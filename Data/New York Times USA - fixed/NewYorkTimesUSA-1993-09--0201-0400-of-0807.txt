HEADLINE: For Children Who Have Children

BYLINE: By Lynn Martin; Lynn Martin, who was Secretary of Labor in the Bush Administration, advises the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche on women's issues.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
The debate over Joycelyn Elders's nomination as Surgeon General stirred an important discussion on the national epidemic of teen-age pregnancies. But the focus on sex education, condom distribution and abortion rights has left out one critical area: the steady rise in teen-age motherhood. Whatever the Government attempts to prevent teen pregnancy, it must stop sending the signal that unwed teen mothers can, with a few dollars from government, both raise their children and seek a decent future for themselves.
It seems no great surprise that the number of unmarried women having children has increased. From a time not too long ago when a pregnancy without marriage was almost unthinkable and kept hush-hush, we have moved unwed motherhood to prime time and celebrate it on the covers of glossy magazines. 
 I hope all of us are glad to leave a past where a child was branded illegitimate or a desperate marriage ruined two or more lives. But it strikes me as equally damaging to ignore the economic and social realities faced today by single teen-age mothers, and to avoid the policy changes that are needed to discourage unwed pregnancies and help girls who have children get their lives in order.
Mature, educated single women who make a choice for motherhood, though increasing in number, are still a small percentage of the total. The huge increase is among young women -- who usually stop their education, have few economic opportunities and often lack support systems for parenthood. That means problems for them and their babies.
We must leave the old conservative-vs.-liberal arguments behind and discuss instead how to change a failed system. A 15-year-old girl is not a 21-year-old woman, yet we have a system that treats her as one.
Think of your own 15-year-old daughter. You find out she's pregnant. Wouldn't you do more than give her a check on the beginning of every month? Wouldn't you be furious this had happened? Wouldn't you want to know how, when, who? Wouldn't you want to know how your child and her child will survive this trauma?
We would not treat our own daughters the way the welfare system does. Could it be that because many of America's 15-year-old mothers are children of color and are poor, too many of us believe they are not important?
Our welfare system should differentiate and separate the pregnant girl who is not yet 16. I'm saying: Remove her from where she is staying -- whether it is with a boyfriend, sister or parent or, too often, on the streets. We need a system that has a residential base where these young girls can stay, be protected and grow up.
Why not have supervised group housing? Why not provide counselors during the pregnancy and, in cases where the mother keeps the baby, for the first eight months of the infant's life?
Why not require school attendance and nightly check-ins? Why not create a haven where a girl can learn she is truly of value -- a place to learn about her new responsibility?
A girl in a group home can more easily get services that help her and her new child. Only half of teen mothers begin prenatal care in their first trimester. Too many continue using drugs and alcohol. Repeat pregnancies occur more often among teens. Abusive parenting is far too common.
Would group housing foreclose easy access for her boyfriend, give greater authority to the state and infringe on the young mother's right to do anything she wishes? You bet. But if we adults know better and do nothing, we are adults in name only.
Obviously this would cost money. But Washington already spends $25 billion a year for families whose first child was born to a teen-age mother. So we have an enormous economic and moral stake in ending the tragedy of childhood motherhood.
Such a program will require fundamental changes in our welfare, medical and legal systems. But why not risk change? All we have now is failure.

HEADLINE: In America;
No Job, No Dream

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
New York City held its Labor Day parade as usual on Monday, but there was little to celebrate. The bad news about employment just keeps on coming.
The Government reported last week that the number of payroll jobs fell by 39,000 in August, the first net drop in more than a year. 
 At the same time the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington research group, issued a report that said real wages continued to sink and the quality of existing jobs continued to deteriorate.
And yesterday Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a firm that counsels out-of-work executives, reported that more than 400,000 layoffs had been announced nationwide since Jan. 1. That represents 20 percent more layoffs in the first eight months of this year than in the first nine months of 1991, "at the height of the recession," the firm said.
The problems cited in the Economic Policy Institute's report were found across the board, in all education groups and all classes. Janitors are struggling, and so are C.E.O.'s.
"There is fear in the workplace, tremendous fear," said Harold Robles, a marcher in the Labor Day parade. "Everyone worries that he or she will be the next to go. Everyone knows someone who has been eased out or thrown out of work."
In the U.S., employment is the cornerstone of everything else. It's the concrete reality that sustains the glorious myth of the American Dream. Take away the job and you take away the dream. Right now an awful lot of dreams are vanishing.
The recession was supposed to have ended in 1991, but according to the Policy Institute study, "There have been broad-based wage reductions during the recovery, including severe wage declines for both blue and white-collar men and for both high school and college-educated workers."
The study confirms previous findings that "an unprecedented number of the new jobs created in the recovery have been either temporary or part-time," and that "well over 60 percent of the new jobs created between January and July 1993 were part-time jobs."
The job crisis has been brutal to the poor and is putting a tremendous squeeze on the middle class. But so far it has provoked no sense of urgency in Washington. Neither the President nor Congress has acted as if this were something we need to do something about fast.
For awhile the President seemed to be saying that continued low interest rates would go a long way toward solving the problem. That was nonsense.
Now there are reports that Clinton Administration aides are taking a look at job-stimulation measures similar to those used by President Bush during his re-election campaign. That doesn't sound like a good idea. It's as if a new baseball manager turned to his predecessor and asked, "O.K., how do I get this team out of the cellar?"
Meanwhile, Vice President Gore's proposal for restructuring the Government would more than double the 100,000 Federal jobs already targeted for elimination. And we are told that the North American Free Trade Agreement would cost jobs, at least in the short run; and that health care reform would cost jobs, at least in the short run.
Lawrence Mishel was a co-author of the Policy Institute study. In an interview he said, "The most depressing part about my research is that if you look at the [real] wages of just about every education group over the last 20 years among men -- college graduates, two years of college, high school graduates, dropouts -- the wages are down."
The fall in wages has been more precipitous among non-college-educated workers. Women have achieved some wage growth but the growth is concentrated among those with college or graduate degrees.
Over all, the wage of the average college graduate has already fallen by 1 percent since early 1992. More dreams are about to vanish.
"The only reason the male wage just hasn't plummeted tremendously on average is that more people are educated," Mr. Mishel said. "So education is almost like inoculating us against a just horrific decline. It's sort of like everybody is on a down escalator and we're busy getting more educated so as not to fall as fast."

HEADLINE: N.A.A.C.P. Takes Two Leaves From the Corporate Playbook

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 31 Business Day article on the pressures the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is putting on corporate America to hire more African-Americans illustrates how the battle for racial equity has changed since the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial three decades ago. 
 Under the leadership of the Rev. Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the N.A.A.C.P. has torn out the first two pages from the tactical manual of business management and is using them to form a new relationship with corporate America.
Page One: in a competitive environment a negative image can hurt profits. Page Two: never ignore a potential opportunity because your competitor might exploit it.
Ever since the struggle for racial equity successfully challenged institutional racism through the courts, it has relied on activist government to remedy what government-sanctioned racism has wrought. But despite impressive legislative, judicial and executive victories, the residual effects of institutional racism -- the exclusionary attitudes toward race and ethnicity nurtured through generations of legal discrimination -- have kept minorities from achieving equity in the market and the workplace.
During that period, tacit adherence by a comfortable corporate America to a status quo in attitude was relatively risk-free. Aside from the threat of an occasional lawsuit, there was little reason for American business to become activist itself.
Times, however, have changed. America is no longer the single, dominant economic power in the world, and its relative decline has helped usher in a new competitiveness at home and abroad. Once-complacent corporate America has been thrust, kicking and screaming, into the global marketplace, where failure to detect and address potentially embarrassing problems, or to exploit new opportunities, can translate quickly into loss of market share.
Negative publicity denoting corporate arrogance or insensitivity toward racial equity within the organization, quickly transmitted through the communications media, can adversely affect sales. Neglecting the contributions that a creative minority population has to offer can mean losing a good idea or product to a less myopic competitor.
Dr. Chavis has recognized that, though we have made some political progress, activist government alone has not achieved the overall goal of racial equity over the past 30 years. He also appreciates the realities of today's competitive economic environment. The direction in which he is leading the N.A.A.C.P., and the successes he has enjoyed thus far, reflect a growing realization among the minority community that striking corporate America where it is most vulnerable -- in the market share -- is the surest way to convert apathy to advocacy.

HEADLINE: Attorney General Abrams to Quit To Join a Law Firm in Manhattan

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
His hopes of winning a Senate seat dashed last year and his prospects for the governorship apparently stymied, Robert Abrams abruptly announced yesterday that he would resign after 15 years as the Attorney General of New York State to become a partner in a Manhattan law firm at the end of the year.
Mr. Abrams, New York's senior statewide official, its chief law-enforcement officer and a popular figure in state and city Democratic politics for more than 25 years, is the second top state official to resign this year. Comptroller Edward V. Regan quit last spring to head an economics study center at Bard College. 
 Before Mr. Abrams's resignation takes affect on Dec. 31, the State Legislature must select a replacement to fill the remainder of his term, which ends next year.
In a telephone interview last night, Mr. Abrams said he had been "all geared up" to run for re-election next year and "there was no question as to the outcome." But, he said, "I guess our lives are always subject to further reflection."
 
Reflecting on Family
 He said that in relaxing during the Labor Day weekend with his family in Dutchess County and looking over college applications with his 17-year-old daughter, Rachel, he had decided it was time for a change.
He called a law-school classmate, Leonard Boxer, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, and agreed to join the firm.
Mr. Abrams has not had a banner 12 months. After winning the Democratic Senate nomination by a single percentage point in a bruising primary against former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro last fall, he lost to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato by two points, despite an overwhelming victory for Bill Clinton in New York. His exploratory efforts to win a senior post in the Clinton Administration did not pan out.
Finally, the likelihood that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo will run for re-election next year seemed to put higher office out of reach.
Mr. Abrams's announcement, made in a news release early last evening, took the state's political world by surprise. Just a few weeks ago, he said in an interview that he fully expected to run for re-election next year, and yesterday a media consultant based in Washington said he had had recent discussions about working on the campaign. On Monday Mr. Abrams smiled and marched with other politicians in the Labor Day parade up Fifth Avenue.
In a prepared statement, the 55-year-old Mr. Abrams said he would place particular emphasis on developing Stroock & Stroock's international law practice, including environmental cleanup projects in the Far East and Eastern Europe.
He said he had authorized his staff to make all decisions on any matter that might involve the law firm while he remains Attorney General, and not to bring the matters to his attention.
In the interview, Mr. Abrams said his older daughter's situation raised questions about his family life with his wife, Diane, and 7-year-old daughter, Becky. "Is the nest going to be empty?" he asked. How much more time is there to spend with our kids?" The Attorney General, whose state salary is $110,000 a year, said his daughters' educational expenses also raised questions "relating to economic security."
Mr. Abrams's departure also opens up new vistas for a host of contenders for his post, which will be filled by the State Legislature. They include the Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes; Assemblyman Oliver Koppell of the Bronx; the Rockland County District Attorney, Kenneth Gribetz, and many others.
The winner would have to stand for election in November 1994.
 
Reputation as an Activist
 Presiding over an office with a budget of $72 million and 1,200 employees, Mr. Abrams built a reputation as an activist and consumer advocate, taking on environmental polluters, charity frauds, discrimination in employment agencies and so on. As chief lawyer for the state, he defended the Governor and commissioners against lawsuits, administered the antitrust laws and regulated the conversion of cooperative apartments.
He is now serving his fourth term, having won re-election three times by overwhelming margins and having set a record as the all-time Democratic vote-getter in New York State.
Mr. Cuomo praised Mr. Abrams in a statement last night as "the nation's leading state attorney general for years, a political leader of total integrity, complete commitment and high principle" and said he would be "missed for a long time."
Calm, cautious, genial, his bald head and glasses lending him a professorial air, Mr. Abrams made few enemies in a career that began in the mid-1960's as a State Assemblyman from the Bronx, where he grew up the son of a candy-store owner near Pelham Parkway. His seatmate in Albany was a freshman from Manhattan named David N. Dinkins, with whom he formed a friendship that was sealed in 1989, when Mr. Abrams offered early and strong support for Mr. Dinkins's mayoral candidacy.
He also handled one especially ticklish assignment with aplomb, when Mr. Cuomo directed him in 1988 to investigate the claims of Tawana Brawley, a black teen-ager, that she had been abducted and raped in upstate Dutchess County by a gang of whites. A lengthy grand jury inquiry supervised by Mr. Abrams's office later concluded that she had fabricated her story.
 
Began Race With High Hopes
 Mr. Abrams began his race for the Senate in 1991 with high hopes, anticipating that repeated investigations into Mr. D'Amato's conduct in office would leave him badly weakened. But then the Clarence Thomas-Anita F. Hill hearings galvanized support for female candidates, and Ms. Ferraro, making a comeback from 1984, when she was Walter F. Mondale's Vice-Presidential running mate, swiftly became the front-runner in the polls.
Mr. Abrams, together with City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, sharply questioned Ms. Ferraro's ethics and personal finances, producing the narrowest of victories and leaving her so bitter over what she regarded as anti-Italian slurs that she declined to endorse him against Mr. D'Amato until the eve of the November election.
By then, Mr. Abrams had already made his own missteps, at one point calling Mr. D'Amato a fascist and refusing for several days to apologize. Ultimately, he was both outspent and outmaneuvered by the Republican incumbent at every turn.
Mr. Abrams's friends said the defeat had shaken him, but that he had rebounded strongly this year, traveling upstate 38 times in the last eight months, renting a campaign office, putting out a newsletter to 25,000 contributors and generally rejuvenating himself to run for re-election for a fifth term.
"I have every expectation of making a run for re-election," he said in a midsummer interview. "I'll be ready for any and all comers. If anybody thinks that this last loss by a hair means that I'm going to be a pushover, they've got another guess coming."
He added: "I mean, I'm resilient."

HEADLINE: Study Says Half of Adults in U.S. Lack Reading and Math Abilities

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Nearly half of the nation's 191 million adult citizens are not proficient enough in English to write a letter about a billing error or to calculate the length of a bus trip from a published schedule, according to a four-year Federal study of literacy in America.
The study, released yesterday by the Education Department, presented a bleak statistical portrait of the nation's literacy. 
 The department tested more than 26,000 Americans, in a representative sampling of those above the age of 15, with questions involving practical matters that people face every day, like gleaning information from a newspaper, reading a bus schedule, making out a bank-deposit slip and understanding instructions for prospective jurors.
Like previous studies, this report said nearly 10 percent of Americans say they have difficulty reading and writing: the usual gauge of illiteracy. But it went deeper by assessing how well people understand English and by including questions that require addition and subtraction.
 
Growing Language Barrier
 Insufficient education and a growing number of adults whose first language is not English were important reasons that the scores were so low, according to the study, conducted by the Educational Testing Service, the New Jersey company that administers the Scholastic Aptitude Test for college admissions and other standardized tests.
The study did not draw any conclusions about intelligence; rather, it assessed reading skills needed for the workplace and for civic activities like voting or jury service. Because the test was given only in English, there was no way to gauge whether native foreign-language speakers would have got higher scores in their first language.
In releasing the study, the Education Department called for a comprehensive remedy, involving businesses, schools and community groups. Just as the Education Department of the Reagan Administration used "A Nation at Risk," a 1983 study of the shortcomings of education in America, as a manifesto for change in the public schools, the Education Department under President Clinton hopes the 150-page study will become a similar impetus. The department, in collaboration with the Labor Department, has begun a study on improving job skills and literacy in the workplace.
"The results are very sobering and they indicate the need for a much greater effort than has been expended until now," said Madeleine M. Kunin, Deputy Secretary of Education, whose office oversees the research and statistical arm of the department. "The overall education level of Americans has increased in terms of schooling and even in fundamental literacy. But the demands of the workplace simultaneously have vastly increased. We simply are not keeping pace with the kinds of skills required in today's economy."
The study found that older people tended to have lower test scores and attributed this trend to the fact that they generally had less education than younger people.
 
New Efforts Expected
 At a minimum, the findings are certain to prompt renewed efforts to bolster adult education and literacy programs across the country, which typically are run by community colleges, churches or service organizations in a fragmented way, reaching only a small fraction of adults who have trouble reading. Until now, corporations have taken the lead in literacy programs through worker retraining programs.
"This is a national problem," Ms. Kunin said. 'We cannot be competitive as a nation or improve the standard of living unless we are able to improve the literacy rate."
Perhaps not surprisingly, the study found that participants with higher incomes did better on the test. Those with the lowest scores earned median weekly salaries of $230 to $245; those with the highest scores had median incomes of $620 to $680.
Businesses estimate they lose $25 billion to $30 billion a year nationwide in lost productivity, errors and accidents attributable to poor literacy. "We have estimated that only about 25 percent of the adult population is highly literate," said Brenda Bell, vice president of marketing for the National Alliance of Business, a group of 3,000 businesses engaged in training and education issues.
A growing number of companies, she said, have put together programs with local community colleges in which professors come to offices and factories to help workers with a variety of skills from basic tasks to more complicated computer skills.
 
Businesses Try to Help
 But corporate efforts to date, as well as those sponsored by local community groups, pale given the size of the problem. "This is clearly disappointing in terms of where we are and where we want to be as a society," said Irwin Kirsch of the Educational Testing Service, who led the project. "It is not a singular problem and points to a complexity of literacy problems and challenges we face as a nation as we move into the next century."
The test takers were measured in three different areas of literacy: reading comprehension, filling out documents and answering questions that require simple arithmetic. The questions on the 50-minute test were weighted for difficulty. Five levels of proficiency were established.
The test results indicate that 40 million to 44 million Americans perform at the lowest level: unable to to calculate the total of a purchase, determine the difference in price between two items, locate a particular intersection on a street map and enter background information on a simple form. It also indicates that an 40 million perform at the second-lowest level: unable to answer a specific question about facts in a newspaper article or write a paragraph summarizing information on a chart about schools. According to the test results, 61 million American function with middle-level skills, 11 million function at the next level and up to 40 million function at the highest literacy level.
In the study, 13,600 people ages 16 years and older were randomly selected and interviewed in the first eight months of last year. An additional 12,000 adults were interviewed from selected states that chose to participate in a separate study comparing their states with the national data and 1,100 inmates from 80 prisons nationwide were interviewed.
As in standardized tests for college admission, white adults posted the best test results with most of them scoring at least in the third of five levels. White adults outscored black and Hispanic adults in all three of the literacy categories. Nearly 60 percent of Hispanic adults who scored in the lowest level were born in other countries. Asians also scored lower than white adults, largely because a majority of Asian adults who scored in the lowest level also were born overseas.
One reason for the lower scores for blacks, the study said, was that they were more likely to attend public schools that were poorer than those attended by whites.
Mr. Kirsch acknowledged that the preponderance of foreign-born adults would depress the overall literacy rate. But he said that regardless of where the adults in survey the were born, they were now residents in the United States and as such represented a fair appraisal of the nation's level of literacy.


GRAPHIC: In comprehension tests given to 26,000 adults, a Federal study showed that almost half of Americans possessed very limited proficiency in English. In each category, about half of those tested could not answer a question more difficult than the one shown.

HEADLINE: Gore's Efficiency Plan Draws Nods in Congress (for Now)

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
While the Clinton Administration's call to streamline Government produced sympathetic echoes in Republican and Democratic cloakrooms, members of Congress predicted today that their most senior colleagues would still try to pick it apart.
In the glare of the attention paid to the announcement of the White House plan, no one in the House or Senate is daring to defend red tape at the Food Safety and Inspection Service. Congressional supporters of mohair and wool subsidies are lying low. And everyone is praising the Administration's objective of quickening Internal Revenue Service refunds. 
 Besides, much of the plan can be carried out by executive orders without Congressional approval, legislative leaders are quick to point out. As many as 70 percent of the proposals offered by Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday do not require Congressional action. They include a plan to review Federal regulations with the goal of slashing them in half, and a recommendation to streamline procurement by buying more supplies from retail stores.
But as the individual proposals take shape, Congressional enthusiasm is likely to cool, especially when it comes to items like consolidating or closing more than a thousand Agriculture Department field offices, dozens of local bureaus of the Housing and Urban Development Department and the Army Corps of Engineers, and offices of other agencies as well.
"With every one of these programs you are going to have to knock out benefits for somebody," noted Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who heads the Government Operations Committee. "That's not going to be easy."
Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers are sure to protect the programs that bring their states jobs or services, which is, after all, part of their job. Western and Midwestern lawmakers, for example, will probably fight an Administration proposal to cut back on subsidies that support rural airport service. And important committee chairmen fiercely protect the programs they enact and oversee.
Democrats are normally more disposed to back the President of their own party, but the Republicans appear most supportive on this issue.
Not only are the Republicans naturally more enthusiastic about reducing the size of Government. But as members of the minority party they also have less patronage than the Democrats and are less reliant on the political good graces of organized labor, which represents many Federal employees and often supports expanding the Government.
With union membership declining in most sectors of the economy other than the Government, Democratic lawmakers with strong labor ties are not expected to support Administration proposals to cut back on thousands of Government jobs or loosen restrictions on using nonunion labor for many public works projects.
Additionally, several of the Administration's proposals fly in the face of the long-held positions of powerful committee chairmen.
For instance, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has promised to move mountains to stop the line-item veto that is an important part of Administration plan. And Representative William H. Natcher, the Kentucky Democrat who heads the House Appropriations Committee, is expected to deploy his considerable powers to stop an Administration proposal to move the Government from one- to two-year budget cycles because it would reduce his panel's year-to-year authority.
 
Turf Wars Are Tough
 "We all know that the toughest thing in Washington are the turf wars," warned Senator William V. Roth Jr., a Delaware Republican who has praised the Administration's intentions. "No committee likes their authority cut back."
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, said that because committee chairmen would try to save the status quo, success or failure "is going to go based on whether the President will knock heads or not."
Lawmakers, who typically praise the outlines of the Administration's proposals, also typically express reservations about changes in their own pet programs or programs they oversee. Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice, is a case in point. Though an avid supporter of the Administration, the Brooklyn Democrat said he would oppose the Administration plan to transfer many law enforcement functions of the Drug Enforcement Administration to the F.B.I.
"Fighting drugs needs focus and long-term follow through," Mr. Schumer said, adding that the F.B.I. had not demonstrated sufficient commitment in the war on drugs in the past.
The failure of similar Government consolidation plans in the past at least partly explains why beneath the rave reviews on the surface, both Republican and Democratic members quickly turn skeptical.
Mr. Glenn said it was very important that Mr. Clinton quickly sign executive orders to put his proposals into effect. "Let's not see six months go by," the Ohio Democrat said. "I don't want this to be the 12th such reorganization plan in line since Teddy Roosevelt that is not implemented."
Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said if Mr. Clinton actually followed through, "it would be like President Nixon going to China."
"The difference," he added, "is President Nixon actually went to China."
Mr. Gramm said that to make the Administration's proposals stick, he would propose an amendment capping Federal employment and guaranteeing a cut of 252,000 Federal jobs by the year 2000.
Representative Scott L. Klug, Republican of Wisconsin, summed up the Congressional mood this way: "There's a scramble by members like lemmings saying they want to cut things. That's good, but that was the climate in 1980 also, and not much happened."

HEADLINE: Clinton Rebuffs Bosnian Leader In Plea for Help

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The President of Bosnia came to the White House today to appeal to President Clinton to set a deadline for the use of force against the Bosnian Serbs if they do not lift their siege of Sarajevo. But Mr. Clinton's answer was essentially that the Bosnian leader should go back to the bargaining table and cut the best deal he can, because Washington is not coming to the rescue, officials said.
Mr. Clinton explained that Washington is willing to use diplomatic and economic sanctions to keep the pressure on the Serbs and Croats to be more conciliatory at the bargaining table, aides said. But Mr. Clinton added that there is simply no support among the Western allies for an armed intervention in Bosnia at this time, and Washington is not inclined to go it alone, officials said.
 
Invokes Congressional Approval
 The Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, reportedly told Mr. Clinton that his big worry is that even if he does return to the peace talks in Geneva and strikes a deal with the Croats and Serbs -- something he was not sure he could sell politically at home -- the Western allies would not come to monitor its provisions and he would be left on his own. 
 Officials said Mr. Clinton said he is still committed "in principle" to contributing American troops to monitor a Bosnian peace settlement, provided that it is a fair, enforceable deal. But Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher also cautioned that such an American commitment would have to be approved by Congress, which would not be easy, officials said.
Before the talks began, Mr. Clinton told reporters that he would seek the approval of Congress before agreeing to let American troops participate in a peacekeeping force for Bosnia -- the first time he has ever made such a vow. Mr. Clinton also stressed that such peacekeeping forces would have to be under NATO command and not United Nations control. Because NATO's top commander is an American general, NATO control would avoid the confusion of command and control that has arisen in Somalia, where American troops are serving under United Nations command, aides said.
"If we can get the Congress to support it, I think we should join in," Mr. Clinton said during an Oval Office picture-taking session with Mr. Izetbegovic (pronounced ih-zett-BEH-go-vitch). "It has to be able to be enforced or guaranteed by a peacekeeping force from NATO, not the United Nations, but NATO."
 
Defining U.S. Policy
 Mr. Clinton's remarks were the most definitive statement of American policy: an inching away from the hopes the Administration may have raised in July when it pressed its NATO allies to agree to use air strikes if the Bosnian Serbs refused to lift the siege of Sarajevo. The allies balked and since then the focus has been on achieving a negotiated settlement to halt the fighting without outside military intervention.
As one senior official said in a briefing for reporters after the Clinton-Izetbegovic talks, "We think now is the best moment for a negotiated solution."
Meanwhile, a tug-of-war appears to have broken out between the Pentagon and the White House over Defense Secretary Les Aspin's planned trip to Sarajevo. The Pentagon announced earlier this week that Mr. Aspin was considering a brief visit to Sarajevo as part of a three-day trip to Europe he is planning for this weekend. Mr. Aspin wanted to get a first-hand assessment of the situation there.
But White House officials said Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, was not informed ahead of time about Mr. Aspin's planned Sarajevo visit and was irate when he read about it in the newspaper. This afternoon, a senior White House official said that there was "no final decision yet" as to whether Mr. Aspin would go to Sarajevo, which could be dangerous, raise the visibility of an issue that is considered a political loser at home and possibly raise unrealistic expectations among the Bosnian Muslims.
A few hours later, a senior Pentagon official said, "it looks like Aspin won't be going to Sarajevo."
 
Keep Balkans on Back Burner
 The White House is not eager to give the fighting in Bosnia a high-profile status at the present time. Both the White House and the State Department treated Mr. Izetbegovic's visit -- which he requested -- in as low a key as possible.
Before going in to see Mr. Clinton, Mr. Izetbevovic met with members of the Congressional Helsinki Commission, which monitors compliance with the 1975 Helskini human rights accords, where he explained what he wants from Washington at this time.
"The United States should put a deadline to the Serbs to remove the artillery around the city," he said. "If they don't do that, then they will have air strikes. We need the support of the U.S."
 
Clinton Rebuffs Plea for Support
 But Mr. Clinton rebuffed such a suggestion, telling reporters: "I believe all that has to be a part of the negotiating process. I don't think that the United States can simply impose an element like that."
While Administration officials would not say so publicly, their attitude toward the Bosnian Muslims is that they should learn a lesson from the Palestinians: strike the best deal they can with their stronger foes at the peace table, because Washington and its allies are not going to commit the military resources to fundamentally change the balance of power.
Although Mr. Clinton said last week that air strikes were still an option he would consider if conditions worsen in Bosnia, the White House is now focused on Mr. Clinton's fall agenda of health care reform, the North American Free Trade Agreement and "reinventing government." Aides say he is not about to get distracted with bombing raids against the Bosnian Serbs.
 
No Consolation for Muslim
 The State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said there was not much "consolation" Washington could offer the Bosnian Muslim leader.
"We can help him understand the nature of the commitments we have made," Mr. McCurry said, "and the nature of the commitments NATO has made and his -- help him understand, you know, our view as it relates to the negotiations in Geneva, which is that they do need to return to the bargaining table and get an agreement."
Asked if he could spell out the commitments the United States had made as far as its willingness to send American troops to enforce a peace agreement in Bosnia, Mr. McCurry said: "I can't. I mean, there's . . . that's a question I think you've seen various senior officials in the Government address from the President on down in recent days, and I don't have anything to add to their commitment."
Mr. McCurry added: "It's not what we're prepared to do, it's what we have done, which is to urge flexibility on the part of the other parties negotiating there. We've actually acted already to, you know, in a sense, assist and improve the positions of the Muslims at the negotiating table itself."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD;
Palestinians Seen in Need Of Billions in Foreign Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
However the Palestinians and Israelis solve their diplomatic differences, the success of any peace plan could depend in large measure on whether the Palestinians get billions of dollars of aid from the United States, Europe, Japan and wealthy Arab nations.
Worried that continued poverty could cause explosive political tensions even with a peace accord, the United States is leading an effort to round up pledges of large-scale assistance even before the Israelis and Palestinians complete a deal that would grant limited self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
 The Administration's efforts make clear that help for the Palestinians could become the next major aid issue for the wealthy industrial nations, just as assistance to Russia was last year.
 
Need Put at $3 Billion
 A World Bank report that will be released later this month estimates that the occupied territories will need $3 billion over the next eight years to meet basic needs like improving water and health care.
But several Palestinian economists who have seen the report say this amount is inadequate: they argue that an additional $6 billion is needed to build housing and develop Palestinian industry.
"If we don't get this help from the outside, it will be very difficult for our economy to survive the transition period," said Samir Abdullah, an economics professor at An Najah National University in the West Bank and a Palestinian representative in international talks on the region's economic development.
 
Washington Needs Help
 American officials said they planned to provide immediate aid to help put the fledgling Palestinian entity on its feet and longer-term aid to improve basic services for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
But these officials said Washington was too hamstrung by budget deficits to provide all the assistance itself.
And aid to the Palestine Liberation Organization, long considered a terrorist organization by Washington, could be an even more ticklish proposition politically than aid to the former Communist nations. Congressional approval of such aid is far from assured.
Oil-producing Arab nations like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait might not rush to aid the Palestinians because they have their own financial problems and are angry at the P.L.O. for backing Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.
State Department officials said Secretary of State Warren Christopher had conferred with Japan, several European nations and the wealthy Arab oil producers about providing aid. One official said there had been "positive responses, including some from the Nordic countries."
Administration officials say they are not ready to estimate how much the United States would contribute, adding that they first want to discuss this sensitive subject with leading members of Congress.
The countries involved in the Middle East peace talks asked the World Bank to prepare a study of the economic needs of the occupied territories, which are plagued by high unemployment, poor roads and a shortage of water, arable land and other natural resources. Per capita income in the territories is just $1,350 a year, one-eighth the level in Israel.
As was the case with aid to the former Soviet Union, the Clinton Administration hopes that much of the Palestinian aid will come from the World Bank and other international financial institutions.
 
Obstacles to Lending
 But World Bank officials say they face several obstacles to lending to the Palestinians. The bank lends only to members, and the occupied territories do not belong to the World Bank. In addition, the bank wants sovereign governments to guarantee its loans, and the peace accord does not envision a sovereign Palestinian entity administering the Gaza Strip and Jericho, the areas to which Israel has agreed to grant self-rule.
Palestinian economists said they thought that if the $3 billion proposed by the World Bank starts flowing, it would go not just to Gaza and Jericho, but also to all of the West Bank with an eye to minimizing tensions.
The 600-page World Bank report states that under self-rule, the West Bank and Gaza would need $1.3 billion in the first three years, and $1.65 billion in the subsequent five years to establish satisfactory basic services. These include water, schools, health care, sewers, roads and electricity.
"We badly need this amount because we have a very poor infrastructure," said Samir Hazboun, chairman of the economics department at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. He estimated that the territories need an additional $3 billion to help build more than 50,000 housing units, and another $3 billion to spur economic development.
"Unless the economic situation in the Gaza Strip is raised significantly, you will have a lot of radicalization and instability there which might endanger the whole peace process," said Ephraim Kleiman, an economics professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
Besides the need for money, other concerns were raised in a separate report prepared by 34 Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian economists along with 7 American economists. They said foreign aid might not be effective unless an efficient government is developed in the West Bank and Gaza, free trade is permitted throughout the region and the current strict regulations on Palestinian businesses are reduced.
"The world wants to be nice and supportive, but a lot has to be done before aid starts pouring in," said Leonard J. Hausman, a Harvard economist who was director of the report, which was sponsored by the Kennedy School of Government's Middle East Institute.
In addition to the worries, economists also pointed to gains the peace agreement would produce for the economies of Israel and the occupied territories. Reduced tensions would no doubt encourage new investment, they said. The Palestinians would also benefit from greater access to the Israeli market, while Israel should gain because the Arab boycott might slowly be ended.

HEADLINE: U.S. Businesses Eager For South Africa Trade

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 8

 BODY:
After the negotiators sealed their deal on Tuesday night on South Africa's transition to democracy, the euphoria spread quickly from the political conference room at the World Trade Center to a neighboring hall where 200 American companies have come to appraise the new African Klondike.
For the participants in what was billed as the continent's largest American trade show ever, peddlers of trucks and shampoos, software and body armor, gaskets and encyclopedias, pinball machines and electric wheelchairs, it was a giddy confluence of political and economic opportunity. 
 The Government's agreement to share power with its rivals in the months leading up to an election means that the African National Congress will soon call for the end of the economic sanctions deployed against apartheid.
 
Mandela Seeks Investment
 Nelson Mandela, who spent an hour on Tuesday hobnobbing with the American prospectors and pleading for investment, predicted today that the call to reopen trading would come in "a matter of weeks."
But while the end of sanctions will bring an immeasurable psychological lift to a country that has been the world's polecat, few here expect the economic payoff to match the euphoria.
"There may well be an anticipation that the lifting of sanctions will see the whole of the Fortune 500 here within weeks, and prosperity flowing six weeks later," warned J. Michael Judin, a trade lawyer and director of the South African American Chamber of Commerce. "Clearly we know in the real world that's not true."
 
Reminders of Violence
 To begin with, less adventuresome business people are deterred by the violent image of a country where every political advance seems to be followed by a slaughter, like the machine-gun massacre of bystanders waiting at a black taxi depot east of Johannesburg today.
David Altman, director of the Made in USA Expo here, said half a dozen exhibitors dropped out after a white American Fulbright scholar was slain by a black mob outside of Cape Town two weeks ago.
Then there is lingering wariness of Mr. Mandela's professed faith in free markets and private property, owing in part to his alliance with the South African Communist Party.
And most American companies, after nearly a decade of sanctions, know little about South Africa. Mr. Judin said some come in expecting easy pickings, only to encounter stiff competition from local producers.
"I think a lot of them arrived here thinking we were still on horseback, and they would just sell things by the container load," Mr. Judin said.
 
A Powerful Lure
 Despite these misgivings, Mr. Altman and others here said South Africa will prove irresistible to many Americans once the sanctions are lifted.
"These people are here today for only one reason," he said. "This is a $20 billion market for them, and their factories in the United States are not running to full capacity."
Most of those interviewed said they see South Africa, with its efficient airports and ports and functional phones, as the well-appointed springboard into the subcontinent.
"For us as a black company, this could be our biggest market outside the United States," said Reginald Maynor, sales manager for Chicago-based Luster Products Inc., which sells black hair care products. He said his company expects to begin producing in South Africa for distribution to countries south of the Sahara.
Dozens of American companies have already entered South Africa with tacit approval from the African National Congress, and scores more never left.
 
Sanctions a Barrier
 But for many major companies sanctions against companies that trade with South Africa -- imbedded in more than 100 state and local statutes and countless corporate stockholder resolutions -- remain a formidable barriers.
Mr. Altman said despite his exhibit's blessing from the African National Congress and the United States Government, most of the corporate giants he approached turned him down rather than risk a consumer or shareholder protest.
Some, like Polaroid, told him even the congress's formal call for the lifting of sanctions will not be enough. They will wait for the restrictions to be repealed, which will take months or years.
"Polaroid sells drivers' licenses to all these different states, and their drivers' license business is bigger than their potential business in South Africa," he said. "So they weren't prepared to make any move to jeopardize it."
 
Little Hope for Jobless
 So far the companies venturing into South Africa are out to sell, not manufacture, so they will have little effect on an unemployment rate estimated at nearly 50 percent.
"We've got to educate, clothe and house," Mr. Judin said. "As welcome as the distributors are, and the franchisers, we do need the manufacturers."
Still, Mr. Judin said, South Africa's readmission to the international business world will increase the confidence of local business, increasing their willingness to invest, and possibly bolstering the country's weak currency.
And the euphoria, he added, however ephemeral, is enjoyable.
"It's only now that we're being accepted back as part of the world that one really appreciates what it was like to be the pariah," he said.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
The Road Show, Part II: Reinventing Bill and Al

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Va., Sept. 8

 BODY:
The fellow on the left in the navy suit was the Vice President, the keeper of all the cryptic details.
The one on the right was the President; his role was to empathize, to talk about trust and to radiate sincerity while discussing belief in Government. 
 Welcome to the Bill and Al Show, Part II, this time on the road to "reinvent" Government.
Bill Clinton and Al Gore, who discovered their political strength as a sales team during last year's Presidential campaign, plan to take their road show around the country this week to California, Ohio and Texas, sharing stories of overpriced file folders and the dedicated Federal employees who would like to spend less.
They began the cross-country trip today at a cavernous Government warehouse that distributes toilet paper, paper clips and yellow legal pads to the Supreme Court, Congress and most agencies of the executive branch. Striding into camera range side by side, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore seemed almost jaunty about their task.
 
Pitching Trust to Skeptics
 Mr. Gore, who has spent six months thinking about overpriced ashtrays and voluminous civil service regulations, has been stumping the television news and talk-show circuits, happily lecturing on the stimulating topic of Government procurement. In one 24-hour block, he appeared on C-Span, "Today," the "Late Show" with David Letterman, "Donahue," the "MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour" and "Larry King Live."
Mr. Clinton's job is more sober and goes to the core of this effort: countering the lack of trust many Americans have in their Government.
"The central tenet of every democracy in the end is trust," Mr. Clinton told the Federal workers, many of whom had been bused in for the warehouse event. "The profound sense of alienation so many people feel in our country has got to be healed, because we've got to do a lot of things to get America into the 21st century, to restore a sense of opportunity, to be able to create jobs and to be able to support incomes again that justify the hard work people do."
Mr. Clinton said reorienting Government was about establishing a partnership between leaders and the people who elect them. "And a partnership, whether it's marriage, a business, a government-private partnership, requires trust," he said.
 
'Wrenching Encounter'
 But no matter how high-minded the President's words, the discussion always comes back to the somewhat clunky subject of what things cost and how those costs affect government reinvention.
Today the President spoke of "a particularly wrenching encounter" he had with a military worker in Alameda, Calif., when he toured an air station slated to be closed.
Was the discussion about impending unemployment? Lapsing health care benefits? Hardly. The two men talked about the waste in paying $4,500 for a $2,500 computer.
Mr. Gore mostly left the high-minded appeals to the President and focused on presenting his latest detailed examples of Government waste.
There was the "designer bug spray" ordered to Federal specifications, the computer diskettes that cost $1.38 more than the discount store price and the bottles of aspirin that cost more because of paperwork.
 
2 Shows, 1 Script
 "There are 142,000 people who work full-time just complying with all of these requirements and regulations and red tape," he said. "No wonder we need aspirin."
The Vice President did it again an hour later when Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate arrived at the White House for their weekly meeting with the President. There, lined up on the table in the Cabinet room were the bug spray, the diskettes and the aspirin. With little prodding and to the bemusement of his former Congressional colleagues, Mr. Gore launched into virtually the same speech.
When reporters asked about free trade and health care, not procurement and personnel regulations, Mr. Gore was not crazy about the change of subject and seized the President's prerogative.
"Thank you," he said repeatedly, effectively ending the exchange.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Delay Effort for Trade Pact

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton's plans to make a personal sales pitch on behalf of the troubled North American Free Trade Agreement have been delayed until late this fall as Mr. Clinton prepares for the fight over health care that his advisers have judged to be more critical to his longterm political health.
The trade agreement has accumulated an unenviable list of enemies in the labor and environmental movements and among Democratic leaders in Congress and the supporters of Ross Perot and Ralph Nader. 
 So instead of raising the fight on behalf of Nafta to the same fever pitch of publicity that he has reserved for issues like his economic package, his plan to streamline government and health care, Mr. Clinton is taking a quieter approach.
 
Timing and Votes
 And Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, said in an interview that political reality may force the Administration to stretch beyond a Jan. 1 target date for putting the agreement into effect.
"Timing is one thing," he said in an interview. "Having the votes is another. They may or may not have any effect on each other."
Mr. Kantor said he was not concerned that the trade pact would suffer because of the other initiatives on Mr. Clinton's plate. All will complement each other, he said.
But this approach could make it harder for the White House to sway skeptical Democrats on Capitol Hill. Without the support of these reluctant lawmakers, like Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the prospects for passage of the agreement would fade.
White House aides said that the President remained committed to Nafta but that he was more likely to stake his personal political capital to the issue later this year, after the health-care reforms had been introduced.
 
'Good News and Bad News'
 But the President's allies in Congress who support the trade pact have been sending up unmistakable signals asking the White House for help.
"I'm here to tell you that there's good news and bad news," Representative Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican who supports the agreement, said today. "The good news is that we've advanced the ball to the 5-yard line. The bad news is that it's our 5-yard line, not their 5-yard line."
Mr. Clinton is scheduled to spend Thursday, Friday and Saturday traveling to Ohio, California and Texas on behalf of Vice President Gore's proposals to streamline government. And Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, have invited Mr. Clinton to address a joint session of Congress on Sept. 22 regarding health care.
But for the free trade agreement, the President has scheduled only a single event, a Rose Garden ceremony at which he will sign related pacts on labor and the environment. Aides have said the event will feature Lee Iacocca, the Chrysler consultant and former chairman, as the latest Administration spokesman for the agreement, but it is clear that Mr. Clinton himself will have other things on his mind for the immediate future.
"Nafta is a process that will come to a head in November or December," said Stan Greenberg, the President's pollster. "I assure you you'll see the President join that issue when it's appropriate."
Other political advisers warned against reading too much into the President's decision to travel the country on behalf of issues other than the pact.
"I don't know if Nafta is a traveling kind of a thing, you know?" said James Carville, a political consultant.
 
Under Fire From Democrats
 Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said today that the peripatetic President's decision to soft-pedal the politicking for Nafta next week should not be construed as any weakening in his support for the trade agreement, which has drawn fire from Democrats in Congress and labor groups.
"We don't have exactly the same strategy for every issue," she said.
But several of the President's advisers have offered little more than a lukewarm and pro forma statement of continued support for the agreement, which threatens to alienate Mr. Clinton from some of his most vital supporters just when he needs all the backing he can get to win passage of a critical and wide-ranging plan for health-care reform.
And privately, these same advisers tacitly concede that they would be happy to see the trade pact languish on a back burner if it meant that health care could proceed unimpeded.
"You can love all your children the same, but some just require more attention than others," said Mr. Carville, who predicted that both measures would pass.
 
Devoting Time to Mideast
 In addition to working on health care, Mr. Clinton is expected to spend some of his time next week staking out a place for himself in the emerging Middle East peace process. Carrying the fight for the trade accord will be left to members of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet, who are scheduled to testify at Congressional hearings next week.
One of those officials, Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, said that all uphill battles are not necessarily bad.
"When you're on the 5-yard line, you have a lot of room to maneuver, and that's exactly what we expect to do," Mr. Kantor said at a Capitol Hill news conference with supporters of the trade agreement today.
And Bill Frenzel, the former Republican Congressman who is now helping lead the Nafta lobbying effort for the Administration, also acknowledged the extensive speculation that has begun about the depth of the President's commitment to the trade issue.
"I realize there has been some discussion up till now, partly because the President had his hands full of budget for a good portion of the first part of his term, but that's behind, and Nafta is out front and center, and it's going to be a strong campaign," he said. "The President is going to push it."
But it is clear the push will not be an explicit one coming from the White House. Mr. Iacocca's arrival is expected to counteract some of the opposition mounted by the plain-spoken Mr. Perot, who has taken his new anti-Nafta book to the talk-show circuit.
And, in the end, Mr. Clinton and his advisers are convinced that health care will do more for the Administration than involving the President in a divisive and potentially bruising fight over the trade pact.
"There has to be a special connection between the President and the public if he is going to venture down this course," said Stan Greenberg, the poll taker. "It's different than Nafta, which is a trade agreement that almost half the public has never heard of."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Finding a saner way to regulate health and safety risks.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
STEPHEN BREYER'S 15 minutes of fame may appear to have ended with the choice of Ruth Bader Ginsberg for the Supreme Court. But in Washington, Mr. Breyer, the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, will long be remembered as the legal adviser to the Senate Judiciary Committee who converted suspicious liberals to the cause of airline deregulation. And now Judge Breyer is back in the bully pulpit, this time attempting to bring sweet reason to the overwrought world of health and safety regulation.
His new book, "Breaking the Vicious Circle" (Harvard University Press), may not convince those who have dedicated their careers to stamping out risks ranging from aflatoxins to X-rays. But this lucid, nontechnical essay on risk regulation will intrigue pragmatists in search of a bigger bang for a regulator's buck. 
 "The notion of tying shifts in resources to a specific commitment to saving more lives is brilliant," said Alfred Kahn, a former Carter Administration official and specialist in industrial organization and airline deregulation.
Health and safety regulation costs Americans about $120 billion a year, and there is good reason to believe that the figure is rising rapidly. Is there anything wrong with that?
Maybe not. A rich country can afford the luxury of investing heavily in reducing risk. But there is a near consensus among scientists that the spending priorities, public and private, are grotesquely distorted.
Judge Breyer notes, for example, that panic over asbestos has led to a cleanup effort costing an estimated $250 million per life saved -- and may actually kill dozens of asbestos-removal workers.
Or consider abandoned toxic waste sites. Most, it is widely agreed, pose little threat as long as people do not build day-care centers or graze cows on them. Yet the bill for restoring the sites to pristine condition may exceed $100 billion. Meanwhile, a host of cost-effective health measures, everything from requiring home smoke alarms to subsidizing early cancer detection, are anemically financed.
Like others, Judge Breyer links this failure to a reinforcing circle of irrationality. The public is ill informed, easy prey to the disaster of the month. Congress usually reacts to public opinion with legislation that leaves little room for adjusting priorities within limited budgets or balancing costs against benefits. Regulators, for their part, are locked into a perpetual better-safe-than-sorry mode, further distorting perspectives.
The standard prescription (bromide) for saner risk regulation is a more knowledgeable public. But Judge Breyer is pessimistic about the prospects for making common sense of technology. "To speak of the need for improved communication," he concludes, "is to call spirits from the vasty deep. One can call them, but will they come?"
His alternative: regulators with greater flexibility and credibility. Judge Breyer reckons that most people would prefer lower levels of risk at current levels of expenditure. He thus suggests the creation of a super-regulator, an agency staffed with career civil servants with a mandate to transfer funds from one program to another, if and only if the transfer would save lives and prevent illness.
The idea, he suggests, would be to start small -- say, with an interagency committee able to throttle back stringent toxic waste standards and apply every dollar saved to reducing identified health risks to children. Once the regulators had earned the public's trust, their mission could be expanded.
Judge Breyer's proposal is a lightning rod for criticism. One charge -- that the delegation of authority would be undemocratic -- hardly seems relevant in a nation that already assigns bureaucrats the job of deciding how many rodent hairs are permitted in a box of brownie mix. But other criticisms have more substance.
Lester Lave of Carnegie-Mellon University believes Judge Breyer concedes too much by implicitly accepting the idea that the current reach and total expenditures on health and safety regulation are reasonable. Most of the risk of premature death, he points out, now comes from individual habits like poor diet and smoking, not environmental hazards controllable by government.
Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute worries that the mandate to save lives fudges critical questions. Should regulators have the power to shift funds from, say, air pollution standards that reduce asthma deaths to preschool education that makes children less likely to murder each other as teen-agers? Should blood-pressure-screening dollars that save 10 poor black males be reshuffled to save 30 middle-class women from breast cancer? "Where and how," he asks, "do you draw the lines?"
Almost everyone agrees, though, that Judge Breyer is on to something. Risks linked to technology, particularly those involving life and death, are too complicated to be analyzed by professional politicians or electronic town meetings. And if we do not become cleverer about the process of delegating decisions, the economy (and thus the society) will choke on public distrust.

HEADLINE: Expansion Plan for Tennis Center in Queens Wins Approval From Council Committee

BYLINE: By LARRY OLMSTEAD

 BODY:
Expansion of the National Tennis Center, the site of the United States Open tennis tournament, was approved yesterday by a City Council committee, all but insuring an official go-ahead for the $172 million project.
The Council's Land Use Committee voted 10-3 in favor of the proposal, which will be considered by the full City Council on Sept. 23. If approved, the United States Tennis Association could begin construction in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park as early as next spring, tennis officials said. 
 The vote came after neighborhood opponents won concessions on parking and the possibility of further funding for youth programs.
"This is the best deal of its kind between a city and a sporting event anywhere in the country, generating approximately $130 million into our economy every year," Mayor David N. Dinkins said in a statement. "I appreciate the strong support of the Land Use Committee."
Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone of Queens, who had kept a low profile during the debate, yesterday called it "a very, very good deal for the city."
 
A Triumph for Mayor
 The committee vote was a victory for the Mayor, who ran into opposition over a proposal that administration officials had expected would win wide support because of its apparent benefits for the city.
Administration officials were enthusiastic over the proposal because it would guarantee that the U.S.T.A. would keep the prestigious tournament in the city for at least 25 years. If the U.S.T.A. exercised a series of lease options, the agreement could run as long as 99 years.
The tennis association also agreed to finance the expansion, and to continue into maintain and operate the center, even though the facility is owned by the city.
 
Neighborhood Objections
 But some neighborhood residents objected to leasing 42 acres of parkland to the U.S.T.A., more than doubling the size of the tennis center. Others criticized the plan as catering to the elite, and took issue with the U.S.T.A.'s insistence that air traffic from La Guardia Airport continue to be diverted away from the center during the Open, even though many Queens residents are forced to put up with noise from planes each day.
The proposal also ran into complaints about terms of the lease, which some community activists and Council members called a sweetheart deal favoring the tennis association.
In giving its approval yesterday, the committee adopted several modifications intended to resolve some of the objections.
 
Compromise on Penalties
 One change would provide 200 free parking spaces for the public when the center is in general use. Another offered a compromise on a provision penalizing the city up to $325,000 annually if there are excessive flyovers from La Guardia Airport during the Open.
Under the compromise, the city could still lose up to $325,000 a year if the flyover provision is violated. But for the first five years of the lease, 25 percent of that penalty would be diverted to youth recreation programs, and 10 percent thereafter.
The flyover penalty would be triggered only after several violations of a provision that bans more than six flights during any hour of Open play, or 18 in a day. The rule exempts flyovers necessary for safety.
The Federal Aviation Administration has diverted planes during the Open since 1990, and has agreed to do so indefinitely. But the U.S.T.A. successfully bargained for language in the lease that requires the city to continue to lobby the F.A.A. to maintain the diversions, saying top players would skip the Open if they had to contend with aircraft noise.
Mr. Vallone said the modifications, which still must be reviewed by the City Planning Commission, should sweeten the deal for community residents and "has resulted in a better agreement with the U.S.T.A."
Opposing the proposal in the committee vote were two Queens Council members, Michael J. Abel and Walter L. McCaffrey of Woodside, and Thomas K. Duane of Manhattan.
Mr. McCaffrey, who offered a series of amendments to the proposal that were voted down by the Land Use Committee, said: "There is much that is wanting. The City of New York could have done much better in negotiating the provisions of this lease."
His amendments would have eliminated the flyover penalties, raised the base rent from $400,000 to $500,000 and changed the lease to guarantee the U.S.T.A., not the city, would pay for any cost overruns on construction of the new center. The tennis association gave its assurances it would be responsible for overruns in any case.
 
'Part of the Community'
 David Markin, past president of the U.S.T.A., who negotiated the deal, said the controversy had been good for the association in making it examine what some call its elitist image. It also will look at the issues of ticket price and availability, Mr. Markin said. Outreach programs would be increased. "We want to be part of the community," he said.
The expansion plan calls for construction of a new 23,500-seat stadium at the tennis center and renovation and scaling down the size of the current stadium and grandstand.
The tennis courts would increase from 39 to 47. Eleven courts would be available to city tennis permit holders to use free on a reservation basis; the rest, as now, would be rented to the public at below-market rates.
The U.S.T.A. would have exclusive use of the center for up to 60 days each year, including the two-week period during the Open.
Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the city expected to gain $1 million each year from the U.S.T.A. in rent and the city's share of tennis revenues, and $3 million in taxes.
The tennis association also is contributing $8 million to a fund that will finance improvements in Flushing Meadow-Corona Park. The Open now generates about $112 million a year in economic activity for the city, That, Mr. Weisbrod said, will jump to $130 million with the construction.

HEADLINE: A Steel Town's Rescue Mission

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: MANSFIELD, Ohio

 BODY:
In this smokestack city halfway between Cleveland and Columbus, a group of business people and merchants give a weekly bagpipe concert in a downtown parking lot at dusk. Fritz's, the local hangout, lets diners pay for their meals on the honor system.
And out-of-towners who park illegally find "parking tickets" on their windshields with a cartoon of a smiling meter and the message, "This one's on us!" 
 But the biggest thing that is "on us" for civic-minded Mansfield right now is the local steel mill, a unit of Armco Inc. The fight to save the mill -- and 1,100 high-paying jobs in this town of 50,000 people -- united Mansfield in a long-shot battle, which it won when the Armco board agreed late last month to keep the arthritic mill alive.
The mill's new lease on life is all the more remarkable in view of American industry's fervor to grow lean and competitive by laying off workers by the thousands and jettisoning obsolete plants.
Mansfield, too, has suffered its share of corporate cutbacks. In recent years, the city has lost a Westinghouse appliance factory, the world headquarters of Tappan and a Peabody Barnes pump facility, to name a few.
Each departure swept smaller businesses along with it. A few months ago the H. L. Reed & Company department store closed after 129 years, and the Mansfield airport no longer receives passenger flights. Money magazine's September issue places Mansfield fourth from the bottom in its annual survey of 300 places to live.
Mayor Lydia J. Reid, a 55-year-old grandmother who was the finance director until four months ago, is fighting to halt the slide. Local politicians, community leaders and Armco executives said they had no choice but to fight for the old mill, a plant that progress and competition long ago transformed into a relic, because they cannot afford to build a more advanced plant from scratch.
Ms. Reid twisted arms until the city and county each agreed to lend $500,000 to save the mill, then offered to reduce water and sewer rates and waive some taxes for 10 years.
The state made nearly $15 million in low-interest loans available -- roughly $10,000 per job. Local electric, telephone and gas providers promised the company a break on rates, and the electric company, Ohio Edison, cobbled together another $8 million in loans.
The United Steelworkers of America union agreed to concessions in June under a new labor contract that gives management more flexibility to assign work and gradually reduce employment by 25 percent. That and the collective contributions had the desired effect. Armco decided to invest $100 million on a continuous caster that may make the mill viable.
 
Old-Fashioned Methods
 Empire-Detroit, as the Mansfield mill is known, is one of the few steel plants in the country that still makes steel in old-fashioned, heat-resistant brick-lined molds. It melts down scrap metal in huge furnaces, ladles the concoction into ingot-shaped molds, cools the ingots, reheats them to clean them and works the ingots into flat sheets that are rolled into the thin coils customers prefer.
Newer mills, in contrast, use continuous casting to eliminate many costly steps. Often called mini-mills, they manipulate the molten steel so it travels directly from the furnace to the rolling mills.
No one can be sure that the city's frantic efforts will protect Empire-Detroit from its more nimble rivals forever. Armco is "throwing good money after bad," said Michael Cygler, a senior sales engineer with SMS Concast, an equipment supplier.
 
A Big Taxpayer
 But Mayor Reid is not about to let the naysayers derail her mission. Empire-Detroit contributes $900,000 a year in income taxes -- $1 of every $16 the city collects -- and nearly $10 million in state and county taxes.
Further, it spends $40 million on electricity and gas each year, $96 million on other operating expenses and $9 million on health care. Since many of the plant's employees live in Mansfield, much of the company's $57 million payroll is recycled back into the local economy.
Aware of the stakes, the residents have rallied around the rescue mission. "They've got to do something to keep this town above water," said Budd Meyer, a 30-year-old vending machine repairman whose wife, Shelley, earns more than him by working at the plant.
A few seats away at Fritz's, Danny Eichler, the owner of a small upholstery business, chimes in with his support. "The bigger businesses employ more people, so you've got to give them more slack," he said.
Cindy M. DeVore, a single mother who used to assemble washers and dryers at the Westinghouse factory, is another fan of the plan to save the mill. She makes good money as a waitress, but she never knows what it will be from week to week. She said she feared that if Empire-Detroit shut down, the uncertainty would get worse. "People lose their jobs; they don't spend money," she said.
 
A Community Makeover
 Named after Jared Mansfield, a surveyor who etched its boundaries into the hills of north-central Ohio, Mansfield has faced the knife before.
When the job drain began in 1990, the town flaunted everything it had. To build traffic in the central business district, it tore down some taverns and spent nearly $3 million on a hand-carved carousel that attracts 300 riders a day.
It also successfully bid on a new state penitentiary and convinced three Hollywood filmmakers to use the old prison in movies.
That connection to fame gave Mayor Reid unlikely ammunition in her fight to save Empire-Detroit as she horse-traded, wheedled and bartered for any possible edge.
Take the state controlling board, which must approve the state's $15 million loan to Empire-Detroit. Over spaghetti dinners at Mama's Little Touch of Italy on Park Avenue, the town's main street, Edward T. Meehan, the president of the Richland County economic development arm, told Ms. Reid that one of the members would like a favor: Could she arrange for his kids to visit the set of a prison movie?
"How'd they like to ride horses with Morgan Freeman?" she asked, recalling that one of the movies being shot in Mansfield stars the actor. "Maybe they'll give us more."
 
A Succession of Owners
 The mill, which started about the turn of the century and has had a succession of owners, has seen potential suitors give its antiquated machinery the once-over and leave shaking their heads.
Its president, Charles G. Kennedy, said he was advised to reject the sales manager's job in 1981. His friends warned him that the plant lacked a continuous caster, which was fast becoming a vital part of any modern steel plant, and would not survive. He accepted the job, which paid $75,000 a year, but kept his house in Pittsburgh to be safe.
He managed to keep the mill afloat and even profitable in the 1980's. He moved to Mansfield and in 1988 became the president of the plant. But as his competitors upgraded their plants and nonunion mini-mills gained ground, the mill's operating costs -- the highest in the industry -- threatened its survival.
"We weren't getting worse," he said. "Everyone else was getting better. The world was passing us by."
 
A Community Effort
 Rather than watch the plant close, he became determined to organize the community to save it. He has coaxed $27 million in equipment financing from vendors who are vying to build the new caster. He has helped the utilities realize the folly of letting one of their largest customers sink.
And he got Gov. George V. Voinovich of Ohio to see that if Empire-Detroit succeeded in grafting a new $100 million caster onto old rolling equipment, other ailing steelmakers could be saved for far less than the $600 million or more it can take to build a new mill.
His biggest sales job was reserved for the union. Some members who were making $50,000 a year with overtime had trouble believing that the plant was desperate.
Others, like Ted Hardy, 58, whose job reducing the size of the ingots would be eliminated by the new caster, doubted that Armco would close the shop and leave its small customers in the lurch.
Younger employees like Steven Norris, 26, have needed less convincing. He said he was grateful to land a job in the plant. At a computer keyboard in a comfortable office, he was recording the temperatures of 15-ton steel ingots immersed in the soaking pits where they are reheated.
That job, too, will vanish the day the caster is installed, and yet he favors the plan. "It's hard to compete without it," he said.
Much of the union's membership eventually came around. "All those mini-mills are nonunion," Mr. Kennedy said. "We have a chance to show that unionized steelworkers can do this as well as nonunion. That's a big ticket for the union."
The Armco board recently approved the caster, which could take 18 months to install. It expects the investment will put the mill, which could lose $25 million in 1993, at least $50 million in the black in 1995.
Leaving in place the Bible that has been in the company's reception area since the day he arrived, Mr. Kennedy calls his attempted bail-out, Project Genesis, because he hopes it will provide everyone who depends on the plant with "a new beginning."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Unilever to Gain Breyers In Kraft Ice Cream Deal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
Unilever P.L.C., already the world's largest marketer of ice cream products, has fattened its presence in American markets with an agreement to acquire the ice cream division of Kraft General Foods, the largest maker of ice cream products in the United States.
In the deal, which was announced yesterday, Unilever would acquire the nation's best-selling brand, Breyers, giving the British and Dutch consumer products company a major presence in American grocery store freezers with cartons of ice cream and making it a leading force in the highly competitive $2.2 billion ice cream industry. 
 Unilever would also gain Sealtest and the license to two additional Kraft ice cream brand names, Light n' Lively and Knudsen. Kraft, however, has retained the Breyers and Sealtest names for existing non-ice cream products, like frozen yogurt, as well as its super-premium line of Frusen Gladje ice creams.
 
 
American Acquisitions
 The acquisition would also continue a strategy by Unilever to expand its involvement in American ice cream through acquisitions. In 1989, Unilever bought Gold Bond Ice Cream Inc. of Green Bay, Wis., makers of an assortment of novelty ice cream products. In January, Unilever bought the Isaly Klondike Company, makers of Klondike bars, and Popsicle Industries from Empire of Carolina Inc. Unilever has made Good Humor ice cream products in the United States since 1961.
While neither Kraft nor Unilever would disclose the terms of the acquisition, the companies said in a joint statement that Kraft's ice cream division had annual sales "approaching $500 million." In the 52-week period ending July 18, according to Information Resources Inc. of Chicago, sales of Kraft ice creams reached $356.9 million, a 15.6 percent share of the market, eclipsed only by the combined sales of all private label brands, $737.1 million, for a 32.3 percent share.
 Yet even such a level of sales for Kraft might have contributed to a decision by the Philip Morris Companies, Kraft's parent company, to sell the division. The company's market share has declined in recent years. The most recent figures reflect a 2.1 percent drop in sales for Kraft, while the next three companies -- Haagen-Dazs, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Company and Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. -- have improved at least 13.6 percent each in the same period.
For marketing purposes, ice creams are separated into categories determined primarily by butterfat content: usually, the higher percentage of butterfat, the higher the cost (not to mention calories and cholesterol). Super-premium brands like Haagen-Dazs and Frusen Gladje contain as much as 16 percent butterfat, while premium brands, like Breyers, have 14 to 15 percent. Regular brands like Sealtest have about 12 percent. An economy category, which includes mainly private-label and store brands, has a butterfat content of about 10 percent.
 
 
Market 'More Competitive'
 "At least since last year, Kraft has seemed to be struggling with their brands as the market has gotten much more competitive," said Howard Waxman, the editor of the Ice Cream Reporter, an industry newsletter.
Data compiled by Nielsen Marketing Research for the 52-week period ending June 12 show Breyers as the leading single brand in sales, with $265 million after combined private label sales ($610 million), with Haagen-Dazs in third place ($136 million) and Ben & Jerry's sixth ($105 million). Frusen Gladje was below the top 10, with sales of $2.4 million and a market share of a tenth of 1 percent -- about half its performance for the previous 52-week period.
"Kraft has clearly fumbled the super-premium category," Mr. Waxman said.

HEADLINE: Baptists Raising Their Voices in Song at the Garden

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
In a hallway off the main floor of Madison Square Garden, Angelique Banks Coleman was having a difficult time explaining why music was such an integral part of the nation's black churches and of the 8.5 million-member National Baptist Convention, which is holding its annual meeting this week in New York City.
Mrs. Coleman was certainly not at a loss for words, including biblical phrases about "singing to the Lord" and "making a joyful sound" from the Psalms. 
 But she was repeatedly interrupted by people congratulating her for the concert she had directed on Tuesday evening. A 350-member choir, specially assembled for the Baptist meeting, had filled the Garden with solemn church anthems, a piece from Mendelssohn's "Elijah," traditional spirituals and, increasingly as the evening went on, with foot-stomping, hand-waving Gospel music.
No session of the Baptist gathering, which has brought about 50,000 people to the city, goes without song.
 
28 Musical Offerings
 Yesterday, the convention officially opened with welcoming speeches from Mayor David N. Dinkins, Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and the Rev. Al Sharpton, and talks by Baptist leaders and the Rev. Conrad Raiser, who heads the World Council of Churches in Geneva.
But the day's program was laced with at least 28 musical offerings at Madison Square Garden and at simultaneous meetings of church associations being held at several hotels.
Today's program will feature a similar number, before, after and between such events as a ceremony honoring Mayor Dinkins and Benjamin Hooks, the recently retired president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and a speech by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, the first black woman elected to the Senate.
 
'An Earthy Kind of Music'
 There was even a choir to perform last Thursday when the church body's president, the Rev. Theodore Judson Jemison, was presented with a check from local donors to help defray the convention's expenses.
The span of Tuesday evening's concert, stretching from Mendelssohn to the spiritual, "Ezekiel Saw de Wheel," was carefully planned to exhibit a wide range of music and talent to the thousands of church leaders in the Garden.
"We've had an earthy kind of music" in the black church, Mrs. Coleman said, "and we're trying now to educate people so they can incorporate a wide range of music in their services."
"We have lawyers and corporate presidents in our congregations, and we have to cater to their broad tastes," she said, even while keeping alive the heritage of spirituals and Gospel music.
Mrs. Coleman is minister of music at Burke Baptist Church in the Bronx where her husband, the Rev. Norman Coleman, is pastor. Besides directing the choir and singing solos, she was the arranger for a medley that intricately interwove the hymns "Amazing Grace," "Blessed Assurance" and "It Is Well With My Soul" to make a point, she said, of Christians' assurance of resurrection.
 
Months of Rehearsal
 Volunteers for the special choir, who came from New York's five boroughs and as far away as Newburgh in Orange County and Long Island, began rehearsing in March.
They met once a week, then twice and more recently three times weekly. "Ninety-eight percent of them don't read music," Mrs. Coleman said. Mrs. Coleman herself has a degree in music. Derrick James, the minister of music at Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, N.Y., who helped direct the choir and also sang one of his own compositions on Tuesday, has two.
But both musicians said they first started singing in the church as children and knew early that religious music would be their life's work.
The concert on Tuesday featured the same active response from the audience that many black congregations traditionally give to their preachers.
Listeners -- and even choir members -- did not wait until the end of songs to applaud. They clapped and shouted in admiration for a particular note or phrase when soloists pushed their voices to the limit or demonstrated some vocal derring-do.
 
Call and Response
 The exuberant directing of Gregory Hopkins, the music director of Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Manhattan who shared the podium with Mrs. Coleman and with Mr. James, not only sent the music flying from the music stand at one point but also sent the music stand itself flying.
"Our music is enveloped in emotion," Mr. James said, "from all the trials and tribulations of slavery, Jim Crow and economic depression."
The black church's hymns, Mrs. Coleman and Mr. James said, were tightly linked to the church's preaching. Music and preaching shared the same rhythmic style, the call and response of the leader and the congregation and finally, they said, the same theology, not of a nebulous belief, but of a personal tie to Jesus.
"We cease to be Baptists if Jesus is not central and focal," Mrs. Coleman said.
"He's the center of the joy," Mr. James added.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 18.17 Points in 2d Day of Selling

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
Growing concerns over the future of corporate profits caused the stock market to plummet yesterday for the second straight day, before it recovered somewhat, easing a wave of anxiety about the end of the bull market of 1993.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down nearly 35 points from its high for the day before being rescued by a 3 P.M. wave of buying. It finally closed at 3,588.93, off 18.17 points for the day, after a drop of 26.83 points on Tuesday. 
 "The market's beginning to understand that lower inflation means lower growth rate and nominal G.D.P., and that in turn will mean a lower growth rate for corporate profits," David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers, said.
Because low interest rates are no longer being viewed "as a complete blessing for the stock market," Mr. Shulman said, stocks and bonds have ended a long period in which they moved in direct inverse relation to each other. He predicted that the market's movements would continue to reflect worries about earnings.
 
'The Market Is Overreacting'
 The market's performance seems to reflect a belief among some investors that the economic recovery is beginning to wane, said Robert Walberg, senior equity strategist with MMS Equity Market Analysis.
"It's our impression now that the market is overreacting, and using recent economic reports as an excuse to take profits after having been through a fairly strong rally," he said. "As we look at the third and fourth quarters, the numbers look pretty good. but there's been a lot of anxiety over the last several months or so of weak numbers."
The Nasdaq suffered what Mr. Shulman described as "real carnage," yesterday with the composite index falling 8.62 points, to 730.73, while the American Stock Exchange composite index dropped 5.20 points, to 451.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.87 points to 456.65. Trading volume was 283.1 million shares, up from 229.5 million on Tuesday.
Mr. Shulman said skittishness about the economy was worsened by two big waves of futures selling that drove down the cash market, one around 11:30 A.M. and another around 12:30 P.M., before the buying wave began late in the day.
Mr. Walberg said the market had been due for "at least a modest correction," and added: "We've gone approximately 200 days without even as much as a 4 percent correction in the market, which is abnormally long. As far as length of rallies is concerned, this ranks up with one of the longest."
 
Selloff in Health Care
 Health care stocks led the fall. Baxter International, the world's largest supplier of medical products, said after trading ended Tuesday that the Government's new health care plan would hurt third-quarter earnings, and the company said it would carry out a restructuring, layoffs and a hiring freeze. Baxter closed at 23 a share, off 3 3/8.
Health maintenance organizations also dropped, following news that the Clinton Administration would trim Medicare and Medicaid spending to help finance its health care plan. Oxford Health Plans plunged 6 3/4 a share, to 63 3/4; United Healthcare dropped 3 3/4, to 56 1/2; U.S. Healthcare slid 2, to 44, and FHP International fell 2 3/4, to 21 1/2. Pacificare Health Systems, a California H.M.O., which said it had received a rate increase for Medicare patients that was lower than expected, saw its class B stock fall 5 1/2 a share, to 29 1/2.
Another group under pressure was the telecommunications equipment group, sagging under profit taking. DSC Communications, fell 2 1/8 a share, to 62 1/8, while Newbridge Networks, dropped 4 5/8, to 62.
After I.B.M. forecast its 1993 minicomputer revenue would be about the same as in 1992, citing weak European demand, the company's stock fell 1 1/8, to 44 3/8.
Traders said shares of Microchip Technology fell 2 1/4, to 49, on news that the maker of specialty semiconductors plans to sell 1.8 million common shares.
Though second-quarter earnings of 43 cents for Circus Circus Enterprises, the casino company, were higher than the 41 cents a share for the period a year ago, it was below analysts' median forecast of 44 cents. The stock dropped as much as 1 1/4 before closing down 1/8, to 41 5/8.
Shares of Genetic Therapy rose by 2 to close at 17 1/4, after the biotechnology company said it was encouraged by early results of human tests of an anti-tumor treatment.
YPF Sociedad, the Argentine oil company, yesterday received buy recommendations from analysts at Oppenheimer, Paine Webber, and Goldman, Sachs. The company's American depository shares, each respresenting one class D share, rose 7/8, to 23 1/2, in active trading.

The dollar recaptured some lost ground yesterday amid signs that Japan and Germany would cut interest rates to spur economic growth.
In New York, the dollar rose to 105.50 yen, from 104.23 yen on Tuesday. It also rose to 1.6140 marks from 1.6095 marks. 
 Dealers suspect the Bank of Japan might cut its official discount rate to 2 percent, from 2.5 percent, as part of a plan to stimulate the Japanese economy. They said the central bank's quarterly report on business conditions, known as the "tankan" survey, could spur an easing in Japan's monetary policy if it proves to be disappointing when it comes out tomorrow.
Lower interest rates make a country's currency relatively less attractive to investors.
Speculation has also been growing that the Bundesbank will take advantage of the mark's strength to trim the German discount rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 6.5 percent, at its council meeting today.
There was no reaction to a Federal Reserve banks periodic survey, known as the "beige book," which found that the American economy grew slowly in most parts of the country during the summer, with inflation muted and job growth slight.
"The survey is neutral," Marcos Douer at the Commercial Bank of New York said. "People are happy to wait for the Bundesbank meeting and Friday's Japanese tankan report."
The dollar staged a brief rally after the Federal Reserve's vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr., said that he saw no reason to lower American interest rate further at this time and that economic growth in the second half could attain 2.5 percent to 3 percent. But the gains were quickly whittled away.
Edward Cook at NatWest Markets attributed the dollar's modest recovery to dealers' cashing in profits by buying back the dollars they had sold. The dollar lost five pfennigs during last week's decline.
Meanwhile, the British pound rose to $1.5420 in New York, from $1.5369 Tuesday.

Recent Dive in Oil Prices Slows to a Slight Decline

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices ended slightly lower yesterday but pulled out of the steep drop that carried them to three-year lows this week.
Other inflation-conscious commodities contracts also steadied after steep declines on Tuesday, with gold rising slightly. 
 After an up-and-down session, crude oil for delivery in October closed just 4 cents lower at $17.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The oil contract has fallen about $1.80, or 10 percent, in the last six trading sessions, including 66 cents on Tuesday.
Traders said oil's long-term trend remained down.
"Yesterday's price action suggests a renewed price downtrend, which will likely be maintained into the Sept. 25 OPEC meeting," said Jim Ritterbusch, an oil industry consultant in Chicago, referring to the quarterly meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
"It should be kept in mind, however, that the possibilities of a successful or cohesive OPEC meeting tend to increase as crude prices decline," he added.
OPEC members may agree to cut their production to bolster sagging oil prices.
Among other energy contracts, October unleaded gasoline recovered 0.11 cent, to 49.05 cents a gallon, while October heating oil dipped 0.01 cent, to 51.12 cents a gallon.
 
Gold Up, Silver Down
Gold managed a slight rebound from Tuesday's wild selling, which pushed the October contract down $14.50 an ounce. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, October gold gained $1.10, to $351.90 an ounce. December gold, the most actively traded futures contract, also gained $1.10, to $353.60 an ounce. But December silver sank 4.3 cents, to $4.257 an ounce.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean and corn prices rebounded ahead of an important crop report estimate by the Agriculture Department scheduled for release late today. The report is expected to show the impact of flooding in the Midwest and unusually cool summer weather.
November soybeans rose 2 cents, to $6.42 1/2 a bushel, while December corn gained 1 1/2 cents, to $2.34 1/2 a bushel.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hog and pork belly prices turned sharply higher, as commodities funds bought heavily based on chart patterns and other technical factors. October hogs rose 0.9 cent, to 48.775 cents a pound, and February pork bellies jumped 1.65 cent, to 52.775 cents a pound.

30-Year Bond Yield Continues to Drop

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell again yesterday as the rally in the long end of the bond market continued. But short-term interest rates moved a little higher.
The yield on the 30-year bond has plunged a quarter of a percentage point in just five trading days and many traders and analysts are still reluctant to say the run is over. 
 In late trading, the price of the 6.25 percent, 30-year bond was up 19/32 of a point. The yield dropped to 5.86 percent, from 5.90 percent Tuesday. This is the lowest level for yields on 30-year issues in 25 years. The Treasury has been regularly issuing 30-year bonds since May 1977.
 
 
10-Year Note
 The yield on the 10-year note was also off sharply, dropping to 5.22 percent, from 5.26 percent, and at its lowest level since 1968. One measure of how far the yield has fallen recently is that on Aug. 19, the yield on the Treasury's 7-year note was 5.22 percent.
The spread between the yield on the Treasury's 2-year note and the yield on the 30-year bond narrowed yesterday to 2.12 percentage points, down from 2.45 percentage points a month ago. This is the lowest spread since October 1991 and indicates that the bond is outperforming the 2-year note.
The prices of shorter-term issues dropped slightly and their yields rose after comments by David W. Mullins Jr., the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. The price of the two-year note was off 1/32 as the yield rose to 3.74 percent, from 3.73 percent Tuesday.
In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Mullins said there was little to gain from a further cut in short-term interest rates.
 
 
'Only Marginal'
 He said the benefits of a reduction in short-term interest rates to help stimulate the economy "seem at best only marginal." The Fed's target for short-term interest rates has been 3 percent since last September.
Despite recent data indicating that the economy may be growing a lot slower than many analysts had forecast, Mr. Mullins said he believed the economy was on a path of moderate growth.
"We don't have a speedboat, but it's as if we have an ocean liner -- the longer it moves at that pace, the less likely it is to falter," he said. He forecast that the economy would grow at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent pace in the second half of this year.
But Fed officials have not proved to be good forecasters recently. The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, predicted in July that data would show the economy in the second quarter quarter grew at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation. The most recent Commerce Department report set the growth rate at 1.8 percent.
 
 
Committee Questions
 Mr. Mullins comments come the day after Mr. Greenspan indicated that short-term interest rates would have to rise sometime in the future if the Fed was going to continue with its anti-inflation stance. His comments came in answers to questions from the Senate Banking Committee and were released by the committee.
Together, the comments seem to head off for now any further speculation about the Fed cutting short-term interest rates below their current level to help the economy. The recent weak economic data, including Friday's report that nonfarm payroll jobs dropped 39,000 last month, had pushed short-term interest rates lower, indicating that some investors and speculators may have begun betting on another easing by the Fed.
Stephen R. Ricchiuto, chief financial economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said that two things have surprised him in the recent rally. One is that there had been so little issuance by corporations trying to lock in these low long-term interest rates. To him, this indicates that maybe some of these companies think the economy is still very weak and that long-term rates will move even lower.
"That is telling me that the economy is not as good as the Fed thinks it is," he said. "If corporates felt this was the lowest level for interest rates and the economy was growing, corporations would be issuing a lot."
 
 
Pace Seen Picking Up
 Steve Carter, an analyst at MCM/ CorporateWatch, said that the pace of new corporate issues had been slow recently but that he expected them to pick up next week.
The other surprise, Mr. Ricchiuto said, is that the spread between the yield on the 10-year note and the yield on the 30-year bond had widened recently rather than narrowed as many analysts had expected. This means that the yield on the 10-year note has come down just about as fast as that on the 30-year bond. For Mr. Ricchiuto, this is another indication of how weak many investors think the economy is.
The next test for this rally will come tomorrow, with the release of the Producer Price Index for August. Forecasts expect the increase to be a moderate two-tenths of 1 percent, which would support the perception that inflation is remaining in check. But a surprisingly large increase could upset the rally.

HEADLINE: Credit Cards and Car Loans Spur Consumer Borrowing

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing rose by $5.1 billion in July amid hefty increases in credit card use and auto loans, the Federal Reserve said today.
It was the second consecutive monthly gain and the largest one-month increase in nearly four years. 
 Analysts said the data suggested people were responding to the lowest interest rates in two decades by taking loans to replace aging autos and other items.
Consumer installment credit includes all household debt not secured by real estate. It does not include home equity loans or mortgages.
July's gain meant borrowing was increasing at an annual rate of 8.1 percent a year, while total credit outstanding climbed to $759.740 billion. The July advance was the largest monthly gain since credit grew by $5.27 billion in October 1989, the Fed said. It was the 11th increase in the last 12 months. Credit fell by $752 million in May. June borrowing, however, was revised downward to a gain of $3.8 billion, from an earlier reported increase of about $7.7 billion.
 
Auto Loans Increase
 The Fed report showed that automobile loans grew by $2.03 billion in July, a 9.2 percent increase at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. These loans have grown each month since falling $498 million in April, including a $918 million advance in June.
Revolving credit, which includes credit cards, increased $2.81 billion in July, at a 12.8 percent annual rate. It was the biggest gain since a $3.66 billion advance in March 1991. Revolving credit grew $1.08 million in June.
Other kinds of consumer credit rose by $265 million, a 1.4 percent annual rate, after rising $1.77 billion a month earlier. This category includes loans for mobile homes, education, boats, trailers and vacations.
Not all analysts see increases in borrowing as a positive sign for the economy.
"Weak retail sales, consumption and confidence suggest consumers are still unable to pay down past borrowing," said a report by Gary Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet Financial.
In addition, a lack of cash is finding many people "unwilling to forgo liquidity, allowing balances on credit cards to continue accumulating," Mr. Ciminero said.
Still, the pace of borrowing has slowed from the buying binge of the 1980's. "Consumer credit use has been a smaller propellant to consumption growth," said a report by Michael Niemira, an economist at the Mitsubishi Bank.

HEADLINE: Fed Economic Study Shows Striking Regional Contrasts

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The economy displayed "slow to moderate" overall growth in midsummer but was marked by striking differences among geographic areas and industries, a Federal Reserve survey said today.
"Economic growth appears weaker on the East and West Coasts while central areas such as Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis report stronger than average growth," said the Fed's so-called beige book, an anecdotal survey of business conditions in late July and August. 
 While this follows the general pattern of recent years, contrasts such as the Chicago district's report of the highest orders for heavy trucks for any July in 15 years and a severe slump in tourism in Hawaii, seemed unusually acute.
Even within individual districts, some areas were robust while others sank. The New York district, for example, cited layoffs by the International Business Machines Corporation as having begun to damage the real estate market in the Hudson Valley while the solid price Morgan Stanley paid for a nearly vacant 42-story office building suggested a firming in mid-Manhattan.
Except for lumber, which was rebounding because of rebuilding in the flood-stricken Midwest, the economy shows little evidence of inflationary cost pressures, the survey found. The floods themselves did not cut crop production enough to have much effect on food or livestock prices, though corn and soybeans in northern areas were described as vulnerable to an early frost.
The survey, compiled this time at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, was based on information supplied by Fed contacts before Aug. 31. It is one of the many sources used to aid deliberations when the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, its main policy body, meets next on Sept. 21.
The preceding survey, published Aug. 4, found the economy expanding "slowly to moderately," in most districts, almost identical to today's characterization. The job market, however, appears not to have held its own, based on last Friday's weak Labor Department report for August and on various comments in the survey.
Employment growth suffers from continued restructuring by corporations, the survey said. Philadelphia, for example, reported that despite expectations of improved conditions, about 75 percent of the area's manufacturers were keeping payrolls "steady" while 25 percent were cutting them.
The Fed banks noted these developments in their regions:
*San Francisco -- Recovery continues to elude California but hefty expansion marks the intermountain West. The motion-picture business, posting double-digit gains, is one bright spot. Tucson booms on the relocation of aerospace activity to southern Arizona. Home sales slump 18 percent in Hawaii from levels a year earlier but the median sales price in Honolulu jumps 5.6 percent, to $358,000, highest in the country.
*St. Louis -- Estimate of flood damage for the district is estimated at $2 billion to $3 billion as the economy continues to grow slowly. One concern is a possible Mississippi River traffic snarl in the autumn as many boats and barges head for New Orleans at the same time.
*Cleveland -- Makers of sheet steel report operations at virtual capacity but those making plate steel find orders softening because of deferrals of barge and rail cars orders until facilities destroyed by floods can be rebuilt.
*Boston -- The economy seems to be expanding only marginally but some retailers fear progress may have stalled. Suppliers of medical equipment have cut prices by as much as 15 percent.
*Atlanta -- Consumer spending slowed unseasonably in July and August, with apparel and other nondurables especially sluggish and recent gains among furniture, appliances and cars have been more muted than earlier in the year.
*Minneapolis -- South Dakota is in a mini-boom, with construction employment at near-record levels, but sales taxes in Minnesota are running behind projections.
*Dallas -- The main source of growth at accounting firms was for consulting on ways to raise productivity. Home building remains strong.
Richmond reported that tourism was strong but activity at the main ports of Baltimore, Hampton Roads, Va., and Charleston, S.C., was only mixed -- exports lower and imports higher in July than in June and in the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: BOXING;
A Title, and Pride, at Stake for Chavez

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 8

 BODY:
In the cantinas and garages that anchor the gritty, working-class neighborhood here called Tepito, the talk is all of Mexican guts and battered gringos, of past and future glory.
For all of the hype about a Mexican fighting an American on Friday night in the Alamodome in San Antonio, no one here seems to be remembering the Alamo much. But ask them about Julio Cesar Chavez, Pernell Whitaker and the symbolic precedent, and the men of Tepito are of a single mind: history will repeat itself. 
 "The Americans have always dominated us in everything," said Jose Luis Villagran, a 25-year-old clerk in an auto parts store. "But we can win with Julio Cesar. He has a very Mexican heart."
It is much the same elsewhere in the country as its superlightweight and spiritual champion -- a slight man with small, hard fists and a smiling, steel jaw -- prepares to defend the national honor against yet another voluble American.
 
Trade Is Trade; Sports Is Sports
 As Mexico has embraced a new partnership with the United States under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, fastening its economic hopes to the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Government has worked with some success to push aside the prickly, defensive nationalism with which Mexicans have long looked northward.
This morning, though, the inky sports tabloids that hang like shingles from kiosks around Mexico City suggested that trade was trade and sports was sports. Anyone wondering about the pride at stake needed only to hear from Chavez.
"I'll never go down on points," the fighter was quoted as saying. "If he knocks me out, I'll retire."
For the Chavez camp, the intended conquest on Friday night will be more than the welterweight champion Pernell Whitaker, who is as elusive as any of the 87 men whom Chavez has fought and beaten, 75 by knockout. The fight will be the third in which Chavez will be putting on weight in search of another championship.
The other goal will be for the five-time world champion, a man of low-key charisma and little English, to hammer his way to a larger American audience and the sort of international star status that a fighter often called the best pound for pound in the world might expect.
"This is to get to another level," said Daniel Castro, the 45-year-old former high school math teacher and track coach who has trained Chavez for the last seven years. "We want to break into the whole American market."
The thought of it seems to have seized Chavez's promoter, Don King, by the nose.
 
Let the Hype Begin
 The fight has been marketed and publicized like none of Chavez's before, with public workouts from Mexico to Los Angeles to New York. The event seems to have outhyped even "the Grand Slam of Boxing," the four-fight card on which Chavez whipped Greg Haugen in February before 110,000 extremely partisan fans in Mexico City's Estadio Azteca. (And that promotion was enough to start King learning Spanglish.)
In a conversation last month in Toluca, a city just west of the Mexican capital where he has gone for years to train in the crisp, thin air, Chavez bubbled with good humor at the prospect of beating up another fighter who lays claim to his unofficial pound-for-pound title. But he seemed somewhat defensive at the notion shared by his trainer and others that his international fame had not yet caught up to his stature as a boxer.
"I am satisfied with what I've done in boxing," he said. "I think the American public knows me better than Whitaker. I sell more tickets than he does. This is just one more fight for me."
In Mexico, product endorsements and other secondary markets for his fame have multiplied with each fight. In Mexico, he promotes everything from potato chips to supermarkets and banks. And he seems to wonder: isn't that enough?
As he thought about it while preparing for an afternoon sparring session, he even seemed tired of the fame, of the people who surround him wherever he goes in Mexico, of all the people who wait outside his home in the northwestern city of Culiacan as they might wait for a priest or a mafia don.
"How could I enjoy that?" he asked. "I don't have privacy. I don't have anything.
"Tons of people come to ask me for things, to ask me for money. I help a lot of people. But I can't help everybody. I don't mind when people who really need you come. But some of them -- it bothers you."
 
'A Real Ugly Style'
 Still weeks before the fight, he even seemed a bit tired already of Pernell Whitaker and the King-orchestrated selling of their fight.
"I don't like to watch him fight," he said of Whitaker. "He's got a real ugly style."
Sure, he was in the best shape of his life, Chavez said. After 10 years of telling his wife, Amalia, that the next year will be his last, he said he was sure he has a couple of good years left in his career.
But there was a note of fatigue in his voice.
"I really don't like to do all the promotion so much," he said in an interview last month at his camp in Toluca. "I am a happy person. But I don't like to act like a clown. Boxing is something serious."
In the musty amateur gyms that dot Tepito, it is something almost religious.
"The gringos have always beaten us in everything else, but not in boxing," said Cesar Bazan Perez, an 18-year-old who hung onto the ropes of a ring at the Deportivo Tepito, a gym where pink and blue squiggles of neon on the wall illuminate a shrine to the Mexico's patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe. "This is Mexico against the United States. Like a good Mexican, I think Julio Cesar is going to win."
Chavez, of course, said he was sure of that.
"I know he is a fighter who is very difficult to connect with," he said of Whitaker. "He can be dangerous in the first few rounds. But I don't think he can knock me out."
 
Always More Rivals
 Was Chavez already thinking ahead to a rematch with Meldrick Taylor, the one fighter who, in 1990, came within seconds of beating him?
"Every time you turn around there are more rivals," he said. "There's always going to be another one."
But who would be next?
Well, next would be a fight in Mexico, he said, describing the habitual Chavez warm-up bout that led Haugen to complain unwisely before their fight that the Mexican had padded his undefeated record against "Tijuana taxi drivers."
"I don't know exactly who I will fight," Chavez said. "They will pick someone."
He smiled the steel-jawed smile. "Some taxi driver."

HEADLINE: For City Council: Bronx, Queens

 BODY:
The shortage of plausible challengers in next week's Democratic primary elections for New York City Council in the Bronx and Queens means that many undistinguished members will glide to re-election despite lackluster records. Voters in the Bronx's 18th Councilmanic District have particular reason to feel cheated by the non-contest in their district.
With the borough's Democratic Party organization helping to clear the field of potential contenders, and with no dissent from the Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, the incumbent, Lucy Cruz, has an unobstructed path -- notwithstanding her alarming pattern of ethical abuses. 
 Here are The Times's endorsements in some of the competitive races.
12th District (Co-op City, Williamsbridge, Baychester, Edenwald and parts of Wakefield): The incumbent, Lawrence Warden, faces an active challenge from Samuel Burke, a Democratic district leader in Co-op City who is an associate manager at Montefiore Medical Center.
Mr. Burke has served as a legislative aide to a former State Senator and as a member of a local community planning board -- normally valuable training for someone who aspires to the Council. But he has yet to acquire a reassuring grasp of citywide issues, and his candidacy seems more inspired by infighting among different political factions in his district than by any clear vision of what he would do in office.
First elected in 1991, Mr. Warden has not emerged as a serious legislator. Though he's a hard-working presence in the community, he has not devoted equal attention to legislation, oversight and the related responsibilities that all Council members share. We endorse him with the hope that he will begin to take his citywide obligations as a lawmaker more seriously.
17th District (Mott Haven, Longwood, Crotona): This district has not been well served by the incumbent, Rafael Castaneira Colon, an 11-year veteran. Mr. Colon was recently indicted on charges of stealing nearly $400,000 by cashing payroll checks made out to phantom employees.
His legal troubles lost him the support of the Bronx Democratic political establishment, which pushed Assemblyman David Rosado to run against him. Mr. Rosado needs to broaden his vision to encompass more than his South Bronx district; even so, he seems to have a slightly better sense of his community's needs than Andrew Eatmon Jr., a Legal Aid Society investigator whom we endorsed last time in preference to Mr. Colon.
27th District (St. Albans, Hollis, Cambria Heights, parts of Jamaica, Queens Village, Rosedale and Springfield Gardens): Archie Spigner, a career politician and an integral part of the Council leadership, faces a challenge from Garth Marchant, a freelance reporter. Mr. Marchant is energetic but does not offer sufficient experience to unseat Mr. Spigner, a 19-year veteran who heads the Council's housing committee in a workmanlike manner.
 28th District (Jamaica, Rochdale Village, South Ozone Park and Richmond Hill): This contest pits Thomas White Jr., a one-term incumbent who directs a state-funded drug treatment program, against Allan Jennings Jr., a Democratic district leader. Mr. White has often paid more attention to his drug program than to his Council duties. But he played an important role in pushing the solid waste management plan and has tried forcefully to heal racial tensions among Council members. Mr. Jennings, 26, shows promise, but needs more political seasoning.
31st District (Far Rockaway, Arverne, Edgemere, Bayswater, Laurelton, Rosedale, parts of Springfield Gardens, Cambria Heights and Ozone Park): The incumbent in this large and economically diverse district is Juanita Watkins, who had been a longtime community activist. She's been less of an activist during her one term on the Council, seeming to concentrate more on constituent services.
But her ability to work effectively when she chooses to do so -- lending her support to a compromise proposal to create a separate city agency for the homeless, for example -- earns her our endorsement over her opponent, Edward J. Lewis, who shares Ms. Watkins's devotion to the community but does not match her political experience.

HEADLINE: Don't Strangle the U.N.

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk; Leonard Silk, former economics columnist of The New York Times, is co-editor, with Uner Kirdar, of the forthcoming "A World Fit for People."

DATELINE: HULLS COVE, Me.

 BODY:
Forty-eight years ago, as a correspondent for an Army newspaper, I covered the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco. In the pressroom in the basement of the Opera House, I met the great essayist E. B. White, who was there for The New Yorker.
One day he posed a riddle. "Sergeant," he said, "what is the most important thing for a marriage?" "Love?" I asked. "No," he said. "The ring." 
 He meant the ring as symbol of commitment: if the 50 founding nations were committed to the new world body, it could survive the kinds of crises that had killed the League of Nations and brought on a world war.
But now, as 183 member nations prepare to convene for the 48th regular session of the General Assembly on Sept. 21, the state of the marriage is alarmingly shaky. Even as the agenda lists a mind-numbing array of problems -- from the fate of Bosnia to the control of Antarctica, from apartheid to the arms race in outer space -- the members seem unwilling to do the hard work needed to keep this union healthy.
As George Bush once said in another context, it's a matter of will and wallet. United Nations peacekeeping forces are engaged in no fewer than a dozen wars, civil and cross-border, around the world. The cost of peacekeeping has risen tenfold in the last six years -- to $3.6 billion in the past fiscal year from $364 million in 1987.
But the U.N. is strapped for funds to carry out the tasks it has been given by member governments. Few countries pay their bills in full or on time; only 10 of the 183 have done so.
The worst offender is the United States. At the end of August, the U.N. was owed more than $2 billion, with the United States owing $786 million, followed by Russia ($505 million) and Japan ($108 million).
Much of the American debt dates to the cold war, when the U.S. deliberately underfinanced the United Nations to show disapproval of its actions. These obligations are being wound down under a program approved by Congress in 1991, but at the present rate they will take years to pay off. To make matters worse, the former Soviet republics have no money to pay their back dues.
The U.N. is not allowed to borrow money; it is constantly delaying payment of its own bills and juggling accounts, a demeaning business.
To withhold support at so crucial a time is unwise and self-defeating. The lack of resources is severely constricting the U.N.'s ability to carry out its missions.
To deal with conflicts already on its agenda, the U.N. has only 80,000 peacekeepers among the 12 wars. These forces are not large enough to enforce the peace. Without the much larger national military forces of the United States and other nations involved, U.N. peacekeepers can only function as observers, mediators, aid dispensers, hostages or victims -- all roles they have played in Bosnia, Cambodia and Somalia.
Neither the United States nor any other nation could take on the job of global policeman on its own. Yet the member states, including the United States, are not ready to give the U.N. the control over military forces and the financing to head off conflicts.
With the end of the cold war, the neglect and disparagement of the United Nations by the United States and other countries cannot safely continue. The U.N. must be rebuilt as an organization capable of fulfilling its original purposes and dealing with the dangers that have grown up during its nearly half century of existence -- not just wars, but the economic stagnation and poverty that underlie so much of the world's conflicts.
"Forty years of neglect," as the American delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, has said, "have left this institution flabby and out of shape." Indeed. But if it is to be strengthened, it is up to the United States to take the lead.

HEADLINE: Time to Lift the Ban On Travel to Lebanon

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Beirut Reborn," your Aug. 29 front-page special report, updates the world on a country that used to have "war-torn" unofficially part of its name. Yet while Lebanon revives, Washington hinders it by maintaining a travel ban to Lebanon on United States passports, putting Lebanon in the company of Libya and Iraq. 
 The original travel ban to Lebanon followed the kidnapping of Americans by terrorist groups operating in a then-lawless nation. Yet the last American hostage, Terry Andersen, was freed Dec. 4, 1991, and Lebanon is today under the firm control of the Lebanese Army, with help (wanted or unwanted) from the Syrian Army.
Why hasn't the travel ban been lifted? In my view, it is simply because the "safe" course of action is to do nothing. The real problem is that if a single American was kidnapped or harmed, those responsible for lifting the ban could pay the political price.
More than $1 billion has been pledged for Lebanon's reconstruction, with participation from the World Bank, the European Economic Community, and European and Middle East countries and institutions. The total expenditure is estimated at $3 billion at least. American companies deserve the right to compete for their share of that business.
The State Department could downgrade the ban to a travel advisory and warn people not to go, as it does in the cases of Bosnia, Somalia and Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Why Family Leave Makes Good Business Sense;
Allowing for Sickness

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Women's Work -- and Men's, Too" (editorial, Aug. 17), you note that the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act are widely misunderstood. Contrary to popular belief, the law gives a man the same opportunity as female co-workers to spend time with his new baby or take his sick mother to the doctor. The sooner employers learn that the family leave act makes family leave available to both sexes, the closer we'll be to a nondiscriminatory workplace. 
 But you further a common misperception of this law by stating nothing about its medical leave aspect. Medical leave -- formerly known as disability leave -- allows an employee to attend to his or her own illness. Although disability leave is a mandated benefit in New York and New Jersey, even for small companies, these states are the exception. Most United States workers have no job-guaranteed right to take time off when sick. Without the Family and Medical Leave Act, a heart attack or a broken leg can mean the loss of a job.
By providing these two types of leave together, the law reconfigures our notion of the typical worker. Public policy has traditionally treated employees as identical individuals whose needs and family obligations are their private problem. The family leave act marks the beginning of a policy that acknowledges wage earners come in many guises and with diverse responsibilities.
We are women, as well as men, fathers, mothers, members of big families and people without close relatives. We have new babies, sick children and aging parents. And sometimes, we fall seriously ill ourselves.
American workers are human beings whose needs should be recognized in the workplace. Whether the Family and Medical Leave Act is justified on ethical grounds or to increase productivity in a competitive global economy, it takes an important step in this direction.

HEADLINE: A Mudslinging Democratic Match;
On L.I., a Race Grows Ugly on Who Will Challenge the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Sept. 8

 BODY:
Four years ago, it would have been almost unthinkable that Democrats in Nassau County, home of one of the last great Republican political machines, would be fighting among themselves over who would challenge the incumbent Republican County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta.
The Democratic nominee, one top party official said of previous county executive races, was "basically the last person to leave the room," often someone who agreed to be sacrificed at the polls after preferred candidates opted for safer electoral climes. 
 But with the county's economy faltering and voters angry about some of the highest county taxes in the nation, the Nassau Republican Party is believed to be vulnerable, and the Democrats have responded with one of the most intense primary battles in the county's history.
After months of trying to avoid an ugly campaign between two of the county's best-known Democrats, the candidates, Richard M. Kessel and Benjamin L. Zwirn, have turned the race into a mudslinging match that has many Democrats fearing that neither candidate will be standing after the primary on Tuesday.
"At least it's generating some excitement," mused Lewis J. Yevoli, the Democratic Supervisor of Oyster Bay, who originally endorsed Mr. Kessel and is now neutral. "I just hope they don't kill each other before next Tuesday."
The primary comes as the political landscape in the suburbs has changed in recent years. While the suburbs were once viewed as Republican territory, in the 1992 Presidential election President Clinton did well in Republican enclaves like Nassau and Westchester Counties, as well as the suburbs of Chicago and Philadelphia.
It is not clear whether such national trends translate to local politics, though Nassau Democrats have recently won some top elected offices for the first time in decades, such as the county clerk's office last year, Mr. Yevoli's as supervisor in Oyster Bay in 1991 and Mr. Zwirn's position as supervisor of North Hempstead in 1989.
The race between Mr. Kessel, executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, and Mr. Zwirn represents a struggle over the best path to winning the county's highest office, the position that serves as chief executive of an area with a population larger than Arkansas (1.3 million) and a budget of almost $2 billion. For many voters, it is not a question of ideology -- both men promise "change," meaning cutting taxes and trimming government -- but one of who will be the better candidate against Mr. Gulotta.
The two men have starkly different images. People commonly refer to Mr. Kessel as a "nice guy" and he proudly wears the label of a "progressive, traditional Democrat." In contrast, Mr. Zwirn, who was a registered Republican for several years in the 1980's, is known as a combative maverick who touts his independence from the Democratic Party and brags of his ties to supporters of Ross Perot and other independents.
 
'Clean Water and Apple Pie'
 "There are no issues at all," said Bruce Nyman, Supervisor of Long Beach. "Both are for lower taxes, clean water and apple pie. People will be voting on personalities, not policies."
Hank Morris, a political consultant who is not involved in the race, said: "Kessel symbolizes the Democratic Party that, as a first order of business, cares about helping people and fighting big powerful interests that are allied with rich and powerful people. Zwirn symbolizes a new kind of Democrat that is less rooted in those traditions, is less ideological and has a track record of winning elections."
Mr. Kessel, who has never held elected office, bills himself as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's "point man" on Long Island: acting as Mr. Cuomo's representative, he was a major player in the deal that led to the closing of the Shoreham nuclear-power plant. A self-styled gadfly in the mode of a Ralph Nader, Mr. Kessel campaigns as a consumer advocate who says he lowered water rates, improved the service of Long Island Railroad and helped in successful fights against proposed sewage pelletization plants and in the closing of a landfill.
At the county's Democratic convention last spring, about 75 percent of the party regulars endorsed Mr. Kessel, and since then, Mr. Kessel has argued that his ties to the party and Mr. Cuomo made him the stronger candidate to run against Mr. Gulotta. Indeed, as of last Friday, he had raised about $311,000, more than twice as much as Mr. Zwirn, with a substantial portion coming from out-of-county contributors.
Mr. Zwirn has emphasized his accomplishments in trimming North Hempstead's work force by 43 percent and cutting the town's taxes to what he contends are the lowest of any town on Long Island.
 
Repeating Campaign Theme
 His literature heralds how in 1989 he became the first Democrat to be elected Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead in more than 70 years and how in 1991 he was re-elected along with the North Hempstead Town Board's first Democratic majority.
When asked his plan for the county, Mr. Zwirn responds with what has become his campaign's theme: "Just look at my record in North Hempstead." His supporters maintain that he will be the better candidate to defeat Mr. Gulotta, because of a proven track record of reaching out to independents and disaffected Republicans. It is Mr. Zwirn's record of winning elections that has some party insiders wavering in their loyalty to Mr. Kessel.
Almost every Democrat grants that the toughest part of the campaign is still to come. Mr. Gulotta has won every race he has ever run, and he already has accumulated a war chest of more than $1 million. While the Republican machine here has suffered some setbacks recently, it is still the operation that served as the base for Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's successful campaigns, and it can mobilize hundreds of county employees who owe their jobs to Republican patronage. And Republicans still outnumber Democrats here 3 to 2.
 
Charges and Countercharges
 For this reason, the divisive primary battle has worried Democrats. Mr. Zwirn last week in a debate on station WGBB-AM declared that he would run as an independent if he lost the primary, a move that Mr. Kessel said would almost guarantee Mr. Gulotta's re-election and that also showed that Mr. Zwirn was not a "true Democrat."
The disarray among Democrats has been compounded in the last few weeks, as the campaign has grown increasingly negative. In a debate Tuesday night on Cablevision's Channel 12, Mr. Kessel accused Mr. Zwirn of being a "rubber stamp to Mr. Gulotta" and charged that he has proposed one of the largest tax increases in county history, ignoring that Mr. Zwirn's recommendation was accompanied by a proposal suggesting spending cuts and was intended to provide financing to hire 1,000 more police officers.
In turn, in the same debate, Mr. Zwirn referred to Mr. Kessel as "rate-hike Richie," blaming him for the county's high utility rates because of the deal that shut down the Shoreham plant. He also ridiculed Mr. Kessel's work as a consumer advocate to put into effect unit pricing, saying, "You're my man for tuna fish."
One top Democratic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "This primary has really deteriorated. The charges from both sides have no basis in reality. Both camps are in outer space."
It is not clear what ramifications the negative campaigning will have in the primary on Tuesday. Democratic primaries in the past here have had poor turnouts, and several party stalwarts said a projected turnout of 20 percent of the registered Democrats, about 43,000 voters, by John Matthews, the chairman of the Nassau Democratic Committee, was optimistic.
If that is the case, the election will very likely be decided by which campaign has the better get-out-the-vote effort, and it is difficult to assess if one organization is decisively stronger. While Mr. Kessel has more money, Mr. Zwirn has mobilized voters before in North Hempstead.
"Nobody has a handle on this race," said Mr. Nyman, the Long Beach Supervisor, who endorsed Mr. Kessel last spring before Mr. Zwirn entered the race and has not been involved in the campaign. "There are so many intangibles here, and neither candidate's organization has ever been tested in a countywide race."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 10, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the Democratic primary for Nassau County Executive compared the county's population incorrectly with that of Arkansas. While Long Island's total population of 2.6 million is greater than that of Arkansas, with 2.4 million, Nassau's population of 1.3 million is not.

Tandem Appoints a Chief For Ungermann-Bass Unit

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
Tandem Computers Inc. yesterday named Roel Pieper, a multilingual computer executive, as president and chief executive of its struggling Ungermann-Bass Inc. computer networking subsidiary.
Mr. Pieper succeeds Ralph Ungermann, 51, who resigned from the company he co-founded on July 28. The same day, Tandem Computers started a cost-cutting and streamlining drive that surprised industry analysts and led to a $550 million third-quarter loss. Ungermann-Bass, acquired by Tandem in 1988, was not spared in the corporate overhaul, a company spokesman said. In the first nine months, the unit had $269 million in revenue, 18 percent of Tandem's total. 
 Only last week, Mr. Pieper, 36, departed from the software maker Novell Inc., which in June acquired Unix Systems Laboratories from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. He had been president and chief executive of the A.T.& T. spinoff. His departure was expected because he was left without a leading role to play at Novell.
 
Efforts to Renew Growth
 In a statement, James G. Treybig, Tandem's president, said in part that he expectedMr. Pieper to return the unit to profitability and renew its growth.
Ungermann-Bass "struggled because it focused on the high end while growth has been at the low end," said Thomas Rooney, a computer analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin. "Clearly, new management and new direction was needed. Now, it's a question of repositioning."
Tandem stock lost 25 cents a share yesterday, closing at $9.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
In an interview, Mr. Pieper (rhymes with beeper) said, "I look for things that are a new challenge, need work and have a lot of potential."
Mr. Pieper, a Dutch computer scientist who is fluent in English, German and French in addition to Dutch, said he was particularly intrigued with being part of a company at the brink of interactive technology, where some envision a myriad of services emerging from the overlay of cable television, computers and telephones.
"Here's where it will happen," he said. Mr. Pieper said his most important task would be marketing the company's networking software, possibly through new partnerships.
Tandem, based in Cupertino, Calif., makes fault-tolerant computer systems, which are designed not to fail even under extreme conditions. The company has been hurt by weak economic conditions, price cutting by rivals and by a shift away from expensive mainframes.
Mr. Treybig, Tandem's president, declined to say what Mr. Pieper would be paid, except that his salary, like that of all Tandem employees, includes an unspecified amount of stock. Mr. Pieper will also be a senior vice president of Tandem.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: The Overview;
P.L.O. AND ISRAEL ACCEPT EACH OTHER AFTER 3 DECADES OF RELENTLESS STRIFE

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Enemies to the death for three decades, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization opened a new era in their blood-soaked history today by recognizing each other's legitimacy and the rights of both to represent their people's dreams.
Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, said in a letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin that his group recognized Israel's right "to exist in peace and security," renounced "the use of terrorism and other acts of violence," and was ready to discipline any of its loyalists who break this pledge. 
 And in a separate letter to Norway's Foreign Minister, who had served for months as an intermediary in secret talks between the two sides, Mr. Arafat called on Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to begin "the normalization of life." Israeli officials took that as an Arafat appeal to end the Palestinian uprising known in Arabic as the intifada, although that was not spelled out.
 
Rabin Stood Firm
 The Israelis said Mr. Rabin was adamant that the intifada be curtailed. It was a measure of Mr. Arafat's determination to reach an agreement that he yielded on this point even though most Palestinians in the territories consider the uprising an indispensable tool to resist the Israeli occupation.
For his part, Mr. Rabin wrote a terse letter to Mr. Arafat saying that in light of these Palestinian commitments, his Government "has decided to recognize the P.L.O. as the representative of the Palestinian people and to commence negotiations with the P.L.O. within the Middle East peace process." Unlike Mr. Arafat, who closed his letter with the word "sincerely," Mr. Rabin dispensed with such pleasantries and simply put his name. [Texts of the three letters, page A12.]
Mr. Arafat signed his letter to Mr. Rabin behind closed doors late tonight in Tunis, where the P.L.O. is based. When Mr. Rabin follows suit at a signing ceremony in Jerusalem on Friday morning, it will clear the way for yet another agreement on a plan to transfer authority in the territories from Israeli to Palestinian hands, starting with a form of self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank city of Jericho.
 
Breathtaking Change
 That accord, the product of months of secret negotiations conducted mainly in Norway, is to be signed at the White House on Monday by high-ranking officials on each side. No names have been announced, but the Israelis said they would probably be represented by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and the Palestinians are expected to send Mahmoud Abbas, the P.L.O. official who supervised the negotiations. Farouk Kaddoumi, the P.L.O. foreign minister, opposed the agreements.
Washington has been the locale of the most recent Middle East peace talks, and both sides seem to want United States involvement in the peace process.
No amount of protocol or formal language, however, could obscure the breathtaking change that has now swept across this land for which Jews and Arabs have fought and died across the last century.
For Israel, recognition of the P.L.O., formally endorsed by the Rabin Cabinet this evening, means that it is prepared at last to come to terms with a detested Arab leader whose followers have taken countless Israeli lives and whose name is uttered by many Jews in the same breath as Hitler's.
For the P.L.O., it means that it has come at last to accept that Israel is here to stay and that this fact will not be altered by killings, resistance or its 1964 covenant calling for armed struggle to "destroy the Zionist and imperialist presence." In rejecting that part of the covenant now, Mr. Arafat acknowledges that if he is to obtain the state he hopes to lead in a few years, he must settle for the territories of Gaza and the West Bank and he is not about to "liberate" all the land that used to be called Palestine.
The leap that has been made is so large that the normally phlegmatic Mr. Rabin told members of his Labor Party today that he had "butterflies in my stomach."
 
Coming to Terms
 It does not mean that he likes dealing with the P.L.O., he said, and aides added that none of this means the Prime Minister puts his trust in Mr. Arafat. But if there is to be peace with the Palestinians, the only negotiating partner available is the P.L.O., Mr. Rabin asserted.
"You don't make peace with friends," he said. "You make it with very unsavory enemies."
Mr. Peres, who guided the secret talks in Norway and who met with a senior P.L.O. official in Oslo last month, spoke more positively about the shift that has taken place, insisting that the Government had remained true to longstanding principles and to its commitment to Israeli security.
"We haven't changed -- it changed," he said, referring to the P.L.O. "Arafat is announcing that he opposes terrorism and will fight the terrorists. He recognizes Israel and its right to exist in peace."
 
From Clinton, Praise
 On a visit to Cleveland, President Clinton added his endorsement, saying after a phone conversation with Mr. Rabin, "This is a very brave and courageous thing that has been done."
Still, as momentous as the breakthrough is, Israeli officials say with somewhat nervous sighs that now comes the difficult part, including hammering out essential details for Palestinian self-rule and contending with hard-line resisters on each side.
Although there were signs of rallying 'round the P.L.O. in the territories, including a march today in Gaza City by several hundred Arafat supporters, widespread opposition remains among Palestinians who believe that they got too little from the Israelis and that self-rule will not lead to a state.
In Damascus, a radical Palestinian leader, Ahmed Jabril, said that 10 Syria-based opposition groups would seek to upend the agreement, adding, "We are capable of finding ways and means to do it." Moreover, no pledge by Mr. Arafat to curb violence is binding on militant Islamic groups like Hamas, a serious threat to the P.L.O.
 
Weary of Conflict
 On the Israeli side, Government officials say that the people will support them, for they are tried of decades of conflict. But the officials acknowledge that they must persuade Israelis that the new course will not undermine their security.
After decades of viewing Mr. Arafat as a scraggly bearded devil, many Israelis will not easily negotiate the mental U-turn now required to treat him as a partner in peace. A widely shared opinion was expressed on television tonight by Ariel Sharon, the former general and opposition Likud Party elder. "There is room for reconciliation with the Palestinians," he said. "There is room for peace with them. There is no room for peace with Arafat."
Given such emotions, officials say it is not clear whether they will allow Mr. Arafat to move into Gaza and Jericho with other P.L.O. leaders expected to arrive in a few months.
As a further complication, Mr. Rabin is threatened with a possible walkout by Shas, the only religious party in his governing coalition. A day after its leader was forced to resign as Interior Minister in a corruption scandal, Shas was still on the Prime Minister's side today. But if it leaves, Mr. Rabin will lose his assured majority in Parliament and may have to depend on Arab votes to win approval for his peace plan. While that would be legally valid, the absence of a clear Jewish majority could be politically damaging, Government officials acknowledge.
 
Problems for Arafat
 Mr. Arafat has legislative problems as well. Technically, he must have more than just the approval of the P.L.O. executive committee, which he received today after days of delay caused by internal disputes over the wording of the mutual recognition accord. To alter the P.L.O. charter on this score he must also get a two-thirds majority of the Palestine National Council, a parliament-in-exile for the Palestinians. That is likely to involve still more delays and bitter fights.
With the clock ticking and convinced that time lost works against them, Israeli officials agreed to a short cut in the form of a solid commitment by the P.L.O. leadership to recognize Israel's right to exist, to resolve disputes through negotiations and not bombs, to assume responsibility for P.L.O. elements that resort to acts of violence and to discipline them.
But in return, the Israelis drove a hard bargain. Mr. Rabin, who was Defense Minister when the uprising erupted in 1987 and who vowed to crush it by breaking bones, was said to be especially insistent on curbing the uprising, which has ebbed considerably on its own. "It's almost a personal thing with him," one official said.
In response to this demand, Mr. Arafat said in his letter to the Norwegian Foreign Minister, Johan Jorgen Holst, that after the self-rule agreement is signed he will call on Palestinians in the territories to "take part in the steps leading to the normalization of life, rejecting violence and terrorism."
An even thornier problem delaying mutual recognition, Israeli officials said, was the language of the P.L.O.'s renunciation of offending sections of its covenant. The wording was finally nailed down only today. According to the Israelis, the P.L.O. had wanted to dispense with these sections by calling them "obsolete." In the end, it agreed to the more forceful construction of "inoperative and no longer valid."
All this was set down on pieces of paper lacking letterheads -- a protocol requirement that Israelis officials considered necessary because, they said, they are not on an equal plane with the stateless Palestinians.
Once the documents are signed, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators must flesh out their outlined agreement on Palestinian self-rule, or autonomy, in Gaza and the West Bank.
For the Palestinians, the goal is clear: a state of their own. The Rabin Government opposes a state, however, and says that it envisions eventual confederation between the Palestinian "entity" and Jordan.
 
A Pilot Project
 The "declaration of principles" that is expected to be signed on Monday at the White House provides for immediate autonomy in Gaza and Jericho as a pilot project, tentatively to start in six months. Soon after, the Israelis say, they will hand the Palestinians responsibility for many functions of daily life elsewhere in the West Bank, but they will not pull back their forces, as they plan to do in Gaza and Jericho.
After an anticipated nine months or so, Palestinians, including those living in East Jerusalem, will elect a council to administer this autonomy in the territories. Israel, while withdrawing its troops from populated areas, will remain in charge of overall security, foreign relations, Israeli settlers living in the territories and the safety of Israelis who may pass through. In addition, the highly delicate question of Jerusalem's future will be left for later.
But much needs to be worked out on basic matters, such as how large the Jericho district is and what sort of cooperation will exist between the Israeli army and the "strong local police force" that the Palestinians are to create. Details must also be arranged on plans for economic cooperation.
"The signing of documents is only the beginning of a very difficult task and the daunting challenges that lie ahead," said Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks that have continued in Washington while the real agreements were reached elsewhere.
Mr. Rabin also said that the agreement is only "a test case" and that much more remains to be done. But he said of the deal with the P.L.O., "I see this as the lowest risk in order to give peace a chance."

SoHo's Grand Reopening
In these precarious economic times, SoHo dealers are betting there is safety in numbers (not to mention increased visibility). Tomorrow, to inaugurate the fall art season, more than 30 galleries and nonprofit spaces in lower SoHo will have simultaneous openings from 5 to 8 P.M. The dealers have decided to make the event a virtual block party, with Wooster Street closed to traffic between Grand and Broome Streets.
"Last year we called each other in order to plan our openings on the same day; this year we decided to formalize it," said Ann Philbin, the director of the Drawing Center, a nonprofit exhibition space at 35 Wooster Street. "It's really a way to break open the season and not be depressed about it," she added, alluding to several recent seasons of poor business. 
 Many dealers said the block party was also an attempt to attract an audience beyond the usual art crowd. "This has become such a diminished community," said Lisa Spellman, the owner of the 303 Gallery on Greene Street. The block party, she said, is "aimed at getting people who don't normally visit art galleries, so SoHo won't seem so insular and myopic." Jay Gorney, another dealer, added, "The industry has taken a lot of bashing lately, and the block party is proof there's still life in SoHo."
The event may also make people aware of the number of galleries (now 17 in all) that have clustered around the block bounded by Wooster, Broome, Grand and Greene Streets. A majority are run by dealers in their 30's, although there are also some older, established presences like Brooke Alexander, whose Brooke Alexander Editions gallery at 476 Broome Street will open with an exhibition of work by John Baldessari, probably the best-known artist involved in tomorrow's event.
 
Indoors and Out
 Other artists include Alexis Rockman, who will show his macabre images of nature at Jay Gorney Modern Art; Lorna Simpson, whose politically acute photo-works will open at the Josh Baer Gallery at 476 Broome Street, and Raymond Pettibon, who is inaugurating the Feature Gallery's new space at 76 Greene Street. Solo debuts include those of Cheryl Donegan, a video artist, at the Elizabeth Koury Gallery, 89 Greene Street, and Jason Rhoades at David Zwirner, 43 Greene Street. Andrea Zittel (at the Andrea Rosen Gallery, 130 Prince Street), Tony Feher (at Wooster Gardens, 40 Wooster Street), Peter Nadin (at Brooke Alexander), Maureen Gallace (at the Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery, 51 Greene Street) and Stephen Westfall (at the Daniel Newburg Gallery, 43 Greene Street) are all making return engagements.
An independent curator, Simon Watson, has organized an outdoor evening of music and poetry readings from 8 to 10 in a space he calls "the lot," on the southeast corner of Broome and Wooster Streets. James Elaine, the assistant director at the Drawing Center, has organized the entertainment, which will include a folk group, the Murmurs, and Billy Basinski, a singer and saxophonist, both from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, as well as two downtown poets, Bobby Miller and Todd Colby.
"Because there will be so many people milling around on Saturday evening gallery-hopping, we thought it would be fun to also show off the downtown talent of poets and performing artists," Mr. Watson said.
Besides these galleries, at least two dozen others in SoHo are opening tomorrow, so the entire neighborhood could become one large party.
 
The Newcomers
 The SoHo gallery merry-go-round, which started this summer, continues unabated. By far the splashiest name in the group is that of John McEnroe, whose inroads into the professional side of the art world became known last winter when he went to work for the Salander O'Reilly Gallery on East 79th Street in Manhattan. Now, the tennis star is opening a by-appointment-only contemporary-art gallery on Greene Street, the John McEnroe Gallery.
Helping Mr. McEnroe run the operation is Robin Zindell, who was also at Salander O'Reilly. While Ms. Zindell declined to comment on the particulars and Mr. McEnroe was unavailable while serving as a television commentator at the United States Open in Queens this week, word in the art world is that the gallery will open in October. Whether this is a preliminary step to becoming a public gallery or just another back room resale space for blue-chip art remains to be seen.
Despite the poor market of recent years, other brave folk have decided to open galleries, despite the slump. Peter Blum, a print publisher who has been running a private gallery for prints and art books on West 10th Street since 1980, is opening a space this month at 99 Wooster Street where he will show one-of-a-kind works as well as editions and books. "I think this is a good time," he said. "There is certainly interest out there." His first show, "The Collinasca Cycle," will feature a series of 12 wood block prints by David Rabinowitch. Mr. Blum said he would continue working on print editions with artists like Louise Bourgeois, James Turrell and the Japanese artist Yukinori Yanagi.
Another newcomer is TZ'art, which opens on Sept. 28 at 28 Wooster Street. Described as a cross between a commercial gallery and an alternative space, TZ'art is run by Frederieke Sanders Taylor, formerly the director of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, Me., and Tom Zollner, the former director of Gallery Three Zero on Bond Street. The two dealers plan to hold regular six-week shows, beginning with an exhibition, "Naturalunnatural," featuring contemporary artists like Mel Chin, Carol Hepper and Eve Andree Laramee. "We see ourselves as different from the blockbuster arena of the 80's," Ms. Taylor said, adding that the gallery planned to hold lectures and panel discussions around each exhibition.
 
Keeping Their Day Jobs
 Two other new spaces are being run by dealers moonlighting from full-time jobs at established galleries. Frederick Petzel, the director of Metro Pictures, is running a gallery out of his home at 591 Broadway, between Houston and Prince Streets. It is open Tuesdays through Fridays from 2 to 8 P.M., and the shows will change every four weeks. Opening next Friday is an exhibition of six sculptures and a video by Paul Myoda, an American of Japanese descent. "I wanted a space to show younger artists," Mr. Petzel said, "ones who don't have a chance to show at bigger spaces."
More temporary is Basilico Fine Arts, run by Stefano Basilico, a co-director of the Sonnabend Gallery in SoHo. Mr. Basilico doesn't have a permanent space, for the moment, so he is working out of 21 Mercer Street, where the gallery Fiction/Nonfiction was before changing its name to Jose Freire and moving to 130 Prince Street. On Oct. 1, Mr. Basilico's temporary gallery opens with a monthlong show of work by the sculptor Michael Rees. The gallery is open Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays only, from noon to 6 P.M.
For November, Mr. Basilico plans a group show, "Ghost Limb," which will include works by Ronald Jones and Haim Steinbach (both Sonnabend artists), Matthew Antezzo and Laura Stein. While he hasn't nailed down a location for the November show, the dealer doesn't seem fazed by the peripatetic nature of his venture. "Different artists require different spaces," he said. "This way I can find the proper venue for shows."
Meanwhile, two permanent galleries will soon be found in new locations. James Danziger, the photography gallery, is moving from 415 West Broadway to a bigger space at 130 Prince Street, where the Rubenstein/ Diacono gallery abruptly closed this summer. Mr. Danziger's new gallery opens on Sept. 22 with a show of portraits taken by Judith Joy Ross at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, to be followed by "Short Stories: Celebrating 25 Years of Vogue Fashion by Grace Coddington." And Richard Anderson is moving to larger quarters, too: from 63 Thompson Street to 2,100 square feet on the second floor of 476 Broome Street, near Wooster Street. His first show, opening on Oct. 6, will be paintings and works on paper by Hugh Steers.

Wall Street Welcomes Settlement Plan on Breast Implants

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Wall Street saw good news yesterday in the possibility of a $4.75 billion settlement of the breast implant cases plaguing a number of big companies.
Shares of Corning Inc., the company that has been most hurt on Wall Street by uncertainty surrounding the litigation, rose $1.625, to $32.25, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Corning is a diversified manufacturer of industrial and consumer products and a leading operator of medical testing laboratories. Along with the Dow Chemical Company, it owns Dow Corning Inc., which was the longtime market leader in breast implants. Dow Chemical's shares edged up 12.5 cents, to $59, on the Big Board.
Shares of the two other former manufacturers of implants involved in the negotiations showed mixed results. Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 25 cents, to $57. Baxter International Inc.'s shares fell $1.125, to $21.825.
Analysts said Baxter's slump should not be attributed to the implant negotiations. The price drop continued a sharp decline that began Wednesday when the hospital supply giant, based in Deerfield, Ill., warned Wall Street that third-quarter earnings would be disappointing and announced several cost-cutting measures. Baxter is the parent company of Baxter Healthcare, a party to the settlement.
 
Ending the Uncertainty
 Wall Street's upbeat view on the breast implant settlement was probably based more on the prospect of ending the uncertainty hovering over the defendants' balance sheets than on any notion that the individual companies would benefit. All of the companies involved stressed that the negotiations had not yet approached the issue of how the $4.75 billion liability would be shared among them, their insurers, and other potential contributors, including suppliers of their manufacturing operations and the plastic surgeons who did the implants.
The impact on any company is unclear until the companies pin down when during the 30-year period covered by the settlement they would make the payments. Such a schedule is crucial in determining the financial impact because inflation makes liabilities to be paid in the future less costly than those due now.
Bristol-Myers said it was premature to make any comment on the negotiations. Corning, Dow Chemical and Baxter all said that the settlement could have a "material" effect on earnings in the quarter in which liabilities are recorded but would not affect their overall financial condition.
The Securities and Exchange Commission normally requires any unusual expense amounting to more than 10 percent of operating earnings in a quarter to be classified as material and reported separately.
Dow Corning said terms of the proposal were likely to result in a material loss in the quarter in which they are recorded and might result in a substantial impact on its overall financial condition. The latter caution was necessary because S.E.C. rules on how unusual expenses affect overall financial health are vaguer than those governing quarterly reports, said Gary Anderson, a Dow Corning spokesman.
Analysts said they were unaware of any insurance companies that would be threatened by the settlement. Exel Ltd., a Bermuda-based insurance company, has announced that it has a reserve fund for this liability.
Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr., the Federal judge overseeing the litigation in Alabama, yesterday approved a $21 million settlement of all claims against the Mentor Corporation. The settlement was reached early this year.
Mentor is the only company still making the implants. It is obligated to exit the business in 18 months under the terms of the agreement.
Approval of Mentor's settlement was announced shortly before the close of trading, sending its shares up $1 each, to $14 in Nasdaq trading.

HEADLINE: In Debate, Dinkins Ties Innis to Giuliani

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Looking past Tuesday's Democratic primary to the general election, Mayor David N. Dinkins used the first formal debate of the primary campaign last night to accuse one of his two challengers, Roy E. Innis, of being a "stalking horse" for the Republican-Liberal candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
In a wandering debate that ran from fiscal policy, to gun control, education, crime and race relations, Mr. Dinkins did his best to dismiss or ignore Mr. Innis, the national chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, and Eric Ruano Melendez, a real-estate broker and civil engineer in the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. 
 Halfway through the hourlong live debate on WABC-TV, Mr. Dinkins diverged from a question and said: "We know Roy Innis is the stalking horse for Rudolph Giuliani. We know that. They have stood together on the steps of City Hall." He added that Mr. Innis had supported Mr. Giuliani in 1989 and another Republican, President George Bush.
He later sought to discredit Mr. Innis in his closing statement by accusing his challenger of being a supporter of Idi Amin, the Uganda dictator, and of Lyndon LaRouche, a political extremist. Though Mr. Innis protested, and called out for "personal privilege of a response," he was cut off without the opportunity to answer.
But earlier, he laughed and dismissed Mr. Dinkins's move to diminish his candidacy. "This question had to come, I guess," he said chuckling, and pointed out that two other Democrats, Andrew J. Stein and Herman Badillo, had dropped from the mayoral race -- Mr. Badillo to run as comptroller on a "fusion" ticket with Mr. Giuliani.
"If there's a horse, it has to be Herman," he said. "I'm still on the Democratic ticket running for mayor. Andy Stein is gone. It's my brother David Dinkins running against me. Rudolph Giuliani is a Republican-Liberal. I'm not competing in that area. I'm competing in the Democratic primary one-on-one, mano a mano."
When one of the three panelists also said that many of Mr. Innis's positions resembled those of Mr. Giuliani, he said playfully, "Oooh, that's a low one."
The debate came five days before the Democratic primary, which in a sharp break with New York tradition, has been overshadowed by the rematch between Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani. Neither Mr. Innis, 59, nor Mr. Melendez, 45, has been able to raise enough money to mount a serious campaign against the Mayor. And until last night the candidates had appeared in a smattering of citizens forums, but never in a full-scale debate. Having accepted $1 million in public matching funds for his primary campaign, the Mayor was under some pressure to debate his challengers.
A poll of registered voters released by Quinnipiac College last week showed Mr. Dinkins the choice of 58 percent, Mr. Innis of 11 percent and Mr. Melendez, 3 percent. Political analysts say the question is not whether Mr. Dinkins will win, but by how much.
But last night's debate covered a wide range of topics that will continue to be key issues in the general election campaign, including such issues as race relations, the Mayor's handling of the 1991 racial disturbances in Crown Heights and of the 1990 black-led boycott of Korean-run grocery stores in Brooklyn.
At one point, Mr. Melendez, who repeatedly stressed his Hispanic heritage, said that he as a Hispanic was best suited to lead the city. "There is not a black person at this moment who is going to be a mayor," he said, "who is going to lead the city in the right direction. It's a lot of hate between white and black at this moment. And I think that I'm the best candidate right now because I'm in the middle." Both Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Innis are black.
Mr. Innis accused Mr. Dinkins of being "not a racial fireman but a racial arsonist" and at one point, as Mr. Giuliani has done in the past, referred to the Crown Heights violence as a "pogrom," using a Russian word that applied to violence against Jews in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Dinkins said his administration had learned from the errors of Crown Heights and had kept the city calm after the verdict in the racially charged Rodney G. King case that led to rioting in Los Angeles. "With respect to 'pogrom' I note that Roy Innis has adopted the language of the person for whom he stalks in this race," he said.
The ideological differences between the three men showed up most pointedly on issues such as gun control and education, with only Mr. Dinkins speaking out in favor of gun control and Mr. Innis ridiculing the "fourth and fifth R -- rubbers and rainbow" that have dominated the recent Board of Education debates in the city.
But Mr. Dinkins often seemed the most assured and in command of details of governance. Mr. Melendez in particular showed the signs of a political novice, rarely looking at the television camera, stumbling and asking for questions to be repeated.
Asked about the loss of jobs and whether onerous taxes contributed to it, Mr. Dinkins again sought to blame the Republican administrations in Washington for the city's fiscal problems.
Mr. Melendez said the city had to cut taxes drastically and called for 50 percent cuts over the next four years. "In the beginning, we have to suffer," he said. "But in the coming years the level of business will increase and that will create jobs."
He also said the city could boost its economy by promoting tourism, including building a casino in the Rockaways.
Mr. Innis said, "We have a business-unfriendly environment in New York City," and he called for re-examining "all kinds of taxes" to revive the city's economy.

HEADLINE: Clinton Adds to Government to Help Him Subtract

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Sept 9

 BODY:
In his first official act of "reinventing government" into a quicker, slimmer, smarter creature, President Clinton today created -- a new Government entity.
"I am going today, as soon as I finish talking, to sit down here and sign a new order to my Cabinet, to create a Community Enterprise Board from my Cabinet," Mr. Clinton told several thousand people gathered in the parking lot of an inner-city shopping center here. "Not a domestic policy group to tell people what to do, but a Community Enterprise Board." 
 A few minutes later, with the stroke of a Presidential pen, the deed was done. The Community Enterprise Board, led by Vice President Al Gore and peopled by 17 Cabinet Secretaries and Presidential assistants, joined the 1,250 commissions, committees, boards, councils and advisory groups that already sit in various nooks and corners throughout the vast enterprise of Government.
But the birth, as it turned out, may have been a trifle premature. The announcement was intended as today's example of what White House aides call a "Rego event," a public relations spectacle to build support for the White House's campaign to reinvent, that is streamline, the Government. But the explanation of the new board did not make clear what it would actually do or how it would do it. The concept, as Marla Romash, Mr. Gore's press secretary, acknowledged, is a work in progress.
The President said his announcement signaled "a new era in the relationship with the national, the state, and the local governments." But beyond that, Mr. Clinton was vague.
"What is the practical impact of all that?" he said. "It will be for us to identify neighborhoods in trouble all across America. They will say what they want done. Then my Cabinet will sit down and work together and figure out how to do it, not how to tell them to comply with our rules, but how to do what people need done at the local level."
A Presidential memorandum, issued by the White House in coordination with the speech, was only slightly more elaborate. In it, Mr. Clinton said the first task of the board would be "to assist in the successful implementation" of "empowerment zones," economically needy areas that are eligible under the 1993 budget act to receive special Federal aid.
Pressed further, Ms. Romash said the board's overall task would be to "carry the ideas of reinventing Government to the streets." It would serve, she said, as "an enforcement tool," pushing recalcitrant bureaucrats into line with the sweeping goals outlined in the National Performance Review that Mr. Gore announced on Tuesday.
But while the board's mandate is couched in grand terms, its actual design is modest. It has no enforcement powers, no staff, no statutory power to force other entities of the Government into concrete actions.
"There is no money appropriated here, no staff assigned, no physical space involved," Ms. Romash said. "The Cabinet Secretaries will rely on their own staffs."
Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and one of the architects of the new board, described it as a gathering of Cabinet Secretaries and top economic advisers that would meet once a month to coordinate ways to "force" interdepartmental cooperation between Federal agencies on problems as large as housing the homeless and as specific as a 10-square-block redevelopment program in Brooklyn."
"We've found that something like the homeless, for instance, is not solvable just as a Housing problem," he added. "You've got to bring other departments into the mix, Justice and Health and Human Services for mental health and so on."
If this sounds like a lot of work for a once-a-month group with no staff or budget, it is, Mr. Cisneros said.
But not to worry. "I didn't say there's no staff," he hastened to clarify. "I said there would be no new hiring. But my understanding is that the Vice President will take some people from his office who worked on the National Performance Review and apply them to this, and we will have some people from H.U.D. we will dedicate to different projects on this." Indeed, he said, "I think every department is going to do this, assign people to the board's projects as needed."
But, he clarified further, it would be nevertheless wrong to think that this would result in something like a new layer of bureaucracy. "This is just a way to facilitate, to coordinate, to make the departments do things together that they are incapable of doing without some direction," he said. "That should be obvious."

HEADLINE: Where Trouble Is Rare And Governing Is Easy

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SUNNYVALE, Calif., Sept. 9

 BODY:
If the Clinton Administration has its way, all of America will operate like this highly computerized, relentlessly self-evaluating city in the heart of Silicon Valley.
Like the kind of efficient and results-oriented operations the Soviet Union failed to achieve with its rigid and often-mocked five-year plans, Sunnyvale's city departments work to meet precisely calculated goals, with the lure of a 10 percent bonus for managers who exceed their targets. 
 By all accounts, the system is working. While the rest of California's economy is foundering, this city has avoided tax increases and municipal layoffs while improving the quality and lowering the costs of public services.
For example, the city promises to remove graffiti in parks or public buildings within two days. It processes building permits within 24 hours. It sets goals for the numbers of miles traveled by city traffic each year without an accident.
 
Administration Recognition
 On Friday, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore will come here to draw attention to the city of 120,000 that was a model for their plan, presented this week in an effort to streamline government by making it work better and waste less.
The question is whether the huge and unwieldy Federal Government can succeed where the Soviets failed in operating Sunnyvale-style. Here the mantras are "performance-based budgeting" and "results-oriented management," with a network of computers watching in the background.
 
Cautionary Voices

Even the program's boosters, like David Osborne, co-author of "Reinventing Government" (Addison-Wesley, 1992), which serves as a blueprint for the Administration's plan, cautions that it calls for a philosophical shift in governing that will not be easy.
"This is going to be a long, tough slog, even if Congress cooperates," Mr. Osborne said.
Or as City Councilman Larry Stone told The Mercury News in neighboring San Jose: "I fear that people are going to expect that you can take the Sunnyvale model, apply it to the Federal Government, and, zappo! Overnight success. That's not going to happen."
Some residents point out that this is an affluent city with a minimum of the kinds of economic and social ailments that hobble many communities. The city's operating budget this year is $119 million, and projected revenue from taxes, permits, rents and other sources is $149 million. The surplus will go for a variety of projects, including water and parks improvements.
The overwhelmingly white, mostly Democratic city has a median family income of about $53,000. Fewer than 6,000 families were listed as living in poverty.
In this well-tended city with broad green lawns, an elegant community center, a gigantic library and ample parking everywhere, the government seems almost as unobtrusive as the computers that monitor it.
The Sunnyvale model begins with a thorough analysis of the goals of every department and every one of the city's 750 employees. These goals are broken down into "units," which form the basis for departmental targets and are the raw data for the computerized analyses of government operations.
From 1985 to 1990, according to Mr. Osborne's book, as a result of constant re-evaluation and refining of government operations, the cost per unit of city services of all kinds dropped by 20 percent. In 1990 the city's staff was leaner than those of similar cities by 35 to 40 percent, and employees earned more, while the budget was smaller than most and taxes were lower. At the same time Sunnyvale managed to spend $5,200 for each schoolchild, compared with $4,500 in nearby San Francisco.
Long-range planning is another key to the Sunnyvale model, said David Vossbrink, the city's community relations officer. Annual budgets are calculated using 10-year projections, and these are constantly revised, serving as what he called an early-warning signal for fiscal problems ahead.
If, for example, police response time on emergency calls begins to fall, the city can analyze whether an increase in the numbers of calls or other factors are to blame.

 A Federally sponsored experiment in managing emergency service operations in Sunnyvale about 20 years ago was the seed from which the city's governing style evolved, Mr. Vossbrink said. In an approach that is typical of government operations, from road repair to library services to refuse recycling, he said, the police pledge to respond to 90 percent of emergency calls within five to six minutes.
"The budget has hundreds of examples of such specific service targets," Mr. Vossbrink said. "Our operations are measurable. Managers are held accountable. If they do not meet these goals, explanations are necessary."
Mr. Vossbrink said most of the city's department managers had earned 10 percent bonuses.
One of them is Beverly J. Simmons, director of libraries and information services, who two years took on the added responsibility of heading the city's Information Management Services Department. In the library, operations had been streamlined by automation and had absorbed a 50 percent increase in public use without additional hiring.
Now Ms. Simmons also oversees the production of the computerized analyses of all the other city departments. The four-inch-thick budget that results is a portrait of government services as painted in computer-digestible "units."
For the library, according to the budget printout, a unit can be a borrowed book returned. For the Human Services Department, a proposal evaluated. For the Fire Department, a rescue. Ms. Simmons emphasized that these units were "proxy measurements" for analytical use that were not intended to cover every action of city workers. And she said pains were taken to assure that the paperwork did not become an end in itself, as it did in the Soviet system.

HEADLINE: Germany, Heeding Appeals, Lowers 2 Rates

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Germany's central bank, widely blamed for Europe's monetary chaos and deepening economic recession, went some way toward appeasing its many critics today by lowering its two influential interest rates by half a percentage point each.
The Bundesbank cut its discount rate, which is the cheapest rate for loans to commercial banks, to 6.25 percent from 6.75 percent and it lowered its Lombard rate, the rate for lending emergency funds to banks, to 7.25 percent from 7.75 percent 
 Central banks in Belgium, Italy, Spain and Austria immediately followed the German lead by cutting their main interest rates. France left its key intervention rate, which acts as a floor on money market rates, unchanged at 6.75 percent, but cut its 5-to-10-day lending rate to 7.75 percent from 10 percent
These reductions should help encourage a long-awaited European economic recovery, which is, however, not expected to materialize until next year.
The German central bank said the long-awaited cuts were justified by indications that inflationary pressure in Germany was easing. Concerns over inflation -- which are particularly deep-rooted in Germany because of the trauma of hyperinflation under the Weimar Republic more than 60 years ago -- have been the main reason advanced by the Bundesbank for its reluctance to lower rates more quickly.
 
 
Signs of Diminishing Inflation
 "There have recently been signs of a gradual easing of price increases," the bank said in a statement. Inflation has stabilized in recent months and stood at 4.2 percent in August -- still about double the Bundesbank's medium-term target.
The German rate cuts came six weeks after the Bundesbank precipitated the collapse of the European Monetary System by declining to reduce its discount rate, which effectively sets a floor for loan rates, ahead of its August vacation.
After its decision, the narrow bands under which European currencies had been allowed to fluctuate since 1979 were sharply relaxed and a 15 percent fluctuation margin introduced. In effect, European currencies are now floating.
High German rates, attracting investors to the mark, have placed an acute strain on European economies over the last year by obliging other central banks to apply rates competitive with the Bundesbank's. They have had to follow this policy at a time when many economists argued that a lingering European recession and soaring unemployment necessitated the sort of sharp rate cuts that helped the United States emerge from its last recession.
The German Government, which has repeatedly countered appeals from the United States and its European neighbors for lower rates by pointing to the fact that the Bundesbank is an independent authority, welcomed the cut.
 
A Helping Hand
 "The decision will help to strengthen resurgent powers in the economy that have already become more apparent," Economics Minister Gunter Rexrodt said in a statement.
Finance Minister Theo Waigel went further, suggesting that the Bundesbank was at last extending a helping hand to neighboring countries. "With this decision the Bundesbank is supporting efforts to restore economic growth within and outside Germany," he said.
This week, the Government said that German gross domestic product grew five-tenths of a percent in the second quarter, the first growth since the first quarter of 1992. Because Germany is the world's third-largest economy and by far the largest in Europe, its recovery from the strains created by unification is widely regarded as essential to any wider resurgence of economic activity in Europe.
The discount and Lombard rates have now fallen a total of 2.5 percent since their peak in August 1992. But the reduction has been far slower than Germany's European Community partners had hoped.
 
Stocks Discount Move
 Stock markets in France and Germany, which have soared to record levels in recent months on expectations of lower rates and of a European recovery next year, fell today. Analysts said the German cuts had apparently been discounted. Moreover, they said, no further cuts are expected for some time.
Lower interest rates tend to push investors toward the stock market in search of higher returns. They also tend to spur corporate activity, leading to improved results that should be reflected in higher stock prices.

HEADLINE: Insurers Face Up to Reality on Real Estate Assets

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
When Travelers sold $643 million in real estate to a partnership headed by George Soros two days ago, a little wave of excitement washed over the insurance industry.
Travelers is not alone: The Equitable Companies sold $393 million of real estate in the first six months of this year, almost twice what the company sold in all 1992. The Prudential Insurance Company of America is getting ready to sell up to $700 million of real estate, company officials say. 
 These sales, and others like them, represent a new chapter in the insurance industry's attempts to clean up its collective bottom line, an effort that is being speeded by a new set of regulations that penalize insurers for holding many kinds of real estate and threaten regulatory action if the companies fail to deal with their problem properties and mortgages.
 
New Rules, New Buyers
 While it has been clear for some time that insurers' real estate problems match or even surpass the anguish suffered by the nation's big banks over real estate, many companies that have been unwilling or unable to sell are being pushed in that direction by the new rules. The sales are being further encouraged by another change: the appearance of willing buyers of distressed real estate.
"It's the beginning of a slow-motion shakeout of some of the major players," said Dennis Yeskey, a principal at the accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal & Company who specializes in the insurance industry's real estate assets. "It's happening slowly, but it will accelerate soon because of the new rules."
Insurance companies have $206.7 billion in commercial property loans outstanding, of which $12.7 billion are classified as delinquent, according to the American Council of Life Insurance, a Washington-based industry group. Delinquency rates fell in the second quarter to an average of 6.14 percent, down from 6.86 percent in the first quarter, the council said, but the picture is not all rosy.
Restructurings, which are usually carried out because the borrower cannot pay, were up to 8.32 percent of all commercial loans, from 7.57 percent in the preceding quarter and 5.83 percent in the similar quarter a year earlier, the council said. Foreclosures by life and health insurers in 1992 were up 39.6 percent over the 1991 numbers, according to figures collected by Weiss Research of West Palm Beach, Fla.
While the crash in real estate that followed the overbuilding in the 1980's has already caused an enormous amount of pain at savings and loan institutions and banks, insurance analysts say most companies have yet to disclose the depth of their problems. Exceptions include well-known cases like the Newark-based Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, which was taken over by New Jersey in 1991 after it became insolvent with a portfolio that showed real estate holdings making up a startling 63 percent of its assets.
Many insurers have not been hurt by their strategy of holding real estate and hoping that values come back. But Mr. Yeskey and others say the new nationwide regulatory standards that were adopted in December by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners attach penalties to problem real estate. The rules, known as risk-based capital requirements, require life and health insurers to calculate how much money they need to offset the risks from their assets and operations.
The system assigns the highest risk, and therefore the highest capital requirements, to common stock and to junk bonds, which life insurance companies generally do not hold in great quantities, and to mortgages that are delinquent or in foreclosure. Beyond that, high risk is assigned to any kind of real estate -- foreclosed, investment property or even company-occupied. The least risky assets are investment-grade bonds and performing mortgages. Thus the rules in effect encourage insurance companies to sell real estate or accumulate extra capital to show that they have enough money to cope with risks. The risk-based capital formula must be computed by the end of the year.
Peter Harrington, the spokesman for the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company, foresees a move toward sales. "Under the risk-based capital rules, you really get your clock cleaned for investing in real estate," he said.
Many insurance company officials say the new rules will not prompt them to sell unless sales make economic sense, but they also say they expect the rules to affect their competitors' real estate decisions.
At Prudential, John J. Divers, senior vice president and controller of the Prudential Realty Group, said the company's portfolio of foreclosed real estate had risen to around $800 million at midyear, from $543 million at the end of 1992 and $275 million at the end of 1991. Prudential's mortgage and real estate investments total about 32 percent of the company's $108.3 billion in invested assets.
While Prudential is planning a bulk sale, Mr. Divers said: "Our strategy was to lower the level of equity real estate even before the regulations. If we think an investment is good regardless of the risk-based capital requirement, we will hold onto it."
 
'Some Haircuts'
 At Equitable, one of the most active real estate lenders in the life insurance industry, Jerry de St. Paer, the chief financial officer, said, "Yes, there are some haircuts to take" on the risk-based capital rules in real estate. Despite other companies' bulk sales, he said: "We've watched what other people are doing with interest, but we have made a conscious policy not to pursue that strategy. We will lighten our percentage of real estate as economic opportunities present themselves and only that way."
Equitable has a real estate portfolio of $11.7 billion, representing 39.8 percent of its general account assets.
At New England Mutual, mortgages and real estate accounted for 39 percent of assets at the end of 1992, down from 47 percent in 1987 but still above the industry average, which Mr. Harrington said is about 30 percent but which is almost certainly shrinking. He said that the mortgage portfolio had been reduced, but that it had been difficult to bring down the percentage of real estate holdings because sales have been sluggish while foreclosures have continued.
And, while he said that New England plans "to continue to sell property where it makes sense," he added: "It's very hard to bring down your real estate equity in the market unless you engage in a fire sale."
While the New England, like many other companies, is writing no new loans, Principal Mutual, a Des Moines insurer, is picking up the slack. Principal Mutual has $9.1 billion in real estate and mortgages, for a total of 31 percent of assets, with about 50 percent of that in warehouse loans and just 30 percent in the very hard-hit office building market.
Craig R. Barnes, second vice president for commercial real estate at the Principal Financial Group, said the company had about $1 billion in new real estate loan commitments that were not yet on the books. "We think the risk-return opportunities in the mortgage asset class today are as strong as they've ever been," he said.
Another big real estate investor is the Travelers Corporation, which had a $12.7 billion portfolio of mortgages and real estate at the end of June, about 32 percent of its total invested assets. With the Soros sale, Travelers said, the company is left with $4.3 billion in foreclosed real estate and underperforming assets.
 
Willing Customers
 Robert W. Crispin, chief investment officer of Travelers, pointed out that a big factor in the sale was finding a willing buyer. More and more buyers are showing interest in buying distressed real estate. "We believe that liquidity exists in the market," Mr. Crispin said, "and we would like to continue to try to take advantage of it. Therefore you can expect to see additional dispositions."
This process of finding a buyer who gives a price the seller can accept has also affected the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. Kenneth Levine, chief investment officer, said the company was not planning to sell anything right now but "that could change at any minute."
Mr. Levine said Mutual of New York had entertained presentations from investment bankers who offered to sell real estate and said they had buyers, but he said the company had decided not to sell because "the prices weren't what we wanted."
The regulations have not only caused insurers to look hard at their real estate portfolios but have also raised a debate among industry executives. While few say the rules are bad, some question the process.
"One of the concerns I would have about the whole risk-based capital process is that our customers and our regulators and even ourselves may begin to look at and manage our companies based on how our R.B.C. formula may be generated," Mr. Barnes of Principal said.
Some industry analysts, on the other hand, say the formula is lacking. Martin D. Weiss, president of Weiss Research, pointed out that size was important: a larger company can diversify its risk more effectively than a smaller one. Also, he said, the risk-based capital number does not show trends over time, but rather a snapshot that would not demonstrate things like too-rapid expansion.
Mark Puccia, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's, said the new rules do not collect enough information. Problem mortgages, for example, are described as those that are 90 days past due, he said, but S.& P. uses a 30-day past-due standard. Further, he said, mortgages that are modified because the borrower cannot pay are not tracked.
Mr. Yeskey, the expert in real estate accounting, said he expected the rules to have effects more far-reaching than just sales of real estate by insurance companies. He predicted that there would be more capital-raising by companies like Travelers; more moves by shareholder-owned mutual companies to go public, as Equitable did last year, and more mergers of smaller, poorer companies with bigger, richer ones.
"I don't believe you are going to see huge insolvencies," he said. "I think you'll see many companies that are on the edge right now, but I don't think they're going to drown."

HEADLINE: Rohatyn to Leave City Watchdog Post

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker who helped engineer New York City's recovery from the brink of bankruptcy 18 years ago and has played Cassandra to free-spending public officials ever since, has submitted his resignation as chairman of the state board that oversees the city's finances and borrows money on its behalf.
Mr. Rohatyn's resignation from the panel, the Municipal Assistance Corporation, came in a letter to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, and he took the step on the eve of today's meeting, at which Mayor David N. Dinkins's $30 billion budget for 1993-94 will be reviewed. The agency's board is expected to pronounce the budget balanced, but repeat its periodic reservations about looming deficits. 
 Barring an unexpected change of heart, his resignation will bring to a somewhat anticlimactic end an unusual stint of public service in which Mr. Rohatyn, an unelected private businessman, loomed large over the city's finances and politics.
 
18 Years Is Long Enough
 Three years ago, after a spat with municipal labor leaders, Mr. Rohatyn announced his intention to resign, but was persuaded by Mr. Cuomo not to relinquish the chairmanship. Yesterday, Mr. Rohatyn, 65 years old, declined to comment publicly, but his message to Mr. Cuomo, who appoints the nine-member board, appeared to be unequivocal. There is never a perfect time to step aside, he suggested, but 18 years is long enough and the agency might now be better served by a chairman who -- as Mr. Rohatyn has put it in the past -- still harbors illusions about what is possible in government.
He also suggested that announcing his resignation before the mayoral election makes sense. Mr. Rohatyn has endorsed Mr. Dinkins for a second term. He reasoned that to resign after the November election, if Mr. Dinkins won, might suggest that his endorsement had been disingenuous. If Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, defeated Mr. Dinkins, a resignation then might imply that Mr. Rohatyn was unable to work constructively with Mr. Dinkins's successor.
Mr. Rohatyn cited another reason: the agency board is about to be reconstituted. One member, George M. Brooker, has died; another, Robert C. Weaver, has submitted his resignation, and four new appointees recommended by the Mayor are awaiting confirmation by the State Senate.
 
To Remain an Adviser
 Mr. Cuomo said that Mr. Rohatyn would remain an adviser to the Governor. Asked to assess Mr. Rohatyn's legacy, Mr. Cuomo said: "It would be difficult to exaggerate it. He literally saved the city from bankruptcy."
Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's spokesman, said, "All of us regret that he's going."
For a private citizen, Mr. Rohatyn wielded enormous influence over municipal government, particularly in the years immediately after he was recruited from Wall Street by Gov. Hugh L. Carey when wary bankers closed the credit markets to New York City in 1975. The city's inability to borrow for operating expenses and public works threatened the solvency of the state.
More than a decade later, in 1990 and again in 1992, he remained so much the personification of fiscal stability and the embodiment of the Municipal Assistant Corporation that his very threat to resign was viewed as a verdict on the city and state's creditworthiness. His soft-spoken but unsparing warnings of fiscal doom became as routine as the city's recurring deficits.
Mr. Rohatyn (pronounced ROH-ah-tin) helped create the state-chartered Municipal Assistance Corporation to borrow on the city's behalf, then transformed the agency into a cash cow that generated upward of $3.5 billion, through surpluses and refinancing, for education, mass transit and economic development. It was an agenda that he largely set himself.
Critics sometimes assailed his approach as high-handed and questioned whether Mr. Rohatyn, as an unelected fiscal monitor, should have so large a role in determining public priorities and dispensing public funds.
As a result of his periodic criticism of city budgets and his efforts to hold sway over how the money was spent, built-in friction with one mayor after another occasionally flared into open warfare, particularly with Edward I. Koch, who said that Mr. Rohatyn was usurping mayoral prerogatives.
Few critics ever questioned Mr. Rohatyn's motives, but he often expressed frustration in understanding their criticism. "When people ask, 'Who elected Felix?' " he once said, "The answer is that the politicians did, because they needed somebody to do this."
For a glib and debonair Wall Street financier, a senior partner of Lazard Freres & Company, he forged an unusual if episodic alliance with the gritty leaders of New York's public employee unions, who also were skilled at negotiating but, in the agency's early years, were not bargaining from strength.
When he last announced his resignation, he said he hoped to fulfill a personal commitment to the city by pursuing other civic ventures, helping to advance the public-education agenda set by his wife, Elizabeth, through her roles as the vice chairwoman of Thirteen/WNET and as a trustee of the New York Public Library.

HEADLINE: Fight Vowed By Giuliani On Narcotics

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Returning to his campaign theme of a city out of control under an administration that is out of touch, Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that if elected mayor, he would crack down on small-time drug dealers, create safe zones around city schools and do away with "swirling masses of garbage" left behind by illegal vendors whom he accused of turning city streets into "vast flea markets."
Using the theme of "term of indifference," he elaborated on issues he has raised throughout the campaign and then said Mayor David N. Dinkins's nearly four years in office had been marked by "a detached reaction to the disorder that is driving the city down." 
 As a result, he said, New Yorkers' lives have become infused with "a sense of dread."
 
Angry Reaction
 His remarks, made at a speech at the Sheraton New York in midtown, immediately drew angry reaction from the Dinkins campaign. The Mayor's aides said the speech ignored steps the administration had taken -- like toughening measures against illegal street peddling. They called Mr. Giuliani's program "arrestonomics" and said the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor lacked compassion.
"Blinded by the prospect of residing in Gracie Mansion," the Dinkins campaign said in a statement, "Mr. Giuliani is unable to find anything positive in this city to talk about."
Mr. Giuliani suggested that he would step up law-enforcement efforts in such areas as arresting aggressive "squeegee" men. He also reiterated that he would push for capital punishment for major drug dealers convicted of murder.
In his third major address on city problems, he spoke at length about the daily irritations faced by most New Yorkers and criticized Mr. Dinkins as a Mayor "who to this day has said nothing of what he is going to do differently than what he is doing today."
In Mr. Giuliani's earlier speeches he had touched on the city's economic problems and on its educational failures. As in those speeches, however, Mr. Giuliani yesterday was more thorough in detailing problems than in offering answers. He skirted some of the more difficult and costly social issues facing the next city administration, choosing to speak only briefly on the problems of homelessness, for example, to emphasize instead a vision of a city with raised morale and a higher set of standards.
Praising the Cuomo Commission report on homelessness, he said the city should be "steering people to the correct programs in the not-for-profit, private, religious sector."
Under Mayor Dinkins, he said mockingly, "the commission did the report -- then a panel was appointed to study what the commission had already recommended." Then, he said, the Mayor "seized on the one point of the report that I guess to his administration made sense, a new agency."
 
To Follow Recommendations
 Mr. Giuliani said he would immediately follow the recommendations of the report. "I just need the people I appoint to government to implement what has to be done," he said. "And we will start on Day One."
Mr. Giuliani did not say a word about what those programs would cost or precisely how they would be structured. Nor did he say whether new programs would be needed. He also said nothing about the ticklish question of local resistance to homeless shelters and services, a problem that has scuttled several major projects in the past. He spoke of "mutual obligations" borne by the homeless, like participation in drug treatment programs.
The Dinkins campaign said Mr. Giuliani was out of touch. It said the administration has already moved toward using nonprofit organizations to deal with the homeless.
As a general campaign strategy, Mr. Giuliani has used these addresses to reiterate city failures and elaborate on continuing campaign themes. Yesterday he made more promises than usual.
Among them were these:
*To sign an executive order on Jan. 1, 1994, that would instruct the police to arrest any person selling or buying drugs on city streets.
*To shift responsibility for school safety from the Board of Education to the city's Police Department and then charge the police with creating a two-block crime-free, drug-free zone for children entering and leaving each of the city's schools.
*To arrest panhandlers and "squeegee men" if they use intimidation and threats of bodily harm that could be legally classified as assault.
He also pledged to fine and then confiscate the goods of about 10,000 illegal vendors choking city streets and sidewalks.

HEADLINE: Stocks Halt Two-Day Slump; Dow Up 0.56

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The stock market staged a modest recovery yesterday on some good economic news, including a drop in first-time unemployment claims, ending two days of bloodletting that had knocked 45 points off the Dow Jones industrial average.
Stocks of banks, auto makers and technology companies did well. The recovery was particularly strong in the over-the-counter market, where the companies are generally smaller. 
 The Dow industrials gained a scant 0.56 point, closing at 3,589.49, but some other indexes fared better. "The Dow doesn't really tell the picture of what happened today," Stephen Van Brunt, head of trading at Nikko Securities, said.
The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks closed up a strong 6.98 at 737.71, while the American Stock Exchange composite was up 2.30, to 453.38. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.85, to 457.50.
Trading volume on the Big Board was 258.1 million shares, down from 283.1 million on Wednesday.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the number of Americans filing first-time unemployment claims last week fell to the lowest level in more than four years. In response, bond prices -- which tend to react negatively to news of an improving economy -- fell for the first time in eight sessions. The Government also reported yesterday that American companies planned to increase spending on new plants and equipment this year by 7.1 percent, which would be the biggest gain in four years.
Mr. Van Brunt said the jobless claims report offered "the first decent number we've had in a long time, although it's not confirmation that the economy's coming back." He said the bond market's decline also affected the stock market.
Robert G. Freedman, president and chief investment officer of John Hancock Mutual Funds in Boston, noted that the summer rally has been particularly strong for over-the-counter stocks, and that they were hit hard in the two days of selling. Yesterday's recovery was also stronger for the Nasdaq, Mr. Freedman said, adding that he expects more to come.
"I'm still very strong on the stock market, especially growth-oriented stocks," he said.
 
Good News for Banks
 Among the biggest gainers were bank stocks, which rose on expectations of strong third-quarter earnings and sunny assessments from several analysts. Citicorp gained 1 3/4, to 35 3/8; J. P. Morgan was up 1 3/4, to 77 5/8; Chemical Banking was up 2 1/8, to 43 1/8, and Bankers Trust was up 1 1/2, to 81 3/4.
Technology issues also rose, led by Intel, up 1 3/4, to 64 3/4, on an announcement that it would work with MCI Communications on integrating personal computers and telephones. Applied Materials, which makes wafer fabrication equipment for the semiconductor industry, gained 2 3/4, to 68, after it announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Microsoft was up 1 3/4, to 76 1/4.
Among the auto makers, Ford announced that it planned to raise its vehicle prices by an average of 2.2 percent for 1994. It closed up 1 3/8, to 52 7/8. Chrysler gained 3/4, to 43 1/2, and General Motors was up 1 1/4, to 46.
Some drug stocks also rose. The American depository receipts of Glaxo Holdings, the British pharmaceutical company, were up 1 3/8, to 19 1/2, on better-than-expected earnings.
Some gold stocks recouped losses of a few days ago, including Sunshine Mining, up 3/8, to 2 1/2; Newmont Gold, up 1 1/8, to 41, and Newmont Mining, up 1 3/8, to 46 3/4.
Airline stocks also gained, with UAL, the parent of United Airlines, up 1 5/8, to 142 5/8, and Southwest Airlines up 1 3/4, to 34 1/8. Federal Express gained 1 1/8, to 56 3/8.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
30-Year Bond Yield Jumps To 5.96% as the Rally Pauses

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
After a stunning rally that took the yields on long-term Treasury securities to their lowest levels in 25 years, the bond market paused yesterday for a bout of selling that knocked the price of the 30-year bond down almost one and a half points and sent its yield up to 5.96 percent.
But traders and analysts said this retreat was not yet a signal that the rally was over. Instead, it appeared to be just a chance for investors to catch their breath and lock in some profits. The selloff also sent short-term and intermediate rates higher. 
 "The fundamentals are still in place for lower bond yields," Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said. These fundamentals include low inflation and slow economic growth, as well as a strong demand for Treasury bonds and notes by investors seeking higher yields and by cities and towns that need them for the escrow funds used to pay off the old high interest rate debt they are refinancing.
The price of the 6.25 percent 30-year bond was down 114/32 points. The 5.96 percent yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped up from 5.86 percent Wednesday. The yield on the 10-year note climbed to 5.34 percent, from 5.22 percent, while the yield on the 2-year note ended at 3.86 percent, up from 3.74 percent.
 Yesterday's selling was not set off by anything that would disturb the positive economic backdrop for interest rates. Instead, it was started by a rumor, which was then denied, that the Clinton Administration was considering imposing a withholding tax on the interest earned by foreigners on United States securities. The rumor, which some traders said began circulating in Tokyo, apparently grew out of an announcement that Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York City, was holding a hearing on such a bill in two weeks.
The fact that a rumor of legislation, which many traders quickly dismissed as unlikely, could spark such selling is an indication of the nervousness of many traders and investors, with prices this high and yields this low. But it does not mean that the buying will not resume. "We are already starting to see buyers at these levels for two- and five-year notes," Ronald Connors, Government trading manager at Bear, Stearns & Company, said. The rumor, he said, "was just an excuse to sell."
The selling, most of which occurred in the morning, was accelerated when the Government reported the initial unemployment claims dropped by 10,000, to 316,000, last week. Market forecasters were expecting an increase, and the 316,000 level was the lowest since June 1989.
"And all of a sudden, we had a good old fashioned selloff," Mr. Connors said.
 
 
Healthy Spin
 Many traders and analysts put a healthy spin on the selloff, saying that it was a natural correction that a market needs after a big rally. In addition, with prices lower, it will give some investors who may have missed part of the price rise an opportunity to get back into the market at a lower cost.
But the spin will continue to sound good only if today's inflation report on producer prices in August is as positive as forecasters expect it too be. The fact that inflation, which was rising at a 4 percent pace earlier this year, is now up just 2.8 percent through July, is one of the main reasons that the yield on the bond fell to a 25-year low of 5.86 percent on Wednesday.
Forecasters are predicting a two-tenths of 1 percent increase in the Producer Price Index for finished goods. If the increase is much larger, then the nervousness that prompted selling on a rumor yesterday could get worse when confronted with a shift in the economic fundamentals that have been underlying the rally.
 
 
Foreign Bonds
 Bonds prices were down and yields were up in European bond markets yesterday after the German central bank cut its two key interest rate benchmarks by half a percentage point each.
In London, the yield on the 10-year gilt was up to 6.80 percent, from 6.77 percent Wednesday, while the yield on the 10-year note in Paris was up to 6.14 percent, from 6.11 percent. The French Government only made a minor cut in rates in response to German move. In Frankfurt, the price of the 10-year bond future was was down 0.13 point at 98.39.
John Beck, an assistant director at Fiduciary Trust International in London, said that there was no rally yesterday because prices had already moved higher in anticipation of an interest rate cut by the Bundesbank.
"Bond markets have been doing so well recently that it was buy on the rumor and sell on the fact," he said.
He added that the sharp selloff in the United States also probably had some impact in Europe.
As for what happens next, it is possible that markets will consolidate for a while. With this cut now history, the next move by the Bundesbank is off in the future, giving traders and investors little to focus on. There were also indications in both Germany and France that the downward trend in interest rates would continue to be slow.
But Mr. Beck added that a pause did not mean the European rally was finished. "There is not as much to look forward to in the near future," he said. "But that does not mean it's over."

HEADLINE: Capital Spending Rises While Productivity Falls

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
American companies plan to increase investment spending on new plants and equipment by 7.1 percent this year, the best showing in four years, the Government reported today.
But in a separate report, the Government said the productivity of American workers fell at a 1.3 percent annual rate from April through June, marking the first back-to-back declines in nearly three years. 
 Businesses surveyed by the Commerce Department in July and August said they would spend $585.2 billion in 1993 on erecting and modernizing buildings and factories, installing new computers and installing new equipment and machinery.
That number represented a slight upward revision from an April-May survey, which found companies planning a 6.4 percent increase in spending. If the companies' plans are realized, it will be the best showing for investment spending since an 11.4 percent jump in 1989.
 
 
Doubling Last Year's Gain
 A 7.1 percent increase would be more than double last year's increase of 3.4 percent. In 1991, when the country was pulling out of a recession, plant and equipment spending fell by eight-tenths of a percent.
The latest survey confirmed other statistics that showed business capital spending as one of the bright spots in the economy this year.
Companies, trying to meet global competition, have been quicker to increase spending on new equipment to improve productivity than to rehire laid-off workers.
Employment in the manufacturing sector has been falling steadily for most of this year. But today's report showed that manufacturers of durable goods still planned to increase investment spending by a sharp 10.4 percent this year.
 That gain was paced by a huge 39.5 percent increase in investment planned by auto makers.
 
 
Weakness in Oil and Rubber
 Manufacturers of nondurable goods -- items not expected to last at least three years -- were forecasting a 1.7 percent decline in investment this year, with the weakness led by a planned 17.1 percent drop by rubber manufacturers. Oil companies were forecasting a 3.2 percent decline in investment. Over all, manufacturers of both durable and nondurable goods planned a 3.4 percent increase, up from a 2.5 percent projection in the April-May survey.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the seasonally adjusted 1.3 percent drop in productivity -- defined as output per number of hours worked -- followed a 1.8 percent decrease from January through March. It was the first back-to-back loss since productivity fell during the final two quarters of 1990.
Productivity in both quarters this year was revised in today's report. It was estimated earlier to have fallen 1.6 percent in the first quarter and 2.5 percent in the second.
The productivity drop in the first quarter had been the first since a drop of six-tenths of a percent in the final quarter of 1990.
Bucking the overall decline, manufacturing productivity jumped 5.2 percent, including a 7.7 percent jump in factories that make long-lasting goods like automobiles and appliances. Productivity in the nondurable sector rose 1.9 percent. Total business productivity, including farming, fell 1 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent drop in the first three months.

Dollar Sinks Despite Cuts In German Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar sank against the German mark and other currencies yesterday, even though Germany's central bank cut interest rates. The long-awaited move by the Bundesbank raised expectations of an economic recovery in Germany.
In New York, the dollar fell to 1.6000 marks late yesterday from 1.6128 marks on Wednesday. It also slipped to 105.33 Japanese yen from 105.50. 
 Gold continued to bounce back a bit from Tuesday's sharp selloff. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for October delivery gained $2.90 an ounce, to $354.80.
The Bundesbank announced yesterday that it was cutting its discount rate, the cheapest rate for loans to commercial banks, to 6.25 percent from 6.75 percent, and its Lombard rate, the rate for lending emergency funds to banks, to 7.25 percent from 7.75 percent.
 
Spurs Mark Buying
 Normally, such a move might prompt a selloff in the mark, since mark-denominated investments will earn less. But instead, the rate cut spurred investors to buy marks and sell dollars.
"You're going to have better numbers coming out of Germany, and more reason to buy the mark," said Arnold Sherrer, chief trader at the Royal Bank of Canada's office in New York.
He and other traders said the lower interest rates could further stimulate Germany's economy, which appears to be emerging from recession. As confidence in the German economy rises, investors will probably buy more marks because investment opportunities in Germany will increase. That makes the mark more valuable.
At the same time, prospects for a strong American recovery appear to be slipping after a series of weak economic data released recently, they said.
"There was a 180-degree turn" in investors' expectations recently about the United States and German economies, said Angelo Evangelista, a vice president at the Bank of Boston. He said large investment funds contributed to the selloff of the dollar as they hedged their European stock and bond investments.
Central banks in Belgium, Italy, Spain and Austria also cut rates, following the Germans. European currencies rose across the board against the dollar, following the mark, the dominant European currency.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
As the gay and lesbian market grows, a boom in catalogues that are 'out, loud and proud.'

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AS more gay men and lesbians become open about their sexual identities, they are being asked to fill their recently vacated closets with merchandise from an increasing number of catalogue marketers addressing them as homosexuals.
Offerings aimed at gay men and lesbians are developing into a nascent niche in the nation's estimated $54.7 billion catalogue industry. Slick brochures with names like Made in Gay America, Proud Enterprises and Shocking Gray carry items from leather jackets and "pride" flags to K. D. Lang recordings and T-shirts bearing such slogans as "I can't even think straight." 
 "It's merchandise with a message," said Paula Xanthopoulou, who with her life partner, Wendy Reiner, operates Proud Enterprises in New York.
Sean Strub, president of the Strub Media Group of New York, which specializes in the gay and lesbian market, said: "Part of 'coming out' is self-expression. And part of self-expression in 1993 is wearing caps and T-shirts and jewelry that say who you are."
"Yet while you now can come out in North Liberty, Iowa, you can't go to the Younkers department store and find" gay- and lesbian-related products, he added. "So a lot of people come out in their mailboxes."
The catalogues typify two trends. One is the continuing segmentation of the once-mass consumer market as advertisers aim sales pitches at narrower groups for reasons of economy and efficiency.
The other is the growing appeal of an affluent, educated gay and lesbian market to consumer-product companies. For instance, the October-November issue of Out magazine will carry an Apple Computer Powerbook advertisement by BBDO Los Angeles -- the first for a high-tech marketer in a publication aimed at gay men and lesbians.
"When it comes down to the dollar, a lot of homophobia disappears," said J. Michael Boone, who publishes Made in Gay America in New York, a catalogue featuring models like Norman Korpi, the gay roommate on MTV's "The Real World," and Joseph C. Steffan, the midshipman forced to resign from the Naval Academy after acknowledging his homosexuality.
Most companies involved in the embryonic catalogue boomlet are small gay- and lesbian-owned businesses, mailing a fraction of the millions of brochures produced by the mainstream catalogue titans.
Some giants, though, are making forays into the field. Hanover Direct Inc. of Weehawken, N.J., a leading catalogue marketer with titles like International Male, Gump's and Essence by Mail, has tested H.I.M., a self-described "out, loud and proud" catalogue "where closets are for clothing." And Time Warner Inc. is selling Triangle Classics -- a series of books with gay and lesbian themes -- in fliers that accompany mailings to members of its Book-of-the-Month Club and Quality Paperback Book Club.
By coming out of the closet, gay men and lesbians identify themselves. That brings sales pitches aimed at homosexuals in the same way ads are aimed at bowlers, collectors of Coca-Cola memorabilia and dog breeders.
"The availability of mailing lists is the No. 1 most important thing to having a successful catalogue," said David Alport, publisher of Out & About, a New Haven travel newsletter for gay men and lesbians. "And now there's a growing resource of viable names for lists available in data bases." Mr. Strub estimated that about a million gay and lesbian households could be reached through various lists.
For all that, the fledgling field has its problems.
"There are people who totally freak out if they get something and they're not gay," said Mr. Strub, who has compiled a sort of reverse mailing list of almost 100,000 complainers.
And finding the right product mix can be tricky. Virtually all shy from sexually explicit merchandise because of its potentially offensive nature (or, more practically, because hundreds of established mail-order marketers specialize in adult films and sex toys). So in most catalogues, so-called visibility items -- freedom rings, which have pink triangles and lambda symbols, "queer pride" refrigerator magnets, his and his (or hers and hers) towels -- predominate.
"But you can't fill up a closet with pink triangle T-shirts," Ms. Xanthopoulou said. She and Ms. Reiner are considering an even more narrow specialty: selling merchandise in conjunction with Stonewall 25, next year's 25th anniversary of the riots at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, which are considered the start of the gay-rights movement.
After catalogues, what? Several gay and lesbian entrepreneurs are considering home-shopping programs on local cable television systems.
That could bring a whole new meaning to the "Q" in QVC.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims at a Low

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly dropped by 10,000 last week to the lowest level in more than four years, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance totaled 316,000, down from a revised 326,000 for the week that ended on Aug. 28. The original Aug. 28 estimate was 324,000. 
 It was the lowest level of initial claims since 314,000 were filed for the week that ended June 3, 1989. Many economists had predicted before the report that claims would be up last week by about 6,000.
The less volatile four-week moving average of claims, which analysts prefer to track because it more accurately reflects the labor situation, also fell to a four-year low. The average totaled 324,250, down from 328,000 for the period that ended Aug. 28 and the lowest since the average was 322,500 for the period ended Sept. 23, 1989.

HEADLINE: Posters: Populist Art For the Collector

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
THE poster started out in life in humble circumstances. Before the age of radio and television, it was an important medium for getting a message across to the broad public, especially on the streets of large cities. The mandate was clear and simple. "They were designed specifically to appeal to people," said Jack Rennert, a poster dealer in Manhattan and the author of more than 20 books on poster art. "They had to have a graphically interesting way of grabbing your attention, otherwise they couldn't sell that beer, or fill that concert hall."
The values of simplicity and immediacy continue to attract poster collectors a century after the dynamic, colorful posters of Jules Cheret, the father of the poster, first appeared on the streets of Paris. They are a populist art form that somehow never learned to be snooty, even in the hands of masters like Pierre Bonnard, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Leonetto Cappiello, A. M. Cassandre or Alphonse Mucha. 
 "There's a wonderful egalitarian spirit about them, even those that were done by the best artists of the day," said Bret Marcus, a news producer at ABC. "It really was an art for everyman."
The prices remain reasonable. Although it is no longer possible to pick up a Toulouse-Lautrec for $300, as was the case before 1960, it is possible to buy posters by important artists for $400 or $500, a tiny fraction of the cost of paintings of comparable quality.
And the poster market is steady and sensible. When the market for paintings boomed in the early 1980's, posters showed healthy increases in value. When the painting market crashed, in the late 80's, posters, again, showed healthy increases in value.
"I must say, during this whole recession, it never occurred to us that there was a recession," said Louis Bixenman, a co-owner of Posters America, a gallery in Chelsea. "We picked up business, in fact."
Gary Fishbein, a 39-year-old jewelry designer who lives in Manhattan, is a fairly typical collector. Several years ago he walked by the Chisholm Gallery in Manhattan and saw some 1890's posters by the illustrator Sargent Kendall advertising an issue of Scribner's Magazine. The price was less than $100. He bought two. Now he has 14 posters, many of them by Edward Penfield, the art director of Harper's in the 1890's, who produced an advertising poster every month to promote the magazine.
"What drew me to them is that they were immediate and direct, but they are also very evocative, and not just stylistically," said Mr. Fishbein. "You really get a sense of what people aspired to. It's almost like looking into the heart of an era."
David Samuels, the owner of the Blue Ribbon Fish Company, a wholesaler in the Fulton Fish Market, began looking at posters after taking some optional art classes in college. Then, like virtually every poster collector, he chose his theme: fish.
His collection of 30 posters includes a fish-filled Art Deco poster by Cassandre for Le Prunier, a Paris restaurant, and a 1926 poster by Jean Carlu for the Monaco Aquarium, featuring a simplified, almost childlike rendering of an ocean sunfish. Most of his posters cost less than $1,000, although the Cassandre is now worth about $45,000.
Mr. Samuels is picky. He does not like posters showing fishermen, especially fishermen holding up huge salmon. "I sell five tons of salmon a day, so I'm not interested," he said. "I have an interest in fish for eating, so I tend toward restaurant posters or travel posters that stress the culinary aspect of fish."
Fish is an unusual category, and Mr. Samuels has been able to find some real bargains as a result. More established catgories include bicycles, motorcycles, trains, airplanes, racing cars, Shell oil advertisements, travel and the circus.
"I have people that ask for posters of feet or shoes," said Philip Williams, the owner of Philip Williams Posters in SoHo. "There's a tank collector, who actually has tanks on his farm, and now, because of the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion, I'm getting interest in war posters and airborne posters."
 
Look, Study, Learn
 Dealers and collectors have the same words of advice for beginners who want to make an acquisition: look, study and learn before buying a first poster. In this respect, New Yorkers operate at an advantage.
Twice a year, in the fall and spring, Mr. Rennert holds a poster auction in which about 500 posters are put on public view and then sold. The auction, which will be held on Nov. 14 in Manhattan after two days of public viewing, presents high-end material, with an average sale price of about $3,500. Three years ago, Toulouse-Lautrec's 1891 poster for the Moulin Rouge fetched $220,000, a record auction price for a poster.
"That sale is not an entry point," said Mr. Williams, "but it is a place to buy the catalogue, see the posters, check the prices, and see the differences in conditions."
For each auction, Mr. Rennert produces a catalogue with a photograph of each poster, accompanied by a brief description and a complete sales history. Virtually every serious collector acquires a complete set of the catalogues, which now total 16 volumes.
 
Dealers From Abroad
 Another opportunity to take a comprehensive look at the poster field is the International Vintage Poster Fair, held twice yearly at the St. Moritz Hotel in Manhattan. The event, which takes place on Oct. 30 and 31, attracts about 20 dealers from all over the world, with posters in a wide range of styles and prices.
Generally, collectors can find a poster with artistic merit, usually contemporary, for $40. In the $400 to $500 range, it is possible to buy a poster with some age and historical interest, and at $2,000 recognizable names begin to pop up, although prime examples by the finest artists run in the tens of thousands of dollars.
The would-be collector who wants a good overview of the subject runs into difficulties when it comes to reference works. There is no single book that provides a comprehensive survey of the history of the poster. Rather, books tend to concentrate on the work of a single artist, or on a specialized subject area, like bicycle posters or Swiss hotel posters.
A third way to learn is to make the rounds of the poster galleries, and to talk to the dealers. Manhattan has a good half-dozen poster galleries, each with its own specialties. La Belle Epoque Gallery concentrates on French posters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as does the Park South Gallery at Carnegie Hall. Posters America specializes in avant-garde posters of the 1920's to the 40's, while Meehan Military Posters, as the name suggests, is devoted to recruiting and propaganda posters of the two world wars.
 
Posters vs. Prints
 Collectors who are familiar with the print market often make a fundamental error about posters. They assume that because posters were printed in the tens of thousands they are less rare than, say, a signed and numbered run of 100 prints.
This is seldom the case. Virtually every poster in a run wound up pasted to a wall or kiosk and eventually was destroyed. When posters did survive, it was because a printer or the printer's client saved extra copies, or a collector approached either the printer or the client for copies.
The Art Nouveau poster is well represented today because Paris and London were gripped by poster fever -- affichomanie in French -- in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Europe, especially Paris, abounded in dealers, collectors and printed references works and magazines.
The fever cooled after World War I, and as a result, an Art Deco poster from 1930 can be a rarer find than a poster from 1895.
In general, value depends on the rarity of the piece, the reputation of the artist and the artistic merits of the poster. Condition is an important factor, and most dealers, following the practice of Mr. Rennert's auction catalogues, will refer to a poster's condition as being between A (very fine) and D (bad). If a poster is rare enough, rarity will outweigh condition in establishing a price.
 
Star Power
 The major exception is American film posters, a category in which value is determined by the popularity of the star and the film rather than graphic quality. The poster for "Casablanca" is not an artistic triumph, but it will fetch $20,000.
Some dealers find this annoying. "The guy who would pay $20,000 for the 'Casablanca' poster would pay $35,000 for the shoes Humphrey Bogart wore during the filming," said Mr. Rennert.
For those who share Mr. Rennert's feelings, there are dealers who ferret out European and Latin American posters of American films. The Chisolm Prats Gallery in Chelsea currently is devoting one of its two front windows to a display of foreign posters of Elizabeth Taylor movies.
Some collectors proceed methodically, cultivating a network of dealers they trust, staking out a subject area and then acquiring, step by step. The tennis star Ivan Lendl decided he liked the work of Alphonse Mucha, a fellow Czech, and set about building a major collection of the artist's work.
Marvin R. Shanken, the president of Shanken Communications, the publisher of the Wine Spectator and the Cigar Aficionado magazines, began collecting turn-of-the-century Champagne and liqueur posters. In the past 10 years, he has built one of the world's top collections of Art Nouveau posters, totaling 1,000 works.
The prize is an 1899 poster by Jacques Villon for the American bar at a Paris cafe called Le Grillon (The Cricket). The poster, which shows an angular, vampirish-looking patron of the bar, glass in hand, hangs in Mr. Shanken's office next to a celebrated poster of the cancan dancer Jane Avril by Toulouse-Lautrec.
"Much as I like the Lautrec, I could live without it," said Mr. Shanken, who bought the Villon at auction in 1989 for $75,000. He was prepared to pay $300,000. "It was a sickness," he said. "I had to have an assistant walk me around the block several times before the auction so I could calm down. I mean, if I hadn't gotten that poster, I might have killed myself."
 
Leisurely Approach
 Other collectors proceed in more leisurely fashion. Mr. Marcus, for example, bought his first poster in the mid-70's to fill space on a blank apartment wall. "I was ready to move up from first-apartment art but didn't have money for really serious art," he said. Like many first-time buyers, he gravitated to Art Nouveau.
About eight years ago, however, he began collecting posters of the British railways and the London underground, but he has made room for a couple of bicycle posters as well.
"My collection has certainly increased a lot in value, but that's not why I put it together," he said. "You have to love the art."
The art still lives, although radio and then television dealt the poster a powerful blow.
 
Bargain Hunting
 Collectors looking for bargains can find them in the contemporary market. "For a really good contemporary poster, a couple of thousand would be the top in the postwar period," said Susan Reinhold, the co-owner of the Reinhold-Brown Gallery in Manhattan. "As little as $50 can buy a very good poster."
The gallery recently mounted a show of posters by the Swiss designers Siegfried Odermatt and Rosemary Tissi, who created a limited-edition poster for the exhibition that sold for $75.
Bannin & Associates has posters by the German Conceptual artist Joseph Beuys for as little as $150.
"There are interesting things as cheap as $40 or $50," said Mr. Williams, "and I've got lots of things at $15 or $20."
A persisent collector can do even better. Mr. Rennert, who started out collecting advertising posters for Levy's rye bread, always keeps an eye out for an arresting image in the subway, or plastered on plywood at a construction site. If he finds one, he'll look for the name of the printer, the artist or the advertising agency on the poster and make a few inquiries.
"Usually, they'll give you a couple of copies for free just to get rid of you," he said. "It's all well and good to collect posters from the turn of the century and the 20's and 30's," he added, "but at the same time you ought to look around you."

Owners Approve Realignment Of Divisions

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Barring a breakdown in negotiations with the union over the players' share of playoff money, major league baseball will sport a new look for 1994: three divisions in each league and a new round of playoffs in October.
The alignment of the National League remained unsettled, but the owners of both leagues voted, 27-1, today to adopt the new format and replace the two-division setup that has existed since 1969. The Texas Rangers, who don't like the three-division setup, an extra post-season round or their placement in the American League's new Western Division, cast the lone dissenting vote. 
 "We're hoping it will enhance and maintain fan interest through the end of the season," said John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, chairman of the schedule format committee.
 
'Plusses Far Outweigh Minuses'
 Asked whether the new system could hurt fan interest, Bud Selig of the Milwaukee Brewers, the acting commissioner, said: "Time will tell. We believe our research, which is ample, shows that the plusses far outweigh the minuses."
The American League alignment will have the Yankees, Baltimore, Boston, Detroit and Toronto in the East Division; Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, Milwaukee and Minnesota in the Central and California, Oakland, Seattle and Texas in the West.
The only set division in the National League is the West: Colorado, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco. Chicago, Cincinnati, Houston and St. Louis will be in the Central with one other team, and the Mets, Montreal and Philadelphia will be in the East with two other teams.
The unsettled teams are Atlanta, Florida and Pittsburgh. The Braves want to be in the East, but the Pirates won't budge from that division. At the owners' meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel today, Wayne Huizenga of the Marlins offered to have his team move to the Central. But one of the primary reasons the Braves wanted to be in the East was to develop a rivalry with the Marlins.
 
A Week to Decide
 The Marlins will most likely wind up in the Central with the Braves and the Pirates in the East, but the league has a week to decide the alignment.
During that time, too, Harrington and Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, will begin negotiations in earnest with the Players Association, which must approve the new format and new playoff round. They have had one meeting and one conference call, but they have not discussed how and what the players will be paid for the post-season games.
"We still have the matter of economics to resolve, but I'm optimistic," Harrington said.
Eugene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, who has led the negotiations, said the basis for an agreement is in place, but he added: "Obviously, we have to discuss economics and there may be some stumbling blocks there. But I don't think that will be a major problem."
 
Both Sides Optimistic
 Because advertising revenue in the new television contract will be based on the number of games played in each post-season series, the union may ask for the players' pool to include revenue from each game instead of the first four games of each series, which has been the practice.
Because more teams will be in the playoffs, the two sides will most likely have to adjust the way shares are computed for the competing teams. Despite the optimism expressed by both sides, the owners have yet to hear the players' proposal on shares.
Harrington said that once the negotiating committee reaches agreement with the union, the 28 club owners will have to approve the final deal.
To make today's vote official, the clubs had to agree unanimously to waive the provision that requires 20 days' notice for this type of matter to be acted on at an owners' quarterly meeting. The Rangers went along with the other 27 on that vote.
The resolution called for the new alignment to be used for a minimum of four years or for the length of the next collective bargaining agreement, whichever term is longer. The format also is to be based on a balanced schedule, under which each team plays two home series and two road series against each other, regardless of division.
 
Veto Right Waived
 In the two four-team divisions, teams will play only about one-fourth of their games against division opponents and the remaining three-fourths against teams in the other divisions.
The three unsettled N.L. teams waived their veto right to block realignment, meaning they will not object wherever they wind up. It seemed highly unlikely that the league would bump the Pirates from the East.
"We have mutual competitive alliances with Philadelphia, Montreal and New York," said Douglas Danforth, the Pirates' board chairman. "We feel it would negatively impact our gate and our television revenue."
Huizenga left the hotel before his offer to change divisions was disclosed, and he was not available for comment. However, his thinking very likely was similar to that of Richard Jacobs, owner of the Indians, who Wednesday agreed to switch to the Central Division and allow the Tigers to remain in the East.
The new playoff format will consist of three division champions and a wild card team, the non-championship team with the best won-loss record, in each league. In the first round, the wild-card team would play the team with the better record of the two champions not from its division.
The first round will be a three-of-five series. The first two games will be played at one site, the wild card team's park in one instance and the other determined by a rotation system. The last three games will be played at the opposing team's park.
 
TV, Radio Pacts Approved
 Major league club owners approved a six-year, $255 million cable deal with ESPN and a six-year, $50.5 milliondeal with CBS Radio.
The agreement with ESPN, down from four years for $403 million, calls for a reduction in games from 175 to about 75. The schedule provides for Wednesday night doubleheaders and Sunday night single games. It adds a Sunday night game as the season opener, ahead of the usual Monday openers. That game next season will be scheduled for April 3.

HEADLINE: Only the Multinationals Win in Free Trade Pact

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The North American Free Trade Agreement will be a disaster for this country and especially its working people if the Clinton Administration insists on supporting what is basically a flawed investment agreement. 
 The American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations believes that international trade can benefit the American economy. But we don't believe in the free trade agreement because, even with the collateral agreements negotiated by the Clinton Administration, it would undermine wages and working conditions in the United States and Canada, and do little to improve the condition of Mexican workers.
A trade agreement should recognize economic disparities, anticipate the likely human impact and advance the well-being of citizens in each country. This one does none of those.
The agreement would help United States companies invest more freely in Mexico, essentially to allow multinationals to exploit that country's cheap labor and lax environmental and safety enforcement. It is an investment agreement, not a trade agreement, that would destroy jobs and depress wages in the industrialized United States and Canada, while doing nothing to advance the poverty-level wages and living conditions paid by United States employers to workers in Mexico.
The trade agreement represents a high-risk experiment in which countries at far different stages of economic development and democratic rights attempt to merge their economies. Mexico's poverty rate is 40 percent, its unemployment rate in excess of 20 percent, and its gross domestic product a 20th of that of the United States. Average Mexican families simply cannot afford to purchase the products they make, much less buy goods made in the United States.
The North American governments agreed to address the overlooked issues of labor rights and standards and the environment only after the 2,000-page trade agreement was signed -- and only after a change in United States Presidents.
But the "side agreements" are woefully lacking. They would provide no effective remedy to protect worker rights and labor standards, in contrast to specific provisions to protect holders of patents and copyrights. The side agreements limit labor complaints to three issues -- child labor, minimum wage, and job health and safety -- effectively scuttling remedies available under United States trade laws. And they create a bureaucratic nightmare that would keep labor and environmental complaints tied up in endless consultation, with no remedy in sight.
The voices that should be heard are the people who will be most affected by this proposed treaty. They are the United States workers who will lose their jobs; the communities worried about the spread of diseases they once thought were eliminated; citizens worried about maintaining standards for food inspection and the use of toxic chemicals, and human rights activists on both sides of the border concerned about child labor and insufferable living conditions.
Instead of a government that worships at the corporate bottom line and leaves working people undefended in the jungle of the international marketplace, we are calling for a government that is on the side of the workers -- one that fights to rebuild the country's economic strength and provides fair opportunities and equal justice for all.

HEADLINE: Only the Multinationals Win in Free Trade Pact;
Commitments Lacking

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In many respects, Mexican law is more than adequate to protect workers. Child labor laws, comparable to those in the United States, are mandated by the Mexican Constitution. Mexican occupational safety and health standards for many toxic substances in the workplace (based on 1983 scientific data) are more stringent than outdated standards used in the United States (based on 1968 scientific data). But even with the best of efforts, Mexico lacks sufficient numbers of trained safety and health professionals, and the Mexican Government lacks the resources, equipment, research capacity and personnel to keep pace with its industrial base -- not to mention the expansion that the North American Free Trade Agreement would bring. 
 I have tried unsuccessfully for years, individually and with other nongovernmental, academic and public health organizations to get the most rudimentary commitment from industry to adhere to even minimal labor standards. Our supposedly most enlightened companies have refused to pledge that they will comply with Mexican laws on child labor and occupational safety and health; that they will assist with data collection and research; that they will support efforts to train more occupational physicians, nurses, industrial hygienists and other health professionals.
The sole faint response from a few companies is that they will engage in a "self-evaluation" of conditions -- all the while asserting that the working conditions at their plants in Mexico are the same as at their plants in the United States.
Many Americans and Mexicans have legitimate concerns that Mexican workers could be exploited and that competitive pressures could cause a general lowering of labor standards in the United States and Canada as well. The multinational corporations that stand to gain much by the passage of the trade agreement must not be allowed to remain silent. Even the most stringent treaty language will be of little value without a genuine commitment by the companies to insure at least minimum levels of labor standards.
Without private sector cooperation with government, universities and other entities on both sides of the border to improve employment conditions of all workers the legitimacy of the free trade agreement will be in doubt, and any aggregate economic gains it brings may not be worth the price.

AST to Build PC Factory Near Beijing

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 9

 BODY:
AST Research Inc., the fourth-largest American personal computer maker, today announced a joint venture with China to build a $16 million computer factory near Beijing that would make 100,000 PC's a year.
The deal, which will include efforts to develop China's nascent market for computers in schools and homes, could help AST solidify its position as China's best-selling computer maker. AST is so popular in China, where its PC's have been sold since 1985, that rivals promote their machines as "AST compatible" and clone makers turn out counterfeits of AST products. 
 "Establishing a leadership position in an early stage market has proved very key here," said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, a computer analyst for the International Data Corporation. "If they can do well in that country, they can do well in other countries in the region."
In addition, he said China's low labor costs could help AST remain competitive in the PC business. "This has implications for AST as a worldwide vendor."
Part of AST's strategy in Asia will be to capitalize on a recently acquired technology that permits data to be entered by pen on a screen. The Tandy Corporation's pen-based Grid system was part of a $160 million acquisition made by AST in July.
Currently, up to four keystrokes are needed to create a single Chinese character on AST machines.
"Clearly, Chinese can write far faster than they can use a keyboard," said Howard Elias, AST's marketing vice president. "We will be taking advantage of that technology."
AST stock rose 37.5 cents today, closing at $15.50 in Nasdaq trading.
AST, which was founded by three Asian immigrants, had 25 percent of China's $440 million market in 1992.
This year, International Data forecasts that 250,000 PC's will be bought in China, compared with 13.5 million in the United States, where growth is below 12 percent a year. China, the world's fastest-growing economy, will be snapping up PC's at a 22 percent annual rate through 2000.
"China represents the world's most promising market for PC's and other high-technology products," Safi U. Qureshey, AST's president, said in a statement.
AST declined to specify China's contribution to the venture. The plant will have 400 employees and open in September 1994 in a special economic zone in Tianjin, 60 miles southeast of Beijing. AST will retain 90 percent ownership.
Based in Irvine, Calif., AST had more than $1 billion in sales for the first time in 1992. In the next 12 months, China could generate 10 percent of the company's revenue, Mr. Elias said.

HEADLINE: Bulls, Bears And Us

BYLINE: By Joseph Nocera; Joseph Nocera is completing a history of personal finance in modern America.

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
Welcome to the bull market, the fifth of the century. It's been a strange one, though, hasn't it? The bond market is going crazy, the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 600 points in just over two years, yet only recently has anybody paid much attention. By contrast, the bull market that began in August 1982 was widely heralded within months of its start.
The other thing that's so different about this bull market is that it is so plainly ours. It is we -- we who make up the great body of middle-class Americans -- who started this thing, and who have been feeding it these past two years. 
 It's never happened this way before. In the 1920's bull market, and again in the early 1960's, we got played for the sucker; we were the ones leaping in just as the smart money was leaping out. Indeed, the smart money sold us its shares. By the end of the 1980's bull market, we had become major players but not the dominant ones; that was a market driven by the big institutions, and ultimately brought down by them. This time, if we get burned, we won't be able to blame the smart money.
How did the middle class gain control over the nation's financial markets? The simple answer is that for the past three years we've been pouring money into mutual funds, our preferred investment vehicle, at astonishing rates. A decade ago, the nation's mutual funds held just over $100 billion; today they're closing in on $2 trillion. A decade ago, 11 percent of households had mutual fund accounts; today 27 percent do. This is the money that is sustaining the bull market.
But the wholesale rush to mutual funds is only a symptom, the most visible manifestation of an enormous cultural change in American life over the past 20 years. During that time, we have gone from being primarily savers -- people who kept our money in the bank, accepting our federally regulated 5 1/4 percent interest with equanimity -- to being primarily investors, people who move their money from place to place, in a never-ending search for decent yield.
The change in our financial behavior was largely a response to changing economic conditions. The skyrocketing interest rates and debilitating inflation of 15 years ago -- so different from the stable economy of the 1950's -- reduced bank passbook rates to rubble. For the first time in our lives, we were forced to look around for alternatives -- places where we might get market rates of interest and protect our money from the corrosion of inflation.
At first, we found money market funds, which were run by the mutual fund companies, and which we eventually began to view as a kind of turbocharged savings account. (They even came with checks!) Over time, we found other things as well, all aimed at us: municipal bond funds, zero-coupon bonds, discount brokerages.
A kind of financial democratization was taking place: finally the middle class had access to the financial tools used by the wealthy. When Fidelity Investments opened the first municipal bond fund in 1976, it pointedly advertised the fund as a middle-class equalizer. "Municipal bonds," the brochures stated. "They're not just for the wealthy anymore." In this new world, it was only a matter of time before the stock market itself became one of the financial tools the middle class would be forced to rely on.
Now that time has arrived. Just as rising interest rates forced middle-class Americans out of old and comfortable patterns, so has the drop in interest rates completed the process. Now it's money market funds (and bank certificates of deposits) whose yields fail to satisfy, so we've turned to the market. We know there are risks -- we saw what happened in October 1987 -- but we now live in a world where middle-class Americans have to take some risks with their money, whether they want to or not. Just like the rich.
And there is the rub. The democratization of personal finance has been, by and large, a good thing. But as they say on Wall Street (and increasingly on Main Street), there is plenty of downside.
It has made American life immensely more confusing, almost paralyzingly so, as not just financial products have proliferated but financial newsletters and commentators and magazines, all shouting their conflicting advice at us. It has made us anxious; we're being forced to make decisions that will affect our future, and we feel unsure of ourselves.
It was easy being a saver. It's hard being an investor. Even the current bull market hasn't done much to ease the anxiety level. Here in my own little corner of Main Street, I get the distinct impression that people aren't having much fun in the market, even as it makes its steady gains.
Lately I've begun to ask people I know whether they're in the market. Always their answer is yes; always they've gone the mutual fund route; always they have a worried look when they talk about it. "When's the crash coming?" one woman asked me. We don't like having our hard-earned money at risk, even if the risk is paying off, as it is right now. We keep expecting the worst.
Sometimes I wonder what Charles Merrill would make of all this. The flamboyant, prescient, dominating co-founder of Merrill Lynch spent his life imploring the middle class to put "the modest sums of the thrifty" into the market. He was the first person who genuinely attempted "to bring Wall Street to Main Street" -- a phrase he coined, by the way -- and though his firm became prosperous, he did not, in the end, attain his goal. When he died in 1956, in the middle of what still ranks as the greatest bull market of the 20th century, only 6 percent of the country was in the market.
My guess is that he wouldn't be too happy. Charlie Merrill, you see, had one huge blind spot. He hated mutual funds.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
CLINTON OFFERING HEALTH PLAN WITH GUARANTEE OF COVERAGE AND CURB ON PRIVATE SPENDING

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
After seven months of secret deliberations, President Clinton has settled on a bold plan to guarantee health insurance for all Americans while vastly expanding Federal power to control private spending on medical care.
Lobbyists and lawmakers feasted on fresh details of the proposal today as they pried loose a bootleg copy of the closely guarded document on which Mr. Clinton has staked his Presidency. The document, which had been available for inspection only by key staff members on Capitol Hill, is an authoritative compilation of ideas embraced by the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who supervised development of the plan and has been selling it in Congress. [Major sections of the final draft are on page 8.] 
 The proposal is breathtaking in its sweep, its complexity and its ambition. But the financing remains murky, and the whole plan depends on extremely optimistic assumptions about the savings that can be achieved through a combination of Government regulation and free-market competition.
 
Phased in Over the Decade
 In the latest draft of his plan, Mr. Clinton says his proposal "enhances the security of the American people" by guaranteeing that they will never lose health coverage, even if they become sick or lose their jobs.
Unauthorized copies of the proposal, which is still subject to refinement, circulated today among health-care experts and news organizations, including The New York Times.
Mr. Clinton predicts that his health plan, which would be phased in over the rest of the decade, will shave $91 billion from Federal budget deficits over the next seven years, even as he tries to provide prescription drug coverage for all Americans and comprehensive health benefits for the 37 million people who are now uninsured.
Many parts of the proposal have leaked out over the last few months, but the full text became available today from lawmakers and lobbyists, just 12 days before Mr. Clinton intends to make his case to a joint session of Congress. The entire proposal is subject to approval by Congress, which is likely to insist on major changes.
 
Cutting Growth Rates
 The document describes how the Federal Government would enforce a national health-care budget by regulating the annual increase in premiums that could be charged for private health insurance. From 1994 to 2000, Mr. Clinton says, the rate of growth of private health spending would be cut in half. The annual rate of growth of Medicare, the Federal program for the elderly, would be slashed by 65 percent, while the explosive growth of Medicaid, the program for the poor, would be cut by 75 percent.
The Clinton proposal would provide more extensive coverage than most existing insurance policies, and it would require most consumers to pay a portion of the cost. The Clinton plan would cover medically necessary hospital and doctors' services, dental care for children and limited amounts of mental health care. Benefits would be expanded in the year 2000, when routine check-ups would be covered for all people.
Under the proposal, "it is the obligation of every eligible individual to enroll in a health plan," the document states.
The Clinton plan would set stringent limits on health spending. But there is no explicit allowance for the costs attributable to new technology or the increased volume and intensity of medical services -- factors that have accounted for a large share of recent increases in health spending.
The formula for computing the allowable increase in health spending would take no account of such special variables, which make health care different from food, clothing and gasoline, for example, but it would reflect inflation and population growth.
The effort to revamp the nation's health-care system has been a perennial theme in American politics for the last half-century. The groundswell of support for such change helped elect Mr. Clinton last year, but in Congress, as in the nation, there is no clear consensus in favor of specific proposals.
 
Born in Academe
 Members of Congress and hundreds of lobbyists for consumers, business, labor and the nation's vast health-care industry have begun to pick apart the Clinton plan even before he formally unveils it.
This is a proposal born in the groves of academe, not in the halls of Congress or the wards of America's hospitals. It would go far beyond correcting the flaws of the American health-care system, remaking and redesigning the system from the top down.
The heart of the Clinton plan is a proposal to establish huge consumer groups, known as regional health alliances, that would buy care from competing networks of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies.
Mr. Clinton would require employers to buy health insurance for all their workers. But for political reasons, he insists that these payments are premiums, not taxes -- a contention vehemently disputed by Republicans and many business lobbyists.
Mr. Clinton's proposal would give states broad new power to regulate and tax the health-benefit plans of the nation's biggest corporations, which have long been exempt from state regulation. Such companies could continue serving as their own insurers, but they would lose much of the discretion they now have in designing and operating health plans.
 
No Mention of Abortion
 On offering his plan to Congress, the President will urge doctors, hospitals and drug companies to limit price increases, but he has apparently not decided what the amount should be. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, would systematically monitor medical prices and spending, and she would have new authority to obtain financial data from companies, the document says.
The Clinton plan does not mention abortion, though it promises coverage of "pregnancy-related services." It says little about taxes. The document is not a concrete legislative proposal; it reads more like a report from a management consultant.
Nevertheless, the document vibrates with a sense of urgency. As part of his proposal, Mr. Clinton is seeking authority to issue dozens of emergency regulations to carry out the plan, once passed, with little or no opportunity for public comment. A 1946 law, passed to prevent a repetition of the blizzard of rule-making unleashed by the New Deal, normally guarantees the opportunity for such comment.
Here is a summary of Mr. Clinton's proposal, as described in the document sent to Congress for review this week:
 
Financing
One significant feature of the last version of the plan, prepared in early August, has been dropped: a proposal for a new Federal trust fund through which billions of dollars in private health insurance premiums would be channeled. This proposal smacked of big government and would have strengthened the hand of critics who said Mr. Clinton was imposing new taxes.
Still, the distinction between premiums and taxes is debatable. Referring to the mandatory premiums, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said in an interview: "It's a Government-imposed decrease in your take-home pay. You can call it whatever you want. I'm sure people will be glad to know they can send their money to a Government-approved insurance company, rather than to the Internal Revenue Service."
Under the latest version of the Clinton proposal, the regional health alliances would keep billions of dollars of premiums in local bank accounts and in secure investments, but would not send the money to Washington.
 
Budget
Mr. Clinton says his proposal "brings growth in health-care costs in line with growth in gross domestic product by 1997" -- a feat regarded as nearly impossible by experts on health care and economics.
Under the plan, "the Federal Government is responsible for enforcing the health-care budget" for America, the document states.
Just days after saying he wanted to streamline Government and reduce Federal regulation, Mr. Clinton now says he wants to establish a new Government agency to regulate the $900-billion-a-year health industry, which accounts for one-seventh of the nation's economy.
The proposed new agency, the National Health Board, would calculate and approve health insurance premiums for most people. Health plans would submit bids to the huge regional alliances of consumers. But if the bids exceeded the target set by the Government, the regional consumer alliance could levy a special assessment on health plans, doctors and hospitals whose bids were deemed excessive.
 
Employers
Employers would have to buy health insurance for part-time workers, just as for full-time workers. The employer's mandatory contribution is prorated, based on the assumption that a 30-hour week is full-time. Thus, for an employee who works 20 hours a week, the employer must pay two-thirds of the usual premium.
Premiums for the standard package of benefits are expected to average $4,200 for a family and $1,800 for one person. Employers would have to pick up a substantial share of the cost of health care for low-income workers now covered by Medicaid.
Companies with more than 5,000 employees may run their own health plans. But states may impose taxes and other assessments on such self-insured companies. Under a Federal law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as Erisa, companies serving as their own insurers are now generally exempt from state taxes and from regulation by state insurance commissioners.
Mark J. Ugoretz, president of the Erisa Industry Committee, a trade association of big companies, said: "I am dumbfounded. The Administration is proposing that states be permitted to levy taxes against corporate health-care plans, which will substantially increase the cost of care. It's an admission that this proposal will be costly because it relies on states to administer health-care reform."
 
Medicare and Medicaid
A state could bring Medicare beneficiaries into the large purchasing pools that would buy insurance coverage for state residents under the age of 65. But the state would have to assure the Federal Government that elderly people would not lose any benefits.
The Federal Government would increase Medicare premiums for individuals with incomes above $100,000 a year and for couples with incomes above $125,000. The premium is now $36.60 a month. The document does not specify the amount of the increase.
For a premium of $20 a month, Medicare beneficiaries could get a new benefit, covering long-term care outside a nursing home.
Most people who are now covered by Medicaid would enroll in regional health alliances, choosing from the same health plans as other citizens.
Medicaid and Medicare would no longer make special payments to hospitals serving disproportionately large numbers of low-income patients. The Administration says such payments will not be needed if all Americans have insurance. The Government would reduce the payments now made to teaching hospitals for the costs of training doctors.
 
Consumers
Every American would be required to enroll in a health plan. Every consumer would get a "unique identification number." The National Health Board would establish standards to protect the privacy of medical information in patients' records. The nation would move rapidly toward greater use of computers to keep medical records and to pay insurance claims.
Consumers would, for the first time, be able to get access to information in the National Practitioner Data Bank, which keeps track of professional misconduct and malpractice payments by doctors. The American Medical Association strongly opposes disclosure of such information, saying the data are often inaccurate.
 
States
"A state may establish a single-payer health-care system," in which the state or its representative pays standard rates to all doctors, hospitals and other suppliers of medical care. Such states might require big self-insured companies to take part in these arrangements -- a prospect opposed by many employers, who contend they can cut a better deal for their workers if they negotiate directly with doctors and hospitals.
Most care would be provided by health maintenance organizations and other health plans formed by doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. But health plans would not be able to provide insurance or medical care to regional health alliances unless the health plans had been certified by the state.
 
Transition
To protect consumers during the transition to the new system, the Administration would prohibit employers and insurers from reducing coverage for any illness, injury or treatment costing more than $5,000 a year.
The Federal Government might organize a national insurance pool to cover uninsured people until states established their own programs.
The existing health insurance program for Federal workers, sometimes described as a model for the nation, would be ended. Federal, state and local government workers would be required to get coverage through consumer purchasing groups in the areas where they live.
 
Enforcement
Under the latest version of Mr. Clinton's plan, the Secretary of Labor -- not the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Treasury Secretary -- is primarily responsible for enforcement, to make sure that employers buy coverage for their workers.
There were two reasons for this choice. If the premiums are not taxes, then the Treasury Secretary does not have to collect the money and dun delinquent employers.
Equally important, Administration officials say the White House wanted to minimize the role of the Senate Finance Committee in reviewing its proposal. This committee has authority over tax legislation, but it appears that a majority of committee members oppose the idea of a Federal mandate for employers to provide health insurance for their workers. The mandate is the bedrock of Mr. Clinton's proposal.
Mr. Clinton assumes that states will move swiftly to establish health-care programs for their citizens. Under his plan, If a state failed to act by Jan. 1, 1997, the Federal Government might impose a payroll tax on all employers in the state to finance care under a program run by Federal authorities.

Chart: "How It Would Work"
 
FOR THE CONSUMER:
 
Who Is Covered; Who Pays?
 Everyone, working or not, would have to carry health insurance and to contribute to its cost, with subsidies to help the poor. Companies would have to contribute for workers and their families; employers would pay 80 percent of the cost of premiums and workers 20 percent.
 
How Good Is The Care.
 Administration officials say the proposal would promote high quality care by collecting information about the performance of health plans, and because consumers would vote with their feet, shunning poor plans. Some critics fear that medical groups would have incentives to scrimp, or that cost controls will force medical rationing.
 
How Much Choice.
 Financial incentives would push more people into health maintenance organizations that place limits on the selection of doctors. Freedom to choose one's doctor is one of the hottest issues raised by the proposal. The White House argues that its approach would open more choices to most Americans.
 
FOR THE PROVIDER:
 
Doctors
 Constraints would have a huge effect on their professional lives. The report says insurers may still offer insurance that lets a doctor bill for each procedure. But since such plans are expected to be the most expensive, planners expect most consumers to chose from the managed care plans. If doctors want patients, they will have to join as well.
 
Hospitals
 Much of the hospital industry has already been shaken by having to get rid of excess beds and lower their costs. As hospitals foundthat they, too, had to affiliate with managed care networks, the process will certainly speed up. The draft suggests easing regulations to encourage hospital to mergers.

Insurers
 Health economists predict that a limited number of operators of medical plans will remain in every medical market supervised by an alliance. In urban areas, experts say it could be as many as 15 or more, in more rural areas, perhaps one or two. (pg. 1)

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: The Consumers;
A Benefit for Some Patients, Difficult Choices for Others

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
For the 37 million Americans who now lack health insurance, and the tens of millions more who may find themselves without it in the next few years when they lose or change jobs, the appeal of the Clinton proposal is obvious: guaranteed coverage regardless of employment status, age or illness.
But the majority of Americans who are already decently insured and happy with their own doctors may have a harder time deciding about their own prospects. 
 The Administration's goal is to reorganize the way health care is paid for and delivered so that nearly everyone would be better off. Officials say most people would pay little, if any, more than they do now in return for generous benefits and lifelong peace of mind.
 
Continuing to Have a Choice
 By bringing order and efficiency to a chaotic system, officials say, the new system would enhance the quality of care despite stringent new limits on the growth of medical spending. Americans would continue to have a wide choice of doctors and health plans, they insist.
But the heart of the Clinton strategy for holding down medical spending is to make people acutely aware of the true cost of their health care. And that may be jarring for many Americans who have long received generous benefits at work.
In the structure outlined by the White House, many people may find themselves choosing among unfamiliar new health plans and accepting new limits on their freedom to choose doctors or hospitals, or paying extra to use the system as freely as they are accustomed to.
The question remains whether the lower-cost health maintenance organizations into which many people might be pushed will offer long lines and second-class medical care, as some critics fear, or efficient, prudent, top-flight care, as officials predict.
 
How Much for Coverage?
 Under the Clinton proposal, everyone would be required to have health insurance and to contribute to its cost. All companies would be required to contribute for workers and their families, with the employers paying 80 percent of the cost of premiums and workers 20 percent.
Officials estimate that the average premium would be $1,800 a year for individuals and $4,200 for families; so an employee would pay an average of $360 for individual coverage and $840 for family coverage. The self-employed and unemployed would be responsible for the entire amount, but depending on income, could be eligible for subsidies.
Individuals and most companies would no longer directly buy their own health insurance. Instead, they would sign up with large cooperatives, or regional health alliances, which would present their members with a choice of health plans that have the same basic set of benefits. These plans would be made up of groups of doctors and hospitals, often organized by insurers.
A company employing at least 5,000 people could function as its own alliance or join the regional alliance.
The proposal envisions three basic kinds of plans. They are:
*"Low cost-sharing" plans, H.M.O.'s in which patients pay $10 per office visit to affiliated doctors.
*"High cost-sharing" plans, which allow patients the familiar freedom to visit any doctors and health centers on a fee-for-service basis, but require families to pay a deductible of $400 and 20 percent of all subsequent bills, to a maximum of $3,000 per family per year.
*"Combination" plans in which patients pay little to use affiliated doctors and more to use others.
In more populated areas, an alliance might offer several plans with varying premiums. Any patient could choose any plan; the idea is to force plans to compete for customers by offering the best price and quality.
In turn, financial incentives would be used to nudge more people into the most cost-effective H.M.O.'s. Through stiffer deductibles and co-payments consumers would pay heavily for the ability to choose any doctor -- an amount, officials say, that fairly represents the extra cost of unmanaged care.
Thus, while many Americans might be able to choose more generous plans that cost them little more than they have paid in the past, others might find themselves spending more to keep the same freedoms they have enjoyed.
 
Choices
One of the hottest issues raised by the Clinton proposal is freedom to choose one's doctor. Critics attack the plan as restricting choice, while the White House says it will be opening more choices to Americans. Both are right.
More than 41 million Americans are already in H.M.O.'s. But to the extent that more Americans feel pushed against their preference into H.M.O.'s, they will face new limits. These groups usually allow a choice of primary physician among affiliated doctors, but patients must go through this "gatekeeper" to visit specialists, who must also be in the group.
Critics raise the specter of chronically ill patients ripped from a trusted doctor. This might happen, but the chances would be reduced if virtually all doctors sign up with health plans, as the proposal envisages.
Administration officials also point out that large numbers of Americans do not now enjoy the hallowed freedom of choice. Some 37 million are uninsured and the 30 million people on Medicaid, the program for the poor, often have trouble finding decent care. And a growing number of workers are offered only a single H.M.O. by their employers.
 
Quality
Health maintenance organizations save money not only by negotiating lower fees with doctors, hospitals and other suppliers but also by scrutinizing medical decisions and discouraging wasteful, costly services.
At best, this could produce fine care and weed out useless and harmful procedures. At worst, doctors' groups and H.M.O.'s could be tempted to scrimp on costly but useful care, jeopardizing health, and on personnel and equipment, producing long waits.
Administration officials say their proposal would insure high-quality care. As they make their annual selection of health plans, consumers would vote with their feet, shunning plans that perform poorly. Equally important, according to the proposal, a national program would develop ways to measure the quality of care offered by health plans.
Annual performance reports, covering both consumer satisfaction and medical indicators for all health plans, would be made available to consumers, which officials say would create a higher level of public knowledge and accountability than now exists in the health system. But critics question how consumers can adequately compare medical performance.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: CLINTON OFFERING HEALTH PLAN WITH GUARANTEE OF COVERAGE AND CURB ON PRIVATE SPENDING;
Clinton's Roll Of the Dice

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's health care plan is imposing, not just in its intricacy and command of detail but also in its political audacity, which history may judge as courageous, or reckless.
The program would stir up and reorganize the medical business and shake up imperfect but familiar relationships, from those in family doctors' waiting rooms to those in the corridors of Congress. It would also promise security for individuals and deficit control for the country. It would try to do all this when the public's trust in the Government is near a low point and when Congress is divided by partisanship. 
 It is an enormous political undertaking. No President in decades has bet so much on a single issue. As a political gamble, it ranks with Woodrow Wilson's advocacy of the League of Nations.
 
Risk for Congress, Too
 But Mr. Clinton is risking not only his own capital but also that of Congress. By defining health care as the most important task of his Presidency, he is making the issue a crucial test for Congress, already the least-loved branch of the Government.
Congress, after all, blocked the efforts of two earlier Presidents, Harry S. Truman and Richard M. Nixon, to institute national health insurance.
There is no way to predict how this Congress will deal with this President's proposals. After all, most of its members do not have them yet. Even the 246 "privileged and confidential" pages that lawmakers and aides are being shown behind closed doors contain what the Senate majority leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, described on Thursday as preliminary conclusions. They are subject to adjustment if strongly resisted on Capitol Hill, although they have not surprised those who followed the months of development of the Clinton plan.
 
Unusually Cautious Reaction
 So far, the Congressional reaction has been remarkably tentative. Some of that must encourage Mr. Clinton, especially after the Republicans denounced his economic plan from February through August.
For example, for a meeting with Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday, Congressional Republicans put forth the blandest and mostly generalized statement of their views that they could prepare. With few exceptions they have been following the advice of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas to keep their powder dry so that they will be able to compromise and legislate in good faith.
And, indeed, the Clinton proposal reflects a number of Republican ideas, or at least ideas Republicans have found appealing. One is the attempt to control fees less by Government directive than by limiting insurance premiums, and thus making private enterprise do the price fixing.
But there is also some significant hesitance on the Democratic side. Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, worries that the Administration is overconfident about the Democrats. "They are in a fog with regards to how much enthusiasm there is for health care," he said. "They are very enthusiastic and I don't see it among the members."
Mrs. Clinton, for one, only recently abandoned the hope that a plan could be enacted this year. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said on Thursday that there was a consensus "that it will be done in this Congress" by the end of 1994. Mr. Rostenkowski is less confident. He said a few days ago: "Doing the job right is more important than doing the job. I don't know that we're going to finish the job" by next year.
 
Plenty of Obstacles
 There are plenty of obstacles, aside from important but purely local constituent concerns, like the Congressional district with an insurance company headquarters, or one with very few doctors.
Republicans worry about requiring small businesses to buy their workers insurance and about excessive controls. So do conservative Democrats. Some liberal Democrats regard the plan's reliance on private insurers as untested, needlessly complex and inefficient compared with a Government-paid system, and they are also concerned that Medicare and Medicaid will be shorted to help pay for the system.
Whether or not to pay for abortions, a word that does not appear in the 246 pages but is subsumed under "pregnancy related services," promises to incite a fierce fight that will cost a final bill votes however it turns out.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, one of the handful of veterans of earlier Congressional battles on the issue, is hopeful that debate can produce "a formulation that is acceptable, or tolerable, to all the groups." He contends that "not since Medicare was enacted in 1965 have the political constellations been so clearly in the right place for fundamental health reform."
The Massachusetts Democrat, the leading Congressional advocate of universal health care over the last quarter century, said Mr. Clinton faced a "once-in-a-generation opportunity." His own efforts and those of President Nixon failed in the 1970's because neither labor nor the medical industry felt the urgency that compels compromise. At that time, he said, health care cost only 6 percent of the gross national product, and private insurers were expanding coverage. Today, health care consumes 14 percent of the economy and much insurance coverage seems uncertain.
He said: "You have the health business as the fastest failing business in America. Its burden on families is out of sight, measured in the cost of doctors and the cost of hospitals. And its cost to American business is out of sight. Its bureaucratic nightmare to the providers is out of sight. So the major interests in the health care all demand change."
There is one very important difference in the political lineup between 1993 and the Truman Administration's effort in 1949 to combat what Mr. Truman called the real costs of inadequate health care: "the shattering of family budgets, the disruption of family life, the suffering and disabilities, the permanent physical impairments left by crippling diseases and the deaths each year of tens of thousands of persons who might have lived."
As Prof. Richard E. Neustadt, the retired Harvard scholar of the Presidency, recalled today from his days working on health care in the Truman White House, "Not one single scintilla of support did we get from the big business community in 1949." Big business, whose health costs are soaring, is one of the biggest boosters of the President's approach today.
Professor Neustadt said the President would still have a hard time winning passage and argued that the emphasis on the plan as a way to reduce the deficit might just produce popular disbelief. "The man's in an awful box," he said. "But at least he's not just sitting in it."
At any rate, he added: "It's an appropriate issue for the Democratic Administration. Nobody should be left out in this country."
Mr. Clinton campaigned on health care legislation as essential to reducing the nation's deficit and making individuals feel secure. In his inaugural address he lamented that "the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and small." Among all his campaign promises, it stood out as one the public thought he could, and would, keep.
 
Political Realities
 And the program has been structured with a serious eye on political realities, avoiding serious new taxes, stressing competition as a way to curb costs, even skirting large trouble spots by assuring labor that workers retired before 65 would not lose the coverage their union contracts now provide.
Stephen E. Ambrose, the Nixon biographer at the University of New Orleans, recalled President Wilson's failure as a comparable big issue. He said there were major political risks in the Great Society program of Lyndon B. Johnson and the variety of domestic programs Mr. Nixon planned for his second term before Watergate sank him. But each involved a variety of subjects, not just one like health care.
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Nixon, however, were taking risks in second terms, chancing history, not re-election, as Mr. Clinton is. And Mr. Johnson had an immense Congressional majority that Mr. Clinton lacks.
As Mr. Ambrose said of the President, "He is gambling everything on it, even his wife's reputation."

Clinton's Health Plan
The Administration has settled on a bold plan to guarantee health insurance for all Americans while vastly expanding Federal power to control private spending on medical care. A bootleg copy of the closely guarded proposal began to circulate. It shows a plan that is breathtaking in its sweep, complexity and ambition, but murky in its financing. [Page 1.] President Clinton's health care plan is imposing not just in its intricacy and detail, but also in its political audacity. News Analysis. [1.]
The appeal of the proposal is obvious to the 37 million Americans who lack health insurance. But Americans who are insured may have a harder time deciding about their own prospects. [1.]
The proposals could throw into fast forward trends that are already reshaping the fates of doctors, hospitals and insurers. [10.]
 
The Economy
The Producer Price Index fell 0.6 percent in August, the Government said, in a report showing surprisingly low inflation. Plunging tobacco prices were largely responsible. [37.]
 
Companies
 Paramount and Viacom may announce a merger as early as this weekend, industry executives said. The deal, estimated at $6.2 billion in stock and $1 billion in cash, would be the biggest media marriage since Time wed Warner four years ago. [35.]
Microsoft will begin charging large customers for some of the technical support it provides. [39.].
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer consolidated its top management in the wake of an executive's departure to Metpath Laboratories. [39.]
Broderbund and Random House will start a venture to produce electronic children's books to be read on personal computers. [39.]
Hundreds of women flooded lawyers with calls after Dow Corning announced a proposed settlement of implant lawsuits. [7.]
 
Markets
 Eager buyers moved back into stocks, erasing most of the week's previous losses. The Dow industrials rose 32.14, to 3,621.63, and gained 12.30 points for the week. [37.]
Bond prices surged on news of sharply lower producer prices, nearly erasing Thursday's steep losses. [46.]
Bearish economic news sent prices falling for crude oil, gold and soybeans. Oil fell to a three-year low. [48.]
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen but fell to a 14-week low against the German mark. [48.]
 
International
 Japan's Foreign Minister suggested that numerical targets for reducing Japan's trade surplus might be acceptable in Tokyo. His remarks mirror a groundswell of opinion in favor of an idea that Japan has resisted for months. [37.]
Canary Wharf administrators agreed with bank lenders on a $1.7 billion financial rescue package for the London complex of office buildings, which fell victim to the British recession and contributed to the collapse of Olympia & York. [37.]
Representative Bonior retreated from his plan to use the resources of his office, as House majority whip, against the North American Free Trade Agreement. [7.]
 
Your Money
The Administration's health care plan would provide health coverage to all, but states could not carry out the changes until 1995 at the earliest. In the interim, people who find themselves without insurance have several options. [35.]
Some financial advisers offer to buy and manage portfolios of no-load no-commission funds -- for a fee. Investing. [35.]
Bill collectors sometime cross the line from aggressive tactics to harassment. But consumers have weapons to fight back. [36.]

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: The Providers;
Changes Would Transform Worlds Of Doctors, Hospitals and Insurers

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
If the health care proposals of the Clinton Administration become law, they would throw into fast forward trends that are already reshaping the fates of doctors, hospitals and the insurance companies that pay them.
Doctors would win a victory that leading medical organizations like the American Medical Association have long sought: guaranteed insurance coverage for tens of millions of the uninsured. 
 But physicians would find that, under the plan, they would have even less autonomy than they do now. The market, under the plan, could be expected to force doctors to find patients by signing up with health care networks run by insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. Even when they treat patients who are not members of such networks, they would be required to charge them according to a schedule of fees approved by regulators for every service, the type of arrangement that has applied to Medicare and Medicaid.
The impact of the plan would probably be just as great on the hospital industry. As hospitals and treatment centers are drawn into managed care networks, they, too, would be put under ever-growing pressure to cut costs. Experts say the Clinton program would probably speed the pace at which such institutions are already shutting down wards, merging with other hospitals or closing their doors.
In addition, the plan says teaching hospitals would be forced to stop turning out so many highly paid specialists and to redirect their efforts to training lower-paid, primary-care physicians. And the plan is expected to bring changes in the medical marketplace that would force a significant number of specialists to retrain.
Some of the most drastic changes, however, would be seen in the health insurance industry. Most of the nation's 500 or so health insurers are expected to be driven out of the field, and among the likely beneficiaries would be the five giants of industry -- Prudential, Cigna, Aetna, Travelers, and Metropolitan Life -- as well as the more than than 70 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
The draft proposal offers a bit of relief to insurance companies that sell workers compensation and automobile insurance. The Clinton plan would merge the $40 billion in medical coverage now offered by workers compensation and automobile policies into standard health care plans. But it assures property-casualty insurance companies that now sell such coverage that they will be allowed to stay in those lines of business by providing their coverage through the alliances.
What ties together the future of all sorts of medical providers, doctors, hospitals, health maintenance organizations, pharmacies and laboratories, is the requirement under the Clinton plan that Americans receive their health coverage through the yet-to-be-created purchasing groups.
These health alliances, region by region, perhaps metropolitan area by metropolitan area, will tell insurers and health maintenance organizations what minimum requirements they must meet before they will be allowed to offer coverage to the public.
 
Doctors
By assuring that all Americans have complete medical insurance coverage, the Government is guaranteeing that millions more patients and tens of billions more dollars will flow into doctors offices. In addition, by permitting the 30 million people who are now covered by Medicaid to be covered by the alliances, the Clinton Administration would create legions of patients who are suddenly more lucrative to treat.
But the plan also spells out major constraints on doctors.
The draft report says insurers may still offer the current type of insurance that lets a doctor bill for each procedure performed. Since such plans are expected to be by far the most expensive, however, planners say the vast majority of consumers will chose managed care plans. As a result, doctors searching for patients will find themselves joining managed care plans as well.
Such plans vary greatly, but one common element for doctors is that they have to agree to work under the rules of an insurance company or a health maintenance organization that closely supervises how much care and what kind of procedures should be given.
In addition, they are often paid by a system designed to motivate doctors to think twice before they go ahead with expensive and time consuming procedures.
Under this "capitation" system, an insurer might offer a doctor a fixed fee for treating 100 patients. If the patients need less care than the average for such a group, the doctor makes more profit, but if the group needs more care than the average the expense comes from the doctors pocket.
Doctors may decide to join one or many such networks, but executives some of the nation's largest health insurance companies say that over time, they expect more and more doctors to affiliate with one network or another.
In some specialized fields that now have many practitioners in a given area, like hematologists in New York City, there may not be enough spaces in networks for all the doctors. The result may be that many such highly trained and well-paid physicians will have to retrain in a lower-paying field of primary-care medicine to be able to join a network and get patients.
 
Hospitals
Much of the nation's hospital industry has already been shaken in the past five years by the need to get rid of excess beds and lower their costs. As hospitals, too, find that they have to affiliate with managed care networks, the process will certainly speed up. The draft suggests easing regulations in an effort to encourage hospitals to merge.
Another section of the report suggests a five-year phase-in period in which academic hospitals would try to decrease the number of specialists they train. The goal would be to increase the proportion of primary-care physicians they train to 50 percent of the new doctors. The plan suggests achieving that goal by reducing the financing of specialty training programs.
But Dr. William T. Speck, the president and chief executive officer of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, said last night that changing the financing of residency programs alone would not be enough. He said the average medical student graduates with tens of thousands of dollars of debt and would not be attracted to lower-paying fields.
"There is now not enough incentive to bring doctors into primary care," he said.
 
Insurers
For the nation's $300 billion health insurance industry the future is one of transformation.
The vast majority of the hundreds of health insurance companies in the United States offer the old-fashioned fee-for-service plans. Those plans are already losing customers to managed care networks, and under the alliance system, economists say, most would have to leave the business entirely.
What would remain, health economists predict, would be a limited number of H.M.O.'s, insurance health plans and similar networks run by doctors and hospitals in every medical market supervised by an alliance. In urban areas, experts say, it could be as many as 15 or more, in more rural areas, perhaps one or two.
Those most likely to survive and flourish are networks that signed up physicians, hospitals and other providers early.
In dozens of markets many local H.M.O.'s and groups of hospitals or physicians have banded together to form networks of their own and many of these smaller players may grow in their individual markets under the Clinton plan. In addition, analysts say some multistate H.M.O.'s like Kaiser Permanente, and U.S. Healthcare are well positioned to grow under the Clinton plan.
But experts say that among insurance companies the five biggest players, led by Cigna and Prudential, are most likely to flourish nationally.
Each of them, along with Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, have made large capital investments and already signed up large numbers of doctors and hospitals in dozens of markets around the country. Their market share, analysts say, appears destined to grow if the Clinton plan passes.
Not surprisingly, the five biggest insurers have broken away from their smaller competitors, to form a insurance lobbying group in Washington that is working for the Administration's proposals.

HEADLINE: Parents Scramble for Day Care in Asbestos Delay

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
With New York City's public schools closed, the Stewart sisters -- Alexandria, 11,; Vanessa, 9, and Amber, 6 -- stayed home alone much of this week and will again next week while their working mother hustles off to the office.
Patricia Stewart couldn't afford a baby sitter, so her daughters have passed the last days of summer since camp ended by acting in make-believe plays on the stage of their Washington Heights living room, usually with only an imaginary audience to applaud them. Their original production of "Two Princess Cats" typically opens with a frenzied dance of hopping, jerking and leg-flapping and unfolds with the sisters tumbling onto the green-carpeted floor like kittens. 
 But while the girls frolicked at home, their mother worried. "I call them 90,000 times a day," she said. Ms. Stewart looks to the schools to provide a safe, free haven for her children.
With more than 1,000 city schools scheduled to open Thursday still closed by inspections for exposed asbestos, a potential health hazard, parents have been scrambling. What they have found are makeshift, sometimes creative ways to look after a mind-boggling million schoolchildren who are already bored and at loose ends as summer wanes and planned activities have petered out.
 
Hired the Teacher
 Ms. Stewart's solution to the school closings was one that many working parents of limited means had to settle for. But others with money to spare had better options. Molly Fermaglich, a scriptwriter, and Laura Pologe, a molecular biologist, hired last year's public school teacher to instruct 10 neighborhood children in a sunny living-room-turned classroom in lower Manhattan. Classes would begin on Sept. 20 -- if schools don't open as promised. Parents will pay the teacher $15 a day per child for several hours of instruction.
On the Upper West Side, a group of parents are sending about 40 of their children to Ramapo Country Day Camp in Monsey, N.Y., to enjoy languid, late-summer days of swimming, arts and crafts and sports. Cost: $199 per child per week, paid by the participating parents at Public School 199.
David and Catherine Evans put their 5-year-old son, Joe, ("I'm 5 and three-quarters years old," Joe complained) on the bus to Ramapo to avoid what his mother described as "organizational hell."
"We work out of the house, so we need time," Mr. Evans said. "And Joe was eager to go back to school. It's been a pretty long summer."
But Joe said he'd choose swimming over school any day, and, with a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich packed in his bag, he was eager for the bus to leave so that he could get to the pool.
 
Range of Financing
 Still other parents have found places that would look after their children, with the city or an employer paying the bill. Jimmy Lanza, the co-op board president at Boulevard Gardens in Woodside, Queens, helped organize a day-care center in the co-op's playroom, with funds from the city's Department of Youth Services. It is one of many such programs the department is supporting.
Bankers Trust has offered its workers free child care in an improvised day care center fashioned from the employee cafeteria -- an offer snatched up by financially hard-pressed clerks and secretaries.
Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, a nonprofit group, is running Public School 194, a school in Harlem with a clean bill of health on asbestos, as a place where parents can drop off their children for the day at no charge. The city is paying to staff the program. "It helps you stop from being on the streets and stuff like that," said Teaner Arnold, an 11-year-old on the school's playground.
And Bronx Community College has arranged day care for its hundreds of students who have children. Samuel Genao, 7, has tagged along with his mother to her classes this summer. He was disappointed that school did not start on time, but relieved that his mother could drop him off at the college's child care program. "I didn't want to stick to my mother like gum," he said.
 
Hardship Varies by Income
 The delay of the schools' opening has been an aggravating inconvenience for parents who can afford baby sitters, camps and day care -- and for those lucky enough to find such services for free. It has been a headache for the 294,000 single parents on welfare, who are watching out for children in neighborhoods often infested with guns and drugs. But it has been a real hardship for working parents who are barely paying the bills.
State law does not specifically prohibit parents from leaving children of any age at home alone, but rather sets general guidelines about what conditions constitute neglect or abuse. The city's Human Resources Administration makes the decisions about abuse based on each situation.
"There is nothing in the law itself which can give you a hard and fast rule -- how old, how long," said Martin Baron, an associate general counsel with the agency. "It's a case-by-case determination."
And life, Ms. Stewart said, sometimes forces difficult choices. "But you have a whole society that has no choice because the cost of child care is astronomical," she said. "What are they going to do, put half the population of New York in jail?"
Fourteen-year-old Shawanna Boyd is forbidden to set foot out the door in the four hours that both her mother and grandmother are at work. "I call her every half-hour to make sure she's in the house," said her grandmother, Julia Boyd, a home attendant to an elderly man. "These are troublesome times in my neighborhood. We have shootings night and day. And with all the children out of school . . . " Her voice trailed off ominously. "You try to keep your teen-agers off the street."
Maria Guadalupe, an office worker in the Bronx, is paid $12,000 a year. Her mother, who has had several operations on her legs, looks after her three boys, but is too infirm to chase after them. So the children are not allowed to play outside, where their mother fears the traffic, guns or drugs could hurt them. Bored and stir-crazy, they fight all the time now, turning on their dueling radios simultaneously.
The oldest boy, Carlos, who is 11, said he is very sad to be stuck at home. He watches cartoons, scrubs the bathtub and plays Nintendo. "I only go outside to throw out the garbage," he said, sounding down-in-the-mouth.
Ms. Stewart, whose three young daughters have stayed home alone, playing Old Maid, Candyland and make believe, says she does not earn enough to pay for child care. She started leaving the girls home alone from time to time three years ago, when she separated from her husband.
"I worry about the kids, of course," she said. "I call them during the day, and they call me asking, 'Mommy, where's this? How do you cook this?' Or there's a fight and they need a mediator. Amber lost a tooth once and called me panicky. I told her to wash her mouth out. They get all excited when they see blood."
The girls went to camp for most of this summer, but that ended in mid-August. Since then, they've been home while she works as the office manager for Harlem Churches for Community Improvement. She wants the schools cleaned of asbestos, but is angry is wasn't done by the time the schools were supposed to open.
The outrage among parents of all economic stations seemed to transcend the usual cynicism about city government. State and city investigators have concluded that the asbestos inspections, as done in the last four years by the school system were so flawed as to be useless, either through incompetence or fraud.
The closed schools -- and the governmental failure they symbolize -- have not only hit many parents in the pocketbook, they have struck at something more fragile and important, their aspirations for their children. Ms. Fermaglich and her husband, Alan Levy, a public relations consultant, are the parents of 7-year-old Jenna. They had a fantasy that 100,000 parents would show up with their children on the lawn of Gracie Mansion on Thursday morning and say to the Mayor, "Here, you deal with it.
"Take my money," Mr. Levy said, "break my axles, but don't betray the trust of our children."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Excerpts From Final Draft of Health Care Overhaul Proposal

 BODY:
Following are sections of the final draft of a Clinton Administration proposal to guarantee health coverage for all Americans. The plan, being circulated on Capitol Hill, is to be unveiled on Sept. 22 in a speech by the President. The Administration's statement of the problem and its overview of the proposed American Health Security Act of 1993 appear in full below, with excerpts from the document's detail sections.
 
The Problem
All Americans, those who have health insurance and those who do not, understand that serious problems exist in the health care system: 
Americans lack security. One out of four people, or 63 million people, will lose health insurance coverage for some period during the next two years. Thirty-seven million Americans have no insurance and another 22 million lack adequate coverage.
Losing or changing a job often means losing insurance. Becoming ill or living with a chronic medical condition can mean losing insurance coverage or not being able to obtain it.
Health care costs are rising faster than other sectors of the economy. Precipitous growth in health care costs robs workers of wages, fuels the growth of the Federal budget deficit and puts affordable care out of reach for millions of Americans.
Left unchecked, rising health care costs will consume almost two-thirds of the increase in Gross Domestic Product for each American for the rest of the decade.
Health care costs will grow from 14 percent of G.D.P. to 19 percent even without an expansion of coverage to insure all Americans.
Bureaucracy overwhelms consumers and health providers. Excessive paperwork confuses and frustrates doctors, nurses, patients and their families. Bureaucracy also drives up costs. Studies document that administrative costs contribute a steeply rising portion of the expenses involved in running a typical doctor's office or hospital.
Quality is uneven. Because no clear standards define best medical practice, lack of information and inadequate attention to prevention make the quality of health care across America uneven. Consumers have no reliable information with which to measure the quality of their health care or coverage.
Coverage for long-term care is inadequate. Many elderly and disabled Americans enter nursing homes and other institutions when they would prefer to remain at home. Families exhaust their resources trying to provide for disabled relatives.
Many Americans cannot obtain quality care. In many rural and inner-city areas, shortages of doctors, clinics and hospitals form barriers to care.
Fraud and abuse cheat everyone. Many Americans believe that exorbitant charges, fraud and abuse undermine both quality and access to care.
 
The Overview
The American Health Security Act guarantees comprehensive health coverage for all Americans regardless of health or employment status. Health coverage continues without interruption if Americans lose or change jobs, move from one area to another, become ill or confront a family crisis.
Through a system of regional and corporate health alliances that organize the buying power of consumers and employers, the American Health Security Act stimulates market forces so that health plans and providers compete on the basis of quality, service and price.
Under the act, health plans must meet national standards on benefits, quality and access to care, but each state may tailor the new system to local needs and conditions. Thus the program encourages local innovation with a national framework.
It frees the health care system of much of the accumulated burden of unnecessary regulation and paperwork, allowing doctors, nurses, hospitals and other health providers to focus on providing high-quality care.
 
Creating Security
The American Health Security Act enhances the security of the American people by extending universal coverage in a environment that improves quality and controls rising costs:
All employers contribute to health coverage for their employees, creating a level playing field among companies.
Everyone shares the responsibility to pay for coverage.
Limits on out-of-pocket payments protect American families from catastrophic costs, while subsidies ease the burden on low-income individuals and small employers.
A comprehensive benefit package with no lifetime limits on medical coverage guarantees access to a full range of medically necessary or appropriate services.
Elderly and disabled Americans receive coverage for outpatient prescription drugs under Medicare for the first time.
Guaranteed choice of health plans and providers enhances choice for many Americans.
No health plan may deny enrollment to any applicant because of health, employment or financial status or may they charge some patients more than others because of age, medical condition or other factors related to risk.
All health plans meet national quality standards and provide useful information that allows consumers to make valid comparisons among plans and providers.
Separate programs increase Federal support for long-term care and improve the quality and reliability of private long-term care insurance.
 
Controlling Costs
The American Health Security Act brings growth in health care costs in line with growth in Gross Domestic Product by 1977. It accomplishes this goal by increasing competition in health care, reducing administrative costs and imposing budget discipline:
A standard, universal package of health benefits and reliable information about the price and performance of health plans encourages informed choices.
Consumers pay less for low-cost plans and more for high-cost plans, creating incentives for cost-conscious choice.
Health plans receive fixed premiums based on risk characteristics of their patients. Working under a fixed budget, they have incentives to spend resources cost effectively.
If savings attained through effective competition and reductions in administrative costs do not achieve the spending goals, the national health care budget provides a backstop, ensuring that health care spending is in line with economic growth.
Like the private sector, major government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, also operate under a budget restraining the growth of Federal and state spending for health care.
 
Enhancing Quality
The American Health Security Act improves the quality of health care by creating standards and guidelines for practitioners, reorienting quality assurance to measuring outcomes rather than regulatory process, increasing the national commitment to medical research and promoting primary and preventive care.
Explicit quality goals and standards shape the health care system.
Health plans are held accountable for quality improvement.
Regular publication of accessible information about quality and cost allows consumers to make informed choices among health care plans.
Increased investment in research advances medical knowledge.
A special funding mechanism insures that academic health centers continue their vital role in research, training and specialty care.
New investments support training for primary care physicians and other health professionals; Federal action helps remove artificial barriers to practice that hinder nurses and other non-physicians.
Investments in public health enhance the level of protection for all Americans.
Changes in Medicare rate schedules and in the allocation of Federal funds supporting graduate medical education provide new incentives for primary care physicians.
Pre-emption of state laws limiting the scope of practice and new funding for the education of health professionals who are not physicians enhance opportunities for nurses, social workers and other non-physician providers.
 
Expanding Access to Care
The American Health Security Act invests in the development of an adequate health care system in areas with inadequate service. Those investments hold the promise of improving the availability and quality of health care in rural communities and urban neighborhoods.
Health alliances assume responsibility for building health networks in rural and urban areas with inadequate access.
National loan programs support the efforts of local health providers to develop community-based plans.
Investments in new health programs such as school-based clinics and community clinics expand access to care for underserved populations.
Financial incentives attract health professionals to areas with inadequate care.
 
Reducing Bureaucracy
The American Health Security Act reduces the burden of paperwork and administration; regulatory, billing and reporting requirements decline, and consumers experience a streamlined and simpler system:
A single, comprehensive benefit package that covers every eligible person eliminates confusion about coverage.
Administrative costs caused by multiple policies with different benefits and risk selection disappear.
Standard forms for insurance reimbursement, the submission of claims and clinical encounter records simplify paperwork and reduce administrative costs.
The cost of administering coverage in small companies declines because they purchase through health alliances that benefit from economies of scale.
Federal regulatory requirements for Medicare, Medicaid and other programs are simplified.
Health care services covered by workers' compensation and automobile insurance merge into the new health system, reducing duplication and waste.
Malpractice reform reduces incentives in the current system to perform excessive tests or unnecessary procedures.
 
Reducing Fraud and Abuse
The American Health Security Act cracks down on health care providers and institutions that impose excessive charges or engage in fraudulent practices, setting tough standards and imposing stiffer penalties including:
New criminal penalties for fraud related to health care and for the payment of bribes or gratuities to influence the delivery of health services and coverage.
New civil monetary penalties against providers who submit false claims.
Tighter restrictions eliminate referral "kickbacks" in the private sector, and new standards prohibit physicians from prescribing services delivered at institutions in which they hold financial interests.
Accountability standards make provider fraud and other misbehavior automatic grounds for exclusion from all health plans.
 
Details of the Plan
 
Who Is Covered
A health security card provided to each eligible person entitles him or her to obtain coverage through a health plan that delivers services covered in a nationally defined, comprehensive benefit package.
Eligible individuals enroll in a health plan through a health alliance unless they are covered under government-sponsored health programs that continue, including Medicare; military personnel covered by the Department of Defense; Department of Veterans Affairs; Indian Health Service. Individuals eligible for those programs continue to receive care through them.
Employer Obligation: All employers contribute to the purchase of health coverage for their employees. All employers pay 80 percent of the weighted-average premium for health insurance coverage in the regional alliances which serve their employees or in their corporate alliance. The required employer contribution in regional alliances is capped at a percentage of payroll, with lower caps for small and low-wage employers. . . .
Firms that employ more than 5,000 workers insure that their employees are enrolled in health plans that meet Federal guidelines and report information about enrollment. Employers with more than 5,000 employees that choose to operate corporate alliances may be required to continue to pay for health insurance coverage for their terminated employees for six months following termination or may have to pay 1 percent of payroll to cover unemployed workers.
Large employers may fulfill their obligation to provide coverage by operating a program of self-insurance through a corporate alliance, contracting with a certified health plan or joining the regional alliance. . . .
Individual Obligations: Families and individuals pay 20 percent of the weighted-average premium for an average cost health plan chosen through an alliance. An individual or family who chooses a less expensive plan pays less, and someone who chooses a more expensive plan pays more.
An employer also may elect to pay some or all of the employee's portion of the premium.
Self-employed and unemployed individuals are responsible for paying the family share of the premium as well as the employer share, unless they are eligible for assistance based on income.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Undocumented Persons: Undocumented persons are not eligible for guaranteed health benefits. However, employers are required to pay health insurance premiums for all of their employees, regardless of immigration status. . . .
Territories: Individuals who reside in territories of the United States receive the comprehensive benefit package through their existing health care systems.
Others: States with migrant labor populations are required to address the needs of migrant workers and their families in state plans for the implementation of health reform. . . .
Students who are not dependents enroll in the regional alliance where their school is located.
Employers make contributions toward health care premiums for part-time employees (generally individuals working more than 10 hours but less than 30 hours per week) on a pro-rated basis.
Prisoners remain the financial responsibility of the various prison systems.
 
Benefits
The health benefits guaranteed to all Americans provide comprehensive coverage, including mental health services, substance-abuse treatment, some dental services and clinical preventive services.
The guaranteed benefit package contains no lifetime limitations on coverage, with the exception of coverage for orthodontia.
Each health plan must provide coverage for the following categories of services as medically necessary or appropriate with additional limitations and cost sharing only as specified in the American Health Security Act of 1993 or by the National Health Board. Covered health services are:
*Hospital services
*Emergency services
*Services of physicians and other health professionals
*Clinical preventive services
*Mental health and substance abuse services
*Family planning services
*Pregnancy-related services
*Hospice
*Home health care
*Extended-care services
*Ambulance services
*Outpatient laboratory and diagnostic services
*Outpatient prescription drugs and biologicals
*Outpatient rehabilitation services
*Durable medical equipment, prosthetic and orthotic devices
*Vision and hearing care
*Preventive dental services for children
*Health education classes

 	 	 		. . .	 	Clinical preventive services: Targeted screening tests and immunizations required for high-risk patients, as defined by the National Health Board, are covered under outpatient laboratory and diagnostic services and outpatient prescription drugs and biologicals. Periodic medical examinations: every three years for individuals ages 20 to 39, every two years for adults ages 40 to 65, and annually for adults ages 65 or more.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Home health care: Same services as under the current Medicare program (including skilled nursing, physical, occupational and speech therapy, prescribed social services) with the addition of prescribed home infusion therapy and outpatient prescription drugs and biologicals.
Limitations: Only as an alternative to institutionalization (i.e., inpatient treatment in a hospital, skilled nursing or rehabilitation center) for illness or injury. At the end of each 60 days of treatment, the need for continued therapy is re-evaluated. . . .
Extended care services: Inpatient services in a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility.
Limitations: Only after an acute illness or injury as an altemative to continued hospitalization; maximum of 100 days per calendar year.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Mental Health and Substance Abuse: By the year 2001, all states are required to submit to the National Health Board a plan detailing steps it is undertaking to move from the traditional two-tier structure for separate public and private mental health and substance abuse services and develop an integrated, comprehensive managed system of care.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Exclusions
The benefit package does not cover services that are not medically necessary or appropriate, private duty nursing, cosmetic orthodontia and other cosmetic surgery, hearing aids, adult eyeglasses and contact lenses, in vitro fertilization services, sex-change surgery and related services, private room accommodations, custodial care, personal comfort services and supplies.
 
National Health Board
The American Health Security Act creates an independent National Health Board responsible for setting national standards and overseeing the establishment and administration of the new health system by states.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In the event that a state fails to meet the deadline for establishing regional health alliances or fails to operate the alliance system in compliance with Federal requirements, the National Health Board insures that all eligible individuals have access to services covered in the comprehensive benefit package.
To induce a state to act, the National Health Board informs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services of a state's failure to comply. The Secretary has the authority to order the withholding of Federal health appropriations.

 	 	 		. . .	 	When the National Board notifies the Secretary of Health and Human Services that a state has failed to comply with Federal requirements, the National Board shall also notify the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury will impose a payroll tax on all employers in the state. . . .
 
Establishment of Alliances
No later than Jan. 1, 1997, each state must establish one or more regional health alliances responsible for providing health coverage to residents in every area of the state. . . .
States may not establish boundaries for health alliances that concentrate racial or ethnic minority groups, socioeconomic groups or Medicaid beneficiaries.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Fee-for-Service Plans
Each alliance includes among its health plan offerings at least one plan organized around a fee-for-service system. A fee-for-service system is one in which patients have the option of consulting any health provider subject to reasonable requirements. Reasonable requirements may include utilization review and prior approval for certain services but do not include a requirement to seek approval through a gatekeeper.
Under certain conditions, with approval from the National Health Board, a state may waive the requirement for each alliance to offer a fee-for-service health plan.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Budget
The American Health Security Act organizes the market for health care and creates mechanisms to control costs through enhanced competition, consumer choice, administrative simplification and increased negotiating power through health alliances. A national health care budget serves as a backstop to that system of incentives and organized market power. The budget insures that health care costs do not rise faster that other sectors of the economy.
The national health care budget centers on the weighted average premium for the nationally guaranteed benefits package in regional health alliances, establishing a target for how much that average premium may increase each year. The Federal Government assumes responsibility for enforcing alliance budgets. . . .
Health care expenditures covered by the budget include premiums paid to cover the guaranteed comprehensive benefit package whether paid by employers, employees, or individuals. Medicare and Medicaid expenditures are included under separate budgets.
Supplemental benefits beyond the comprehensive benefit package, as well as workers' compensation and auto insurance benefits, are not included in the budget. Premiums for insurance policies providing coverage for cost sharing are not included.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Drug Pricing
The case of new drugs that the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] determines are excessively or inappropriately priced, the Secretary has the authority to negotiate a special rebate with the manufacturer. Such a determination by the Secretary would be based on such factors as prices of other drugs in the same therapeutic class, cost information supplied by the manufacturer to the Secretary, prices of the drugs in other comparable counties, and other relevant factors. If a manufacturer refuses to negotiate or the Secretary is unable to negotiate a price that the Secretary determines to be reasonable, the Secretary may exclude the new drug from coverage under Medicare.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Medicaid
Under-65 Medicaid recipients who are not receiving either A.F.D.C. [Aid to Families with Dependent Children] or S.S.I. [Supplemental Security Income] cash payments will no longer receive insurance through Medicaid. They will enter regional and corporate alliances based on their employment status.
An exception to this policy is that undocumented persons will continue to receive Medicaid coverage for emergency services.
The Medicaid program will continue to make payments on behalf of A.F.D.C. and S.S.I. recipients.


GRAPHIC: American Health Security Act -- The name of the legislation that President Clinton will propose to Congress to overhaul the nation's health care system.
Chart: "THE LANGUAGE OF HEALTH CARE"
Employer mandate -- The Clinton plan's requirement that employers pay at least 80 percent of the cost of health coverage for their workers.
Guaranteed national benefit package -- The standard comprehensive coverage that would be guaranteed all Americans as a result of the President's proposal.
Health alliances -- Purchasing groups that, under the Clinton plan, would each buy health care services for thousands of consumers. The alliances would be of two types: regional health alliances, whose creation would be the responsibility of the states, and corporate health alliances. A corporate alliance could be established by any large employer (in general, one with more than 5,000 workers). But such an employer would have the option of joining a regional alliance instead.
Health plans -- The insurers that would provide coverage through contracts negotiated with regional or corporate health alliances.
Managed competition -- A health care policy, largely embraced by the President, that combines free-market forces with Government regulation. In this concept, large groups of consumers buy health care from networks of care providers. The aim is to create business competition among those networks, thereby restraining prices and encouraging quality of care.
Medicaid -- The existing Federal-state program of health coverage for the poor. Under the Clinton plan, Medicaid beneficiaries are to be folded into the health alliance system.
Medicare -- The existing Federal program of health coverage for the elderly and the disabled. Under the Clinton plan, a state could apply to the Government for permission to include Medicare beneficiaries in the alliance system, and a person who was already included in an alliance upon turning 65 would have the option of remaining.
National Health Board -- A seven-member Federal panel that would be appointed by the President to oversee the states' creation of regional health alliances, interpret the guaranteed benefits package, enforce a national health care budget, monitor the quality of health care and investigate pharmaceutical companies' prices for new drugs if evidence suggested that the prices were unreasonably high.
National health security card -- An identification card that would serve as proof of a person's eligibility for the Government-guaranteed package of benefits. All citizens and legal aliens would be eligible.
Single-payer option -- A provision of the Clinton plan that a state would be allowed to enact as an alternative to the system of regional health alliances. Under this alternative, the state would make direct payments to health care providers, with no intermediaries.

HEADLINE: Salvador Journal;
In Brazil, a City Has Its Own Harlem Renaissance

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALVADOR, Brazil

 BODY:
Welcoming patrons to his stylish new restaurant here, Elon Carneiro Coelho's eye was caught one recent evening by the bust of an ancient Greek healer brooding in a wall niche across a narrow cobblestone street.
"My father studied medicine there," he said, waving toward Brazil's first medical school, a decaying neoclassical landmark of Salvador's historic center, the Pelourinho. "But my generation always avoided coming here. Despite the historic buildings, we always saw the Pelourinho as ugly, rundown, dangerous." 
 But in a turn of the generational wheel, Mr. Coelho returned to the Pelourinho in July to open his Catarina Paraguacu restaurant in a restored colonial-era town house.
No risk-taking pioneer, Mr. Coelho is capitalizing on Brazil's growing movement for historic preservation.
 
Back from the Future
 In the 1960's, Brazil promoted itself as "the country of the future" and turned boldly to its interior wilderness to build Brasilia, a modernistic capital for a young nation. Today, after decades of helter-skelter industrialization, Brazilians are looking to their past, seeking to restore the colonial cores of their coastal cities.
"There has been a big change -- suddenly there is nationwide concern for historic preservation," Ciro Pirondi, president of the Institute of Architects of Brazil, said recently at Sao Paulo's Second International Architecture Biennial. Critics said Brazil's strongest entries included restoration projects for Rio de Janeiro, Sao Luis, Florianopolis and Salvador.
Salvador, a city of red roofs on a bluff overlooking a sparkling blue bay, is the site of the most ambitious project. Galvanized by growing tourism and a conviction that its cultural patrimony is crumbling, the government of Bahia State is investing $30 million to renovate 350 colonial-era buildings in the city's historic center.
For Americans, the Pelourinho, or Pillory Square, is perhaps best known as the setting for "Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands," a movie based on the novel by Jorge Amado, a former resident of the Pelourinho, a sloping triangle of cobblestones.
 
A Colonial Treasure
 Brazil's fourth largest city, Salvador has the richest raw material for preservationists: the nation's largest collection of colonial architecture.
When the English Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Salvador was a 71-year-old city that already ranked as a colonial capital. Second only to Lisbon in Portugal's far-flung empire, 18th-century Salvador was the busiest port in the South Atlantic.
But in 1763 the colony's government shifted to Rio, and in the 19th century Brazil's economic locus shifted to Sao Paulo. By the end of the 19th century, Salvador's moneyed families started to abandon the city's colonial heart, and by the 1920's, it was officially designated the city's red-light district.
Without maintenance, historic buildings fell to ruin.
"The government had two choices: restore the area, or let people continue living in subhuman conditions, where they risked dying in collapsing buildings," said Adriana Castro, restoration director for the Institute of Artistic and Cultural Heritage, the state agency that is overseeing the renewal of Pelourinho.
 
A Transformation
 One year after the work began, the transformation is startling.
Overhead cobwebs of electrical wires have disappeared underground. Crumbling facades pocked by empty window frames have been replaced with stucco painted in colonial pastels. Backyard outhouses have disappeared as sewer lines have been installed.
In alleys once patrolled by prostitutes and pickpockets, young tourists and Bahians crowd the tables of piano bars and sidewalk cafes.
In Brazil as elsewhere, historic preservation often means gentrification. Community leaders estimate that as many as 500 people were forced to move.
"If the building was important they just gave the people living there $300 and said, 'Get a new house,' " said Dimitri Ganzelevitch, a French art dealer who lives there.
 
Afro-Brazilian Showcase
 But others see an Afro-Brazilian renaissance in a neighborhood that has been a stronghold of black culture. Over the centuries, the Pelourinho has been closely identified with the trajectory of Salvador's black-majority population: in the 18th century as slave market and pillory, in the 19th century as the site of city's most powerful black church, in the late 20th century as the home of thriving Afro-Brazilian restaurants and reggae-samba music groups.
Several black political and cultural groups have opened offices and boutiques in the Pelourinho.
"I don't think that tourists are 'whitening' Pelourinho," said Joao Jorge Santos Rodrigues, president of Olodum, an Afro-Brazilian drum corps that long lobbied for the neighborhood's renewal. "Restoring our Harlem doesn't mean whitening it."

HEADLINE: Bonds Soar on Producer-Price Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices roared back yesterday on news of an unexpected plunge in August producer prices. The gains nearly erased Thursday's steep losses. Leading the rally were long-term bonds, which are most susceptible to inflation pressures.
The Treasury's 30-year bond, which plummeted 17/16points Thursday, gained 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield dropped to 5.87 percent, just above the record low of 5.86 percent set on Wednesday. On Thursday, the yield closed at 5.96 percent. 
 The drop in interest rates helped stock prices, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 32.14 points.
Bond traders searching for confirmation that inflation remains low said they were pleasantly shocked by the Labor Department's report of a drop of six-tenths of 1 percent in wholesale prices last month. Moreover, the so-called core rate of wholesale inflation -- excluding the volatile energy and food components -- dropped a huge 1 percent. Most economists had expected a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in both figures.
 
'A Big Roar'
 "There was a big roar that came out of everyone's mouth" when the report was released at 8:30 A.M., said Frank Marchetti, a bond trader at Fuji Securities Inc.
The drop was so steep that most traders overlooked the fact that the fall in producer prices resulted mainly from plunging tobacco rates. Bond investors often dismiss inflation figures that are overly influenced by price changes in one commodity.
The numbers reassured investors that the low inflation that has sent interest rates plummeting to their lowest levels in 25 years remains firmly in place.
Also reinforcing that notion were falling prices for commodities, including gold and oil. The Commodity Research Bureau index, a measure of daily price changes and a barometer of inflation trends, fell 1.70, to 213.17.
The August price data also reinvigorated speculation that the Federal Reserve has room to ease short-term interest rates to help stimulate growth. Those expectations were hurt earlier this week after Federal Reserve officials suggested the central bank did not intend to reduce short-term rates any further.
Prices of short-term Treasury securities rose 5/32 point to 1/4 point yesterday and intermediate maturities rose 3/8 point to 9/16 point, the financial information service Telerate Inc. reported. The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 5.07, to 1,338.43.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 3.01 percent as the discount dropped 2 basis points, to 2.95 percent. Six-month yields fell to 3.14 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points, to 3.05 percent. One-year yields dropped to 3.29 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points, to 3.18 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 2.94 percent, down from 3 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10519/32 , up 1/4 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 5.47 percent, up from 5.46 percent.

HEADLINE: Inflation Report Gives Stocks a Rebound

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
Eager buyers flooded back to the stock market yesterday, erasing most of the week's previous losses on the strength of surprisingly good news about inflation and a subsequent drop in interest rates.
Technology, banking and oil stocks were among the strongest sectors of the market, which took off early in the day after the Government reported that wholesale prices declined six-tenths of a percent in August, the biggest drop in two and a half years. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,621.63, up 32.14 points, apparently indicating that investors had lost their nervousness about soaring stock prices. For the shortened post-Labor Day week, the Dow industrials had a net loss of 12.30 points.
It was a week in which stocks made some unusual movements. In the first two trading days, the Dow lost a total of 45 points despite rising bond prices and lower long-term interest rates, which usually make stocks more attractive to investors. Thursday was a flat day. And yesterday stocks moved higher along with bond prices, which rallied on the news of low inflation and the prospects for lower interest rates.
 
'Financial Market Heaven'
 Richard J. Hoffman, the chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company, said the buyers yesterday were drawn by the conviction that interest rates would drop further, and by corporate profits that were a little better than expected, given the slow growth of the economy.
Looking back on the week's roller-coaster trading, Mr. Hoffman said, "Economic purgatory has turned into financial market heaven."
He added: "The main characteristic of this market ever since the inception of the bull market has been the question, 'When is it going to end?' The higher it gets, the more anxiety there is."
Contributing to the activity yesterday was a flurry of buying by investors seeking to cover their short positions, or bets that the market would fall. "This bull market has taken no prisoners," Mr. Hoffman said. "And if you've been short this market, you've been in trouble."
The Standard & Poor's 500 ended up 4.22, at 461.72, and the American Stock Exchange composite was up 2.68, at 456.06. The Nasdaq composite was up a strong 6.60 to finish at 744.31.
 
Technology Stocks Gain
 Four program trades raised the Dow by a total of more than 9 points, according to Philip H. Smyth, who tracks program trading for Birinyi Associates. He called the impact "fairly significant."
Technology stocks again were among the strongest gainers, with semiconductor issues leading the way. National Semiconductor was up 1 3/8, to 20 5/8, on a good earnings report and upgrades from financial analysts. Kyocera finished up 1 1/4, at 118 3/4, and Applied Materials closed up 3 5/8, at 71 5/8.
Other technology gainers included Lotus Development, up 1, to 36 3/4; Microsoft, up 1 3/4, to 78; Texas Instruments, up 1 1/8, to 78 5/8, and Intel, up 3/4, to 65 1/2.
Among the interest rate-sensitive stocks that climbed yesterday were bank issues, which continued a rise that began on Thursday on the predictions of good third-quarter earnings. Big gainers were Wells Fargo, up 2, to 121 5/8; First Chicago, up 3/4, to 48; and J. P. Morgan, up 1 3/8, to 79.
Oil stocks also did well, with Royal Dutch Petroleum up 2 1/8, to 103 3/4, Chevron up 1, to 89 3/8, and Texaco up 1 5/8, to 66 1/8.
Other big gainers were Manufactured Homes, a real estate investment trust based in Chicago, which closed at 41 5/8, up 3 7/8, on the news that it was holding talks on a big acquisition. Paramount closed up 4 1/4, at 61 1/8, on rising earnings and news of its potential merger with Viacom.
One of the day's biggest losers was Media Logic, a maker of computer testing equipment that predicted disappointing second-quarter sales. It was down 4 1/2, to 6 5/8, losing 40 percent of its value to wind up as the biggest percentage loser for the day on the American Stock Exchange.
In Tokyo yesterday, stocks ended mixed. The 225-share Nikkei average was down 7.60 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,817.98.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Post 0.6% Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
In a report showing surprisingly low inflation, the Government said today that plunging tobacco prices drove the Producer Price Index down six-tenths of a percent in August, the fourth straight decline and the biggest drop in two and a half years.
In the latest 12 months, prices received by American producers have risen a scant 1 percent or less at all stages of processing, a performance that delights the Federal Reserve and other policy makers. But it also raises concerns because sluggish business activity is largely responsible for the low inflation. 
 "It's a sign of the times," Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Chemical Banking Corporation, said of the results. "The economy is not strengthening, and it may be weakening."
 
Difficult to Charge More
 John M. Albertine, a Washington consultant who is increasingly fearful of recession, said, "If you're not selling anything, it's hard to raise prices and make them stick."
The four-month decline, which was registered after the figure for May was revised to a drop of one-tenth of a percent from unchanged, represents the first time wholesale prices have declined four months in a row since the beginning of 1986.
Analysts hailed the inflation news and bond prices headed back toward record peaks. [Page 46.] But examination of the figures disclosed that inflation has not quite disappeared, nor is it likely to do so even if oil prices continue to fall.
Excluding tobacco, a sector marked by price wars, prices at the producer level rose a modest two-tenths of a percent for both the overall rate and the so-called core rate, which excludes the gyrating food and energy components.
The prospect for the coming months, suggested Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley, is for an underlying rate of about 2 percent at the producer level and about 3 percent for the Consumer Price Index, which is also expected to show favorable results for August when it is reported on Tuesday. He said the price war in tobacco was a one-time phenomenon, though brand loyalty had faded among other products, too.
 
Possible Shift by Fed
 Still, the Federal Reserve was thought today to be even more likely to subtly shift its monetary stance at a Sept. 21 policy meeting from a bias toward tightening credit to a position of neutrality.
The six-tenths-of-a-percent decline in the finished-goods index in August resulted from an unprecedented 25.6 percent dive for tobacco products, one that could not be dismissed as a statistical aberration because it was even steeper before adjustment for recurring seasonal patterns.
Energy prices fell eight-tenths of a percent, also the fourth straight decline, but this was offset by food prices that turned up five-tenths of a percent, while automobiles rose 1 percent. Prescription drugs advanced five-tenths of a percent, half the July rise but twice June's increase.
For the 12-month period ended in August, finished goods -- those ready for sale to the consumer or final business user -- rose six-tenths of a percent.
Today's report by the Labor Department also showed that without food and energy, the Producer Price Index for finished goods dropped in August by 1 percent, the biggest monthly drop on record.
This reflected the collapse in the price of tobacco, which according to Kathryn L. Kobe, an economist at Joel Popkin & Company, accounts for only about 3 percent of the Producer Price Index and may be even less important than that in today's economy because there are fewer smokers.
 
Across Production Levels
 Inflation at the earlier stages of production also was firmly under control last month.
For intermediate goods, like a bolt of cloth, prices were unchanged over all. Construction materials turned up, energy items fell a bit less than in July and the rise in foods and feeds slackened considerably.
Nondurables for manufacturing, like chemicals, edged down a tenth of a percent, but factory durables climbed two-tenths of a percent. This durables category showed big jumps for plywood and for hot-rolled sheet and strip steel and big declines for copper and brass ingots and other mill shapes. Silver, gold, zinc and hardwood turned down after rising in July.
For crude goods, like raw cotton, prices fell five-tenths of a percent last month, somewhat less than the declines of June and July. Basic industrial materials turned down for the first time since November, the Labor Department's report also showed.
Prices of crude energy declined 1.8 percent after skidding 4.9 percent in July. Foods and feeds rose 1.6 percent, up from 1.2 percent.
Crude goods other than energy and food fell 2.6 percent after a fractional July rise. Iron and steel scrap tumbled 7.2 percent, and softwood logs and copper and aluminum scrap also fell. Leaf tobacco, however, rose again.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Climbs Against Yen But Falls to a Low vs. Mark

BYLINE: The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained on the Japanese yen yesterday but fell to a 14-week low against the German mark as investors interpreted a drop in producer prices in the United States as further evidence that American interest rates would stay lower than those in Europe.
The dollar continued to fall in Europe a day after Germany cut interest rates, prompting several other European countries to follow suit. Traders said it appeared that Germany was not planning any further rate cuts soon, leaving European interest rates higher than those in the United States, a condition that weakens the dollar's value. 
 "There seems to be a feeling that European stock and bond markets will give you better returns than the U.S. at this point," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank.
That sentiment was persuading investors to buy European currencies rather than the dollar.
 
 
Inflation Not a Concern

Traders also said a decline of six-tenths of a percent in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index in August meant that inflation would not be of concern to the Federal Reserve, which would have little reason to raise interest rates.
Meanwhile, the dollar rose against the yen as investors anticipated a Japanese cut in interest rates and progress in talks on reducing Japan's trade surplus with the United States.
The yen has soared this year, in part on market perceptions that Washington wants a strong yen to reduce the surplus. A strong yen makes Japan's exports more expensive and its imports cheaper.
 
 
Yen Is Not the Issue
 "The markets have finally come to realize the yen is not really the core matter when the U.S. and Japan get together at the table," said David Gilmore of MCM Currency Watch, an analysis service in New York.
In Tokyo, the dollar settled at 105.63 yen, up 0.25 yen from Thursday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 106.15 yen, up from 105.00. In New York, the dollar traded at 106.10 yen, up from 105.33 on Thursday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5500, down from $1.5510 late Thursday. In New York, the pound was trading at $1.5520, up from $1.5510 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Acts To Show He Is Candidate For Change

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Striving to invigorate his campaign on the eve of a desultory Democratic primary and counter criticism that he lacks a vision for the future, Mayor David N. Dinkins is taking a flurry of actions to argue that he, not just Rudolph W. Giuliani, can be a candidate for change.
This week the Dinkins campaign sent a mailing to more than 100,000 households in liberal swing neighborhoods like the Upper West Side and Park Slope, Brooklyn, highlighting his efforts to start new programs despite tough times. The eight-page flier invites voters to "Give Mayor Dinkins a Piece of Your Mind" by returning the back page with their own views on whether the city should keep building housing for the homeless, place tolls on the East River bridges and other questions.
 
Outlining His Priorities
 On Monday Mr. Dinkins plans a speech to outline a broad range of programs in fields like education, crime and the economy that would be among his top priorities should he win a second term. His proposals -- a mix of old and new ideas -- range from a longer school year to a new core curriculum of educational basics to neighborhood business centers, financed with the help of computer companies, that would provide access to office equipment for the owners of small shops who could not yet afford their own. 
 "It's him saying this election is about substance, choices and differences," said Peter Johnson Jr., a Manhattan lawyer, informal Dinkins adviser and occasional speechwriter who helped draft the plan. "In essence, the Mayor says we must provoke the future, not invoke the past."
That is a not-so-veiled dig at Mr. Giuliani, who has issued a range of comparable plans in recent weeks, often invoking the city's past glories and complaining that Mr. Dinkins has presided over a slow decline that will only grow worse if he is re-elected.
 
Focusing on Giuliani
 For his part, Mr. Dinkins is doing all he can to keep the focus on Mr. Giuliani and not on Tuesday's Democratic primary, in which he is assured of victory but hoping to hold down a potential protest vote for Roy E. Innis, the conservative chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, or Eric Ruano-Melendez, a civil engineer and real-estate broker from Queens who has said he is making a symbolic run as a Hispanic candidate. Aides said one point of the flier, for example, was to let voters vent anger at the Mayor by writing to him rather than by voting against him.
The Mayor used a televised debate with the two on Thursday night to accuse Mr. Innis of being a "stalking horse" for Mr. Giuliani and to stress his own experience in presiding at City Hall.
Yesterday Mr. Dinkins attacked Mr. Giuliani for running a campaign of sound bites and slogans as he backs a conservative agenda "learned at Ronald Reagan's knee." Mr. Giuliani made almost the same charges against the Mayor, complaining that Mr. Dinkins was using "selective statistics" to show that crime is down in the city and accusing him of waging a campaign that amounted to "a slogan a day."
 
Countering Criticism
 By making the speech -- the result of several months of consultation with top aides and local academic experts -- the Mayor hopes to counter widespread criticism that his administration has often drifted from crisis to crisis without a blueprint for the future.
Many of the proposals, to be delivered to an invited audience of supporters at the Sheraton New York, would require state legislation or City Council approval. Most of the specifics and financing remain to be determined, and the city is already facing multibillion-dollar budget gaps in the coming years.
Mayoral advisers said the plan grew out of their conviction that most of the Mayor's term has been dominated by responding to the overwhelming budget gaps and a recession that have forced him to trim city services.
 
'From the Ground Up'
 "We have to make people believe that when you vote for David Dinkins the next four years are going to be better and different," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University and a campaign adviser. "Giuliani doesn't have any great ideas, but people want a promise of action."
"The era of the big project, the mega-solution, is gone," Mr. Moss added. "The future is in building from the ground up."
Among the proposals that have been discussed and rejected in the past is one to merge the city's three police forces. Mr. Dinkins will also call for expanding the use of computer technology to cut down on arrest times and paperwork to free up more officers for patrol, and targeted investments in local industries from biotechnology to jewelry, retailing and recycling.
Mr. Dinkins planned the speech even as his campaign sent a flier aimed especially at liberals in heavily gay and Jewish neighborhoods like Riverdale and Greenwich Village.
 
'If You're Not Satisfied'
 The mailing begins with the words: "If you're not satisfied with everything in New York City, join the club. Neither am I." over Mr. Dinkins's name, and it goes on to say: "Not everything has gone right; I am a human being and I make mistakes -- as any Mayor would. But I'm a man who learns from his mistakes and moves to rectify them."
The flier lists the Mayor's efforts to open schools in the evenings, start neighborhood health centers and expand the police force. Finally, it asks voters to tear off the back page, which lists six questions on their views on topics from cutting back garbage collection to changing the property tax system, and to send their answers to the campaign. They are also asked to write an essay on the single thing the Mayor has done that most upsets them, and the thing that most pleases them.
Andrea Bernstein, a deputy campaign manager, said the flier was the first in a series and had so far prompted about 75 responses, with most citing hiring more police officers, extending library hours and recycling and support for gay rights as the things that had most pleased them and the Mayor's handling of the Crown Heights disturbances and a general sense that he was not tough enough as the things that had most bothered them.

HEADLINE: Japan Seems to Ease Stand On Setting Trade Targets

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Japan's Foreign Minister, in what appears to open the way to a loosening of this nation's stance, suggested today that it might be acceptable for Japan and the United States to discuss setting numerical targets for reducing Japan's overall trade surplus.
The minister, Tsutomu Hata, did not clearly call for such targets and his remarks were disavowed by some other officials, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the official Government spokesman. 
 Nonetheless, his remarks mirror a groundswell of opinion here in favor of numerical targets, an idea that Japan has resisted.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, welcomed Mr. Hata's comments.
"Japan's huge global trade surpluses represent the major asymmetry in the world economy today," Mr. Kantor said in a statement this evening. "A commitment to a specific numerical reduction in that surplus will help in maintaining the health and the credibility of the global trading system."
In July, during negotiations for a basic trade framework between the two nations, the United States asked Japan to agree to cut its current-account surplus with the rest of the world, suggesting a figure of 1 to 2 percent of Japan's economic output, within a few years, from more than 3 percent now.
But Japan insisted that such a target would violate free trade and that the surplus depended on factors beyond the Government's control. It also feared it would set itself up for punishment by the United States if it set goals and then did not reach them.
 
Bold Steps Urged
 But just this week, leaders of two prominent business lobbying groups urged the Government to consider agreeing to such targets. They contended that unless bold steps were taken to improve relations with the United States and cut the trade gap, the upward pressure on the yen would continue, crippling Japan's blue-chip companies.
Mr. Hata made his remarks as Japan and the United States began negotiations this week to flesh out the trade framework signed in early July by President Clinton and Kiichi Miyazawa, who was then the Prime Minister.
The new Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, is to meet Mr. Clinton in New York later this month . At that meeting Mr. Hosokawa is expected to present Mr. Clinton with an "omiyage," or gift, consisting of new plans for Japan to reduce its trade surplus and stimulate its economy.
The trade framework signed in July calls only for Japan to take actions to bring about a "highly significant" reduction in the trade surplus. The new Hosokawa Government has said it would honor the trade agreement.
 
Room Left for Argument
 The wording in the agreement, however, leaves room for argument and debate. The United States has been insisting that "highly signficant" means the surplus should drop below 2 percent of economic output. Japan has been rejecting this interpretation, but may now be warming up to it.
At a news conference today, Foreign Minister Hata said: "Regarding the total surplus, it will be hard for us to get an understanding unless we set up a target. There is a common-sense range for what kind of a level should be permissible. I think it is possible for us to debate such things as a target."
But he did not specify a figure and also said that any goal should not be binding and should be easily modifiable if economic conditions changed. He also said he remained opposed to targets for specific industries or products, like how large a share of Japan's market should be held by foreign automobile or computer manufacturers.
 
Distinction Is Drawn
 The business leaders who favor setting a target for the trade surplus also draw a distinction between such a broad goal and goals for specific industries or products, which they said would constitute unacceptable government interference in the purchasing decisions of private companies and individual consumers.
On Thursday, Takeshi Nagano, the chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, said that it would be "appropriate to bring the surplus down to within 2 percent of the gross national product."
His remarks echoed those of Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, who proposed a target when he met with Prime Minister Hosokawa on Thursday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Wild Day for Commodities: Oil, Gold and Soybeans Fall

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Bearish economic news touched off a wild day in the commodity markets yesterday, with crude oil prices falling to their lowest level in three years, gold prices to the lowest in four months, and soybeans to the lowest since June.
Analysts said gold prices might stabilize, but crude oil and soybeans should be in for more losses. 
 Frenzied trading was seen in all these markets, with selling initially motivated by a Government report showing that wholesale prices fell in August.
"Inflationary pressures are not building and the economy has been sluggish," said Steve Platt, vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
Sluggish inflation is bad news for commodity traders, who bought a variety of commodities over the last few months on the expectations that prices would rise.
Traders said a two-week collapse in energy futures would continue unless OPEC stitched together a realistic accord at its Sept. 25 meeting to stem the world oil glut.
 
Crude Down 21 Cents
 Crude has lost about $2 a barrel, or 10 percent, since Aug. 27. At yesterday's close at the New York Mercantile Exchange, October crude settled down 21 cents, at $16.76 a barrel.
Gold prices, which commonly mirror the rise and fall of inflation, tumbled from the three-year high set in August. At the close at the New York Commodity Exchange, October gold was at $350.70 an ounce, down $4.10 from Thursday. September silver plunged 17.5 cents, to $4.065 an ounce.
Selling hit soybean prices on the Chicago Board of Trade after the Agriculture Department raised its crop estimate to 1.909 billion bushels from the 1.902 billion estimated in August.
Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds said that if weather forecasts predict beneficial weather in Midwest growing areas for the next 10 days, soybean prices should fall again on Monday.
The November soybean contract closed down 21 1/4 cents a bushel at $6.20 1/4 - a sharp move considering the maximum allowable drop is 30 cents.
The one exception to the lower prices was cotton, which rose sharply. The Agriculture Department estimated that American production would exceed China's for the first time since 1981.
The December cotton contract at the New York Cotton Exchange rose by the 2-cent-a-pound limit, to 59.34 cents.

HEADLINE: Q & A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Liens by Contractors
Q Can you explain what the term "mechanic's lien" means?
 
MARK SCHROEDER, Bronxville, N.Y.
A A mechanic's lien gives a contractor or subcontractor who has performed work on your home the right to collect a debt upon its sale. The method of enforcing such a lien varies. In some states, the contractor can force the property to be sold immediately to satisfy his claim; in others, collection cannot begin until the house is sold or used as collateral for a loan. 
 If materials or services used to improve the property are not paid for by either the homeowner or the contractor, a mechanic's lien might be filed at the local courthouse. Depending on the state, a homeowner may or may not be notified. If you are notified, you may have the right to dispute the lien's amount and validity.
"One danger is that even if you pay the contractor, the contractor may not pay the subcontractor," said Margot Saunders, managing attorney of the National Consumers Law Center in Washington. "A good way to protect yourself is to require a waiver of lien from the contractor, if your state law allows."
 
Floaters
Q What are floating-rate notes?
 
SHELAGH DALY, Hoboken, N.J.
A Floating-rate notes, or floaters, are debt instruments with a variable interest rate. Adjustments are made periodically, typically every three months, with the rate based on a predetermined spread above a benchmark, like the rate on three-month Treasury bills.
"A floating-rate note allows holders to gain by rises in interest rates, but pays lower yields than fixed-rate corporate notes of the same maturity," said Joseph Bencivenga, head of corporate bond research at Salomon Brothers. "Usually the interest rates are subject to caps and floors, which insure that they will not go above or fall below certain predetermined levels."
These notes are generally more attractive to investors when rates are poised to advance and less attractive when the outlook is for falling rates.
 
Value Averaging System
Q How does value averaging differ from dollar-cost averaging?
 
JACK D. SOLOMON, Forest Hills, Queens
A With both value averaging and dollar-cost averaging, you invest in stocks or mutual funds every month or quarter. But with value averaging, you adjust the amount of your investment according to how the security has performed. The goal is to increase the value of the investment by the same amount each month or quarter.
"The value-cost averaging method of investing is more subjective than dollar-cost averaging," said Kenneth S. Janke Sr., president of the National Association of Investors Corporation. "The amount of money increases as the price of the stock drops and decreases as the price rises."
Value averaging requires more time and discipline than dollar-cost averaging. And since the market has an upward bias, you would invest fewer dollars than through dollar-cost averaging.

HEADLINE: HOW THEY DO IT;
Fulfilling a Dream While Paying Off Hefty Student Loans

 BODY:
Sharon Gass-Simpkins knew in college that she wanted to be a dentist, but decided after graduation to sample other fields first.
 Starting with a short stint as a flight attendant, she earned a master's degeree in public administration and held a marketing position at the Xerox Corporation for nine years.
 
 In 1984, at age 36, she returned to her original goal -- and entered the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. When she received her degree in 1988, she had taken out $78,000 in student loans. When payments were deferred for nore than three years, interest rates raised the total debt to $150,000.
 In 1992, Dr. Gass-Simpkins started a $55,000-a-year job as director of dental services at the Camden County Health Services Center, which serves low-income and indigent patients. "I find providing care to patients who otherwise can't afford it extremely rewarding," she says, The job also qualified her for a loan-forgiveness program that will pay $70,000 of her debt.
 Here is a look at the paymnent plan, and how it will help her ahcieve her long-deferred goal.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Highlights of the Clinton Health Plan

 BODY:
All Americans and legal residents would be guaranteed a package of minimum benefits that would continue despite any illnesses or changes in employment.
 
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE
A range of services would be covered, including hospital care, emergency services, doctors and other health professionals, pregnancy-related services, hospice and home health care, ambulances, outpatient laboratory tests and prescription drugs. The Administration describes the coverage as equal to that offered by the nation's largest companies.
 A new long-term care program would be created for disabled people that would provide expanded home care services.
 Coverage of dental, eye and mental health care would be initially limited, but be expanded in the year 2000. Items considered not medically necessary, like cosmetic surgery, would not be covered.
Free preventive care, including periodic medical exams, immunizations and screening procedures like mammograms, pap smears and readings of cholesterol levels would be provided in accordance with a schedule set by the Government.
 A Medicare benefit for prescription drugs would be created. Beneficiaries would pay 25 percent of the program through their Part B premium, a $250 deductible and 20 percent of the costs beyond that to an annual maximum of $1,000.
 A choice would be offered between enrollment in a traditional fee-for-service plan, a health maintenance organization or a plan that combines elements of each.
Employers would be allowed to provide benefits that are more generous than the standard package, although after the year 2000 the extra benefits would be treated as taxable income for employees.
 Illegal immigrants would not be covered, although they would continue to be eligible for emergency and other services; institutions that serve many uncovered patients would continue to receive Federal reimbursement.
 
HOW IT WOULD WORK
 Most Americans would be enrolled in regional entities called health alliances, which would negotiate the price of coverage with health plans, offer a range of plans to members and collect premiums from employers and individuals.
 States would insure that alliances exist in areas where coverage would otherwise be insufficient.
 Companies with more than 5,000 employees would have the option of providing care to their workers by creating a corporate alliance and contracting directly with a health-care provider.
 People now enrolled in Medicare would continue in that program, but could later join the regional alliances. States would have the option of integrating Medicare recipients into their alliances so long as their coverage is as good or better.
 Medicaid recipients would be enrolled in regional alliances and receive the standared package of benefits, as well as supplementary services.
 All Americans would be issued a national health identification card that would guarantee them access to needed services.
 
WHO WOULD PAY
 The average premium for the standard package would be $1,800 a year for individuals and $4,200 for families. Businesses would be required to pay 80 percent of the average premium. Families and individuals would pay the difference between that amount and the full cost of the plan they select, meaning that those enrolled in cheaper plans would pay less, or more for plans more expensive than the average. Employers would have the option of paying more than 80 percent. The plan also suggests that a worker would be able to buy an average health policy for just $360 a year and a family policy for $840. The employer would pay four times that much.
 No business in a regional alliance would have to pay more than 7.9 percent of its payroll. Companies with fewer than 50 employees and those with many low-wage workers would be eligible for Government subsidies and for caps ranging from 3.5 percent to 7.9 percent of payroll, depending on their average wages.
 Families and individuals could pay their share of the premium directly or through withholding; alliances may require withholding to avoid bad debt.
 The self-employed and unemployed would be responsible for the entire amount of the premium, unless they were eligible for assistance based on income.
 Retired workers under 65 would be responsible for 20 percent of the premium.
 Employers would pay for part-time workers on a pro-rated basis.
Out-of-pocket costs would depend on the kind of service chosen. Alliances would be required to offer high-cost, low-cost and combination plans. The terms appear to refer respectively to traditional fee-for-service coverage, HMO's, and preferred provider networks.
 A high-cost plan would allow the use of any doctor but calls for deductibles of $200 an individual and $400 a family and 20 percent co-payment after that.
 In a low cost plan, the patient would see only doctors approved by the plan, but pay no deductible besides a $10-a-visit fee for outpatient services.
 In the combination plan, the patient would agree to pay 20 percent of the cost whenever using a doctor outside the plan.
 Out-of-pocket expenses are capped annually at $1,500 for each person and $3,000 for a family under all three plans.
 
CONTROLLING COSTS
 A National Health Board would be created to oversee the system and set a national health budget with the goal of limiting the rate of increase of health care spending to that of the general rate of inflation by 1999. Health care expenses are now growing at more than twice the inflation rate.
 If the competitive process does not reduce growth to that level, the board would impose mandatory limits on the growth of annual premiums, forcing health plans to spend less.
 Upon introducing the plan, the President would urge all sectors of the health care industry to limit price and spending increases to a specific amount not yet disclosed. Prices and spending would be monitored by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
 The National Health Board would make public declarations about the costs of new drugs and could investigate the costs of existing drugs it considers overpriced. It would have no authority to set drug prices.
 The rate of increase of Medicare and Medicaid would be reduced.
 
WORKERS COMPENSATION
 The separate insurance systems that now exist to cover the costs of injuries suffered at work or in automobile accidents would be continued. But the care would be provided through the health alliances created under the plan through contracts between them and the insurers.
 
TAKING EFFECT
 States could begin implementing the system by Jan. 1, 1995, and would be required to have it in place by Jan. 1, 1997.

HEADLINE: Science Fiction

BYLINE: By Gerald Jonas

 BODY:
Is William Gibson mellowing? The initiator of cyberpunk, who brought a new stylistic bite to science fiction with his 1984 novel "Neuromancer," has not quite turned into a futuristic Pollyanna. But compared to his earlier work, VIRTUAL LIGHT (Bantam, $21.95) offers more likable characters, a more subdued style, a less claustrophobic setting and a more upbeat ending.
Cyberspace -- Mr. Gibson's term for that amorphous computer-generated realm where information becomes geography -- plays a relatively minor role in his new novel. Instead of focusing on hackers obsessed with surfing the binary waves, he places at the center of his story two young people in a near-future San Francisco, a bike messenger named Chevette and a security guard named Rydell, who may actually have a flesh-and-blood future of their own, together. 
 Chevette, whose bike is moderately high-tech, gets her hands on a pair of super-high-tech sunglasses, which contain secrets that some powerful people are willing to kill for. Rydell, who discovers to his regret that he is working for the same people, eventually calls on a shadowy band of hackers for help. Mr. Gibson can write lean, mean action scenes, and his plot is so economically constructed that a reader who is not paying close attention may miss a crucial lead or two. Not to worry. Mr. Gibson's main interest, as always, is in creating a near-future world that can hold its own with the mind-bending reality of the present.
If the text of "Virtual Light" reveals the precise year in which the story is set, I missed it. But Mr. Gibson has other ways of delineating time and place. On hearing his new employer mention that his grandmother is Vietnamese, Rydell thinks to himself: "Saigon was where rich people went on vacation." You are invited to fill in the date for yourself. It may help to know that California has split into two states -- SoCal and NoCal -- and that since an earthquake known as "the Little Grande," the Bay Bridge linking San Francisco and Oakland has been closed to traffic and the still-intact center span has become a squatters' paradise, home to thousands of ex-hippies and formerly homeless people who have built themselves a new self-governing community: "At night, illuminated by Christmas bulbs, by recycled neon, by torchlight, it possessed a queer medieval energy."
Through a steady accretion of clearly imagined detail, Chevette's and Rydell's world comes to seem no queerer than our own. When Rydell gets into his employer's expensive car, his keen eye takes a quick inventory: "Four-wheel drive. Ceramic armor. Goodyear Streetsweepers you'd need a serious gun to puncture. There was a cardboard air freshener, shaped like a pine tree, hanging in front of the heater vent." I was especially taken with the Fallonites, a religious sect who believe that watching old movies on television is a form of meditation and that if they watch long enough "the spirit will sort of enter into them."
The final word on this latest installment of Mr. Gibson's speculative future belongs to a sociologist named Yamazaki, who maintains his scientific detachment even when he gets caught up in the action. Yamazaki's study of the unique society taking shape on the bridge prompts this reflection:
"We are come not only past the century's closing, he thought, the millennium's turning, but to the end of something else. Era? Paradigm? Everywhere, the signs of closure.
"Modernity was ending."
Undaunted, Yamazaki continues his research, "feeling for the new thing's strange heart."
William Gibson is a dewy-eyed optimist compared to Elizabeth Hand, whose ICARUS DESCENDING (Spectra/Bantam, paper, $5.99) is set in the mid-25th century but whose point of view is chillingly fin-de-siecle. As one character says to a talking ape who represents innocence incarnate: "There's always a war, Scarlet!" When mutated viruses are not literally raining down from the skies and radiation is not seeping into bones and genes, mad scientists are creating mutant clones and half-mechanical warriors in a Human Engineering Laboratory that more than earns its acronym of HEL.
"Icarus Descending" is set in the same shattered America that formed the background of Ms. Hand's earlier books "Winterlong" and "Aestival Tide." Although the publisher says that the new novel can be read independently, and Ms. Hand interpolates copious synopses throughout her narrative, I cannot imagine a reader who is unfamiliar with the earlier novels making much sense out of the complicated plot and intricate cross-references. And without a grounding in that shared history, it might be difficult to work up any anxiety over the threat posed by an onrushing meteor called Icarus to a world "that has already been twisted and burned and poisoned beyond all hope."
Ms. Hand occasionally strains for a poetry of decadence, interrupting the litany of scientific horrors with such archaisms as "fulvous" and "rubeous" in the manner of Gene Wolfe's "New Sun" series. But these touches serve only to remind the reader of all that has been lost in a future so dark that the impending annihilation of "civilization" seems more like a deliverance than a punishment.
Poul Anderson has been writing science fiction for over 40 years. In 1989 he published one of his most successful novels, "The Boat of a Million Years," an adroit study of the mixed blessings of immortality. HARVEST OF STARS (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95) reads like something salvaged from a drawer of old rejects. Anson Guthrie is the irascible but lovable founder of Fireball Enterprises, a company that dominates space travel in the solar system. Unlike all other monopolies in history, Fireball is neither inefficient nor corrupt, possibly because Guthrie, who has achieved a kind of immortality as a computer "download" after his body gives out, commands not just loyalty from his staff but a literally feudal devotion in which Fireball employees "plight troth" to their chief as he battles government baddies to win personal freedom and humanity's passage to the stars.
If this is Mr. Anderson's attempt to re-create the simple pleasures of the pulp magazines of the 1950's, he has only succeeded in proving that you can't go home again. "Harvest of Stars" is overwritten, underimagined and fatally flawed with self-satisfied musings on life-according-to-Guthrie that read suspiciously like the author's own self-justifications: "Back then, I too did my share of reading. It wasn't the fashionable stuff, no. Shakespeare, Homer, Cervantes, they might be acceptable, if outmoded, but Kipling, Conrad, MacDonald, Heinlein, that ilk, they were insensitive reactionaries. Or racists or sexists or whatever the current swear word was. You see, they dealt with things that mattered."
CORE, by Paul Preuss (Morrow, $23), is a savvy, hard-science techno-thriller about the hardest science of all. Cyrus Hudder, a maverick geologist, discovers a new substance, dubbed hudderite, that is so hard it can be used to drill into the molten core of the earth. When Cyrus disappears, his disaffected son, Leiden, is left to carry on the family tradition of brilliant if erratic applied science.
Mr. Preuss has obviously done his homework, as evidenced by dialogue in which Leiden Hudder's patent attorney notes: "But the fraction of elements in the plasma beam has not been the same as the stoichiometric fraction. . . . I mean, aren't the non conducting elements generally underrepresented?" Fearful perhaps that readers will not stick around for the answers to such questions, the author stuffs his plot with enough political intrigue and earth-shaking perils to plump out a big-screen movie script, which this novel seems all too eager to become.

Seductive Smallness

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger; Paul Goldberger, the culture editor of The Times, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1984 for criticism.

 BODY:
If you write about art you can collect it, at least to the limits of your wallet. If you are a music critic you are assumed to have an ample supply of CD's. A book critic accumulates a serious library. But an architecture critic? There is architectural drawing, but it has always seemed so much art manque. That's why I began to collect tiny toy buildings -- what other way short of investing in real estate is there to build a collection of architecture?
That's the story I would tell an interviewer if I were the sort of person who gets interviewed. The truth is that the whole thing never had so considered a purpose. It was born of necessity. A while ago I lived in a small apartment that had an odd little niche in the wall, and lying around on my desk was one of those cheap, eight-inch-high miniatures of the Empire State Building that you can buy in any souvenir shop. Better a toy Empire State Building than a vase of dried flowers, I said to myself, and into the niche it went. That was to be the end of that, until a neighbor saw it and said he had a souvenir World Trade Center that he would like to give me, and then somebody else said you can't have an Empire State Building without a Statue of Liberty, and not too long after that I got married and a friend from California gave us his miniature lead Woolworth Building and then my wife was browsing in an antiques shop and found an RCA Building in the form of an ashtray and it was all over. The RCA Building cost a lot of money -- $85 -- and it meant that there was no turning back. 
 Now I have something like 150 buildings, most of them three or four inches high, generally of metal, though some are ceramic, and a few recent ones, alas, are made of plastic. It's true that they don't make buildings the way they used to. You can compare my Empire State Buildings -- I have six, which includes the Empire State Building pencil sharpener but not the three Empire State erasers -- and the older ones invariably have finer detail, more solid construction, a surer sense that they were made to last. That I could write that last sentence with a straight face is a sign that I have become unnaturally attached to my toy buildings. My collection now fills not only the niche and some shelves we added but also an entire counter top, where the skyscrapers and the churches and the banks and the monuments line up row upon row like a miniature city, although I am not sure just what sort of vision of urban glory is represented by putting Chartres Cathedral across from the Nutley Savings Bank.
There is not much architectural scholarship to these miniature buildings; in fact, there isn't any. The five-inch lead Flatiron Building for which I paid dearly last Christmas may be a semivaluable antique, but it is an almost crude representation of the building, more an abstraction than a reproduction. There are better ways to learn about the Tower of Pisa than through my nine-inch ceramic version of it, better ways to study the United States Capitol than through any one of my Capitols, though I have to admit that the metal one whose dome opens up to reveal a jewel box is pretty nifty.
But collecting souvenir buildings has nothing to do with being serious about architecture. It has a lot to do with affection for buildings, and with the curious joy that comes from seeing anything you like in miniature. In its surprising tininess it becomes containable, manageable, in a way that the real thing is not. If children find order in the world they are coming to know through their play, adults can order the world they already know through collecting, which is really a form of play, too.
And yet I remember once saying to an architectural model maker that his craft was dangerous because he had the power to make any building likable. A model of the worst skyscraper on Third Avenue is benign, even appealing. As an architecture critic I have seen hundreds of buildings I couldn't stand, but I don't know when I've ever seen a model I didn't like. The worst building in the world is cute when turned into a model. Indeed, it is more than cute: it is seductive.
Is it the desire to be seduced again by buildings, to see them as objects of fantasy rather than as the difficult and challenging things that they are, that motivates me to collect all these little souvenirs? Perhaps. On my counter top there are no real issues of urban context to think about, no concerns about the social imperatives of architecture, no need to take into account the realities of economics or zoning. The buildings become shapes to be manipulated for amusement, and how good they look is the only thing that matters. Since when could a responsible architecture critic justify making that kind of judgment on a real building?
SO I PLAY ON, MOVING my Towers of Pisa and Woolworth and Sears and John Hancock back and forth, and wondering why my forays to flea markets and back-roads antique shops (which is where you find the good miniatures, the ones too old to be in the souvenir shop at the airport) haven't yet turned up a Chrysler Building, which is the rare object I covet most of all. Indeed, I only learned that there were Chrysler Buildings a couple of years ago, when I ran into David Weingarten and Margaret Majua, a couple in Northern California whose collection of souvenir buildings makes me seem a rank amateur. They crossed the 1,400 mark not long ago, and they keep acquiring. David and Margaret, of course, have two Chrysler Buildings. I know this because they told me, and also because they have created a computerized inventory, copies of which they have circulated to the small circle of souvenir building collectors that has grown up around them. Last year they played host to this group for a weekend of conversation and trading, and this year Dixie Trainer, who gives every indication of being a normal housewife but for the fact that she has 700 miniature buildings, decided to reciprocate. I went to Dixie's, partly to see who else would show up and partly to see her collection, which also has two Chrysler Buildings, neither of which she would part with.
It was a strange combination of social event and bazaar. First, a lovely summer lunch with about a dozen of us who, like occupants of a nudist colony freed at last from the normal social conventions, could blather on about early Bunker Hill Monuments and toy classical banks with no fear of embarrassment. I had brought nothing to show and nothing to trade, my collection being too small to have duplicates and too uneven to justify winnowing out the less distinguished examples. I came away with two shopping bags full of miniatures, not a one of which, of course, looked anything like a Chrysler Building.

HEADLINE: The World Capital of Whatever

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER; HAROLD FABER contributes to The Times from the Hudson Valley. His latest book is "From Sea to Sea: The Growth of the United States" (Scribner's).

 BODY:
AS I was driving along Route 5 in central New York State, my eye was caught by a sign outside Geneva: "Lake Trout Capital of the World."
"Write it down," I called to my wife. And another city was added to the growing list of world capitals I have visited or heard about. 
 Anybody can go to capitals like Washington, London, Paris, Rome, Madrid or Beijing. But how many have been to the world capital of apples, artichokes, barbed wire, charcoal, chili, dandelions, ferrets, garlic, horseradish, pretzels, seafood, spinach or toothpicks?
I have, either in person or vicariously, by clipping newspapers and magazines. My latest tabulation includes 465 world capitals, ranging from accordion (Castelfidano, Italy) to youth unemployment (New York City).
What makes world capitals? It's rather who makes them. They are named by chambers of commerce and writers who use the phrase "world capital" as a shorthand device for describing a place's major product or attraction.
I have done it myself, creating some world capitals in writing for this newspaper. Among them are Chazy, N.Y., the world capital of McIntosh apples; Hurley, N.Y., the sweet corn capital of the world, and Rhinebeck, N.Y., the anemone capital of the world.
It would be impossible to visit all the world capitals, so I also rely on tipsters and publications for reporting new ones. My older daughter, for example, while driving along Interstate 10 near Gulfport, Miss., glimpsed a billboard reading "The Root Beer Capital of the World." Even though I have been to Gulfport, I still have not found out why it has that title. Do they make root beer there or just drink it?
Just recently, my younger daughter sent me a clipping from The Hartford Courant calling Connecticut the witch hazel capital of the world. There was an explanation in this case: it said that every drop of witch hazel produced in the United States comes from two companies in that state.
That seems justified. But there are other claimants to the identical titles of world capital that are disputable even after my research.
How can anyone judge which of the following is entitled to the singular honor of being the catfish capital of the world: Des Allemands, La, or Belzoni, Miss.?
Or the golf capital of the world: Myrtle Beach, S.C., or Palm Springs, Calif., or Pinehurst, N.C.? How about the horseradish capital of the world: Tule Lake, Calif., or Collinsville, Ill.?
Or the watermelon capital of the world: Weatherford, Tex.; Rush Springs, Okla., and Hope, Ark. The last is well known these days, of course, because it is the birthplace of President Clinton, but no articles so far have described him as a watermelon fancier.
I feel more comfortable, though, about choosing the seafood capital of the world because my wife and I have eaten in both -- Crisfield, Md., and Calabash, N.C.
On balance, I would give the nod to Calabash, a town of about 150, where we had a choice of 21 seafood restaurants. Second prize to Crisfield, which is also called the oyster capital of the world. Despite that, the best oysters I can remember eating were at Murrells Inlet, S.C., and Apalachicola, Fla.
In the quest for superior seafood, we obviously have been to Rockland, Me., the lobster capital of the world. And we have even traveled to Bayou La Batre, which modestly boasts of being only the seafood capital of Alabama.
In the various subdivisions of seafood, how could I forget visits to Baltimore, the crab cake capital of the world? Or the salmon capital of the world, Ketchikan, Alaska, which is also the canned salmon capital of the world. I haven't found any canned tuna fish capital of the world yet, although that is one of my favorite foods, but Galilee, R.I., claims to be the tuna capital of the world, based on fishing, not canning.
Other fish capitals, in addition to Geneva, N.Y., include Birchwood, Wis., the bluegill capital of the world; Waterville, Minn., the bullhead capital of the world; Breaux Bridge, La., the crayfish capital of the world; Fort Thompson, S.D., the paddlefish capital of the world, and Okeechobee, Fla., the speckled perch capital of the world.
For meat lovers, mecca is Lincoln, Neb., the steak capital of the world. But you'll have to go to Owensboro, Ky., to reach the barbecued mutton capital of the world or Memphis, Tenn., for the barbecued pork capital of the world or either Sheboygan, Wis., or Bucyrus, Ohio, each of which claims to be the bratwurst capital of the world.
Sheboygan gets my vote because it also boasts that it is "the wurst city in the world."
That distinction might be disputed by some city in Germany, but I have not found any citations on that. I did, however, find one surprising capital in Germany -- Hamburg is the world capital of chicken salad. It was thus crowned by Mimi Sheraton in The New York Times on Aug. 27, 1983.
Speaking of capitals abroad, I can show documentation that London is the bathtub capital of the world; Qiaotao, China, the button capital of the world; Grand Manan Island, New Brunswick, the dulse capital of the world (and I had to go to the dictionary to find out that dulse is an edible red alga that grows on rocky oceanic shores); Dijon, France, the gastronomical capital of the world, and Pont-d'Ouilly, France, the kayak polo capital of the world.
But my records show that the United States is truly the capital of world capitals. Where else could you find capitals like these:
Apples, Wenatchee, Wash., and Winchester, Va.; barbed wire, De Kalb, Ill.; charcoal, Salem, Mo.; chili (cooked), Terlingua, Tex.; chili (peppers), Hatch, N.M.; crutches, Rumney, N.H.; dandelions, Vineland, N.J.; ferrets, Meeteetse, Wyo.; frogs, Rayne, La.; pretzels, Reading, Pa.; pork rind, Westminister, Ohio; purple martins, Griggsville, Ill.; roses, Tyler, Tex.; Spanish peanuts, Dawson, Ga. and spinach, Crystal City, Texas.
As a serious compiler of capitals, I soon found out that California is the (uncrowned) food capital of the world. Look at the list:
Almonds, Chico and Sacramento; asparagus, Isleton (disputed by Hadley, Mass.); artichokes, Castroville; avocados, Fallbrook; blackberries, McCloud; broccoli, Greenfield; dates, Indio; garlic, Gilroy; lettuce, Salinas; lima beans, Oxnard; raisins, Selma and Fresno, and strawberries, Watsonville (disputed by Plant City, Fla.).
Many cities and states have dual claims to being world capitals, but New York City outdoes them all. Not only is it truly the world capital as the home of the United Nations but it is also the world capital of capital because of Wall Street. More than that, though, it also bears the title of world capital in the following categories:
Advertising, art, the arts, art theft, bagels and lox, communications, corruption, credit card crime, dance, entertainment (disputed by Las Vegas, Nev.), food stamp fraud, glamour, herring (many European cities would certainly question that), jazz (New Orleans would differ), media, noise, pop music, private schools, publishing, skyscrapers (but Chicago has the tallest building in the world), theater (I, however, would opt for London) and youth unemployment.
To end this smorgasbord of cities with dessert, why not a trip to these capitals: cherries, Traverse City, Mich.; chocolate, Hershey, Pa.; fruit cake, either Corsicana, Tex., or Clayton, Ga.; coffee, Seattle, Wash., and Champagne, Rheims, France. For those so inclined, add the toothpick capital of the world, Strong, Me.
And I have citations to prove all of the above.

HEADLINE: THE NEW SEASON: ARTS/ARTIFACTS;
Craftsmanship, American To the Core

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG; Verlyn Klinkenborg is the author of "The Last Fine Time," a nonfiction work about Buffalo in the 1940's.

 BODY:
It's not uncommon to grow up in America believing that home is the graveyard of esthetics, a place where the numbing, comforting everydayness of family life covers even beautiful objects with a pall of invisibility. It can be hard to see the furnishings of domestic life for what they are simply because they are so thoroughly put to use, more palpable to the hand than to the eye. That may be why at museums you often find the largest crowds in the gift shops and cafeterias, places where deeply familiar transactions like shopping and eating occur, rather than in the galleries, where the vital strangeness of art is evidenced once more.
And yet the vital strangeness of high art, as well as an oddly moral, almost political appeal, marks the extraordinary objects -- furniture, pottery, silver, textiles -- created for domestic use by the artisans of the American Arts and Crafts movement in the first two decades of this century. Some 200 of the finest of those objects, drawn from public and private collections across the country, will be gathered at the American Craft Museum for an exhibition, opening on Oct. 21, called "The Ideal Home: 1900-1920," the first of a series of annual shows in the museum's proposed decade-long retrospective of crafts in the 20th century. 
 The polarities of the Arts and Crafts movement -- and of the objects gathered in "The Ideal Home" -- are as extreme as the polarities in American society itself. The movement encompassed the stained glass of Louis Comfort Tiffany, largely intended for his wealthy patrons, as well as the crafts made in urban settlement houses, like Chicago's Hull-House, and in craft communities like the Byrdcliffe Colony in Woodstock, N. Y.
At the heart of the movement was a vision of creative, individual handwork, supported by fraternal or sororal fellowship. Yet its designs were also disseminated to a mass audience in the form of sewing kits, for instance, and in product lines by Gustav Stickley, among others, that ran all the way from blueprints for Craftsman houses to trademark Stickley linens, several of which appear in "The Ideal Home." The movement revived traditional arts, often enlisting the aid of recent immigrants and American Indians, and it had an essential conception of the healing quality, the wholeness of craft-work, its capacity to reintegrate one's identity, that survives to this day in home woodshops and therapeutic craft courses across the land. As Charles Lummis, an early devotee of Southwestern culture, said, "Any fool can write a book, but it takes a man to dovetail a door."
We're used to the idea of art as manifesto, but the idea of craft as manifesto comes as something of a surprise. The meaning of craft appears to be contained in the functionality of the objects it creates and in what Janet Kardon, director of the American Craft Museum and curator of "The Ideal Home," calls the craftsperson's "homage to the hand, to material, to process." There seems to be no room left for didacticism in the spare design, the transparency of purpose, of such objects in "The Ideal Home" as the furniture of Gustav Stickley, the pottery of Adelaide Alsop Robineau or Maria Longworth Nichols, or the embroidery of the Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework. Yet the philosophical lineage to which such work belongs can be traced to Emerson and Whitman in the United States and to Carlyle, Ruskin and William Morris in England. It's a lineage steeped in the sanctity of labor and deeply opposed to the social and psychological fissures caused by the Industrial Revolution.
A good machine, wrote William L. Price, the founder of a crafts colony at Rose Valley, Pa., "remains a tool that a thinking man may work, shaping the product by his volition. A bad machine is . . . automatic in its operations, requiring only a human feeder, who must with deadly regularity supply it with the material from which it, not he, makes the product." Price's description of the bad machine, written in 1904, sounds like an image of Odysseus in the cave of Polyphemus, watching his men being eaten one by one.
From an economic standpoint, whatever the principles of the movement, Price, like other craftspersons, was forced to compete with bad machines everywhere. Arts and Crafts designs were rapidly appropriated by commercial firms, and the history of the movement is littered with financial failures -- men and women who discovered that true handcrafts in a (bad) machine age were simply too expensive for the market -- the American home market -- they had in mind.
Alongside the simplicity of furniture by Stickley or Frank Lloyd Wright or the plainness of ceramics by Mary Chase Perry, the founder of the Pewabic Pottery in Detroit, also in this exhibition, there was a vein of medievalism, a Gothic strain, running through the American Arts and Crafts movement. What lies behind that medievalism is the assumption that there was a wholeness to life in the Middle Ages, that it was a time when a man's labor had not been appropriated from him, though this seems romantic at best and naive at worst. Such a belief belies the obvious fact that the very craftsmen admired by William Morris and his followers were individuals of highly refined skills, whose labor had already been separated from the mass of ordinary workers.
Part of what inspired this devotion to medieval objects is the apparent interpenetration of moral message and art in medieval crafts, the doctrinal force that permeates such art. But this is a narrow view of the Middle Ages, very much a product of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In a way, the work produced by the Arts and Crafts movement is less playful, less tolerant of the wide range of human experience -- more didactic, in fact -- than medieval art itself.
One of the most important precepts governing the movement was "total design," as James D. Kornwolf, professor of fine arts at the College of William and Mary, calls it in the catalogue for "The Ideal Home," which will be published by Harry N. Abrams. Everything, he writes, "from dinner fork to regional state plan, was made to conform to the same design principles." We live in an age of rapacious eclecticism. To a modern eye, the "total" designs of Wright or Stickley, the esthetic coherence, the unifying inspiration -- borrowed, as it were, from nature's own unceasing ability to weave variations on a master theme -- can seem either refreshing or stultifying, almost repressive.
TODAY, WHETHER FOR GOOD OR bad, we're more concerned with style than with design in the way that Wright might have used the word. The works of the Arts and Crafts movement are not about style but about some deeper bond between ethics and esthetics, a connection that derives directly from Morris. Style is the loosening of that bond, a liberation or a loss of seriousness, depending on your point of view.
World War I brought an end to the American Arts and Crafts movement. One of the ironies of that movement is that it served, quite unwittingly, as a precursor for total design in the machine age that followed the war, when the idea of handcrafts came to seem precious at best and when the repressive power of totalitarian design first made itself felt. It's the eclecticism of our own post-industrial period that has brought Stickley's furniture, for example, back into vogue during the last decade, decontextualized. The communal craft societies have largely gone, the settlement houses have disappeared, but there is a familiar feel to the objects they left behind because they are now part of the American vernacular, the polyglot language our homes speak from time to time, when we choose to hear them.

 BODY:

The Trains Down Under
Q. I will be visiting Australia in October and I would like to know if there are any cross-country trains there and if tickets for them can be bought in the United States. -- Nino Giaco, Howard Beach, Queens. 
 A. Australia is home to some of the most interesting train trips in the world, taking travelers through a continent of vast contrasts along thousands of miles of track.
Many long-distance trains offer first-class, deluxe and economy-class compartments, sleeping berths and reclining seats. Some have entertainment cars, in which a piano, video games and even slot machines are provided. And the Queenslander, which goes from Brisbane to Cairns, even has a disco car called Club Loco offering dance music.
For Americans traveling to Australia there are a variety of multi-trip passes available, which must be bought in the United States. Tickets for single trips can be bought before leaving, too.
The Austrailpass gives unlimited first-class and economy travel anywhere on the Australian rail network, including electric metropolitan trains. Prices range from $339 in economy for 14 days ($565 in first class) to $877 in economy for 90 days ($1,377 in first class).
The Austrail Flexi-Pass is good for 8 days' rail travel within a period of 60 days for $250 in economy and $413 in first class or 15 days within 90 days for $370 in economy and $585 in first.
The Kangaroo Road n'Rail Pass is good for unlimited first-class and economy travel anywhere on the Australian rail network plus selected bus travel with Australian Coachlines (one class only). Passes run from $511 in economy for 14 days ($811 in first class) to $897 in economy for 28 days ($1,193 in first class).
All tickets can be ordered through Rail Australia, ATS Tours, 100 North First Street, Suite 301, Burbank, Calif. 91502; telephone (800) 423-2880 or (818) 841-1030. The agency can also arrange hotel packages.
These are some of the train trips you might want to consider:
The Indian Pacific from Sydney to Adelaide to Perth, a 65-hour journey that runs every Monday and Thursday (Tuesday and Friday in Adelaide) through most of the year.
The Ghan, from Adelaide to Alice Springs, is a 22-hour trip that runs every Thursday all year and every Monday from April to January. Named after Afghan traders whose camel trains were at one time the only link between Australia's interior and Adelaide, the 908-mile journey takes you straight to the heart of the outback.
The Queenslander goes every Sunday from Brisbane to Cairns in 32 hours, a 1,044-mile journey that stops after 19 hours at Proserpine, gateway to the Great Barrier Reef.
 
Florida Keys Houseboats
 Q. We are interested in renting a houseboat in the Florida Keys this winter. Can you give me any names and addresses of rental agencies and some idea of the cost? -- R. John Currie, Somers, N.Y.
A. Three companies in the Key Largo area would probably provide what you are looking for.
Coral Bay Houseboat Rentals, Post Office Box 1414, Islamorada, Fla. 33036, (305) 664-3111, is at mile marker 81.5 at the Coral Bay Marina on the bay side of Islamorada. Boats are restricted to a cruising radius of around 25 miles (Key Largo to the north and Long Key to the south). The 34-by-12-foot houseboats, which sleep six, have a dining booth with a couch and table that each convert into a double bed, a stateroom with a closet, a bathroom with a shower, and a hand-pumped toilet. A week's rental is $850; three weekdays are $450 and a three-day weekend (either Friday to Sunday or Saturday to Monday) is $500. Rates apply all year.
Smilin' Island Houseboat Rentals, Post Office 3003, Key Largo, Fla. 33037, (305) 451-1930, is at mile marker 99.5 on the bay side at Key Largo. The boats come in two sizes, 42 feet and 52 feet. The 52 footer sleeps 10 and has central air-conditioning, television and a VCR, a microwave oven and an 11-foot Boston Whaler runabout. Rates from Sept. 15 to Dec. 15 are $850 for a three-night weekend, $950 for four nights at midweek and $1,450 for seven nights. From Dec. 15 to May 15 rates go up by $200. The rate for the 52 footer does not include fuel, which is about $100 a week. The 52 footer can be docked only at its home marina or anchored in Florida Bay. Cruising is restricted to an area roughly within the southern boundary of the Everglades National Park. The 42 footer sleeps six and overnight docking at nearby marinas is permitted. From Sept. 15 to Dec. 15, rates, which include fuel, are $600 for a three-night weekend, $700 for four midweek nights and $1,000 for seven nights. From Dec. 15 to May 15 rates go up by $200.
Houseboat Vacations of the Florida Keys, Post Office Box 1202, Islamorada, Fla. 33036, (305) 664-4009 is at mile marker 85.9 on the bay side. Houseboats are available at 40 feet, 42 feet, 45 feet and 46 feet and cruising is permitted within 40 miles of the marina. The boats are permitted to dock at any of the local marinas or to anchor in the bay. Rentals, which are for a minimum of two days, range from $350 to $550 depending on the size of the boat. Weekly rates are from $860 to $1,550.
 
Island Weather
 Q. I will be cruising at the end of December in the Azores and the Canary Islands. What sort of weather can I expect? -- A. Sheinin, Long Beach, L.I.
A. The Azores, about 800 miles west of Portugal, have a very mild climate throughout the year, with no great extremes of temperature.
In December the high averages 62 degrees, with precipitation at 4.4 inches (compared with 3.6 inches in New York City, for example). Average lows are 55 degrees.
The Canaries, some 60 miles off North Africa, are even more agreeable. Average highs are 72 degrees (dipping to 60) with only 1.6 inches of precipitation.

HEADLINE: City's Colleges Add $2 Billion In Facilities

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
NO ONE is going back to school at the College of Staten Island this month. Rather, its 12,000 students are traveling to a place they have never been before: a 204-acre campus with 19 buildings, new and old, on the grounds of the infamous Willowbrook State School for the mentally retarded.
Although this $374 million campus is easily the largest academic property under development in New York City, it is by no means the only one. Major colleges and universities have either launched, planned or recently completed more than three dozen projects -- about $2 billion worth of construction, renovation and acquisition. 
 These include what may become the tallest academic center in town: the 50-story former G.E. Building, at Lexington Avenue and 51st Street, which General Electric gave to Columbia University in July. Columbia has several other big projects in the works, as do New York University, St. John's University, Fordham University, Brooklyn Law School and Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
But the private efforts are dwarfed by the City University of New York, where a construction pipeline that opened in the 80's is now disgorging enormously ambitious projects, including the Willowbrook campus, by some of the city's leading architects. Once that pipeline empties in 1994, however, it is likely to stay rather dry for several years.
"We're at a peak in terms of opening things," said Donal E. Farley, who retired in January as senior vice chancellor of City University for facilities planning, construction and management. "We have stopped in terms of new initiatives, but we still have momentum with the projects that were financed two or three years ago."
Almost every City University project is financed by the New York State Dormitory Authority, which also underwrites private projects -- and not just dormitories, despite its name -- through the sale of tax-exempt bonds. It has paid some $850 million to contractors statewide this year, up from $450 million five years ago, said Sam R. Davidson, deputy executive director for construction.
"I'm doing more construction than ever," Mr. Davidson said. "We're building like crazy and spending a lot of money. But within a year, things are just going to be lopped off. And there's a lot of stuff that we won't be doing in the future."
At a time when commercial development is all but frozen, schools, hospitals, courthouses and other institutional or government work becomes even more critical.
"Public construction programs are basically keeping the construction industry going in New York City," said Rudolph J. Rinaldi, who left his post last week as the city's Buildings Commissioner to become executive director of the Dormitory Authority. "It's essential. Without it, the economy would have been hit in a tremendous way."
The senior vice president of Columbia, Joseph P. Mullinix, said: "We have not retreated the same way you see many private developers at this point. On the other hand, we've certainly adjusted our sights. We've slowed down a lot of renovation projects largely for the tightness of funding."
And public projects have their own logic, said Arthur Zabarkes, dean of the real estate institute at New York University's School of Continuing Education. "The pipeline is so slow for public projects that they're there whenever they're there -- independent of interest rates, construction needs and the business cycle in general."
The Chancellor of the City University, Dr. W. Ann Reynolds, described this logic: "When the country's economy slumps, our enrollments are still very strong. People choose that time, when they see what's coming at them, to train themselves for different careers. Or, if you lose that job, you take more hours to get through school." She said City University's enrollment had grown to 203,000 from 197,000 in three years.
"We create jobs in the building of these facilities," said Robert E. Buxbaum, acting vice chancellor for planning and construction, "and then these facilities produce students who go out and get jobs."
There are distinct advantages to building during a slump. Fordham's residence hall at the Lincoln Center campus cost $39 million -- about $13 million less than was budgeted. Some of the savings were used to rebuild an arid plaza as a more verdant, inviting academic quadrangle, said Dr. Brian J. Byrne, the vice president for administration.
"It is not a good time economically for any institution of higher education," Dr. Byrne said. "On the other hand, we have to make investments in the future and it happens to be a good time for capital investments."
Dr. Reynolds said, "I'm just taking a breath and rejoicing in the facilities that have come on line." These include new academic centers for Hostos Community College in the Bronx and Baruch College in Manhattan, a new athletic center at Lehman College in the Bronx and extensive renovations and a new sports field at City College.
For sheer size, none of these rivals the College of Staten Island. Said to be the largest campus in New York City, public or private, its grounds are ordered along a formal north-south axis that bisects two broad quadrangles, skirts a mature stand of oak and pine trees and leads to the high ground from which a copper-domed library rises. Echoing the library at the lower end of the axis is a domed student center, whose airy rotunda serves as the student cafeteria.
The college had been split between St. George and Sunnyside. "We've been working out of two separate campuses five miles apart," said the president, Edmond L. Volpe. "It has been exceptionally difficult and expensive." He credited State Senator John J. Marchi with the idea of reusing Willowbrook, after that institution closed in 1987. "Turning this national symbol of degradation and pain into a symbol of hope is something we're very proud of," Mr. Volpe said.
As many as 2,400 more students may be attracted to the new campus, Mr. Volpe said, with most probably coming from Brooklyn. But the college's newfound grandeur may also have drawbacks for those accustomed to more cramped quarters. Raymond F. Pavia, the dean of administration, demurred when asked the length of Alumni Walk, the broad axial allee that ties the grounds together. "We don't like to emphasize it," he explained, "because students complain about having to walk so far between classes."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Analyzing Trends;
The Only Thing That's Clear Is the Lack of Clarity

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
"COMMERCIAL real estate activity continues to improve." -- Julien J. Studley.
"Office market shows signs of revitalization as leasing activity picks up." -- Newmark Real Estate. 
 But then there's this:
"Despite sharp increase in lease activity, negative absorption rate continues." -- Williams Real Estate.
"New York commercial real estate market remains volatile." -- CB Commercial.
Whom to believe?
Getting a fix on New York's commercial real estate market is rough these days. And the reports spewing forth from the large brokerages don't make a would-be analyst's life any easier.
Indeed, depending on whom you ask, rents are up, rents are down, rents are stagnant. Concession packages are niggardly, concession packages are generous. The rent gap between downtown and midtown is widening, is narrowing. Tenants are expanding, are contracting, are doing lateral arabesques into same-sized but better space. Brokers are doing well, brokers are fighting to survive.
It's all reminiscent of the old joke about the accountant who, when asked what certain numbers meant, replied, "Well, what do you want them to mean?"
"No one's ever seen a market like this, so no one knows what to make of it," said Stephen B. Siegel, chief executive of Edward S. Gordon Company. "The lack of job growth, the shrinking of Corporate America, the drying up of construction funds -- there are just no historic parallels to draw on."
Some things do seem clear. Leasing activity is frenzied throughout Manhattan, and rents have stopped their downward plunge. Large blocks of contiguous space in prime buildings are scarce. Overall vacancy rates are down a few tenths of a percent, hovering around 16 percent. Since there's been virtually no new construction, that should mean more absorption of space.
But even that seemingly obvious extrapolation does not go uncontested. Take Morgan Stanley's recent purchase of 1585 Broadway, near 48th Street. On the surface, it removed 935,000 square feet -- what's left in the 1.3- million-square-foot building after subtracting the 365,000 square feet occupied by its only tenant, the law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn -- from the market, and put a stamp of approval on the Times Square area.
"This transaction gave people confidence that the financial community is staying in New York, it took a huge building off the market and it extended midtown's western end to Broadway," said Charles R. Borrok, a vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield.
BUT there's a dark side, too. Morgan Stanley is tossing the million-or-so square feet it now rents back into the swollen space pool. And 1585 had been so tied up in squabbles among its owners that few brokers or tenants ever considered it viable space.
"The Morgan Stanley deal is adding space to the market, not taking it out," said Michael T. Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate. Added Lizann Galbreath, vice chairman of Galbreath Riverbank:
"It's just another sign of space-shuffling activity."
The glass-half-empty, glass-half-full debate doesn't stop at 1585 Broadway. If anything, the real estate market has grown so polarized that generalities are specious.
"If you have a post-1968 building on Avenue of the Americas, your market is getting better," said Mr. Cohen. "If you've got a post-war cookie-cutter building on Third Avenue, nothing's improved."
The same dichotomy exists for tenants, he continued. "If you want huge chunks of space in a Class A building, your choices are dwindling," he said. "But most tenants still have a bewildering array of alternatives."
The leasing volume certainly gives the appearance of a healthy market. But there's a lot of smoke and mirrors at play. Many tenants are signing leases now because their leases are expiring and because they can still get huge concessions and low rents.
"Today's deals are wonderful for tenants, and brokers are making money, but owners are still struggling," said Mike Solomon, a vice chairman of Julien J. Studley.
Still, with real estate, perception is often more important than reality. And many landlords are viewing the heightened interest from tenants as a sign that the buyer's market is finally turning.
Many are becoming less willing to give away the store.
"In the better buildings, tenants are asking for $60 or $65 in contributions to work, but they're settling for $40 to $45," said Steven J. Riker of Abrams, Benisch, Riker.
Landlords may soon be better able to stand their ground with retail tenants, too.
"Broadway is hotter than a pistol and you have to shoehorn your way into SoHo," reports Faith H. Consolo, a managing director of Garrick-Aug. Benjamin Fox, an executive vice president of New Spectrum Real Estate, makes a similar point about 34th Street. "The vacancy rate between Fifth Avenue and Eighth Avenue is less than 4 percent," he said. "A few years ago it was triple that."
But the two part ways on cause and effect. Ms. Consolo says that increased demand has led to a "tremendous firming" of retail rents in the last two months; Mr. Fox says that chains like the Gap and Duane Reade, which already have dozens of stores in Manhattan, are the ones doing the leasing these days, and they have the clout to drive hard bargains.
"RENTS have come down 30 percent on average all over town, and that's what's spurring leasing activity," he said.
Not much is spurring leasing in the B-building market, though. In the height of the recession, many B-building tenants took the so-called "flight to quality," replicating their space in a higher quality building for the same rents. That flight continues.
"One of the biggest problems in the B-market is that tenants can afford to move back to midtown," said Fred I. Adlman, executive director of Winoker Realty.
Few B-building landlords can take a hard stance on concessions. The first new tenants in several years at 360 Lexington Avenue, a bankrupt Class B building on 40th Street, got $40 a square foot, much more than previously offered, to customize the space. Similarly, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, a B building near 40th Street, leased six of seven vacant floors only after the landlord put in a concierge desk and other amenities.
"We have to work 10 times as hard to make a deal today," said Mr. Adlman, whose firm manages both buildings.
But the gloom is not unanimous even among B-building owners. Jeffrey Gural, who co-owns or manages some 40 B-buildings in various parts of Manhattan, notes that his buildings are nearly fully rented and that rents are inching up. Even more important, his tenants are finally all paying their rents.
"The tenants who were going to go broke already have, and everything seems pretty stable right now," he said.
AMIDST all the disagreement, there are some undisputed positive signs. The decisions by Mastercard and the Associated Press to stay in Manhattan gave apsychological boost to the New York market. Morgan Stanley's purchase of 1585, whatever its impact on available space, did so as well.
"If you can renew your space in a Class A building for $32, and you don't have to pay for moving, it really doesn't cost a lot more to stay than to go to Connecticut," said Arthur H. Lerner, a Newmark vice chairman.
The upsurge in building sales also bodes well for New York City's economic recovery.
"The three most significant transactions in the last year were Morgan Stanley and 1585, Bertelsmann and 1540 Broadway, and Mutual of America and 320 Park Avenue, and all of those represented companies locking in their futures by buying their headquarters," said Peter Riguardi, executive vice president of Koeppel, Tener, Riguardi.
Sales of smaller buildings, like the sale of 4 East 54th Street to Banco Di Napoli, are even more numerous. "This sales trend normally precedes an upturn in leasing," said James S. Meiskin, senior managing director of Wm. A. White/Grubb & Ellis.
Still, few real estate experts expect a real market turnaround without job growth. And no one really sees that happening yet.
"This market is like a patient that's been running a real high fever," said Mr. Riker of Abrams Benisch Riker. "Once the fever breaks, you know the patient will recover. But for now, he still feels lousy."

 BODY:
OVER the last generation the 1931 Whitney Museum of American Art, at 8 West Eighth Street, has slowly sunk from raffish bohemianism to a neglected decay.
But now the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture, which owns the building, is making the first repairs in a multiyear restoration project that will sand down, but not off, the rough edges of one of New York's art monuments. 
 The museum was founded by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Though her grandfather was Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt and her husband was the playboy-financier Harry Payne Whitney, she did more than just bounce around the New York-Newport society circuit.
According to Avis Berman, author of "Rebels on Eighth Street" (Atheneum, 1990), within a few years of her marriage in 1896 Gertrude Whitney discovered that her husband was unfaithful, and she decided to become a sculptor. She took up with a group of artists who formed the Ashcan School -- Robert Henri, John Sloan, William Glackens and others. They were fighting to establish artistic realism in a conservative atmosphere of society portraits and soothing landscapes.
In 1907 she took a studio on Macdougal Alley, a street of stables serving the flanking rows of houses on Washington Square North and Eighth Street. She proved to have only moderate talent as a sculptor but excelled as an organizer.
In 1914 she took over the adjacent rowhouse at West Eighth Street for a meeting place and gallery for other artists on the outs with the establishment.
Gradually, she added the houses at 10, 12 and 14 West Eighth Street -- as well as their corresponding stables on Macdougal Alley -- and what had become the Whitney Studio Club became a center of advanced thinking in American art.
John Sloan and Reginald Marsh had their first one-man shows there and in 1924 the club mounted the first exhibit of American folk art, a complete reversal of the old-master theory of collecting that had dominated the 19th century.
Mrs. Whitney also directly supported artists with gifts, loans and purchases, and by the late 1920's she had amassed a collection of about 500 works by Hopper, Bellows, Prendergast, Sloan and others.
In 1929 she offered these to the Metropolitan Museum of Art along with $5 million for a new wing.
The Met, long criticized for collecting dead artists but ignoring the living, rejected the offer and, says Ms. Berman, Mrs. Whitney and her assistant, Juliana Force, concocted the idea of their own museum, specifically to serve American artists while they were still alive.
Mrs. Whitney retained the architects Noel & Miller, who in 1931 rebuilt 8, 10 and 12 West Eighth with a coating of salmon-colored stucco and a modernistic entranceway. The stucco veneer was by then a standard solution for redoing old houses, but the doorway shouted out with the novelty of a brave new post-Crash architecture.
Severe white marble columns support a giant entablature, itself topped by an eagle in white metal designed by Karl Free, a painter and curator at the new museum.
Aluminum strips are bundled into giant, reed-like columns and the sidewalk is in diaper-shaped sections of pink and gray tints. Aluminum outer doors, with American-flag stars and Art Moderne details set in red Numidian marble, were removed when the Whitney left the building in 1954.
The interior, designed by the decorator Bruce Buttfield with the architects, began with a striking, almost surreal, vestibule with a vibrant terrazo floor, a double staircase with strange, tendril-like balusters and sculpture niches with starkly realistic figures of nymphs.
IT is difficult to document, but the rest of the interior changed repeatedly over the next decade. The changes showed how architects and designers were starting from scratch with the advent of modern design.
Baseboards have a strange, angular top molding. The mahogany hand rail on a stairway ends in a supremely exaggerated curlicue.
Rectangular light fixtures mix the Federal-era symbols of five-pointed stars with blue glass and metal casing recalling several periods.
Douglas Morgan, development director of the New York Studio School, calls this synthesis "Early American Deco Empire."
Indeed, the controlling personality of the museum building is its furious mixture of styles and periods. A 19th-century pier mirror faces a nightclub-modern rest-room entrance.
Italianate door and room moldings co-exist with sophisticated 1930's gallery lighting. Ancient wooden stair balusters run past Art Moderne doorways.
The old Whitney is rich with the presence of artists. To close off a hidden staircase, Robert Locher painted a trompe l'oeil doorimitating a staircase.
A fragment of Thomas Hart Benton's mural series on American arts survives in the original library -- an arc with the words "She'll Be Wearin' Red Pajama."
AND Gertrude Whitney's studio, on Macdougal Alley, is eye-popping, one of the great unknown interiors in New York, designed by Robert Chanler. In a high, whitewashed space of plain brick walls a blaze of sculptured flame encases a chimney. As it reaches the ceiling, the flame changes into waves and clouds, spreading out over a ceiling sea of fantastic figures -- dragons, sea horses, demons, mermaids, angels and octopi.
The Whitney Museum opened in 1931 with George Bellows's "Dempsey and Firpo" painting of a boxing match as a centerpiece symbolizing its challenging stance.
"There may be pictures here that you do not like, but they are here to stay, so you may as well get used to them," Mrs. Force declared at the opening.
In 1932 came the first of the Whitney's Biennial exhibitions, pilloried in the press, according to "Rebels on Eighth Street." The museum -- for another decade largely reflecting the personalities of Gertrude Whitney and Juliana Force -- continued to join in controversy without reservation.
Active in helping unemployed artists in the Depression, it got criticism that much larger (and less helpful) institutions were spared.
Mrs. Whitney died in 1942 and Mrs. Force in 1948. In 1954 the Whitney moved up to West 54th Street, behind the Museum of Modern Art, finally relocating to its present site at 75th Street and Madison Avenue in 1966.
The old building remained, however, bought by the New York Studio School in 1967. It is now a picturesque gaggle of studio spaces, with ancient linoleum coming up off even more ancient pine floors and with puddles of clay, paint and other materials everywhere.
But when skylights leak and walls shift, the possibilities move from the artistic to the catastrophic.
With a historic-structures report by Li/ Saltzman Architects and Wesley Haynes, the school is beginning to make $600,000 in emergency repairs on the gutters, exterior walls, roofing and skylights.
At the same time it is planning to raise $5 million more to restore the dingy facade and make other interior repairs. Mr. Morgan said the result would be not spotless and museum-like, but still an art school awash with dribbled paint and the baggage of artists who are living, not dead -- very close to the spirit of the original institution.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Music of Many Lands at Grace Church's 'Noonday Getaway'

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHERMAN

 BODY:
THIRTY years ago, chamber music was the province of the listening elite. Record companies and presenters avoided it because it didn't sell and classical radio stations reserved it for late evening hours when it wouldn't drive away most of their audience.
All of that has changed, thanks in part to the pioneering work of groups like the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, to the high cost of presenting larger ensembles and to sundry other considerations that would make an interesting doctoral thesis. Whatever the causes, chamber music today occupies an important and much-loved segment of our musical awareness. 
 As the new season beckons, we note with delight the abundance of listening pleasures in store countywide.
Friends of Music, which was ahead of its time in anticipating the new public acceptance of chamber music, is about to begin its 40th season, bringing us some of the finest soloists and ensembles in the country. In the Ossining High School auditorium on Sept. 25, in fact, two superb string quartets will be on hand, the Cleveland Quartet and its protege, the Ying Quartet, winner of the 1993 Naumburg Award. The groups will top their individual Beethoven and Bloch performances with the Mendelssohn Octet.
The renowned pianist Richard Goode gives a solo recital in October, and a similarly high standard continues with later visits from the New York Chamber Soloists, the Lark Quartet and the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio. Those wishing more information may call 271-4657 or 271-4800.
What Friends of Music is doing in Ossining, the Westchester Chamber Music Society does in Rye, with a world-class five-recital series at Congregation Emanu El.
Four elegant performers -- Christopher O'Riley, Pamela Frank, Paul Neubauer and Carter Brey -- join forces Nov. 14 to present piano quartets of Mozart, Brahms and Aaron Jay Kernis; in December, it is a meeting of the musical minds between Oscar Shumsky and the Emerson Quartet (a rescheduling of a program that had to be canceled last year because of the violinist's illness); and in the new year, the Hagen and Tokyo Quartets and the Mannes Trio. The reservations numbers are 948-6533 or 723-0222.
The Pleasantville Chamber Music Society has once again made tickets unnecessary for its Sunday afternoon series, beginning Nov. 21 at the Presbyterian Church. How the wizards at the society have been able to maintain this no-admission-cost policy through 17 years of inflation is a wonder, but we can be grateful.
Appearing at the Nov. 21 opener is a new group, L'Estro Harmonico, with a promise of an old favorite, Schubert's "Trout" Quintet; later concerts are by the Arden Trio, the Manhattan String Quartet and, in March, a Baroque finale with the flutist John Solum and friends. No reservations are required, but for a flier call 769-1827.
Chamber music, as the phrase suggests, originated in intimate, often private surroundings, rather than the churches, schools and other large halls in which it is most often found today. Performers of Westchester is based on the premise that sonatas, quartets and so forth are still best served by being in a warm, intimate atmosphere, so all of its programs take place in private homes.
"When you attend our concerts," said the publicity director, Linda Caigan, "you are one of a small audience and experience an unequaled intimacy with the music and musicians. Following each performance, refreshments are served and you have an opportunity to talk with the artists."
High on the list of those artists is Stanley Drucker, first clarinetist of the New York Philharmonic, who opens the season on Oct. 1 and 2 with his wife (and fellow clarinetist), Naomi Drucker, and the pianist Miriam Brickman.
Later on the Orion String Quartet and the standout violin-piano team of Maria Bachmann and Jon Klibanoff will perform, among others. Those interested in locations and reservations may call 693-1151.
Among concert offerings this week is the season opener of Music at Concordia at the College in Bronxville at 8 P.M. Friday when Susan Deaver and David Allen Coester present what they describe as "a quiet evening of chamber music" (337-9300).
Another opening follows at 8 P.M. on Saturday when the Greenleaf Chamber Players, an ensemble chartered to explore the repertory beyond that usually performed by string quartets and piano trios, begins its second season at SUNY Purchase with Schonberg's super-romantic "Transfigured Night" for String Sextet, and Mozart's Serenade No. 10, with its offbeat scoring of double bass and 12 wind instruments. The box office is at 251-6200.
Also at 8 P.M., the Philharmonia Virtuosi unveils its "Baroque With a Twist" series at the Peekskill Paramount, with Anton Nel, the Naumburg Award winner, playing Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 9, K. 271, and the ensemble's new concertmaster, Mela Tenenbaum, featured both in a Locatelli violin concerto and one by Vivaldi for viola d'amore, all with Richard Kapp conducting. The program will be given again next Sunday afternoon at the State University. For subscription or single-ticket reservations, call 693-5595.
While the Greenleaf and Philharmonia ensembles occupy the smaller halls at SUNY, the New Orchestra of Westchester begins its season in Theater A with two concerts, at 8 P.M. Saturday and 3 P.M. next Sunday.
Tedd Joselson, a Westchester native, is the featured soloist, with the music director, Paul Lustig Dunkel, surrounding his performance of the Prokofiev Second Piano Concerto with two symphonic staples, Berlioz's Roman Carnival Overture and the Beethoven "Pastoral." Credit card reservations are accepted at the orchestra's offices, at 682-3707.
Most local choirs are just beginning rehearsals, so it will be two months before the musical results are available. Not so the 30-voice Coro Laboratorio, from Fano, Italy, which has included the Rye Presbyterian Church on its first American tour. Under the direction of Paola Urbinati, the ensemble will present works of the Italian Renaissance and Baroque periods, plus choruses of Rossini and Verdi, at 8 P.M. Saturday.
There is no admission charge, but donations will be accepted at the door. For details, phone the church office at 967-0842.

Curious Wrinkle in the Mexican Play

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
TO show how closely Mexican stocks mimic the ups and downs of the pending North American Free Trade Agreement, financial analysts point to a chart that plots stock values with Nafta news.
Check Oct. 4, 1992, the day then-candidate Bill Clinton announced his conditional support for the agreement. The Mexican market index -- then at 1,250 and sliding -- suddenly turned skyward. Then look at Jan. 20, 1993, Inauguration Day for President Clinton, when he gave his mixed message that he would support the agreement, but only if side accords were reached. In Mexico, the stock index lurched up a bit, then sobered to turn sharply downward. 
 The past two years have been a roller-coaster ride for the Mexican stock market -- the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores -- and for United States investors enticed by relative bargains to stay the bumpy course. Many believed that by now everything about Nafta would have been wrapped up, or nearly so.
But even though the Bolsa index reached a new high of almost 1,950 on Tuesday, the steam ran out again. Congress's apparent reluctance to pass the historic deal before the Jan. 1 deadline set by the Mexican President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has even diehard Nafta supporters trying to hedge their bets -- even by just a bit -- to get over the next few rocky months.
"People are looking for something that gives some downside protection if Nafta fails, without giving up all the upside benefits if Nafta goes through," said Eduardo M. Cabrera, manager of Latin American equity research at Merrill Lynch & Company.
Analysts suggest hedging bets by shifting stocks or moving more heavily into bonds, but no strategy manipulates risk more completely than the warrants, or options, now being offered by groups like Serfin Securities, the New York broker-dealer for Grupo Financiero Serfin, a large Mexican banking and financial services company.
For a 20 percent premium, Serfin is offering a kind of Nafta insurance policy to limit losses to no more than the 20 percent premium in a basket of five industrial Mexican stocks. Of course, Serfin also keeps 20 percent of the gain if the value of the basket spurts beyond 20 percent.
"In that sense you can hedge yourself against the good and the bad," said Hernan Sabau, executive director of derivative products for Grupo Serfin in Mexico City.
The basket comprises shares from five of Mexico's largest companies: Telefonos de Mexico; Cemex, a cement producer; Cifra, an operator of supermarkets; Femsa, a brewery and bottling company, and Vitro, a glass manufacturer. Telmex is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The other companies are traded in the United States as American depository receipts.
Each share in the basket is a bet that the trade agreement will cause prices to fluctuate enough on the Bolsa this fall to make back the premium Serfin is charging. Investors can pledge a minimum of $10,000 for a share in the five-company basket. The initial installment on the premium is $6.65 per $100 invested with the balance due on Jan. 3, the first working day of the new year. The basket will reflect stock values as of last Friday.
Mr. Sabau said that on Jan. 3, investors who made the downpayment will have several options. If the value of the basket rises or falls by more than 20 percent, Serfin pays investors the difference between the current value and the Sept. 10 value, if investors exercise their option. Because of the 20 percent premium, using the option provides a gain only if prices rise or fall by more than the price of the premium.
Investors also have the option of simply backing out and forfeiting the initial premium.
"This is an instrument where people are hedged against good times or bad times," Mr. Sabau said. Investors are hurt, he said, only if stocks do not move up or down, and they lose their premium.
He said Serfin Securities is willing to grant $50 million worth of the stock warrants based on prices as of Sept. 10.
Some analysts said such a financial rabbit's foot carries too steep a premium for average investors. Mr. Cabrerra of Merrill Lynch believes that the time for hedging bets is past and that now investors have to decide for themselves whether they believe the trade agreement will or will not pass.
William Truscott, a portfolio manager in the Latin America group at Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc. of New York, said the continuing uncertainty hasn't caused him to change his view that the trade agreement is "of minimal significance," to the Mexican market over the long run. Thus, he is not planning to hedge.
The analysts at Bear, Stearns & Company have devised their own strategy. They recommend shifting away from higher performing but riskier stocks like those in the infrastructure, retail, banking, tourism and communications sectors and moving toward slower, steadier performers like food companies and mining and industrial suppliers dependent on overseas sales that would not be overly hurt by defeat of the trade agreement.
Analysts at the emerging markets unit of Lehman Brothers, increasingly worried about Nafta's prospects, have reduced their estimate of the chance for Nafta passage to 65 percent from 80 percent. "The way to hedge the market in general," said Lawrence D. Krohn,chief Latin American economist at Lehman Brothers, "is to back away from it now and see what happens."

HEADLINE: Higher Grazing Fees Have Ranchers Running Scared

BYLINE: By DOUG McINNIS; Doug McInnis, who has lived in Wyoming and Colorado, is a reporter for The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch.

DATELINE: LOST CABIN, Wyo.

 BODY:
WITH a cattle ranch 10 times the size of Manhattan, Rob Hendry might be expected to make a comfortable living. Instead, he worries about going broke, even though he often works from early morning until dark, seven days a week.
His future, he says, depends not on his own labor, but on Washington, where the Clinton Administration and Congress are reshaping Federal land policies that have long fueled the West's economy. Last month the new Administration moved to more than double grazing fees on Federal land, while imposing new environmental restrictions on its use. 
 These policies are of intense interest to Mr. Hendry and those who run 18,000 other Western ranches because they all pay to graze more than 30 million head of cattle and sheep on 260 million of the Government's acres. Many ranchers run on such a slim margin that any large increase in grazing fees would cut deeply into profits and even plunge some into losses. If, in response, ranchers cut back their operations, beef prices could rise and imports could begin to fill the void, he warns.
When Federal grazing fees are low, well-watered private land and large tracts of Federal land complement each other. It takes huge amounts of land to run cattle in a region where annual rainfall of six to nine inches is less than the Midwest may get in a week, and forage is extremely thin. But if grazing fees rise too high, the system may not work, ranchers say.
For their part, environmentalists have complained for years that ranchers were paying cut-rate fees, while damaging land by overgrazing. During 12 years of Republican Presidential rule, those charges got little attention. Bill Clinton's election changed matters. The stakes are huge. Government land in 12 Western states, including Alaska, equals all land east of the Mississippi, and much of that is vital to Western industries.
Wyoming, for example, ranks first in coal production, third in sheep, fifth in natural gas, and sixth in crude oil. Each industry relies on Federal land, which makes up 49 percent of the state. Those industries -- along with cattle ranching and timber -- provide many of the best-paying jobs and support service employment in cities like Casper, center of the region's petroleum industry. "If we lose oil and gas, mining and ranching, Casper dries up and blows away," Mr. Hendry said. "There's nothing else in town."
Traditionally, the Government has let ranchers use its land on favorable terms, and more than half of Wyoming's 5,000 ranchers do so. Federal lands make up nearly half of Mr. Hendry's 150,000-acre ranch, the Clear Creek Cattle Company.
Like other Western ranchers, Mr. Hendry, 36, considers the Federal land part of Clear Creek, which was begun by his Scottish immigrant grandfather in 1912 as a sheep ranch. During the Depression, Clear Creek survived only because its banks chose not to repossess it. After World War II, Mr. Hendry's father, Jim, 71, took it over and switched to cattle. Today, three generations of Hendrys -- Jim and his wife, Mary Helen, and Rob, his wife, Leslie, and sons James Wayne, 9, and Jarrod, 4 -- live in adjacent houses on the ranch 75 miles from Casper, the nearest city.
But changing Federal policies could tear up the age-old economics of ranching. Take Mr. Hendry's operation, which is larger than many Western ranches, but typical of the financial pressures these ranches face.
Mr. Hendry's land and livestock are worth roughly $5 million. After a string of losing years in the 1980's, the ranch turned profitable with an upturn in beef prices. It now makes about $60,000 a year after taxes, or a slim return of just over 1 percent on assets. And that profit is crucial to the ranch's survival because it pays for capital expenditures, like new trucks. (Mr. Hendry's salary is $850 a month, plus he gets free use of his house, which is owned by Clear Creek.)
The proposed grazing fee would cut deeply into those profits. Mr. Hendry now pays $1.86 a month for each "animal unit," which consists of a cow and calf, or five sheep. In the Clinton proposal, that would rise to $4.28 over three years. Mr. Hendry's total fees would rise from $13,450 to $30,450, and the $17,000 difference would come straight out of profits.
The new environmental rules are expected to add more costs. Those proposals would, among other things, shorten grazing seasons and curtail the use of pesticides for grasshopper control. They would also make it easier for the Government to terminate leases to ranchers who abuse the land.
In addition, the higher Federal gas taxes in the recent budget bill will cost the ranch about $700 a year. Down the road looms the possibility of Federally mandated health insurance for Clear Creek's four hired hands and their families. (The ranch offered health insurance once, but stopped as costs soared.)
IT would take little to put Clear Creek in the red. Mr. Hendry fears that a downturn in beef prices -- averaging $1.03 a pound for a 500-pound calf -- would be the final blow, leaving the ranch unable to pay interest on loans taken out in the 80's, when, like many Western ranches, Clear Creek expanded.
Just a nickel-a-pound drop would cause income to fall roughly $50,000 on the 2,100 calves Mr. Hendry markets each fall. Though no one can say where prices will go, big fluctuations are not unusual. In 1992 calf prices dropped about nine cents before rebounding this year, according to Cattle-Fax, a Denver research group.
Frank Shepperson, a rancher near Casper, is prepared to use less Federal land and run a smaller herd. If others follow suit, beef production would shrink and prices could rise, which would benefit ranchers elsewhere. Only about 20 percent of production is in Federal land states. Some Western cattle-producing states, like Texas and Nebraska, have little or no Federal grazing land.
Environmentalists are not impressed by these arguments. "This will not drive all the ranchers out of business," said June Rain, executive director of the Wyoming affiliate of the National Wildlife Federation. Nor, she said, will it result in $10 Big Macs, though she conceded that it could lift costs. "Every industry and citizen has to face the rising cost of a clean environment," she said.
THE federation said that more than two-thirds of 95 million acres of grazing land it studied was in unsatisfactory condition and that some areas should be off limits to grazing, but other parts can accommodate it if ranchers don't overdo it.
Environmental groups assert that overgrazing destroys vegetation along stream banks, and creates siltation, which damages trout populations. As cattle tromp through streams, they widen stream beds, which quickens evaporation, drying up a water supply on which wildlife depend.
Moreover, overgrazing causes grasslands to give way to sagebrush, mesquite and nonnative exotic grasses, environmentalists contend. In some cases, native wildlife won't eat these new grasses. And some invading plant species are not deeply rooted, and thus less effective in holding soils in place.
Two years ago, the General Accounting Office studied 20 million acres of Federal desert grazing land in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, and concluded that current levels of grazing risked long-term environmental damage. And, the G.A.O. said, grazing fees do not generate enough funds to manage the region properly.
Some middle ground may be found. Although the President's planned grazing fee may be cut back, ranchers say some increase is coming. "It's inevitable, and may be justified," Mr. Hendry said. "But to more than double it is pretty radical." Senators Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Democrat of Colorado, have proposed lifting fees only about 25 percent -- a plan recently endorsed by five Wyoming ranching organizations.
Mr. Hendry said Clear Creek could survive a modest fee increase. But Western sheep ranchers might not. They are losing money because lamb prices -- at 65 cents a pound -- are about five cents a pound below the break-even point, said Jim Magagna, a third-generation sheep rancher. Mr. Magagna runs 5,000 head on 500,000 acres in extremely arid southwestern Wyoming, all but about 4,000 acres of which is owned by the Government.
Mr. Magagna is contemplating something that was once unthinkable. "If they double it right now, and land prices stay in the range they've been in the last four years, I wouldn't even try to make money," said Mr. Magagna, past president of the American Sheep Industry Association. "My sheep would be sold."
If he quits ranching, the only other prime asset Mr. Magagna can salvage is the land he owns, which includes 2,500 acres at the foothills of the Wind River Mountains. If he must, he will sell it for ranchettes -- small parcels with vacation homes. For years, environmentalists have complained that cows and sheep compete with wildlife for scarce resources. They do not relish the idea of vacationing humans competing for those resources, too. "We do not want ranchettes," said Ms. Rain of the Wildlife Federation.
THE idea of using less Federal land is based on the nature of that land, which is the worst for grazing, less fertile than private land, and often without water. When settlers took homestead allotments they left marginal properties for the Government.
Mr. Shepperson is angered at the prospect of shrinking a ranch he expanded through winnings on the professional rodeo circuit. The Clinton Administration cares "more about a wolf and a spotted owl than they do about hungry children," he said.
Ranchers are also bitter because they say that their land is in much better shape than critics admit. As the elder Mr. Hendry drove the dirt roads of the ranch he built, he described practices intended to keep the land healthy. No land is grazed for more than one season. Herds are moved from range to range, summering as high as 9,000 feet, wintering in the lowlands. "If we destroy the land, we're out of business," he said.
Despite all the difficulties they face, Jim Hendry believes Western ranching will survive. "You have to believe that common sense will prevail," he said. "America simply cannot allow this to be turned into a recreation area and nothing else."

HEADLINE: Missing Out on a Glittering Market

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia

 BODY:
LES MUSIAL assumed that Malaysians lived in "straw huts or something" when the Chrysler Corporation dispatched him to Southeast Asia last year to help open its first manufacturing operation in the region in more than a decade.
Chrysler made him feel no more comfortable about the assignment when a company doctor presented him with 10 pounds of medicines -- "for malaria, for tropical diseases" -- apparently in the belief that local supplies might be lacking. 
 But Mr. Musial's qualms about Malaysia were upended the minute he landed at the marble-lined international airport here in the capital and began driving into one of the most modern cities in Asia, with residential neighborhoods that could be mistaken for California suburbs.
"I saw the skyscrapers, lots of skyscrapers, and the manicured lawns," he said. "There were good, new cars on the road. I thought that the technology and the industry would be in the beginning stages. But then you see the factories, and they are so advanced that you could put them anyplace on earth."
Mr. Musial was seeing for himself what many American business leaders have not yet seen, or have chosen to ignore -- that Southeast Asia is in the midst of an economic revolution that in several nations is creating glittering wealth where once there had been only abject poverty, and that Americans are welcome to profit from it.
Over the last decade, Southeast Asia has been the fastest-growing economic region on earth. Collectively, the major non-Communist nations of the region -- Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines -- already have a vast manufacturing base, and they are quickly creating a market here for imported goods. Among the more than 400 million people of Southeast Asia, a large and growing middle class is clamoring for American goods -- even as the market for American products has faltered in Japan and in Europe.
So why aren't more American companies here?
American businesses offer several answers to that question -- from the perception of widespread corruption among government bureaucrats in the region to the frustrations of doing business halfway round the world from the home office. But the larger reason that Americans shy away may be simple ignorance about the opportunities here.
 
An Ambassador's Plaints
 "We've really had to beat on American companies to get them out here," said John Wolf, the United States Ambassador to Malaysia, recounting his frustration in trying to persuade American companies to open marketing offices here and to bid on big government infrastructure projects, including this city's new $3 billion airport. "The place is in the chokehold of the Japanese, even though there is a fantastic potential for Americans."
To be sure, American investment in Southeast Asia has grown substantially in recent years, but the pace of Japanese investment has been much faster.
According to the Japanese Finance Ministry, that nation's cumulative investment in Asia, most of it in Southeast Asia, has tripled from $20 billion in 1985 to $60 billion at the end of last year. The latest total is almost double the $32.2 billion that the Commerce Department shows American companies have invested in the region, although the figures are not perfectly comparable because of different statistical methods.
The companies that account for most of the new American investment in the region are the same giants -- including Exxon, I.B.M., Coca-Cola -- that have been operating in Southeast Asia for years. More than 40 percent of American investment in Southeast Asia is in a single industry: petroleum.
In July, Chrysler began manufacturing right-hand-drive Jeep Cherokee utility vehicles in a plant just outside Kuala Lumpur, the company's first manufacturing operation in Southeast Asia since it pulled out in the late 1970's to deal with a severe domestic slump. Kmart announced last month that it would open stores in Singapore in its first large venture in Southeast Asia.
Yet Chrysler and Kmart are the exceptions to what American diplomats and members of the American business community here say is a distressing rule.
"There is an amazing lack of understanding as to the potential of Southeast Asia," said Roger Bertelson, general manager for Malaysia for Motorola, which has four factories in Malaysia and employs 12,000 people. With high-technology investments like Motorola's, Malaysia is now the world's largest exporter of computer chips.
"There needs to be a swift kick in the rear end for American businesses," said Robert D. Orr, the former American ambassador to Singapore, the futuristic city-state that functions as the hub of Southeast Asia's economic miracle. "I just don't think they understand what has happened in Southeast Asia."
 
Impressive Numbers
 The numbers bear out the opportunities. The economies of the six nations that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei -- have collectively experienced annual growth of 7 percent over the last decade. They grew 5.3 percent last year -- still impressive in light of the recession among Asean's large Western trading partners.
With 328 million people and a gross domestic product of more than $350 billion, the six Asean nations are already the fifth-largest export market for the United States, after Canada, Japan, the European Community and Mexico. Adding neighboring Taiwan and Hong Kong, Southeast Asia is a $600 billion economic powerhouse.
The export markets for American goods in Japan and Europe have stagnated since 1990, but the export market to the Asean nations has grown by more than 26 percent, reaching $24 billion last year.
There is still wrenching poverty in Southeast Asia. Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar (formerly Burma) remain among the poorest nations on earth and after years of upheaval, the Philippines has fallen far behind its non-Communist neighbors. But the overall trend in Southeast Asia is one of solid growth, stable governments and open markets.
The region's largest nation, Indonesia, home to 184 million people, has seen per capita income rise from $250 in 1985 to nearly $650 today, and seems likely to see it double again within a decade.
Despite concern that Indonesia could someday fragment along ethnic lines -- there are scores of major ethnic groups and hundreds of languages among Indonesia's 13,000 islands -- American investors already in the country say the risk seems far off, and they speak with enthusiasm about the Government's prudent economic planning, vast natural resources and cheap labor.
Malaysia is poised to become one of Asia's next economic tigers, notably through the development of high-technology industries. Singapore, with its enlightened economic planning and rigid social engineering, has emerged as the region's financial and technological center. Thailand's economy continues to grow rapidly despite political upheavals and a succession of recent governments.
And Vietnam, with 70 million people and a well-educated, low-wage labor force, is widely thought by foreign investors to be on the verge of an economic boom that will accelerate if President Clinton follows through on hints that he will lift, at least partly, an American trade embargo that dates from the Vietnam War.
In a few stretches of Southeast Asia, incomes approach, or even surpass, those of Western European nations. In Singapore, the per capita income is more than $15,000. In tiny, oil-rich Brunei, it is more than $17,000 -- wealth for buying imports.
Robert E. Driscoll, president of the U.S.-Asean Council, a Washington-based trade group that represents American companies doing business in the region, said that among Southeast Asians, "There is a cachet to owning American." Still, American business has largely ceded the market to Japanese competitors.
 
Detroit's Regret
 In Bangkok, Jakarta and Singapore, Southeast Asia's yuppies crowd expensive department stores bearing the names of Japanese retailing giants. The upper end of the small appliance market is virtually monopolized by Japanese brands, as is the auto market.
Detroit's decision in the 1970's to shut down Southeast Asian manufacturing operations just as the automobile market here was about to explode "was a shortsighted decision made on the basis of huge domestic losses and a need to restructure at home," Mr. Driscoll said. And now the price is being paid, as a generation of newly affluent Asian carbuyers buy Japanese.
The reluctance of more American businesses to establish operations here perplexes the Southeast Asians. "You have to be an absolute fool not to make money here," said Noordin Sopiee, director of Malaysia's Institute for Strategic and International Studies. "Our markets are open to you. Many people speak English. We watch your television shows."
He attributes the American absence from the market to a basic American ignorance about Asia, particularly Southeast Asia. "They don't think of us," he said of Americans.
Mr. Orr, the former ambassador to Singapore, recalled attending a March 1992 dinner in Manhattan held to drum up interest in Southeast Asian investment among prominent New York bankers and executives. "The dinner became a little testy because many of the people in the room were quite defensive," he said. "They kept saying they were wary of Southeast Asia after getting their fingers burned in South America and in other third-world countries."
 
No Latin America
 Comparisons between the prudently planned economies of today's Southeast Asia and the disastrous, debt-laden economies of South America in the 70's and 80's are distressing to those who know this region. The dinner was evidence to Mr. Orr that "people just don't understand the indigenous wealth of Southeast Asia and what is happening there."
The reasons for the absence of new American investors go beyond simple ignorance. Widespread government corruption in the region has frightened away many potential American investors who are justifiably wary of violating American laws that forbid the payment of kickbacks and bribes abroad. Few large government projects in Indonesia, the Philippines or Thailand are won by foreign contractors without at least the whiff of corruption or insider connections.
Still, American executives operating here say that the corruption is no more prevalent in Southeast Asia -- and may actually be less so -- than in other parts of the developing world.
"An awful lot of American companies refuse to engage in corrupt practices and succeed in Southeast Asia," said Mr. Driscoll of the U.S.-Asean Council. "It may take a little bit longer to get business done. You may lose a couple of contracts. But once you've learned the business system, it's a problem that can be overcome."
Other potential investors shy away because of the inconvenience of doing business halfway around the world from most of the United States. It is easier for a New York investor to search out business opportunities in Brussels, seven hours flying time, than in Bangkok, 19 hours, and most Americans have ancestral ties with Europe, not Asia.
"It is not as difficult to do business in Asia as some potential investors seem to think it is," said Mr. Bertelson of Motorola. "But in Asia it does take patience. Relationships are very important here. And the relationships take time. Unfortunately, Americans are not the most patient people."
As a result of their impatience, many American businesses are missing out on what is in general a liberal, welcoming climate for foreign investors and exporters. In the larger nations of Southeast Asia, foreign investors can own 100 percent of a business in most industries; there are government guarantees that foreign-owned businesses will not be nationalized; the governments are flexible about allowing foreign companies to send their profits home.
When they do consider Asia, many potential American investors think not about Southeast Asia but about China or Japan.
But investment in China carries risk. While the Chinese economy's annual growth rate is now approaching 13 percent, many economists warn that it may be on the verge of overheating. Corruption is a growing problem. And the protectionist barriers are far higher in Japan than in the large nations of Southeast Asia.
"Japan is a huge market, but there are many more obstacles to getting into it," said Phil Curran, managing director for the Thailand division of Digital Equipment, the computer maker. "The argument you can make for Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore is that you can hit the ground running, you can get productive quicker, and you can start taking your money out quicker."
In contrast to Digital's upheavals at home in the United States, its operation in Thailand has grown phenomenally since it began in 1988. Business in Thailand grew 46 percent last year, reaching $70 million. A recent survey of 3,000 Asian business people, most of them in Southeast Asia, found that more than 50 percent had invested in desktop computers in the last year.
 
Why No Eastern Europe?
 The commercial counselor in the American Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Paul Walters, said that among many Americans, "there is almost a fear of the unknown about Asia."
In the United States, he said, he encountered companies that were moving quickly in Eastern Europe, where there is only a small fraction of the industrial capacity and affluence of Southeast Asia.
"I see these companies spending all of their time in Eastern Europe, even though there's no money in Eastern Europe to speak of," he said. "And in the end, nothing comes of it. If these same companies came to Southeast Asia, they'd find the people here are ready to deal with them -- and have the money to spend."

The Competition Gives Away Its Product. What, Him Worry?

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
Scott Cook may soon be keeping track of your money from the time it enters your hands until it is pried from your fingers by the Internal Revenue Service.
Mr. Cook is chief executive of Intuit Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif., which makes Quicken, the most popular personal finance program for personal computers. Intuit recently announced it would merge with Chipsoft Inc., maker of Turbotax, the leading PC tax preparation program. 
 Mr. Cook's career began at Procter & Gamble, where he once helped recruit Steve Balmer (now the billionaire vice president of Microsoft). Later, while at Bain & Company, a business strategy consulting firm, he and Tom Proulx moonlighted to start Intuit, which shipped Quicken in 1983. We caught up with the Cooks early one morning last week.
Question: Describe your feelings in the first 10 seconds after you heard that Computer Associates, a billion-dollar software giant, had decided to give away a million copies of Simply Money, a Windows program designed to kill Quicken.
Answer: [Yawns.]
Q: Yawn? Really?
A: No, I just had the 4 A.M. feeding. Actually, my reaction at the time was that it was just like being back at Procter & Gamble. In packaged goods, virtually every major brand is launched with a free trial promotion or a giveaway, and the truth is that most new brands fail. Demand dries up when they stop giving it away and start charging for it. The product quality has to be there. It all gets down to the product.
Q: And now that you've seen the product?
A: I breathed a sigh of relief. It doesn't have legs.
Q: So far Quicken has fended off assaults from Microsoft Money and the Computer Associates giveaway. Isn't there a risk of hubris, of becoming the next Visicalc, which owned the spreadsheet market before Lotus 1-2-3 arrived?
A: We wanted to make sure that if there was a way to beat Quicken, that we made every effort to find it before someone else did. So we assembled a team of outside renegades -- brave, wild thinkers, including the guy who invented Harvard Graphics, and the woman who designed Hewlett-Packard's Dashboard interface for Windows -- and told them to go out to beat Quicken. We said, 'Use none of our learning, ignore our work, and figure that what we've done is wrong or has holes in it.' They worked for a year.
Q: Did they find the killer?
A: They came up with great ideas, but ideas that were not the germ of a new product. Instead, they were great extensions and improvements to what we were already doing, which will be incorporated into the next version of Quicken. This research did show us that there is a huge class of customers that we were not speaking to. Financial software was doing a great job of helping people plan for retirement, but these guys were just trying to get to the next paycheck, and we were doing nothing for them.
Q: [In background.] Dwoo, ack! Aiyyy?
A: Why, thank you, Karl. A toothbrush is exactly what Daddy wanted.
Q: Ah, we're in domestic mode. Your company went public, and as a co-founder your household finances probably became, shall we say, more complicated? And now the Chipsoft deal will double the company's size to $200 million. Do you still use Quicken to balance your own checkbook?
A: Oh, absolutely. I was just catching up this weekend. I kind of ignored it for a month while we were doing this merger. You know, in Japan, household finances are done exclusively by the women, and banking is done by so-called bank ladies.
Q: [From Signe.] No wonder they're so well run!
A: She uses it on a Mac to keep track of her horse business, and I use it on a PC, the Windows version, for my accounts.
Q: A mixed marriage!
A: I've got to be where the volume is, and the volume is with Windows.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Reform in Mexico: Now You See It, . . .

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
NOW that Mexico is being auditioned for a major role as a trading partner of the United States, the country may be more in the world's spotlight than at any time since Hernan Cortes sent word back to Spain that Moctezuma had rooms full of gold.
What makes Mexico so interesting now is that for the first time, a developed country like the United States is thinking of joining hands so firmly with a developing country like Mexico, and Mexico is determined to show that it is worthy of its new status. 
 Debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would lower or eliminate most tariffs on goods moving into the United States from Mexico and Canada, officially began in Washington last week. Besides jobs, the discussion is expected to turn on Mexico's internal situation and on the attempts of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his cabinet of United States-trained technocrats to reverse some of the country's old habits: repressing democracy, neglecting poverty and encouraging corruption.
Many economic and social reforms have come out of Los Pinos, the Mexican White House, and at least on the surface it appears that Mexico is truly re-inventing itself. But while substantial changes have been made here, recent examples suggest that parts of the new Mexico may be little more than a Potemkin village, consisting of impressive but hollow structures built by officials who are overly eager to please.
Take, for example, part of the recent electoral reform passed by the Mexican Legislature, in which the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has an overwhelming majority. The party has never shown much inclination to change the election procedures that have locked it into power for six decades; this is one reason why United States Congressmen like Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey have been saying that the free trade agreement should be a "democracies-only club" and have been pressing for more democratization here.
After a long debate, legislators this month approved a change in the Constitution that would make Mexicans eligible to run for president as long as one parent is native-born. Until the change takes effect, both parents must be native-born.
The change could have allowed a popular opposition party leader -- Vicente Fox Quesada -- to run for president next year. But the ruling party delayed the effective date of the reform until the year 2000. "It's just a response to internal political pressure that's been raised," said Mr. Fox, whose mother was born in Spain.
To Mr. Fox and others who are tired of the old Mexico, such goings on prove the country is not yet a democracy. But what Mexico actually is at times seems uncertain. It can be hard to tell the difference between the Government and the party -- which with the fall of the Soviet Communists now is the most durable ruling party on Earth. The Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has called Mexico "the perfect dictatorship," and is now persona non grata here.
There are plenty of other examples of how the new Mexico seems to be the old Mexico in disguise. Education Minister Ernesto Zedillo has boasted of overhauling the country's schools and universities, and the public school year has just been extended 20 days to 200 days. But some 20,000 children in the central state of San Luis Potosi are reportedly not able to attend class this year because of a shortage of school buildings that is likely to continue for five more years.
Millions of photo identification cards have been issued as a safeguard against fraud in the 1994 elections. But the election commission is still controlled by the ruling party, and opinion polls indicate that only 34 percent of Mexicans believe the vote will be clean.
Even something as seemingly straightforward as the new superhighway connecting Mexico City and Acapulco may not be all it appears to be. When it was opened in July, Mr. Salinas called it a work of national pride. The only problem is that traveling it is so expensive (a round trip costs $158 in tolls) that most Mexicans cannot afford to use it.
Critics of the free trade agreement say that the lobbying for it is twisting Mexico's sensibilities. Questions are arising about Mexico's identity, and no wonder. Wal-Mart is opening a store in Mexico City. Bread is gaining popularity over tortillas. Gov. Ann Richards of Texas has accepted an invitation to attend independence day ceremonies on Wednesday in Mexico City. She is said to be the first Texas governor to attend since the Alamo.
Robert Pastor, a Mexico expert at Emory University in Atlanta, said "Nafta is a watershed event" that represents "the first time the United States and Mexico have consciously decided to manage" the economic and social integration that has been going on for decades.
But with so much about Mexico being reconsidered on both sides of the border, even history seems to have become hard to pin down. Last year, there was an outcry over the Government's new public school history textbooks; one criticism was that they gave incomplete explanations of an incident in 1968 when the Mexican Army was ordered to open fire on student demonstrators in Mexico City.
This year, the winning entry in a contest to come up with new books ended its treatment of Mexican history in 1964 and invited students to write their own version of what has happened since.
That seemed to solve the problem. But the Education Minister has decided not to publish the books anyway and will hold another contest next year.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Big Gamble;
Spreading the Pain of Health-Care Reform

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the end, governments have a limited number of tools available to fix things domestic. They can regulate, they can tax, they can spend and their leaders can exhort. And they are assured of tremendous grief anytime they do any of the first three. So they sometimes follow a normal human impulse and look for some way to share the burden.
The 246 pages of health-care proposals that were made unofficially public last week represent the promise, the gamble and perhaps the measure of Bill Clinton's presidency are also a textbook example of how to share these unpleasant tasks. The plan's vision is health care, at reasonable cost, for all. Its structure reflects its essential gamble: that the despised tools of taxation and regulation have been camouflaged in enough different ways to make the proposal politically palatable. Understand this, and it is easier to understand why President Clinton's effort to exercise new control over one-seventh of the nation's economy seems so complex. 
 Take the new entities that will work on the front lines, squeezing down health-care costs. They will not be Federal regulators but regional-health care alliances, perhaps state agencies or nonprofit organizations, as each state government sees fit. These will negotiate the price of coverage with networks of doctors, hospitals and insurers.
Or take the Administration's call for all employers to ante up money to furnish health insurance for their employees. The Administration insists that this is not an ugly new tax, but an innocuous premium. Most business lobbyists disagree.
Now step back and imagine trying to control a series of interlinked industries that employ 15 million people -- doctors, insurance adjusters, research chemists, even hospital janitors. Then think of applying the principle of proxy regulation and taxation on top of it all. That's complexity.
The sweeping proposal to remake this $900 billion industry would be the Government's biggest intervention in the economy since President Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls in 1971 and arguably the largest since the Roosevelt Administration's industrial mobilization asserted control over more than a third of the economy during World War II.
However much the Clinton Administration may assert that the plan will create a more efficient health-care industry, worries abound that the changes could create huge inefficiencies and lots of losers. Many people -- not just conservatives -- fear that whenever the Government wades deeply into economic affairs, it messes things up. One cynic said the Government might do for health care what it did for the savings and loan industry.
Small-business organizations argue that the plan's requirement that small businesses provide health insurance for their employees will push thousands of mom-and-pop companies out of business, and force the layoffs of more than a million workers. The Administration has sought to cushion the blow by phasing in this requirement and proffering subsidies to small business. But Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, an association of 610,000 small businesses, said, "No matter how you try to sweeten the taste, arsenic is arsenic."
Administration officials say that wholesale Government intervention is the only way to rein in health-care costs, which are draining the economy and pushing up the Federal budget deficit. Without a Government overhaul, the Administration notes, health-care costs are expected to jump to 19 percent of the nation's gross domestic product within a decade, up from 14 percent at present. That would be 2.5 times the level in many other industrial countries.
The plan "should improve our international competitiveness," said Kurt Karl, an economist with the WEFA Group, an economic consulting firm.
"It should enable large companies to hire more people. Their cost per worker should go down, so their demand for labor would go up. But for smaller companies that do not have health-care coverage, this should raise their costs. They would then tend to reduce the size of their workforce."
Small businesses' worries will find a ready audience among many in Congress, especially those Republicans interested in overhauling the President's overhaul.
The plan's intricacy has not kept industry experts from making some early calculations about who wins and who loses.
To brake cost increases, the President's plan would limit the amount that health-care premiums could rise each year. This cap would limit the of money in each health alliance's till, encouraging alliances to squeeze doctors and hospitals to hold down their costs.
For instance, an alliance might contract with the health maintenance organization that made the lowest bid to provide care for 20,000 of the alliance's members. The H.M.O. might try to hold down costs by paying doctors a set amount -- perhaps $35 -- for each patient visit or by paying a hospital less for doing an appendectomy than it paid last year.
In this way, the Clinton plan would create a new universe of losers and winners. Specialists who charge $200 a visit may be squeezed, while demand for lower-cost nurses should jump. Hospitals able to cut costs could prosper; those that can't might have to close.
Companies that develop money-saving medical devices see their stocks soar. Drug companies specializing in generics should do well, while researchers who develop new drugs may see their big budgets slashed.
But President Clinton's system of health alliances might not create all the competition he hopes for -- and thus might hardly hold down costs. If he loses this bet and health costs keep rising at twice the inflation rate, Mr. Clinton could turn to hands-on, no-proxy regulation: he could set a global cap on health spending. This, many economists fear, could lead to price controls.
"If you try to jam one-seventh of the economy inside a fixed budget, one of two things happens," said Donald Moran, senior vice president at Lewin-VHI, a health-policy consultant. "You won't be successful in jamming it inside that budget or if you're successful, you create all sorts of distortions in the way the system works."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Congress Opens the Larder, and Ducks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REMEMBER Fibber McGee's closet? In every episode of the classic radio comedy "Fibber McGee and Molly," McGee would absent-mindedly open a closet door, unleashing an avalanche of pent-up junk -- shoes, bowling balls, maybe skis -- that would cascade onto the floor, raise an immense clatter and make the audience bray with laughter.
Washington has such a closet: it's known as Congress. Every spring, lawmakers stuff great mounds of bills into its maw , and then ignore most of them until autumn, when Democratic leaders in both chambers realize that the year is about to end with little to show for it. As distinguished from the radio comedy, the trick in Congress is to open the door just enough to free the political winners, but not so much as to get bonked by the legislative version of bowling balls. 
 Autumn is about here, and the lawmakers have their hands on the doorknob again. The anticipation is delicious.
At this moment, which bills will reach the House or Senate floor, and in what venue, is a matter of some deliberation, not to say scheming, among Democratic and Republican leaders and lesser members.
It is "almost like a game of chicken on the highways," former House Speaker Jim Wright recalled last week, describing the year-end competition to pass and kill bills.
Since January, Washington politicians have proposed 4,494 new laws and enacted exactly 81, including a $504 billion economic package and a measure that enables armored-car guards carry guns across state lines. If history is any guide, Congress will enact at least a couple hundred more bills by Turkey Day, when it ardently hopes to adjourn for the year and go home.
A few items, however, will not wait. Congress must pass 13 separate appropriations bills, prescribing 1994 budgets for the panoply of Government agencies, preferably before the new fiscal year begins on October 1. (It will miss the deadline, but only by a few weeks.)
Nafta, the contentious free-trade pact with Canada and Mexico, must land in the Congressional hopper by year's end, before the expiration of a crucial law that guarantees it an expedited, non-amendable trip through the legislative mill.
President Clinton wants to carve into law some of the governmental reorganization plan Vice President Gore proposed last week, partly because that might enable him to keep his promise to Congress and come up with another $10 billion in budget trims. Congress should take that up. The President wants votes on a $3.4 billion crime bill proposed last month, so mark that down, too.
But the last days of a legislative year are more jitterbug than minuet, and there are other ways to force votes on -- or, for that matter, to deep-six -- any of the 4,413 bills still vying for attention.
First, there is the power of public opinion. Despite it, most lawmakers would prefer to delay votes on three do-good measures: bills to tighten the campaign-finance and lobbying laws, already passed under some duress by the Senate, and a more sweeping blue-ribbon plan, not yet in bill form, to tighten Congress's rather sedentary management practices and its ethical constraints.
Still, House Democrats, who are are naturally wary of campaign-money reforms that would hurt incumbents and management reforms that would erode their privilege, will likely take them up anyway, mostly because an angry public and an assemblage of talk-show hosts have made them priorities. Making necessity a virtue, the House can be expected to pass parts of all three measures and pound itself on the back for a job well done.
Thomas Mann, a longtime student of Congress at Washington's Brookings Institution, advises against taking this too seriously. Note that in the dying days of last year's Congress, House Democrats pushed a positively Calvinist version of campaign-spending reform to passage, utterly confident that George Bush would veto it. Without a sure veto on t5he horizon, the same bill is barely treading water this year.
A second trick of late-year scheduling: Voting on an unpopular bill enables lawmakers to brag during the next election campaign that they supported it.
A third rule: wily legislators can force even the balkiest leadership to give their bill its day. Take Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat, who is guaranteed a Senate debate and vote, probably next month, on legislation his superiors detest -- a proposal for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.
Mr. Clinton is curiously silent on the bill, a sure sign he dislikes it. For two years, George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, stiffed Mr. Simon's pleas for a floor debate on the proposal. But Mr. Simon extracted the promise of a vote when he began threatening to attach the measure to other bills as an amendment. This summer, the Senate Judiciary Committee quietly voted by a 15-to-3 margin to endorse the amendment. Leaderships ignore bipartisan support at their own peril.
A fourth ploy: adopt protective coloration by hiding a bill among similarly nondescript bills. There is always a chance that it might be passed without much scrutiny. This is the way most bills pass at year's end -- under suspension, a procedure by which lawmakers vote on a flock of bills, weeding out only those that cannot muster, say, two-thirds of the vote in the House.
It's also surprising how time flies while you're dodging bowling balls.
"What's really amazing, when you look at the legislative calendar" says Lawrence O'Donnell, the staff director of the Senate Finance Committee, "is how few in-session days there are in a year. When you throw into that a little arithmetic about the number of hours a piece of legislation can tie up the Senate floor, you can think of it as something akin to the way our court dockets are clogged.
"I used to think a year was a long time," he added. "But Senate floor time is a precious thing."
So is space in Fibber McGee's closet.

HEADLINE: Conversations/Douglas A. Fraser;
He Always Gets Restless When the Union Is Bargaining

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
"THEY have no sense of strategy!" thunders Douglas A. Fraser, former president of the United Automobile Workers and a skilled negotiator, watching the Big Three negotiate new three-year labor contracts with auto workers in this country and Canada.
The immediate object of his ire is his longtime employer, the Chrysler Corporation, which, he argues, frittered away a precious bargaining chip by announcing before negotiations began that it would expand a plant in Canada. 
 "They gave that away six months ago," he grumbles, then laughs his long, gravelly laugh. "You wonder how the hell that industry survives."
At age 76 and out of the fray for more than a decade, Mr. Fraser finds himself restless when negotiations roll around every three years. Now a professor of labor studies at Wayne State University here -- a "concocted" title, he says, because of his spotty academic credentials -- he clearly misses the give and take, or at least the take, of bargaining for U.A.W. members.
"It's only once every three years that you have the opportunity to address their concerns and their worries and their goals and their aspirations," Mr. Fraser says.
But workers' priorities, and with them the bargaining process, have changed, he says. Mr. Fraser, an immigrant from Glasgow, Scotland, with a high-school education, was first hired in the plants in 1935, then fired for trying to organize workers, then rehired, then fired again, then rehired again; eventually he climbed through the U.A.W. ranks to negotiate with the giants of American industry, as well as with senators and vice presidents. Over that period, the U.A.W. improved the lives of hundreds of thousands of men and women, revolutionizing the idea of what blue-collar workers could achieve -- second homes, fishing boats and the paid vacations to enjoy them.
Now there are as many retired auto workers as there are active ones, however -- and the active ones' average age is 46. At the same time, the auto industry is aging, hampered by foreign competition and no longer the engine of prosperity it was.
"As you become older, your interests change, and now you're concentrating on security, particularly in an industry that's so volatile and so threatened," Mr. Fraser says. "So I think that what happens is that the members have become more cautious."
Now, he says, "the goals and aspirations almost coincide with the concerns and worries. When you think about it, they're one and the same. They used to be completely different things."
 
Question of Strategy
 As a result, the big issues at the bargaining table are preserving health benefits, improving job security and fattening pensions, rather than bolstering wages or -- as the younger workers in Canada are hoping to do -- shortening the workweek. The current U.A.W. contract, which covers about 700,000 workers and retirees, expires at 11:59 P.M. on Tuesday.
In the old days, Mr. Fraser negotiated some of the union's more inventive contract provisions, including free legal advice for auto workers. As president of the union (1977 to 1983), he helped save Chrysler by rewriting the contract two times between negotiations in the late 1970's and early 1980's. He made financial concessions, but they were not for nothing: in exchange, he got the union a profit-sharing plan and a seat on the company's board of directors -- anathema to the companies and puzzling to many members, but for Mr. Fraser a way to gain greater influence over company policy, including plant-closing strategy. The union later lost the seat.
At times, Mr. Fraser sounds wistful about what the union could be achieving.
"I suppose if we were in normal times, prosperous times, they might be thinking about something like having an educational fund to send their kids to college," he says. "That would be a goal and aspiration. Wouldn't be a bad one, either."
As the goals of the workers have changed over the lifetime of the union -- which is to say, over Mr. Fraser's career -- so have the tools of the negotiators, their understanding of each other's needs and their relative strength.
In the past the negotiators used to rely on one calculator; today they have batteries of computers and economists. In the 1930's, Mr. Fraser recalls, a foreman told him -- when the sweat in a stamping plant turned his shirt brown -- that lead was good for him; today the companies work with the union to design safer working environments.
In the past, company negotiators used to call quality a "management prerogative"; today labor-management cooperation has become an advertising theme. And in the past the Big Three, in particular General Motors, were the undisputed leaders of the industry, able to dictate price and style; today they are running scared.
"You know, they say, 'Well, the union doesn't have as much power as they used to' -- the hell they don't," Mr. Fraser says. "Maybe it's not so much the union has gained strength as the companies have become more fragile, so the contest isn't as even as it used to be."
A strike now, he said, would devastate the target company, as the Big Three slowly regain market share from Japanese automakers.
 
A Certain Caution
 The same circumstances that give the union more power, Mr. Fraser says, force it to be more cautious about exercising it. In the old days, the workers felt more free to pressure management. Around 1940 Mr. Fraser worked with a team of men hammering the wrinkles out of about 14 fenders a day, for use in the Chrysler. The foreman kept exhorting the group to raise their output to 16. Mr. Fraser told the men to cut output to 12.
"So we did, for a week, and they were going crazy," he says. "I remember the foreman coming to me and saying, 'Lookit, starting Monday, it's 14 a day.' "
Now workers view management as less of a combatant.
"It sounds simplistic, but I think there's a higher level of understanding on the part of our members that they can't survive unless the corporation survives, and they can't prosper unless the corporation prospers," he says. "You know, in the auto industry we just rolled along. There were a few bumps in the road, but every time there was a downturn you knew somehow it was going to come back. That's no longer true."
As a result Mr. Fraser says, "I suppose, if you had a company-wide strike, the American public would probably question our sanity."
Despite such considerations, Mr. Fraser believes the union will strike if the auto makers try to roll back health benefits -- which is why he thinks the companies, their protestations notwithstanding, won't really try. Personally, he favors changing the union's benefit plan to charge workers if they choose to go to more expensive doctors and nurses.
"If I could reach back over the decades, I'd do it that way," he says. "But it's late now. The system is so embedded, and the workers so cherish it."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
South Africa Sanctions May Have Worked, at a Price

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
IN the arsenal of diplomacy, economic sanctions are crude weapons, slow-acting and unpredictable. When they work, innocents suffer. The bad guys, after all, are usually the ones with the bunkers and gas masks -- or, in this case, the power and cash -- to endure a war of attrition.
But as the use of real force has become less politically palatable, the world has increasingly turned to the trade embargo, the investment ban, the credit blockade or the assets freeze as a way of punishing a misbehaving state. The United States now monitors official sanctions of one kind or another against a dozen countries. Do they work? 
 South Africa now presents one case study of sanctions that have run their course. With the white Government's agreement last week to submit to the oversight of a multiparty council in the months before next April's election, making the transition all but irreversible, the African National Congress is on the verge of calling off the economic penalties the world imposed against apartheid.
In hindsight, few now question that the sanctions had powerful consequences, but there is no consensus that the results were quite what the sponsors intended.
The United Nations imposed an arms embargo against South Africa in 1977 after a massacre of schoolchildren in Soweto, but the real economic siege of South Africa began in 1985 when Chase Manhattan Bank, under pressure to sever its ties with the apartheid rulers, called in its loans. Other banks in America and Europe followed suit. The following year Congress voted, over President Reagan's veto, to restrict trade, investment and lending by American companies in South Africa. Scores of state and local governments enacted their own anti-apartheid statutes.
It is impossible to isolate the effect of sanctions from the other pressures that finally drove the white Government towards surrender: the riots and nettlesome guerrilla war waged by the African National Congress, the ascent of a more sophisticated and pragmatic generation of Afrikaners like President F. W. de Klerk, the collapse of the Communist bogy man that so terrified South African whites, the shame of sports and cultural boycotts and, perhaps most of all, the sheer, self-defeating folly of an ideology that tried to make foreigners of the country's black laborers and customers.
The African National Congress contends, and some independent economists agree, that sanctions helped hasten the end of apartheid through a combination of psychological and economic pain.
"Sooner or later, probably later, the Government would have had to face up to including blacks," said Edward Osborn, chief economist of Nedbank, who has studied the impact of sanctions. "But I think the short answer may well be, yes, sanctions accelerated the process."
Critics of sanctions counter that sanctions worked, but economic growth would have worked better, and would have left the next, democratic Government with a healthier country to run.
Such apartheid practices as reserving certain jobs for whites and forbidding blacks from living in cities, most experts agree, were abandoned because the state simply could not hold back the tide of job-seeking blacks. A booming economy, with more jobs, the critics argue, might have brought down those barriers faster.
"Sanctions have slowed down change," said David Steward, the chief Government spokesman. "They slowed down the big engine that was already breaking down apartheid."
Some sanctions hurt worse than others. The trade restrictions, by most accounts, had limited effect on a country rich in gold and diamonds. When America and Europe refused to buy South African goods, exporters scrambled to find new markets in the East and, except for a few industries like winemakers in the Cape region, they succeeded. South African consumers, in turn, had little trouble finding new sources of oil and other imports, using devious channels and paying a premium to middlemen.
 
Tight Money
 The most devastating blow was the loss of easy credit from foreign banks. While most developing countries are big borrowers, South Africa became an exporter of capital, rationing out its cash to satisfy foreign creditors. Tight money helped push the country deeper into recession and, Mr. Osborn and other economists are convinced, helped persuade Mr. de Klerk to reverse course in February 1990.
Critics of sanctions, including the Government and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, contend that the main victims of this economic punishment were destitute blacks, who make up most of the country's nearly 50 percent unemployment rate. Poverty, in turn, bred violence.
"Violence doesn't take place among the middle-class suburbs," said Peter Smith of Inkatha. "It takes place among the poorest, the marginalized, and blacks are poorer and more marginalized as a result of sanctions."
Trevor Manuel, the head of the A.N.C. economics department, conceded that blacks shared in the suffering, but not disproportionately. In part because of sanctions, white South Africans, who were less accustomed to economic hardship, experienced a startling drop in their living standards, and newspapers began reporting the eye-opening novelty of whites lined up at soup kitchens.
The sanctions ricocheted with many unpredicted effects.
One, many economists agree, was that by slowing the most advanced economy in southern Africa, sanctions also retarded development in neighboring countries, including outspokenly anti-apartheid (but economically dependent) countries like Zimbabwe and Zambia.
Another, Mr. Steward observed, was that South Africa, cut off from foreign military supplies, built up "one of the seven or eight largest armaments industries of the world."
Another was to convert many South African business executives into grudging lobbyists for political reform. Alarmed by the prospect of endless isolation, bankers and corporate executives privately urged Mr. de Klerk to move faster, and publicly entered into their own dialogue with black leaders.
 
Better to Stay or Go?
 Some of the impetus came, paradoxically, from American companies like Colgate Palmolive and I.T.T. that decided, despite public vilification, to remain in South Africa. To justify their decision, they signed pledges that committed them to programs for black advancement, and a number of South African companies followed their example.
Yet another unplanned result of sanctions was to help fatten a few South African corporate giants. As American and European companies disinvested, titans like the Anglo-American mining conglomerate bought up the abandoned automakers and paper companies and banks, consolidating a hold on the economy that critics contend has thwarted competition.
The stunted economy that sanctions helped create now becomes the inheritance of the A.N.C., assuming it wins elections next April. Blacks will take over an economy that is shrinking, that is not adept at competing in the world, that is lagging behind in research and modernization, that is inbred and dominated by a few corporate pyramids.
And the United States, having helped bring the South African economy to its knees, is now being called upon to help get the country back on its feet.
"I believe that clearly American sanctions played a major role in the dismantling of apartheid," said Michael Judin, a lawyer specializing in United States-South African trade. "And we feel that it's now incumbent on the American people to play a major role in rebuilding the country."

HEADLINE: Mideast Accord: U.S. Policy;
Clinton Seeks to Buoy Israelis, Saying U.S. Backing Is Firm

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton today promised the Israeli public the unflinching support of the United States at this critical time in an effort not only to make Israelis comfortable about striking a deal with Yasir Arafat but also to obtain their backing for a future peace accord with Syria.
In his first interview since the breakthrough toward peace in the Middle East, Mr. Clinton said King Fahd of Saudi Arabia told him in a telephone conversation on Friday that despite the lingering wrath of the Saudis over Palestinian support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, they would be ready to contribute funds and raise money from the other Arab nations of the Persian Gulf to insure that the new Palestinian entities in the Gaza Strip and Jericho get on their feet. 
 Mr. Clinton said he expected the American economic contributions to be modest. He said he saw Washington's job as providing seed money while most of the aid would be contributed by Japan, the European Community, Scandinavia and the gulf Arabs, all of whom have given him indications of support.
 
In an Ebullient Mood
 Dressed in a track suit and gripping a mug of coffee in the early hours of this morning as Air Force One carried him from California to Texas, the President was in an ebullient mood. He alternated between expressions of amazement at what was happening in the Middle East, analyzing the different actors almost as though he were watching the most unusual play, and pragmatic discussions of his strategic plans that underscored the central role he feels he too must perform if the whole thing is to work.
"I think even some of the leaders are still adjusting to it," Mr. Clinton said, explaining that he was not the only one stunned by the recent events. Recounting his telephone conversation with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel on Friday, Mr. Clinton quoted him as saying: " 'Can you believe, Mr. President, that I am signing this letter to Yasir Arafat? I fought him for decades.' "
Asked how he felt about playing host to Mr. Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, at the White House, Mr. Clinton said: "I guess I sort of feel the way Rabin does. I never thought I would be in this position, but then I never thought Arafat would be doing what he is doing.
"First of all," he went on, "I would tell him that I think he has done the right thing and that he has given the next generation of Palestinian children a chance to have a normal life -- that they don't have to grow up first throwing rocks in the intifada and then learning how to use guns and then wondering whether they could wreak more violence or endure it."
 
Assad's Cautionary Words
 Among the other points made by the President in the 70-minute interview in his private cabin were these:
*President Hafez al-Assad of Syria is ready to endorse the accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization but had cautioned Mr. Clinton in their telephone call that it could not stand alone, but had to be followed up by a breakthrough on the Syrian-Israeli track.
*The Administration still opposes the creation of an independent Palestinian state, but his view is that Israelis and Palestinians should decide such issues and that his policies will be strongly influenced by what they decide.
*He hopes Iran will use the Middle East breakthrough not to isolate itself further by opposing it, but to "change course" and thereby create the possibility of a different relationship with Washington and the West.
Time and again, though, the President hammered at a single point: Israeli public opinion. That was the key, he said, because Israel is the country that will have to trade tangible security assets for promises. He said the people of Israel had to be made to feel secure about that, since otherwise the opposition there would block the deal, there would never be progress on the Syrian track and the whole thing would unravel.
"The pivotal question is what the traffic can bear in Israel and in Syria," Mr. Clinton said. "And that is a function of how well this initial agreement is received in Israel. One of the things that I really hope to do -- and I mean this in no way that I am trying to interfere in internal Israeli affairs -- by hosting the event on Monday is to reassure the people of Israel that the United States is committed to their security, that we see this as a huge, emotional, psychological as well as practical step toward giving them a more normal life. And that it is possible because they have been willing for the first time to get a normal life to give the Palestinians some measure of normality and that if we are still with them maybe we can in sending that clear message generate more support for this deal in Israel."
 
No Promise on Aid
 Asked to be more specific, Mr. Clinton did not promise an increase in American aid to Israel -- already about $3 billion a year -- but sought to assure the Israelis that just because they signed a peace agreement the United States was not going to start reducing aid or military support. Clinton aides said later, though, that the President was considering an increase in military assistance to Israel to help it defer the costs of redeploying its troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
"Plainly we have to be part of any ultimate resolution of the Israel, Syria, Lebanon negotiations," Mr. Clinton said. "But I think that they have to deal with it and I think what we have to do is to create the strongest possible conditions in which they deal with it and I think right now what that means is making the Israeli people as comfortable as they can be with this -- that they are more secure not less secure because this is done and that the United States is still there. I think that is the most important thing now as they absorb this."
The President continued: "Each successive day that the agreement builds up in strength I think that that enables the Government in Israel to engage Syria. I personally believe that is a lot more important than the details of this piece of land on the Golan Heights or anything else."
Mr. Clinton went on at great length about his phone conversation with President Assad of Syria, which lasted 30 minutes. That conversation seemed to underscore the challenge Mr. Clinton faces in trying not to overload the political circuits in Israel -- by asking Israelis to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights at once -- while also keeping the Syrian leader interested in supporting moves that might not reward him immediately.
Mr. Clinton said Mr. Assad had told him: "I think you are right. It is a positive thing, this agreement, for all of us. I just want to know that you are committed to the whole process."
"I said, 'I am, strongly,' and I said, 'I think you should be committed to the whole process.' I reminded him the issue in Israel is security, and the opposition to the agreement are people who believe that it will weaken rather than enhance their security, and if we are going to see this all the way through, which I really believe we have to, you got to solve these inter-state conflicts.
"Monday has to be a signal to the people of Israel that this is about security. I said if your Ambassador is there it will be a pretty clear signal that you are serious about it, and he said, 'Yes, I think that is right.' "
 
'A Huge Deal'
 "But he also said he really wanted my commitment to continue," Mr. Clinton added. "He said, 'You know, the people on our side are restless too and they don't want to feel that our part of this will be abandoned.' "
According to an Administration official, the Syrian leader added: "If there is no comprehensive peace this will not stand on its feet. If there are long periods of time with no progress these difficulties will grow greater. We should not let time go by without serious work."
Mr. Clinton said he was most relieved by the willingness of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to support the Israel-P.L.O. accord, despite the P.L.O.'s support for Iraq against Saudi Arabia in the gulf war.
"I think he has very strong feelings about that gulf war -- very strong feelings about this," Mr. Clinton said. "I said to him: 'Your Majesty, you have been a great ally of the United States and a great force for peaceful resolution of this conflict for a long time. This is not like Camp David where the United States basically had to assume financial responsibility because of the interplay of world politics.' He said, 'You take the lead in organizing it and tell us what we're supposed to do.' But he said, 'I will be there.' He said, 'This is too important.' He said this is a huge deal."
Mr. Clinton indicated that he wanted Palestinians to understand that in emphasizing the importance of the Israelis' feeling secure, so the deal would go ahead, he was not trying to diminish the Palestinians' needs.
"The beauty of this moment is that each of them, in a funny way, has given the other the chance to have a normal life," Mr. Clinton said, "and while they are nowhere near agreement on what the end of Palestinian self-determination looks like, still they have given each other a sense of place. No matter what you say, there is a sense of roots, of place."
 
Depth of Yearning
 The President added: "The one thing I think that we tend to underestimate, those of us who are away from it, is the depth of the yearning of the Palestinians for peace, and a normal life, to know their kids will always be able to go to a school without getting beat up, and never have to provoke an Israeli soldier again. I think underneath that's the bedrock thing here."
Again and again, the President returned to the notion that the moment unfolding in the Middle East was something beyond diplomacy -- that peace there is like peace nowhere else in the world. It evokes something larger than two enemies simply signing treaties.
"This whole thing is immensely interesting for Christians," he said. "Well, I mean, it's our Holy Land too. I never will forget, the only time I went to Israel was with my pastor, who told me after I got back that he thought one day I would be President, and since at that time I was the youngest ex-governor in America -- I was 34 -- I didn't think he knew what he was talking about. And he said, 'Just remember, God will never forgive you if you turn your back on Israel.' It was an amazing thing."

HEADLINE: CLINTON SCRAMBLES TO FIND FINANCING FOR HEALTH PLAN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Just days after sending a detailed description of President Clinton's health plan to Congress, Administration officials scrambled today to find new ways to pay for it, as they acknowledged that Congress would probably not accept deep cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid.
The officials said they were considering several options, including a new Federal tax on hospitals, if they are forced to scale back the proposals on Medicare and Medicaid, the programs for the elderly and the poor. 
 Ira C. Magaziner, the President's health policy coordinator, said in May that such a tax could be justified because many hospitals would get a financial "windfall" under the Clinton plan. All Americans would have insurance coverage, so hospitals would be paid for services now written off as bad debt or charity care, he said.
 
Seeking Savings in Medicaid
 The hospital tax was not in the plan that Mr. Clinton sent to Congress for inspection this week. But Administration officials said today that the idea was still under consideration as a backup if Mr. Clinton could not get all the savings he wanted in Medicare and Medicaid.
The President wants to cut $238 billion, or 12 percent, of the projected growth of Medicare and Medicaid over five years. He would use the savings to help finance coverage for the uninsured and to expand benefits for the elderly.
Administration officials say they are also seeking other sources of revenue. One option is some form of tax on big companies that operate health insurance plans for their own workers, outside the regional health alliances that would buy coverage for most consumers under the Clinton plan.
 
Doubts in Congress
 The question of how to finance Mr. Clinton's ambitious program still vexes many Administration officials and members of Congress, who doubt that the latest proposals will produce all the revenue envisioned.
"I don't know anybody who thinks it's fully funded," said Representative Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat who reviewed the President's proposal this week. Gail R. Wilensky, an economist who was in charge of Medicare and Medicaid from 1990 to 1992, under President George Bush, complained today that the Clinton Administration had "punted on the question of how to finance" the program. "It's not hard to be benevolent if you're not worried about how to pay for it," she said, asserting that Mr. Clinton had avoided "hard choices."
The Administration's 11th-hour struggle comes just days before Mr. Clinton is to unveil the health plan in a speech to Congress on Sept. 22. For months, as he and his aides tried to design a generous, comprehensive package of health benefits for all Americans, they deferred tough decisions about how to pay for it. After a long fight over his budget package, which included many tax increases, Mr. Clinton is skittish about proposing new taxes for health care.
For now, in addition to the savings in Medicare and Medicaid, Mr. Clinton expects to get $105 billion from new taxes on cigarettes and perhaps liquor over the next seven years. He will propose $47 billion of savings in other Federal health programs.
In addition, the White House says the Treasury will collect $51 billion more because businesses will have higher profits and workers higher incomes if medical costs are controlled as Mr. Clinton proposes. C. Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said that "if the costs constraints really work," such increases in revenue are plausible. But he observed that doctors and hospitals often find ways of circumventing such controls.
And the prospects for other financing tactics are uncertain. Many Congressional Democrats and some Administration officials say the proposed cutbacks in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid are too big, and lobbyists for the elderly note that Medicare was already trimmed in the budget package just enacted. On Thursday, Hillary Rodham Clinton told Congress that the White House was willing to reconsider these proposals.
 
Capping Health Costs
 The premise for many of the numbers in the plan is the assumption that the Federal Government can, by law, curb the growth of health spending. The Clinton plan includes a formula that would put a tight lid on the growth of private health spending, as well as Medicare and Medicaid.
Under this formula, in the year 2000, the Government would not allow any increase in medical spending beyond that needed to keep pace with inflation and population growth.
Hospital officials say the health-care industry probably cannot curb costs so fast, and many Administration officials agree.
In recent weeks, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, and her staff have raised questions about the validity of numbers being used in the President's plan. But Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Magaziner insist that Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers can save huge sums by cutting waste and limiting payments to doctors and hospitals.
Some Administration officials say they worry that abrupt cutbacks could have devastating effects on the quality of care and access to care. Other officials say such concerns are unfounded and cite the experience of manufacturing companies that have become stronger after cutting costs.
James D. Bentley, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said his group was willing to consider a national budget that set limits for spending on the standard package of health benefits to be guaranteed to all Americans under Mr. Clinton's plan. But, he said, the budget should not be fixed in advance by a rigid formula. Rather, he said, the budget should be set annually, "in view of actual experience, the state of the economy and the needs of the population."
Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said, "We should focus first and foremost on total national health expenditures, not on the share of health expenditures that flows through the Federal budget."
 
Premium Cap or Price Control?
 Under Mr. Clinton's plan, the Government would control health spending by limiting the premiums that could be paid for private health insurance. Insurers, he assumes, would then have to limit payments to doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers.
Mr. Clinton insists this type of regulation is not price control. But insurers disagree.
Terrence C. Burke, senior vice president of Aetna Health Plans, a unit of Aetna Life and Casualty Company, said: "They can call it what they want, but premium caps are price controls. The minute you put price controls on the industry, you will choke off the capital needed to create competitive health-care systems."
The premise of Mr. Clinton's proposal is that competing networks of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies will control costs to win business. But such networks require large amounts of capital, for medical equipment and computers to analyze the use of care. Federal regulation of premiums would dry up such capital, Mr. Burke said.
 
Spouses' Insurance
 Much, but by no means all, of the money for Mr. Clinton's plan would come premiums paid by workers and employers. He would require employers to pay at least 80 percent of health insurance premiums for their workers. And he would end the current practice of allowing a worker to get coverage through a spouse's employer.
White House documents say that employers would pay "a fixed contribution for each employee." The contribution for a married worker would be the same whether or not the employee's spouse worked.
Dallas L. Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said this proposal was intended to "eliminate an incentive for employers to shift health costs to other employers."
Some companies now provide no health insurance for their workers. To save money, some companies that offer health benefits refuse to provide coverage to an employee who can obtain coverage through a spouse.
When husband and wife both work, the coordination of their insurance benefits is complicated. Typically, a worker submits a medical claim to his or her employer. The worker may then ask the spouse's employer to pay amounts left unpaid under the first policy. The spouse's employer may pay some or all of these amounts.
 
Proposal First, Financing Later
 The Administration's scramble today for financing sources stands in contrast to a speech in April by Mr. Magaziner, in which he seemed to minimize the political difficulty of getting Congress to raise taxes.
"Often," he said, "our friends in the media focus their whole attention on health-care reform as if what specific piece of money might have to be raised next year to help us insure the uninsured is the most important thing in health care.
"We know better," he said. "We know that what is really going to matter to the American people five years from now, 10 years from now, is not what amount of money was raised initially to get over the hump of getting the uninsured insured. What's really going to matter is what happens when I go to my doctor. What happens when I get ill? How does my insurance coverage look? Does it really protect me or not?"
That was before Congress, as part of a huge deficit-reduction bill, imposed new taxes on affluent people, Social Security recipients, corporations and gasoline.
From the moment he took office, Mr. Clinton talked of the new health benefits he would guarantee all Americans. His health policy advisers initially gave far less attention to the question of financing than to the design of the standard package of benefits.
But Mr. Steuerle of the Urban Institute says, "Tax policy and health policy are flip sides of the same coin, two sides of the same accounting ledger."

HEADLINE: CHRISTIAN GROUP KEEPING TO RIGHT

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
This was to be a conference where the Christian Coalition broadened its political image, but today Pat Buchanan brought 2,000 Christian conservatives to their feet with a vow to rebuff Republican moderates and never "raise a white flag in the cultural war."
After George Bush lost the Presidential election last year, many moderate Republicans said Mr. Buchanan and the coalition, led by Pat Robertson, had given the party an image of intolerance and were in part to blame. 
 Since then, the Christian Coalition has expanded its issues portfolio beyond its traditional opposition to abortion and homosexual rights, and it has sought to shake its image as an arm of the Republican Party, going so far as to invite the chairman of the Democratic National Committee to speak here at its annual conference.
But the chairman, David Wilhelm, received hisses when he spoke Friday, and the warm reception afforded Republican speakers has left no doubt of the audience's partisan preference.
 
'Our Culture Is Superior'
 "If a political party would turn its back on the 4,000 unborn children doomed to death every day in this country, then it is time to find a new party," Mr. Buchanan said, prompting a standing ovation. "We are a pro-life party, and we are going to keep our party pro-life."
The conservative commentator, who mounted an unsuccessful primary challenge to Mr. Bush last year, won rousing applause again with an attack on "multiculturalism," scoffing at those who say the world's many cultures are equal.
"Our culture is superior," Mr. Buchanan said. "Our culture is superior because our religion is Christianity and that is the truth that makes men free."
It is such talk that moderates claim drove many suburban middle-class voters away. "It cost us the election," said Elsie Hillman, a moderate Republican National Committee member from Pennsylvania.
 
Dole Shows Broader Focus
 Ms. Hillman's view was common among Republicans after the election, and even many conservatives said their movement needed a softer image. But eight months into the Clinton Administration, many Christian conservatives are less worried about taking defiant stands, believing they have gained strength thanks to President Clinton.
Still, not all of the potential Republican Presidential candidates were as eager as Mr. Buchanan to plunge into the party's internal debate over abortion and other social issues.
In speeches on Friday, Senators Bob Dole of Kansas and Phil Gramm of Texas focused on economics and health care.
The closest that Mr. Dole came to talking about the abortion debate was when he said, "We don't need any litmus tests in the Republican Party." Mr. Gramm also avoided social issues.
Former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said tonight that it was a "false choice" to pit social conservatives against economic conservatives, in a speech that skirted any direct reference to moderates or the abortion feud.
Mr. Buchanan showed no such reluctance and was by far the best received of the four.
 
'God Is an Independent'
 In contrast, the Democratic chairman received a chorus of hisses when he tried to persuade the delegates that the Democratic Party and President Clinton shared their commitment to faith, family and tax fairness.
"Let me say it plainly: the Democratic Party is and always has been a party of values," Mr. Wilhelm said.
He also said the coalition had tried to characterize Clinton supporters as unchristian and said it was wrong to use faith "as a weapon to divide."
"God and faith are not and cannot be the province of one political party or movement," Mr. Wilhelm said. "God is an independent. And no single entity can claim to speak for all persons who believe in Christ and consider themselves Christians."
Today, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, Ralph Reed, said the economic focus by Mr. Dole and Mr. Gramm showed the wisdom of diversifying the organization's issues portfolio. "Taxes and health care and government are of paramount importance to our members," he said. "We've moved beyond the days when someone has to talk about abortion when they come before us."
Yet even as he talked of "casting a wider net" to expand the coalition's reach, Mr. Reed was careful to make it clear that he was not advocating a retreat on abortion or other cultural fronts.
"To do anything that would be perceived as backpedaling from that position would be a disaster at the ballot box," Mr. Reed said of the party's antiabortion stance. But he said he believed there was a way to "use different words to convey the same principle," perhaps in a way that also recognized that not all Republicans agreed on the issue.
That delicate maneuvering on the abortion issue was just one example of the challenges the coalition faces as it tries to become more involved in other issues, topics in which its core supporters are not as unified as they are over abortion and gay rights.
Mr. Reed, for example, wanted to put the Christian Coalition's grass roots strength behind the North American Free Trade Agreement. But Mr. Buchanan's opposition to the treaty drew sustained applause, and Mr. Robertson said, "I don't think we are going to be beating a drum on it."

HEADLINE: Tribe Plans to Develop Blighted Area of Bridgeport

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: STRATFORD, Conn., Sept. 11

 BODY:
The Golden Hill Paugussetts today announced a three-phase urban redevelopment plan for the Bridgeport area that includes building a 250,000-square foot casino.
The tribe said its plan could change a blighted section of Bridgeport into a crime-free, picturesque area. 
 "This tribe has always lived in the Bridgeport area. They are members of the community. They believe in the area and want to see the greater Bridgeport area become more productive, more economically viable," said Rodney Doran, a spokesman for the tribe.
The tribe, which has state recognition, said it would build the casino, an attached bingo hall, two hotels, a 20,000-seat arena and parking garages at a cost of $1 billion if its application for Federal recognition was successful, Mr. Doran said.
 
Land Claimed in Lawsuit
 In the first phase of the plan, the complex would be constructed within a year on land that the tribe has claimed in a lawsuit, which was dismissed by a Federal judge and is under appeal. The tribe said it would also buy more land if necessary.
The second phase would involve building a tribal community home on Pleasure Beach Island, which once housed an amusement park off downtown Bridgeport.
In the third phase, which would take up to 20 years, the tribe would work with the city and state to redevelop the entire east side of Bridgeport. The area has many dilapidated houses and abandoned buildings.
The Paugussetts said they would tear down the buildings and construct multifamily homes to be connected to schools via parks. The plan also calls for the construction of a technical training center, a community college, a performing arts center, an outdoor amphitheater and several retail centers.
 
10,000 to 12,000 Jobs
 Office buildings would be constructed along Interstate 95 as a buffer from highway noise. The tribe, which would police its own complex, would help expand and improve security to deter crime on the east side.
The projects would generate 10,000 to 12,000 new jobs and use mostly small minority- and female-owned businesses, Mr. Doran said.
Based on the success of the Mashantucket Pequots' casino in Led yard, the Paugussetts said they estimated that their casino would make $3 million a day. The tribe said it would come up with a tax-sharing plan with the city and state even though Federal recognition would give it a tax-exempt status.
The tribe would use casino profits to help implement phase three of the urban redevelopment plan, Mr. Doran said.
"The tribe has clear, well-defined, meaningful contributions that it will make to the state and to the greater Bridgeport area," he said. "We're not talking about a pie in the sky dream; we're talking about reality."

HEADLINE: Mideast Accord: The P.L.O.;
Finally, After Several of His Nine Lives, Arafat Is Going to the White House

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUNIS, Sept. 11

 BODY:
It has been a long voyage to the White House for Yasir Arafat.
Several times, the Palestinian leader was counted out in Middle East politics, but each time he has shown extraordinary resilience. In the Arab world, they call him the "cat with nine lives." No leading Arab figure has survived more setbacks than Mr. Arafat, whose latest exploit has been to strike a deal with Israel that has revived his bankrupt, nearly defunct Palestine Liberation Organization. 
 On Monday, unless there is another sudden change, Mr. Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, the man who survived a civil war in Jordan in 1970, an Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, several assassination attempts, a plane crash, and countless bad decisions of his own will be standing with President Clinton and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel on the White House lawn.
 
End of a Search
 Whether or not he actually signs the document in which Israel will recognize the P.L.O. or shakes anyone's hand, his very presence will mark the end of an incredible search for prestige and for recognition of an organization that Washington refused to deal with for years.
His birthplace is a mystery. There is no official biography, but informed Palestinians say that while Mr. Arafat's family is from Gaza and he spent his youth between the strip and Jerusalem, he was born in Cairo, where he returned for high school and college.
Mr. Arafat has hinted a number of times that his mother shares the ancestry of Faisal al-Husseini, the Palestinian negotiator, who comes from an ancient well-known family, but this account has been disputed.
Ever since he began his tortuous road as a student at Cairo University's prestigious school of engineering, he moved from exile to exile.
After forming the first cell of his own guerrilla group, Fatah, in Kuwait in 1959, he abandoned what he said was a very successful career as a contractor to devote himself fully to the Palestinian revolution.
In the late 1960's, he moved to Jordan. Soon after he was elected president of the P.L.O. in 1969, he built it into an umbrella organization that encompassed military, political and social organizations.
As his power base in Jordan grew, he became embroiled in a struggle with King Hussein of Jordan, who became concerned that the P.L.O. was planning to take over the country.
What ensued was a bitter nine-day civil war in 1970 that has become known as Black September. Thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of King Hussein's Bedouin soldiers fought street-by-street battles that ended in Mr. Arafat's first big strategic defeat by an Arab army. He fled to Lebanon.
Quickly, however, he began to make his first comeback, building a much bigger, more influential state-within-a-state in Lebanon than he had in Jordan.
 
Golden Age in Beirut
 In the early 1970's, thousands of young Palestinians flocked to join Abu Ammar, as Palestinians call Mr. Arafat. Beirut saw the golden age of Mr. Arafat's P.L.O. and Lebanese and Arab politicians looked to him for political consultations, photo opportunities and deals. Millions flowed into the organization's coffers from the Gulf Arabs as well as other oil-rich states like Libya and Iraq.
In the 1970's, the P.L.O. fast became one of the international left's most romantic organizations. When it began to sponsor the hijacking of airplanes, it became one of the most famous. While its aim was to wage a war against Israel, Mr. Arafat's grandiose schemes cast it against much of the West with support from much of the Communist world.
 
Accumulating Power
 By that time, Mr. Arafat was also commander in chief of an estimated 15,000 Palestinian troops, chairman of the P.L.O. and president of Fatah. That marked the beginning of his pattern of accumulating power in his hands. He now also has the title of President of Palestine and has received ambassadors like the Pakistani envoy who presented him with his credentials on Thursday.
It was also in Beirut that Mr. Arafat developed his flair for theatrics and costume: the neatly pressed olive-drab fatigues and the kaffiyeh, a Palestinian headdress, and matching ascot.
But the secret of his success remained as always his fine sense of what his people want. Wrong or right, he rarely went against the instincts of most Palestinians, even when, as in the case of the Palestinians' support of Iraq during the Gulf crisis, the instincts led to catastrophe.
Palestinians may criticize Mr. Arafat bitterly, but all it takes is the sight of him to make them melt in admiration. He cultivates personal loyalties the way a farmer tends to his field. He has been known to astonish visitors with his memory of previous encounters.
He is a dictator who always speaks of the Palestine Liberation Organization as a "democratic organization." In fact, he does allow a margin of freedom to his fellow leaders that permits an extraordinary amount of dissent, far more than any other Arab ruler.
 
Biding His Time
 In the last few days here, for example, while the world awaited the P.L.O.'s decision on the final text of two agreements with Israel, he let dissenters vent all their poison against him, against Israel and against the proposed accord. All he had to do was call for a vote. But he took his time and said little. When the vote came, it was when none of his associates had anything further to add and, more significantly, after he had let the whole world know that his answer was going to be yes.
Among his closest associates he is referred to as "Al Khityar," or "the Old Man," a term he likes. One of his strengths is that he is, among all Palestinian leaders, by far the one who has a reputation for the greatest personal integrity.
Unlike many of his dissenting lieutenants and colleagues, he has always managed to convey to his estimated five million compatriots the notion that while he is far from perfect, he is unequivocally devoted to fight for their cause. He lives simply. He does not drink or smoke, and has never been known to have a good time, go to a party, or do anything but work.
Until his marriage three years ago to Suha Tawil, 32, a Christian who is a graduate of the Sorbonne, he lived with excessive frugality, remaining, as he said many times, "married to the Palestinian revolution."
 
Venom Over Marriage
 Mrs. Arafat had worked as one of his personal assistants for economic affairs in his office after they met in Paris in 1988. She is the daughter of Raymonda Tawil, a member of the Palestinian movement who founded a news agency in the Israeli-occupied territories and was repeatedly harassed by Israeli authorities who eventually shut her business down. The family moved to Paris more than a decade ago.
Mrs. Arafat is known to be a fervent supporter of the Palestinian movement. Mr. Arafat took more than a year before confirming the wedding, and the fact that his wife is a Christian inspired venom in Muslim fundamentalist movements.
The marriage tempered his wildest excesses, but it does not appear to have changed his life style much. One night about two years ago, after an interview that ended at 3:00 A.M. here, he invited a reporter to dinner. On the table there was nothing more than a dozen hard-boiled eggs, stale bread, mineral water and cheese in plastic wrappers.
While Mr. Arafat is one of the Arab world's most notorious wheelers and dealers, most of his followers who remain devoted to him, admire him particularly for preventing Arab countries from trying to control and manipulate Palestinians. This long-held bitterness against fellow Arabs has finally come to fruition in his deals with Israel.
There is little doubt that one of the cherished byproducts of the accord was to signal that Palestinians, who have long suffered humiliating treatment by other Arabs, can move on their own.
 
Farther From Home
 The Israeli invasion of Beirut, during which he became the object of man-hunt by Israeli commandos aided by spies and technically advanced gear, was his second major setback. He successfully evaded his pursuers, developing his remarkable ability to take care of his personal security. He was eventually expelled and moved here to Tunis, still farther from Palestine.
In Lebanon, where he lived for years, he fine-tuned his knack for personal security. He has been known to trust a tiny circle of personal guards, to sleep in cars parked in empty lots guarded by his personal security agents and to spend each night in a different apartment. He always moves without warning, flying in private planes, borrowed from Arab governments but with his own pilots. He keeps departure time, routing and sometimes the destination strictly to himself until after takeoff.
When his Russian-made plane crashed last year in the Libyan desert, he stood in the back of the plane as it went down murmuringaccording to associates on the flight: "I am coming to join you Abu Jihad. I am coming to join you."
Abu Jihad, whose real name was Khalil al-Wazir, was a founder of Fatah and the P.L.O. He was assassinated by Israeli commandoes in 1988 in his home in Tunis.
 
2 Best Friends Slain
 Now, Mr. Arafat is said to be planning upon his entry into Jericho, anticipated for the first of January, to take the coffins of his two best friends, Abu Jihad and Salah Khalef, otherwise known as Abu Ayyad, who was also assassinated, here in Tunis by a dissident Palestinian faction, the moment he steps back into "Palestine."
It is difficult to predict what will happen from now until then, given the threats against Mr. Arafat's life and the evident malaise widely shared by many Palestinians -- and even more by other Arabs -- about the meager gains the agreement provides compared to the grandiose dreams of 45 years of struggle.
But the words he told an interviewer 10 years ago still seem to reflect his own position: "Oh, if only the Palestinians and the Jews unite. The resulting genius, the pooling of material and intellectual resources of our two people are enough to overcome the duplicity, selfishness and corruption of most Arab regimes."

HEADLINE: COUP ANNIVERSARY IS MARKED IN CHILE

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Sept. 11

 BODY:
On Thursday, students began throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails and burning tires. On Friday, hundreds of supporters of Gen. Augusto Pinochet staged an all-night vigil outside his home.
Today, Socialists and Communists marched on the presidential palace and skirmished with the police; three bombs were deactivated at headquarters of right-wing political parties; two other bombs exploded at power pylons, and two McDonald's and one Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet -- symbols of American business presence here -- were targets of attempted bombings. The police reported at least two deaths today, an elderly man who was struck by a police water-cannon vehicle and a young boy killed by a gunshot wound. 
 Chileans are looking back in anxiety to 20 years ago today, when the military, led by General Pinochet, swarmed into this city and bombed the presidential palace.
 
17 Years of Military Rule
 President Salvador Allende, a Socialist, died in the coup in what a medical team concluded was a suicide, and Chile entered 17 years of military rule and the so-called dirty war to systematically eliminate the leftist opposition. In the end, more than 2,000 people were killed or made to "disappear," and thousands were imprisoned and tortured. That ended in 1990, when General Pinochet stepped down as President after losing an attempt to be elected and was succeeded by the victorious Christian Democratic candidate, Patricio Aylwin.
The anniversary of the military coup is a day that divides Chile, which now enjoys one of the most stable democracies in Latin America and a booming economy.
"There is a fight for history going on here," said Jaime Esteves, a Socialist Party member of Congress. "Pinochet wants to pass into history as the man who modernized Chile, the great Jefferson of Chile. We want to say that bloody period was not a positive thing."
Many here dispute that point. In fact, what surprises observers is the strength of the conservative streak, the support for the general, who at 77 still runs the military, and the sentiment that stability and economic prosperity take precedence over righting the wrongs of the past Government.
Though Pinochetistas, as they are called, do not wish the general to return to politics, they point to the economic and social convulsions brought on by the Allende Government -- the food lines, the hyperinflation, the seizure of land and factories by workers and the political closeness to Moscow and Havana -- and say the coup was worth it.
 
Prosperity Amid Rights Abuses
 The military re-established order, these people say, and left a vibrant economy.
Last year, with an inflation rate of 12.7 percent, Chile grew more than 10 percent. Its fruits, wine, salmon, lumber and copper are exported to the world, and the country has become a focus of intense foreign investment.
"Pinochet marks the beginning of the modernization of Chile,"said Domingo Arteaga Echeverria, secretary general of the United Democratic Union, a right-wing party. "Someday people will look back at Sept. 11 and see it as a key date."
But others remain deeply troubled by the human rights abuses and by the fact that no officer has been imprisoned for murder or torture. More than 800 cases remain unresolved, and the military has refused to provide information about the victims.
"This is an open wound in our society that cannot be closed," said Genaro Arriagada, secretary general of the Christian Democratic Party.
Under an amnesty law instituted by General Pinochet, no member of the military can be sent to prison for human rights abuses committed from 1973 to 1978, but the Government has still permitted court investigations of the abuses.
General Pinochet is considered an embarrassment in the international political arena, but he also leads the finest army in Latin America and is guaranteed the position as commander in chief of the army until 1998; thus he remains a major political force.
 
Pinochet Answers to Himself
 He does not openly defy civilian authority, but seems to enjoy reminding the public that in the end, he answers only to himself.
In May, disturbed by an investigation into the financial dealings of his son, he called out the army's black berets in a show of force. And the military recently threatened to bring one senior politician before military courts for every officer asked to testify in a human rights case.
Today, General Pinochet referred to the coup, saying, "He who has been in battle knows what the noise of bullets means, knows what it is like to face enemies, knows when someone falls at one's feet. All this produces a mental uncontrol which many times leads to unjustified excesses."
"Those who have done nothing, can fear nothing," General Pinochet said.
Ands this week at Chile's Union Club, where the army was honored, he said "We did not move against disarmed people, against unprepared or innocent people. Here in Chile there were 15,000 guerrillas."
Despite the fear of violence on the anniversary of the coup, no one fears military intervention and Chileans seem to expect continued stability. But many say that it may take decades to bring the military under full civilian control and that most human rights cases will never be resolved.

HEADLINE: Fewer Tickets As Goal Shifts From Revenue

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
After climbing steadily for several years, the number of parking tickets issued by traffic agents in New York City plummeted to 6.6 million from 8.9 million, or by 26 percent, in the fiscal year that ended in June.
The unexpected drop has provoked and puzzled the city's budget officials, who are concerned about a significant loss of revenue at a time of severe economic pressure. 
 But the Department of Transportation says the decline, while attributable to a number of factors, nonetheless fits in with its own shifting philosophy: moving away from infractions that merely milk a municipal cash cow and focusing instead on violations that cause traffic congestion and present safety hazards.
The city's Transportation Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio, has responded to the decline in tickets issued by agents in the Bureau of Traffic, which his department oversees, with internal and independent reviews for the underlying causes. "We're looking at this phenomenon from all different aspects to find the source of the drop-off," he said.
 
Deliberate Change of Approach
 The decline can be attributed in part to a deliberate change of approach. "We're trying to de-emphasize summonses that do not have a direct impact on traffic flow and quality of life," Mr. Riccio said. "Not cutting your wheels to the curb is a classic example of a summons that doesn't greatly contribute to the traffic mission of the department."
The Department of Transportation points with pride to the average traffic speed in midtown Manhattan: 7.7 miles an hour. It sounds laughably low, but is actually the highest average in a decade.
Other examples of "low-hanging fruit" that agents are encouraged to ignore, according to a department memo explaining the decline in tickets, are illegally parked cars in residential areas during early-morning hours on Sundays, expired inspection stickers, cars faced the wrong way on dead-end streets and wheels aligned more than 12 inches from the curb. (This last violation was removed from the books altogether last year, replaced by one that prohibits a car from blocking a moving lane.)
Officials of the Office of Management and Budget question whether the price tag on the Transportation Department's new approach is one the city can afford. Mark Montgomery, an assistant director at O.M.B., estimates that the shortfall in 1993 will cost the city $53 million over two years. "It's a drop in the bucket in terms of the overall budget but that's not how I look at it," he said. "Fifty million dollars is a lot of jobs and a lot of services."
 
Hope Seems Optimistic
 Budget officials were hoping that the decline would be reversed in the current fiscal year, returning to 8.2 million summonses. But preliminary data from tickets issued in July and August indicate that that projection is overly optimistic.
The brown-clad traffic agents issue about two-thirds of all parking tickets, with most of the remainder handed out by the police and a small part given by workers at some 30 other agencies, from the Department of Sanitation to the Parks Department. The budget office said there was only a slight decrease in the number of tickets issued by the police.
Transportation officials have some strong hunches about causes of the decline. In fact, there is a virtual laundry list cited by the department to account for the sudden plunge in tickets, which reached the lowest level since 1987.
Apart from the Department of Transportation's change in emphasis, other opportunities for the nearly 2,000 traffic agents to catch a violator were removed.
 
Alternate-Side Suspensions
 There was more frequent suspension of alternate-side parking, both because of the elimination of Wednesday and Saturday street cleaning regulations and because of the addition of six religious holidays. With steeper fines accompanying parking tickets, more and more motorists are avoiding summonses by "sitting" in their cars as they double-park or occupy a space next to a fire hydrant. And deferred maintenance on street signs has reduced the number of blocks where tickets can legally be given.
The December northeaster and the March blizzard also led to the suspension of alternate-side parking, and one-time events like the Democratic National Convention and the World Trade Center explosion diverted agents from issuing summonses to directing traffic.
On the Bureau of Traffic's end, there was a high absentee rate of 23 percent among agents, partly because a less-than-expected turnover rate in the last two years meant that more workers had accrued greater vacation time and sick leave.
City officials say, too, that the productivity of individual agents has been hurt by the effects of rising confrontations with the public, including violent assaults. One agent had some fingers blown off by a cherry bomb. Another was whipped with a chain. Others have been shot.
 
Confrontations More Likely
 With a new focus on commercial areas, where officials say it is vital to keep cars from blocking bus stops and traffic lanes and to insure turnover in front of businesses and stores, there are more chances for confrontations. "In residential areas, vehicles aren't watched as closely," said Michael Primeggia, Deputy Transportation Commissioner for Traffic. "In a commercial strip, people park for a shorter period of time."
The department has also recently and emphatically told its agents that they are not subject to any ticket quota. That reminder, plus the reduced emphasis on certain summonses, might have made agents less aggressive by giving them more discretion, the department memo said.
The average number of tickets issued per shift by agents on foot patrol fell from 37 in 1992 to 34 in 1993. For agents in cars, the average ticket number per shift dropped from 54 to 51 during the same time.
"Cooping," or slacking off on the job by agents, was identified as a problem two years ago in a Department of Investigation report, but officials say they have cracked down on popular hangouts and have weeded out the worst violators. Other problems were the writing of fraudulent tickets and the dumping of summonses on abandoned vehicles, practices that may have arisen from a sense by agents that they had to meet quotas.
 
'Integrity' Training for Agents
 As a result of those findings, the Department of Transportation started a campaign called the "total commitment to integrity," which beefed up training for agents, stressed professionalism and sent supervisors into the field to make random inspections. "We wanted to make sure the agents understood that just writing large numbers of tickets was not our highest order," Mr. Riccio said.
The Office of Management and Budget says it recognizes that the main objective for the Bureau of Traffic is traffic management, not revenue generation. But the agency has still asked transportation officials to re-examine their plans.
"We don't want to balance the budget over the backs of motorists, but clearly the financial implications are great," Mr. Montgomery said.
"If there's an indication from the agency that parking enforcement is going to encounter fewer violations on the street," he said, "it would make sense to cut some positions. And if they feel the parking rules are inappropriate, they should advocate change."

HEADLINE: President Appeals for Trust From Bastion of Skepticism

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Traveling to an area where many voters have been skeptical of some of his Administration's more ambitious initiatives, President Clinton told Texas officials today that his plan to streamline Government would be the first step in persuading Americans that he can be trusted to expand North American trade, overhaul health care and even promote peace in the Middle East.
The theme of impending grand challenges was a constant today, in the President's weekly radio address and in his appearance with Vice President Al Gore at a state surplus property warehouse, where the two leaders talked about how Government can be made more customer-friendly and trustworthy. 
 Even as he completed a four-day tour promoting a plan to streamline government, White House officials in Washington were scrambling to prepare for the signing of a Middle East peace agreement and to put the final touches on an extensive plan to restructure health care.
"We're living in truly revolutionary times, with profound changes sweeping the entire world," the President said in the radio address. "Reforming, indeed, reinventing government is essential to make our economic health care and trade efforts succeed."
 
Goodwill Over Strategy
 Reminders of the challenges that await him after Monday's foreign policy celebration were everywhere. A group of about 100 supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement were summoned by Mayor Bob Lanier to the President's hotel for what they thought would be a meeting about Nafta strategy. It turned out to be an informal round of handshaking with Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton.
Even these Nafta supporters seemed nervous about Mr. Clinton's commitment to an agreement that several said would help Texas businesses. "I don't think it has been addressed yet," said Fan Dorman, president of the Houston Interamerican Chamber of Commerce, speaking of the Administration's selling of the pact.
But nothing detracted the President in his effort to showcase the sweeping recommendations for streamlining the Government that were made this week in the National Performance Review.
 
Clinton Signs 3 Orders
 Gov. Ann W. Richards and several other state officials joined Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore in a sweltering government warehouse today to ask public officials for their ideas about how to make Government work more efficiently. With some minor fanfare, the President also signed three orders that he said would help achieve the aims of the performance review.
The orders would direct Government agencies to cut regulations in half, prepare reports on how to cut Government jobs by 12 percent across the board and develop new customer service initiatives.
Mr. Clinton said that such steps had to be taken before the Administration could hope to win support for proposals like the trade agreement. The accord has divided Democrats in Congress and angered labor leaders who argue that the pact will make it easier for companies to move jobs to Mexico.
Mr. Clinton has been stung in recent days by complaints in Congress and murmurings among his own staff about the relative importance of the Nafta agreement, which has already sown seeds of dissent within the coalition the White House needs to approve the sweeping changes he will recommend in health care.
To counteract the impression that the President is backing away from Nafta, the Administration has planned a White House signing ceremony on Tuesday for labor and environmental side agreements to the pact, with former Presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter in attendance.
But Mr. Clinton said today that he could not hope to whip up support for free trade or any other issue unless Americans could be convinced to take the plan to streamline government seriously.
"Texas is the probably the only state in America right now where there's overwhelming public support for the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, which I strongly support," he said.
The agreement, he said, would increase spending for environmental cleanup along the borders and raise wages in Mexico.
"Nobody has ever agreed to that in a trade agreement," he said. "And it's a blip on the screen. Why? Because a lot of people in this country whose jobs are at risk do not trust the national Government to do anything right."
"So what we've got to do with this reinventing government is not only save money and give you better service, but restore the trust of the American people that together through our elected officials, we can actually solve problems," he said.

HEADLINE: Rochester Retrenches as Kodak Cuts Work Force

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company had always been there for Mark Assini, even paying his college bills 13 years ago.
But the investment that Kodak made in his education was not enough to save his job. Mr. Assini's election to the Monroe County Legislature last fall did not help either. 
 This spring, he was laid off, sent home to face a future that included three young children and a wife recovering from a stroke.
"It was not so much a shock because I had seen others get laid off," said Mr. Assini, 34 years old, who had worked in finance and marketing and who had tried to protect himself from a layoff by sticking to Kodak's core product: film. "It was this feeling that after 13 years, after always working hard -- I can't remember ever working only a 40-hour week -- I was out of a job."
 
Down From 60,000
 He is far from alone. The Kodak work force here in Monroe County has shrunk to 40,000, down from more than 60,000 people in the early 1980's. The company has announced its intention to cut another 10,000 jobs worldwide by the end of 1995, it is searching for a new chief executive officer and there has even been talk that it might move its headquarters from Rochester.
The only thing that people here say is certain is the inevitability of change.
"It's just a reality we have to live with," said the Monroe County Executive, Robert L. King.
Thomas T. Mooney, president of the Greater Rochester Metro Chamber of Commerce, said: "It's not just the downsizing but it's changes in the way Kodak produces things. It is highly unrealistic to think any company will get up to that level again in a community our size."
The most immediate concern is the impact that the cuts will have on consumer spending, both by people who have lost jobs and those uncertain whether their paychecks are secure.
"I think there will be a natural slowdown in consumer spending," Mr. Mooney said. "I think there will also be a natural rush of properties on the real estate market. Uncertainty is the biggest reason."
 
Drop in Sales Tax Income
 Mr. King said he was concerned that the county's sales tax income, which has already been lower than expected, will drop even more.
"The uncertainty over how big and how soon will cause everybody to be restrained in what they might do," Mr. King said.
Tony Agostinelli, vice president and director of advertising at Charlotte Appliance, said customers at his store's Labor Day sale seemed to be doing more comparison pricing than ever before.
"I noticed people seemed to be a lot more cautious," Mr. Agostinelli said.
"I have an advantage," he said. "If your refrigerator breaks down, you have to get another one. You may stay home more, but you're still going to watch television. Other industries that don't deal with the essentials are going to be hurt a lot more."
Some business owners are taking an aggressive approach.
John Holtz, a car dealer, has confronted the uncertainty head on. His advertising has been stressing that his dealership will work to develop payment plans buyers can live with.
"I'm not telling people anything they don't already know from the headlines," Mr. Holtz said. "Everybody in Rochester is well aware of the situation."
 
Jobs in Smaller Companies
 Many former Kodak employees have found jobs in smaller companies and the local unemployment rate has not risen above the statewide rate.
"We do have an ability to absorb a substantial number," Mr. Mooney said. "It's difficult to know how much we can absorb, but we do know the economy is very elastic."
Of course, many of these jobs provide paychecks much smaller than those from Kodak.
Mr. Assini, for example, saw his income fall from $40,000 a year while he was working for Kodak to just under $20,000, mostly his salary as a legislator.
"It hasn't been a picnic," he said.
Mr. Assini vows never to become so dependent upon a large company again. He has taken office space in a former motel to work as a travel agent while he looks for employment.
"If I get offered another job," he said, "I will not be left out in the cold because someone at the top made a bad decision."

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Proposes Free Bus-Subway Transfers for Commuters

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who have to take the bus to the subway have long cursed both geography and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which makes them pay for both trips.
Now, with ridership sagging, the M.T.A. has proposed something that will save commuters money, if not time: free transfers. 
 What the M.T.A. is calling for in its four-year business plan, to be presented to its financial committee tomorrow, would do away with so-called two-fare zones, meaning that riders would pay only one fare for both legs of their commute, the way a bus rider can now get a transfer ticket to head uptown after a crosstown trip.
If approved, the change would affect about 400,000 city residents, or 14 percent of the New York City Transit Authority's ridership, and would mark the biggest shift in fare policy since Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia united the three separate subway systems with a single nickel fare in 1940.
 
Good News in Sheepshead Bay
 "It's something that people in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn and Queens Village and Williamsbridge in the Bronx have wanted for generations," said Gene Russianoff, a staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit riders' advocacy group. "If you were to go into my old neighborhood in Sheepshead Bay and ask people what they don't like about New York, on their top-five list would be that they live in a two-fare zone. It's up there with crime and lack of services."
The free transfers -- something the M.T.A. had resisted for years -- are being embraced by its chairman, Peter E. Stangl, as a way to increase ridership, which fell to 1.44 billion in 1992 from 1.56 billion in 1988, largely because of the recession.
"The issue is obviously one of satisfying customers, but it's also trying to provide the type of transportation that this region needs," Mr. Stangl said in an interview. "We need to increase our ridership and deal with the increasing problems of air quality and congestion that will ultimately determine whether this area remains a terrific place to be."
But it is uncertain whether the proposal will survive a vote by the board later this month, primarily because of concerns about cost. And even if the proposal passes, it will not be feasible until the new fare-card machines are installed throughout the bus and subway system, which is expected to take at least three years.
Nonetheless, city officials and commuters alike welcomed its inclusion in the business plan. "It reflects a new movement on behalf of the M.T.A., a dramatic step in the right direction," said Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation adviser to Mayor David N. Dinkins. "This is something he's called for ever since he's been Mayor."
 
Now to Find the Money
 Last year's four-year business plan, which also anticipated the possibilities of automated fare collection, called for a 50 percent discount on the second leg of a combined bus-subway trip. Since then, the M.T.A. has conducted research indicating that such a discount would cost $50 million a year and increase ridership by only 0.4 percent. A free connection, however, while costing $89 million a year, would increase ridership by 3.2 percent.
The big question is money, and it is not clear how this proposal would be financed. The M.T.A. has already said that it will need some increase in the $1.25 fare for subways and buses in 1995. Whether that will be enough to finance the free transfers, or whether an infusion of state and city money would also be necessary, is unclear.
"The discussion of eliminating two-fare zones is a terrific thing because we're trying to encourage people to get out of their automobiles and use mass transit," said Lucius J. Riccio, the New York City Transportation Commissioner. "But you have to really consider the total economic package to make sure that we can do this and pay for it."
Mr. Riccio, one of four mayoral appointees to the M.T.A. board, raised the thorny issue of how income from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority is distributed. Half the tolls collected by the Authority now go to the bus and subway system and the other half to the railroads. "The distribution of the T.B.T.A. tolls puts a lot of money into commuter rail, which runs surpluses, and not enough in the subway, which is in deficit," he said.
M.T.A. officials say that a fare-card system would prevent the abuse of a free connection. A fare card would be encoded with the time and location of a trip, and give a rider only a certain amount of time to get on a connecting subway from a bus.
A plan announced last year under the M.T.A.'s Fare Deal program to sell monthly passes for unlimited trips would also allow free transfers between buses and subways. But the current proposal goes beyond that and would apply to those who wanted to buy a week's worth of fare cards or a card for a single trip.

World Bank Says West Bank and Gaza Need Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The West Bank and Gaza Strip could face a long economic slide, with political tensions continuing to fester, unless they receive large-scale foreign aid and adopt sound economic policies, the World Bank warns in a new report.
Describing a grim situation of low per-capita income, sewage in the streets, interruptions in electricity and a contaminated water supply, the World Bank said the West Bank and Gaza urgently need at least $3 billion in aid over the next decade to improve schools and other services. 
 "The economy of the Occupied Territories is currently in turmoil," the report said. "Income levels have stagnated over the past decade; unemployment and underemployment are rising rapidly; public infrastructure and social services are grossly overstretched."
 
Report Hastily Completed
 The report, which was drafted over the past year and rushed to completion after the Israeli-P.L.O. mutual recognition, said the Palestinians' economy is at a crossroads now that Israel is about to agree to limited self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. Thanks to the Palestinians' high education levels and entrepreneurial flair, their economy could be poised to expand, the World Bank said, but it could just as soon deteriorate if the new Palestinian administration adopts poor policies and receives little aid.
An important factor helping to fuel tensions, the report said, is that the impoverished Palestinians live in such close proximity to Israel, which has a far higher standard of living.
In recent years, the territories' economic problems have been aggravated by the exclusion of many Palestinian workers from Israel as a result of attacks against Israelis and from the Persian Gulf states because of the P.L.O.'s support for Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. This drying up of job opportunities coupled with the fast population growth in the occupied territories could keep tensions high, the report said.
The World Bank undertook the report at the request of Israel, the Palestinians and other parties to the Middle East peace talks for a study to help guide the West Bank and Gaza to a stronger economy in the hope that this would help assure prosperity and peace among Arabs and Israelis.
 
Lack of Phones and Electricity
 The report said the economy in the occupied territories is in shambles because it has so little industry, its trade is so heavily dominated by Israel and its infrastructure is in such poor shape. There is just one phone for every 46 people and in the West Bank, just 80 of 400 villages even have telephone service. About 140 Palestinian villages have no electrical supply or a part-time supply, while a lack of waste-water treatment facilities means that sewage is often discharged into streams.
A major indication of the territories' economic weakness is that such a high percentage of its labor force works outside. Until Israel tightened entry as a result of the Palestinian uprising, almost 40 percent of the territories' labor force worked in Israel.
Industry accounts for just 8 percent of the territories' output, a percentage that is one-third the level of many African nations.

HEADLINE: Mideast Accord: New Calculations;
For Arab Lands, a Raft of Questions

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 11

 BODY:
For decades, the Palestinian cause has been the most sacred in Arab politics, even if the relations between Arab countries and those Palestinians who sought refugee inside their borders were often strained and even violent.
In the 1970's, Palestinians became embroiled in rebellion and civil war in Jordan and later in Lebanon. More recently, Palestinian workers were the target of reprisal and expulsion in Kuwait and other Persian Gulf nations as a result of suspicions that they had conspired with Iraq in the 1991 gulf war. Today, fewer than 150,000 of a prewar population of about 400,000 Palestinians remain in Kuwait. 
 Now, with an accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on limited self-rule in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank town of Jericho, Arab governments and Palestinians alike have some new calculations to contemplate.
 
Three Million in Diaspora
 What happens, for example, if the accord does not provide room within the occupied territories for the 800,000 Palestinians who fled after the 1967 war, or the hundreds of thousands who left between 1948 and 1967? In all, there are an estimated three million in the Palestinian diaspora, the bulk of them still in the Middle East.
And with this and so much else still unclear, just how far should Arab countries go in offering political and economic support to the Palestinian experiment?
So far, the agreement has won the support of most Arab governments, who seem to have regarded it, pragmatically, as an investment in regional stability. But there are risks too.
"Already a lot of Arab countries are coming to face questions they never imagined considering before," a senior Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said. "In particular, if the agreement cannot absorb all those who left, these Arab governments must decide whether they will then be willing to integrate them into their own populations at last. From the beginning they have refused because the defining mythology until now was that someday the Arabs would win and everyone would go back."
 
U.S. Aid an Issue
 Even Egypt, despite its helping in brokering the agreement, concedes its anxieties. Since 1979, when it signed the Camp David accords, exchanging peace with Israel for the Sinai peninsula, Egypt has received $2 billion a year in American military and economic aid.
"We have to ask ourselves too: are we supporting an agreement that will be made at our own expense?" the official said. "We know the U.S. and other Western nations have limits on how much they put into the region, and there is no way we can be certain the same levels of economic assistance will continue in the future"
Among the wealthy oil-exporting nations of the Arab gulf, who have strengthened their strategic ties to the United States since the gulf war, the agreement has received initial approval.
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar declared this week that they would support the agreement, even though they cut off aid to the P.L.O. and most contact with it when its chairman, Yasir Arafat, sided with Iraq in the gulf war.
Western diplomats in the region say the money to make the agreement work will be there when it is needed, but no one has spelled out what they will contribute.
 
In the Vanguard
 The gulf nations have always been in the political vanguard of the Palestinian cause, which burns with special intensity in Saudi Arabia because as the appointed guardian of Islam's holiest shrines it says it cannot accept Israeli control of Jerusalem.
But while the sparsely populated gulf countries have also relied on Palestinian workers imported from elsewhere in the Middle East to help staff their offices and schools, they have regarded them as aliens and refused them permanent settlement.
According to the agreement, the refugee issue could be raised in negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories, which will begin two years after self-rule. Until then, the matter remains unclear.
Abed Rabbo, a P.L.O. official, said last week that the accord would allow all 800,000 refugees who left after 1967 to return. But Israel's Deputy Defense Minister, Mordechai Gur, said Israel would not allow it, denying any Palestinian right of return.
It is in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon that the resettlement question is most sharply drawn, as most of the Palestinians who fled after the 1967 war live there, many still in refugee camps.
 
Reassured, King Says
 King Hussein of Jordan, who has fully supported the agreement, said he was reassured that Jordan would be fully consulted on all matters that concerned it directly, including the question of what will happen to those who fled after the 1967 war.
After the war, Israel occupied an area of the West Bank of the Jordan River that had been under Jordanian authority. Many of those who fled resettled in Jordan, where they now hold Jordanian passports and make up an estimated 60 percent of Jordan's 2.5 million people.
The harshest debate over resettlement has been in Lebanon, which was torn by civil war in the 1970's, when armed Palestinian commandos sided with Muslims, upsetting the careful balance that divided power in the country among Christian and Muslim groups.
So far, the Lebanese have kept a wary distance from the accords, although they said they would do nothing to block them. On Friday, a member of the Lebanese Cabinet declared that no matter what happened, none of the more than 350,000 refugees still in Lebanon would be allowed to settle there.
 
Syrian Support Grudging
 "What lies after Gaza-Jericho?" Foreign Minister Faris Bouez asked last week, giving voice to the question being asked in every Arab capital.
Syria has also given the Israeli-P.L.O. agreement only grudging support, It is home to some 300,000 refugees, including the most militant Palestinian organizations opposed to the accords. President Hafez el-Assad told Mr. Arafat he should do what he believed was best for the Palestinians.
Both Lebanon and Syria are conducting separate negotiations with Israel under the auspices of the formal Middle East peace talks. The 11th round of talks just ended in Washington.

HEADLINE: Germany Finds That Spies Are Still Doing Business

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Fair game for Communist spies during the cold war, Germany has not let down its counterespionage defenses since the collapse of Communism in Europe. German counterspies have caught more agents in the last three years than during most of the time East Germany and the Soviet Union existed, the authorities say.
"The Federal Republic of Germany remains one of the primary targets for foreign intelligence services," said the annual report issued late last month by its domestic security and counterintelligence service. "Simply because of its economic strength and its scientific-technical resources, it offers plenty of opportunities for espionage activities." 
 This week, the counterespionage authorities let it be known that they were hot on the trail of about 30 high-ranking diplomats and career Government employees who had spied for Communist East Germany.
 
Second-Oldest Profession
 Communism came in 1917 and went between 1989 and 1991, but spying -- the world's second-oldest profession, according to the novelist John le Carre -- goes on. Both Russia and Poland have kept open fully staffed spy "residencies" in their embassies and consulates in Germany, the report says, although Russia and Germany now consider each other friends and Poland is clamoring to join NATO. (The report says nothing about whether the United States, France or any other country allied with Germany is spying on it, but it is common knowledge that friends do spy on one another.)
 
Economics the Priority
 Getting an economic edge over their Western competitors, particularly in the international arms trade still so important to many Eastern European countries, is apparently the main reason for cloak-and-dagger activities these days.
But some countries -- particularly from the developing world -- also use secret services to settle political scores with their enemies on German soil. Four Iranian Kurdish leaders were assassinated in Berlin last September, possibly by Iranian intelligence operatives, the Germans believe.
Romania and Bulgaria are still busy gathering political, economic and especially scientific and technological secrets by means both fair and foul, according to the German spy-catchers, and Iran succeeded in infiltrating two intelligence agents, both Iraqis, into Bonn's Federal Press and Information office until they were arrested in the spring of last year.
Almost three years after disappearing into the dust bin of history, East Germany is still keeping Bonn's counterintelligence service fully employed catching up with moles and former agents whose covers are being blown by the discovery of their names in the files of what used to be the State Security Ministry in Berlin.
Last year, the agency -- whose full name is the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, based in Cologne -- conducted 1,737 investigations into suspected treason or other intelligence activities, and arrested 56 suspected spies, including 38 from the former East Germany, one from Poland and one from Iran. Prosecutors convicted 22 people.
The agency said it had opened investigations on more than 2,200 so-called "traces," former East German agents mentioned in files inherited from the old Ministry for State Security. These files have enabled the agency to catch agents it could not track down during the cold war. So far, 972 have been identified through the files, the agency said, and the end is not yet in sight.
"The removal of the threat from world Communism has not made the domestic security service superfluous," said Interior Minister Manfred Kanther.
 
'Never Had So Much Work'
 Sounding like a man defending his agency's budget, which has remained roughly constant over the last two years despite staff cuts, one of his officials said, "The counterespionage division has never had so much work as it does today."
Bonn's security services have never been so shrouded in official secrecy as Britain's. In fact, the reverse was true; they were so open that the standing joke in the 1970's was that they leaked like a sieve. One head of the counterespionage service, Hansjoachim Tiedge, defected to East Germany in 1985.
After the Berlin wall came down in 1989, the federal office in Cologne was reduced from 2,500 people to about 2,200, but the reductions were suspended in 1992 as the threat of violence from right-wing militants grew. A spokesman said the counterespionage division, whose size has never been disclosed, had shrunk while the sections responsible for investigating militant groups had absorbed a greater share of the agency's $139.4 million budget in recent years.
The counterspies have been busy. This summer, investigators arrested Rainer Rupp, a high-ranking member of the German mission to NATO, and charged him and his wife with having supplied the Communists with top-secret alliance documents for many years.
Investigators also questioned Karl Wienand, a former opposition Social Democratic leader in Parliament, and Wolfgang Luder, a Free Democratic legislator from Berlin, but later cleared both men of suspicion of having been East German agents.
 
Markus Wolf on Trial
 Markus Wolf, who headed the East German foreign intelligence service until 1986, has been on trial in Dusseldorf since May on charges of treason and bribery. Bonn's counterspies are still worried about some of his legacies, particularly informants his agents tricked into thinking they were working for German industry or a "friendly" intelligence service.
One such case, of a German woman who worked for the United States military, was recruited this way by being misled into thinking she was actually supplying Dutch intelligence with information.
Her control officer went to work for the Soviet K.G.B. after East Germany vanished, and she kept supplying him with information for the Dutch until she was stopped in the spring of 1992, after the Soviet Union had broken up.
"Agents recruited and run under 'foreign colors' this way could be taken over by the K.G.B. relatively simply," the German agency said.
 
Four Agencies Succeed K.G.B.
 The K.G.B. was dismantled after the country it served went out of existence at the end of 1991, but Russia now has four separate intelligence-gathering services, and judging by Bonn's experience they are still up to many of the K.G.B.'s old tricks.
"Illegals" -- spies who do not work out of embassies but run networks of agents under cover and, often, false identities -- still find Germany a magnet, but some of the Russian ones operate with all the subtlety shown by Boris and Natasha in the old Bullwinkle cartoons.
The agency's report said that on April 23 of last year, for instance, a man and a woman, claiming to be named John David A. and Elizabeth Anne G. and born British, emerged from an Aeroflot plane in Helsinki, Finland, where the authorities became suspicious because both ostensible Anglo-Saxons had heavy Eastern European accents. They also were carrying $30,000 in cash, a modified short-range radio receiver, and materials used for writing coded messages.
After questioning, the pair finally admitted to being not Britons but Russians, and Finnish officials expelled them to Russia.
"All the circumstances indicate the two were either going on assignment for a foreign intelligence service as 'illegals' or were on their way back from a consultation in Moscow," the report said. "Articles in their luggage that were made in Germany strongly indicated that this could have been their operational area."
 
Spy Gets Suspended Term
 Stephen Laufer, a German citizen who was working as press officer for the United States Mission in Berlin, was arrested as a spy for the K.G.B. in 1991 and was convicted and given an 18-month suspended sentence last year. The German agency said Mr. Laufer, who now reportedly lives and works in South Africa, had asked his Russian control officer to let him fade into the woodwork after the Berlin wall fell in late 1989. But he did not turn himself in to the German authorities; they had to catch him.
Most present-day Russian intelligence activity against the Germans is concentrated on prying out industrial and economic secrets, with a special division of the main Russian service run by Yevgeny Primakov dedicated exclusively to collecting information on economic conditions and developments in Germany, the United States and other leading industrial countries.
"Western companies, banks, think tanks and economic journals enjoy the status of top priority targets," the German counterintelligence agency reported, adding that the aim was to acquire information that could be used to modernize Russian enterprises and improve their ability to compete on world markets.
"It has been observed that since 1991, numerous Russian intelligence officers assigned to Germany have 'left' the service and tried to establish themselves in private enterprise in Russia or in Germany," the German report said. "It can be assumed that not all of these persons have broken with their former employer."
 
Spy Chief Interviewed
 Mr. Primakov, the agency noted, had even acknowledged his service's new priorities in an interview with The Sunday Times of London last September. In the interview, he announced that Russia was cutting back intelligence activities in Africa and the Far East.
Mr. Kanther said the Russian services had reduced their "legal" agents in consulates and the embassy here by about a third during the last year. But those that remain are still believed to be working hard.
"Both services are continuing their intelligence work in the classic fields of espionage -- politics, science and technology, the economy and the military," the annual report said. "But the readiness to take operational risks that was observed in earlier years has diminished markedly."
Many Germans, the counterintelligence agency warned, were under the impression that all Russians were their friends now. Sounding wistful for the days when everybody knew that loose lips could sink ships, the counterspy service reported, "In contacts with official Russians there is a growing tendency to be frank and ready to disregard the still-appropriate need for caution in communicating information."

HEADLINE: Why the Cars In Japan Look Just Like New

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 11

 BODY:
One of the first things an American motorist might notice about Japan is that the automobiles here all seem so shiny and new, without smashed headlights, dents, rust or even dirt.
The reason is only partly that Japanese fastidiousness extends to the maintenance of cars. Rather, experts say, there really are relatively few old cars in Japan, because of an automobile inspection system that is so onerous and expensive that many people prefer to trade in a perfectly good three- or five-year-old car rather than spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars for the inspection. 
 The inspection system, critics say, is a case study of the regulations in Japan that benefit businesses at the expense of hard-pressed consumers. It is the type of regulation that Japan's new Government is promising to relax as part of a major effort to improve living conditions.
 
Consumer Group Complains
 "The people who profit from this are maintenance shops and car makers," said Fumio Matsuda, head of the Japan Automobile Consumers Union.
Japan's 83,000 garages obtain 44 percent of their roughly $60 billion in annual revenues as a result of mandatory inspections. Automobile companies benefit because people replace their cars frequently.
Inspections are required when a car turns 3 years old, then every 2 years until the car turns 11, then every year. The inspections, which cover more than 100 items from brake function to headlight orientation, are done by a Government test center or by an authorized service station.
Other nations and many states in the United States also require inspections, either of emissions alone or also of the car's functioning, but Japan also requires car owners to have certain items checked or serviced every 6 months, 12 months or 24 months.
Another big difference is that Japan's Government asks the owner to have the car repaired before it is inspected, so that it will pass. Faced with this requirement, most owners give their car to the dealer or a service station to prepare it for inspection.
"You take it to the garage and they will just change everything, even if there is nothing wrong with the car," Kenichi Ohmae, organizer of Heisei Reform, a movement that advocates less Government control over Japan's economy. said. "If they keep fiddling with the car, there are more problems after the inspection."
 
Inspection Itself Costs $12
 A typical bill for this pre-inspection inspection is $600. The actual inspection at a test center costs only about $12.
Government officials defend the inspection system as necessary to keep traffic flowing. In Japan, where congestion is horrendous and highways often have only two lanes in each direction, a vehicle breakdown is far more disruptive than in the spacious United States, they say.
"Inspection actually contributes to the situation where most of our automobiles run in good condition," said Takashi Shimodaira, director of the maintenance service division of the Transport Ministry.
He said that only 1 in 2,000 car accidents in Japan were caused by mechanical failure, compared with between 1 in 200 and 1 in 20 in the United States and Europe.
In the United States, 64.1 percent of passenger cars in 1991 were at least five years old. In Japan, only 46.8 percent were. In the United States, 30.5 percent of cars were at least 10 years old, versus 9.6 percent in Japan.
With little demand for used cars, cars here lose their value quickly. "A car more than six years old and in very good condition you can easily see in a junkyard," said Hiroshige Hanabusa, who makes a living helping people with the administrative chores associated with their cars.
Many of the used cars find their way to other nations, where they are considered bargains. In New Zealand, used Japanese cars are cutting so heavily into sales of new cars that auto dealers and assemblers have complained to the Government. And Russians can't get enough of old Japanese cars.
 
Taking Cars Home to Moscow
 Last year, when a Russian circus returned to Moscow after a tour of Japan, 93 animals, including bears, leopards and parrots, were abandoned on the dock at Yokohama. There was no room for them because the ship was full of used cars bought by the crew.
In June an advisory committee to the Transport Ministry recommended several changes to the inspection system to be carried out in the next two years.
The periodic 6-month checks would be abolished and the number of items in the 12 and 24-month checks would be reduced. Cars more than 11 years old would need inspection every 2 years, instead of every year. And consumers would have the option of going for their inspection first and then doing the maintenance found to be necessary.
Even without the committee's plan, things are changing. The recession is causing Japanese consumers to hold on to cars longer. And a growing number of people, though still only 1 percent of the car owners, are doing the pre-inspection inspections themselves rather than take their car to a garage.
"I started checking the items one month ago, so I did it gradually," said Toyokazu Yamada, who had just run his Toyota pickup through the Government testing center in Tokyo.
The inspection showed his brakes to be a little loose, and he was told to have them repaired and come back. He left, drove around, came back and entered a different lane. This time, he passed.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Whitman Calls a Florio Plan 'Right-Wing'

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
It is as though the two major candidates for governor followed Alice down the rabbit hole.
Even by the frequently wild swings of New Jersey politics, the first week of all-out campaigning by Gov. Jim Florio and Christine Todd Whitman was topsy-turvy. It began with the candidates clashing over guns, legal threats and the First Amendment. It ended with an angry debate over welfare that presented a curious role reversal: Mrs. Whitman, a Republican, accused Mr. Florio of "extreme right-wing radicalism" and Mr. Florio, a Democrat, staunchly defended sweeping new regulations on welfare recipients. 
 With the election barely seven weeks away, each candidate began the revved-up, post-Labor Day phase of the campaign slamming the other while prospecting for issues to lure the sizable bloc of middle-income voters who are believed to be still undecided and who control the outcome of the race.
As the last weeks of the campaign unfold, the driving issues for Mrs. Whitman continue to be her now-familiar attacks on a bitter tax increase and a sour economy, both of which she attributes to the Governor.
The strategy for Mr. Florio is largely unchanged, too: Find anything to distract voter attention from the record $2.8 billion tax increase he orchestrated three years ago, and keep Mrs. Whitman's campaign off-stride.
For Mr. Florio, the issues of the moment are welfare and guns, the two points on which he is most highly regarded in the polls, although it is unclear just how big an impact either is having with the electorate.
Following up on a year-old state welfare reform program that he has championed as a national model, Mr. Florio on Thursday proposed further reforms, including requiring mothers to provide the name of the father and other information about him for the child to be eligible for welfare benefits. The timing of Mr. Florio's announcement and his recent calls for preservation of the state's mandatory sentencing laws are both seen as efforts to court middle-class voters.
 
'Demeaning and Degrading'
 But Mrs. Whitman immediately fired a broadside at the Florio welfare plan, accusing the Governor of political pandering.
"The Governor is playing to the most vicious stereotype of a welfare recipient in the most demeaning and degrading way possible," Mrs. Whitman said. "What is the Governor's next idea in his headlong rush to embrace extreme right-wing radicalism? A program of tattoos for welfare mothers? A badge sewn on to their clothing identifying them as welfare recipients? Creation of colonies, like leper colonies, where welfare recipients would be forced to live? How about an involuntary re-location program into camps?"
On Friday a stern-faced and testy Mr. Florio called a news conference to respond to Mrs. Whitman's attack and to breathe another day of life into the story.
"I am disturbed that Mrs. Whitman would react to this by firing off such a knee-jerk, intemperate statement before she even had a chance to study my proposals," the Governor said.
"And it insults the victims of the Holocaust to make allusions to Nazi Germany in the context of welfare reform that brings families together and makes parents meet their obligations to their children."
 
Warning on N.R.A. Ads
 Days before welfare ballooned into an issue, Mr. Florio set the pace for the final weeks of campaigning with a two-pronged attack. One prong was a television ad that tried to link Mrs. Whitman to the National Rifle Association's efforts earlier this year to overturn New Jersey's ban on semiautomatic weapons. The other was a bit of legal maneuvering intended to disrupt an N.R.A. campaign against the Governor.
The legal maneuvering began with a letter that the Florio campaign sent to all commercial television stations in New Jersey, New York City and Philadelphia and all New Jersey radio stations. Citing a slew of court cases and Federal Communications Commission regulations, the letter warned the broadcasters against accepting from the National Rifle Association or its affiliates or front groups "distorting ads designed to smear Governor Florio."
"We warn you that the N.R.A. or its agents may misrepresent or distort the issues in an attempt to mislead the public about Governor Florio's records and positions," said the letter, which was signed by the chief counsel for the campaign, Angelo J. Genova. "We appeal to your best editorial judgment as well as your interest in providing the voting public with accurate and truthful information about issues of concern to them, and urge you not to accept these commercials."
Mrs. Whitman demanded that Mr. Florio disavow the letter "or admit publicly that he thinks the First Amendment to the Constitution was written in disappearing ink."
"The Governor apparently feels very strongly, to the point of threatening legal action and broadcast license challenges, that his record shouldn't be criticized or that he shouldn't be called to account for it," Mrs. Whitman said.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Dinkins Safe in Primary, But Not in November

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's certain victory in the Democratic primary on Tuesday reveals a paradox of black New Yorkers' political power: His race has helped him stave off any real challenge to renomination, but it remains one of his greatest vulnerabilities as he fights to avoid becoming the first black mayor of a major American city to be defeated in his quest for a second term.
The demographics of the city's Democratic primary electorate -- in which blacks account for about one-third of the vote and a candidate needs just 40 percent of the total vote to avoid a runoff -- drove away otherwise serious contenders, who could not hope to crack Mr. Dinkins's base despite his rocky term. He is left facing a negligible challenge from two political gadflies, one of whom happens to be black, the other Hispanic. 
 But that very strength among black Democrats counts for much less among the general electorate because no single ethnic or racial group predominates . And even though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by 5 to 1, whites showed their willingness to defect in droves four years ago, leaving Mr. Dinkins with not quite 30 percent of the white vote (which was still a national record for a first-time black victor in a racially diverse city).
In short, historians and political analysts agree, this election could prove to be just as great a transitional moment in the city's coalition politics as Mr. Dinkins's victory in becoming the first black mayor. Polls show that Rudolph W. Giuliani has peeled away some of the liberal white and Hispanic voters who helped make the Mayor's two-point margin of victory. Black population growth is declining in relation to waves of new Asian and Hispanic immigrants, many of whom are not yet citizens or registered to vote. All of this could eventually lead to an environment of shifting coalitions, whether Mr. Dinkins wins or loses this year.
 
Iffy Alliances
 "What happened in '89 was in some respects premature, reflecting more the Democratic primary electorate than the electorate as a whole," said Chris McNickle, the author of the current book "To Be Mayor of New York" (Columbia University Press), a study of the changing ethnic alliances of the last 50 years. "In the Democratic electorate, a black candidate has a terrific base of support, but in the city as a whole, the electorate is still quite evenly split."
Of course, any incumbent has a presumed advantage in winning his party's renomination. But the last Mayor to face a term as tempestuous as Mr. Dinkins's, Abraham D. Beame in the mid-1970's, fell to a crowded field of challengers. Mr. Dinkins won the nomination four years ago on the strength of sentiment against Edward I. Koch, who had come to be seen as racially divisive, and he began the campaign for the general election in November well ahead of Mr. Giuliani in the polls, borne on by his promise of racial healing.
But his coalition was always wispy, connected more by a general sense of hope than by clearly defined and shared priorities, and the Mayor has had big trouble consolidating that coalition in office. Polls show that a clear plurality of New Yorkers believes that Mr. Dinkins has not managed to make much of a difference in race relations, and that a bare majority now believes that any mayor could, compared with nearly 6 in 10 surveyed four years ago.
"It was an alliance based on the good will of whites and Hispanics, but it was held together with spit and toothpicks," said Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College and the author of "Two Nations: Black and White, Separate, Hostile and Unequal" (Scribner's, 1992). "It was so iffy, and clearly in the last four years that alliance didn't become any stronger."
 
Promise Unfulfilled
 Mr. Dinkins's race has always been a distinctly double-edged sword. Four years ago, he won in no small measure by appealing to whites' sense that it was time for a black candidate, and also to a pragmatic sense that a black mayor might be specially equipped to deal with racial tensions, while Mr. Giuliani was often seen as a candidate of white resentment.
"People liked Dinkins precisely because of his nonracial appeal, somebody who was black and showed us that this city was big enough to elect a black Mayor, and yet doesn't go around saying, 'We've got power' and 'In your face,' " said Thomas H. Kessner, a history professor at the City University of New York. "That was a great deal of his promise, and now much of the opposition to his candidacy is the feeling that that has not worked out."
Mr. Giuliani has worked to soften his hard-edged image and to couch the election as a referendum on competence and management of the city, to convince skeptical liberal voters that they can comfortably vote against the Mayor on the basis of his record in office and not his race.
That rankles many of the Mayor's supporters, who argue that he has managed to hold the city together in the face of a deep recession, and that if he were white, his re-election would be all but certain, given his party's advantage.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, one of the Mayor's oldest friends, gave voice to that sentiment last week when he said that "Giuliani's best asset is that he is white and not an incumbent," and noted the statistical reality of white voters' reluctance to support black candidates.
The Giuliani camp immediately complained that Mr. Rangel's statements were racist, and Mr. Giuliani himself called them "desperate." The Mayor hastened to say that he disagreed with Mr. Rangel and that he would do better among white voters than his doubters expected, but several of the Mayor's aides said Mr. Rangel had simply stated an unpalatable truth.
 
Competing for Rewards
 One reason many of Mr. Dinkins's supporters, especially among blacks, care so deeply about his success is that the potential for succession should he lose is unclear. There is no well-developed group of second-generation black politicians waiting in the wings, and there are strong obstacles to overcoming schisms between blacks and such vital elements of Mr. Dinkins's coalition as Jewish and Hispanic voters.
Mr. McNickle, the mayoral historian, contrasts the fragile entente between the competing interests of black and Hispanic voters with the alliance of interests between Jews and the Irish that long prevailed in the city's Democratic politics. While Jewish voters traditionally wanted protection from anti-Semitism, safeguards against corruption and expansive social programs, Irish politicians were driven more by social ascendancy, patronage jobs and the prestige of office.
Now, Mr. McNickle said, black and Hispanic New Yorkers both want the same basic political rewards: the prestige of office, jobs for their communities and social services in the face of dwindling economic resources.
None of this is easy for the Mayor's campaign to voice openly, but in the end, the same appeal to fairness that helped elect him may remain a potent tool, as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo elliptically suggested last week.
 
Blaming the Record
 Four years ago, Mr. Cuomo predicted that the primary would be won by the candidate who could bring the city together. After marching in the Labor Day parade on Monday, he said that he was not sure what the defining rationale would be this time, but that Mr. Dinkins deserved to win because of his record and because Mr. Giuliani had failed to present any compelling alternative programs.
"I was asked recently, 'Why do so many of the Democrats in Queens County, your borough, Mario -- and a lot of them white Democrats -- why are they polling that they're for Giuliani?' " Mr. Cuomo said. "Now this is a touchy question. People don't like questions like that. I don't like them, but it's a vital question. And I said, 'That's not the real question.' The real question is why were they against Dinkins in '89?"
This year, Mr. Cuomo went on, voters can say they do not like the Mayor's record, that they gave him a chance and things did not work out.
"But what happened in '89?" the Governor repeated. "Why didn't we vote for him in '89? That's a troublesome question for me."
Typically, Mr. Cuomo did not answer his own question, but his meaning was clear.

13,800 Masochists See Mets Fall Again

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

 BODY:
Plans for future expansion? Crowds of 60,000 a game at Mile High Stadium? The decision to add an extra round of playoffs as of the 1994 season? Title races in three of the four divisions?
Want perhaps the single greatest evidence that, whatever the cries of poverty from the owners and cries of everything else from the players union, the baseball industry is safe from economic peril? 
 Here it is: 13,800 people showed up at Shea Stadium yesterday.
Why ask why? Because one has to. Why come? Why stay? The Mets began the afternoon 40 games out of first place. Dwight Gooden is hurt and probably won't pitch again in 1993. Bobby Bonilla is done. Even Anthony Young, the loser in yesterday's 4-3 loss to the Cubs, has to have lost his attraction as a phenomenon of failure.
 
It's Boo Franco Day
 Why?
The reasonable answer for the fact that anyone came is the reasonably fresh air available at the stadium.
The cynical response is that there was a promotion in place for kids to run the bases at Shea after the game.
The difficult-to-ignore possibility was that many of the 13,800 came waiting for the chance to boo John Franco, which they did with striking vehemence in the ninth inning.
The hardest-to-fathom answer is that the crowd came to see the Mets.
"Typical," Manager Dallas Green said of the defeat.
Here, in succinct summation, are the familiar specifics. Young had mistakes made behind him and committed sins of his own as he allowed four runs in five innings of work to fall to 1-16 for the season. The Mets, 18-54 at the day's start in games decided by one or two runs, wound up 18-55.
"We could have won last night's game, we could have won today's," said Green. "We just don't do it. We get to the edge of the precipice and never go over."
The metaphor seemed a bit misguided. The Mets, it certainly can be argued with greater literalness, went over the edge and into the abyss long ago. It's climbing back onto the edge that the Mets can't seem to do.
And so the 13,800 yesterday at Shea were left to ponder all sorts of calamitous calculations as they prepared to run the bases afterward. Could Randy Myers, who gained his 44th save with a scoreless ninth for the Cubs, wind up with more saves than the Mets will victories (the club is stuck on 47)? Will the Mets, with 95 defeats, lose 100 games for the first time since 1967? Will the Mets, who have lost eight straight and have the Phillies and Braves coming up next, ever win again this season?
 
And Franco Responds
 Can the Mets soon be eliminated from contention for sixth place in the National League East? Will Sid Fernandez, who retires from his matches faster than Natalya Zvereva these days, go more than five innings Sunday against the Cubs? Can it really be that the rotation breaks down so that, if the Mets continue to lose, Young is the scheduled starter for what would be their 100th defeat?
"There wasn't much to keep the faith in as it was," said Green.
Evidently, Shea has lost all faith in Franco. The closer, who has been hurt or ordinary or awful for three seasons, lost three straight games last week and came into yesterday's contest serenaded by tons of boos.
"I don't care," said Franco. "Doesn't bother me. You deserve it when you don't perform. They are entitled."
Franco then felt entitled to return some of the bitterness in kind.
"You lose three games, you get booed," he said. "You lose 27, you get cheered."
The allusion, of course, was to Young, who set a major league record with 27 straight defeats earlier this season. Young certainly was never in position to win yesterday. He yielded a run in the first. He then was sabotaged by a Jeff Kent error, a pair of singles, a sacrifice fly and a bomb of a run-scoring double by Mark Grace in the fifth. Young then hurt his thumb falling while covering first to end the inning, and he was pulled for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the fifth.
"We made mistakes," said Green. "And A. Y. wasn't able to get through the inning with the mistakes."
The season has been a mistake from its outset. But the attendance was no mistake.

 
 
INSIDE PITCH
 Manager DALLAS GREEN's description of DWIGHT GOODEN's recovery from shoulder trouble seemed to hint that the right-hander would not return in 1993. "They are not real happy with what's going on," Green said of the club's medical personnel. "It hasn't responded real good." Gooden had hoped to throw off the mound today. That plan has been killed. . . . EDDIE MURRAY's two-run homer in the sixth was the 438th of his career and he is now four runs batted in behind TONY PEREZ for 17th place on the career list.

HEADLINE: Health Care: A Historic Journey

 BODY:
Humane. Visionary. Complex. Overreaching. Those are just a few of the adjectives that leap to mind when plowing through President Clinton's 250-page health care plan that was leaked to the press by members of Congress a week before the President was to unveil its contents. There will be plenty of time over the next few weeks to scrutinize the details. But this is the moment to savor the noble ambitions of this plan and to ponder the politics and history of the moment.
The Administration's overriding goal is that no American will ever go to bed at night fearing that medical catastrophe will lead to financial ruin. Every Republican and Democrat in Congress ought to reflect on the need for a bipartisan commitment to this goal. If President Truman's plan for universal care or President Nixon's effort to create national health insurance had passed, the country would almost certainly be healthier today, both physically and economically. 
 With the release of the entire plan, some tentative answers are now possible to basic consumer questions about coverage and costs to individuals. All residents will be required to buy a basic benefits package that would be more generous than most private policies. It would cover hospital and physician services, preventive care, pharmaceuticals, dental care for children and a limited amount of mental health benefits.
For the uninsured and underinsured, the plan is a big plus. But it also provides something valuable to the insured: peace of mind about chronic illness and loss of coverage. For the poor, who have little choice now, health cooperatives will provide a larger set of choices. But to many middle-class families, the choice of doctors, especially specialists, would be diminished. Doctors too will find themselves more closely supervised, if not salaried, by health plans. In other words, Mr. Clinton proposes to change not only the economics but the sociology of health care in America.
That will -- and should -- bring furious debate in the days ahead. But the most obvious immediate problem is that Mr. Clinton has decided to mask the cost, pretending -- against the counsel of several of his financial advisers -- that the $700 billion program can be paid for without a major tax hike. That decision, in turn, forced him to clamp down hard on Medicare and Medicaid and to limit the rate of growth of private insurance premiums. If these clamps are applied too hard, the Administration will do harm to the quality of care as providers respond by rationing access or cutting treatment corners.
Rationing, consumer choice, quality of care, cost -- these will be the buzzwords of the autumn debate. The public portion of that debate begins months later than we would have liked. Even so, Mr. Clinton deserves credit for starting the country again on a journey too long delayed.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Mr. Perot Attacks Nafta

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN

 BODY:
Ross Perot's book attacking the North America Free Trade Agreement is an inept diatribe that misstates facts, misleads readers and misunderstands trade. "Save Your Jobs, Save Our Country," written with economist Pat Choate, piles one tendentious assertion atop another.
Serious-minded people can disagree about the wisdom of Nafta, which would phase out trade barriers among the U.S., Mexico and Canada. And those who like Nafta can disagree over President Clinton's efforts to muscle it through Congress when his health care reform hangs in the balance. But Mr. Perot's writing isn't a fair sifting of pros and cons. He ominously asserts, by ignoring evidence to the contrary, that Nafta will "pit American and Mexican workers in a race to the bottom." 
 Many economists don't like regional trade pacts because they discriminate against nonparticipants. Under Nafta, Mexican exporters would gain privileged access to the U.S., driving out exports from the Caribbean.
Yet there are good reasons for this pact. Neighbors like Mexico may warrant special consideration. Nafta's path-breaking provisions could serve as worthy precedents for future trade pacts. And Nafta would lock in Mexico's market reforms and encourage the rest of Latin America to follow suit. Careful studies also show that the agreement would have a positive, though minuscule, impact on U.S. living standards and give a small boost to the Mexican economy.
Sadly, Mr. Perot's book dismisses foreign policy implications and runs rough-shod over economics. Factual errors and misleading statements litter nearly every page. He correctly cites testimony by a former Cabinet official that Nafta would cost some Americans their jobs, but he conveniently forgets to mention that she testified that Nafta would create more jobs than it would eliminate. The authors estimate that Nafta would threaten 6 million American jobs, but their calculations ludicrously assume that high-wage jobs in industries like aerospace could lose out to low-paid Mexicans.
The accord would, Mr. Perot warns, open U.S. borders to unsafe Mexican trucks. But Mexican truckers would have to obey every U.S. safety regulation. He claims Nafta would allow Mexico to challenge U.S. environmental regulations as unfair trade barriers. But he conveniently forgets to say that for Mexico to win, it would have to prove that the regulations lacked any scientific merit and unfairly blocked Mexican exports.
Mr. Perot's book makes a muddle of economics. Using bogus measures, it alleges that low wages give Mexican employers an unfair advantage. But if that were true, U.S. employers would be racing to relocate even without Nafta. And if low wages are the villain, why does America's fiercest competition come from high-wage Germany and Japan? Low Mexican wages largely reflect low productivity and don't serve as a huge magnet for American employers.
Mr. Perot ignores the fact that Nafta knocks down Mexican tariffs a lot and U.S. tariffs -- which are already low -- only a little. That's no threat to most American employers. Under Nafta, numerous industries from agriculture to insurance will export more to the newly opened Mexican market.
However, Nafta will force some U.S. firms to close. That's the process by which each country will specialize in what it produces best -- the key to lifting living standards. But Mr. Perot hysterically exaggerates the negatives. Studies predict that Nafta will add only a little to the tens of millions of Americans who will lose their jobs over the next decade for reasons unrelated to Nafta.
After weighing the pros and cons, I expect Nafta will prove a plus for the U.S. But critics cite reasonable grounds for reaching the opposite conclusion. They denounce doing deals with a Government that they regard as politically oppressive and that can't be trusted to enforce its labor and environmental laws. And they don't trust Washington to help out dislocated workers.
Serious people can disagree. But Mr. Perot's sweeping denunciation is not a serious analysis.

On Spelling Kat

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
So now we find that a whole lot of us can't spell kat, or read a bus map, or add two and two on a kalculator.
Apparently there are even people who don't read newspaper columns. 
 The nation's reading and math skills are in sorry shape, according to a four-year study released by the U.S. Department of Education.
As if that weren't bad enough, most of the people who are poor at readin,' writin' and kalculatin' have deluded themselves into thinking they are good at it, or even very good.
I handed a map to a man the other day and asked if he could determine the approximate distance between Kansas and New York. He said yes, he could. After studying the map for a moment, he confidently announced, "About 4,000 miles."
I don't think there are 4,000 miles between here and Oz. I asked the man how he had come up with that answer. He threw me an annoyed look and snapped, "Just trying to help you out, pal."
The study found that some 40 million Americans are incapable of handling anything more complex than signing their names or reading the expiration date on a driver's license. Many of them fake it when looking at a menu in a restaurant.
Twenty percent of those who scored worst were high school graduates. That means an awful lot of fraud went on in an awful lot of schools. What happened to the idea that if you get a diploma you ought to be able to read it?
The study was a gauge of adult proficiency. So it's logical to wonder what's happening now in the public schools, which should be busily shaping the skills of a new generation of Americans.
It's not pretty.
There are many fine school systems in the United States. But there are others that are so farcically inept they look like they were designed by Laurel and Hardy and run by the Three Stooges.
These, of course, are the systems with the youngsters most desperately in need of help.
In New York and Chicago, officials haven't even been able to get the schools open. In Michigan, the property tax has been scrapped as the primary means of financing public schools, but the Legislature and the Governor haven't been able to come up with alternative financing. In Los Angeles, the schools are so short of qualified teachers that administrators are practically dragging substitutes in off the street.
These are not great ways to get the nation's literacy levels up.
Public schools were supposed to open in New York, the nation's largest system, on Sept. 9; and in Chicago, the third largest, on Sept. 8.
Neither city could meet the deadline.
In New York, school officials have been unable to determine for years whether the students are being exposed to dangerous levels of asbestos in the schools. Previous tests were found to have been incompetently and possibly fraudulently conducted. So a million kids remain out of classes while the schools are retested.
In Chicago, more than 400,000 students have been shut out of classrooms while teachers, school officials and state legislators argue over money. The school system has a budget deficit and so far the politicians and bureaucrats have been unable to close it.
Some schools are just plain dangerous. While Los Angeles managed to get its schools open, a 15-year-old boy was shot and wounded on the very first day when a gang fight broke out in an auditorium where students had lined up to enroll.
The shooting exasperated Sid Thompson, Superintendent of the nation's second-largest school district. "You can't secure this place with anything less than the 101st Airborne," he said. "It takes that many troops to cover it."
There are two main reasons for trying to overcome budget problems, gunfire and other obstacles in the way of improved literacy. One is to maintain the nation's economic vitality. The other is to provide citizens with as many opportunities as possible for personal fulfillment.
I thought about that on Friday when I asked a 16-year-old New Yorker if he understood why the schools were closed.
"Yeah," he said, " 'bestos."
I asked if he knew how to spell asbestos.
He said sure. "B-E-T-O-S."

HEADLINE: Can't Just Do It

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
After reading Bill Keller's "Where Kids Don't Jump" (The Times, Aug. 28), my skepticism turned to dismay about the movement to introduce basketball as a model sport in South Africa's black townships. Keller wrote that the former National Basketball Association star Bob McAdoo was there "pushing basketball as an engine of black excellence and pride." 
 In addition, he quoted Dikembe Mutombo, of Zaire and now of the Denver Nuggets, as saying, "We did it in America, and they can do it here in South Africa."
Did what? While the outrageous salaries and endorsement contracts of a few N.B.A. stars are well-known, it's also widely recognized that opportunities for black youth in the United States have increased little if at all. The N.B.A. stands for an anomaly, not a model, and South Africa needs serious solutions, not pipe dreams.
I would feel more hopeful about the future of young South African blacks if the N.B.A. and other organizations instructed them that they have a better chance of achieving excellence, pride and economic growth through education than through slam dunks.

HEADLINE: A New 10-Year Plan to Prevent Water Pollution

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
New York City will spend $750 million in the next 10 years to protect its reservoirs from pollution, Mayor David N. Dinkins has announced, as the city seeks to avoid a Federal requirement for a water filtration plant that would cost $5 billion.
Mr. Dinkins last week promised strict enforcement of new pollution rules for the 2,000-square-mile region upstate where the city gathers its water. 
 "It is absolutely asinine to let people pollute the water we're going to drink, and we're not going to have it," he said.
The program he laid out includes hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for improvement of sewage treatment plants owned by upstate towns and assistance for towns to develop planning and zoning standards.
 
A One-Year Exemption
 Nearly all big cities filter their water, a trend the Federal Government is trying to encourage. But New York City has argued that its water from upstate reservoirs is of such quality that it can meet Federal water-quality standards by taking steps to prevent the introduction of pollutants.
In January, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency gave New York City a one-year exemption from the filtration requirement, and the city is seeking a 10-year exemption.
The city's program was widely applauded by environmental organizations. But some, notably the Natural Resources Defense Council, have said the most important question is how well the city carries out the program.
Art imitated life in that detail on Thursday at an event at the South Street Seaport that was part campaign rally and part environmental celebration. The organizers raised a 180-foot-tall mural painted by Mike McNeilly, depicting the Statue of Liberty and a wave of clean water, on the wall of the 32-story New York Telephone building on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan facing the East River.
 
New Regulations
 A major part of New York City's effort to protect the water was to draft new regulations, the first since 1954, governing land development and water emissions near upstate reservoirs owned by the city. State law gives New York City the authority to do so, and city officials are now holding a series of public hearings upstate to receive comments on the new rules.
The rules cover everything from where new buildings or landfills may be situated to what materials may be spread on icy roads in winter. Some rules have drawn opposition from people upstate who fear that the rules will block economic development.
But the Mayor said the city's approach was "a conscious repetition of the confrontation of the past" between downstate and upstate interests.
The program announced last week is to be financed mostly with water and sewer charges for city residents. The spending has already been approved as part of various capital and operating budgets, but city officials said they had not previously been laid out as a comprehensive program.
 
Highlights of the Plan
 Among the most important elements are these:
*The city will buy 80,000 acres of environmentally sensitive land in the next seven years at a cost of $250 million to $270 million, including $47 million this year. In some cases, the city will buy "conservation easements," leaving the land in private hands but making a payment to forbid future development.
*The city's Environmental Protection Department will hire 500 to 600 people, from lab technicians to enforcement agents, and add laboratory capacity, at a cost of $250 million over 10 years.
*New York City will improve several upstate sewage treatment plants it owns, for $100 million to $150 million.
The city also plans to enter a "partnership" program with towns and cities in the watershed, to help them develop community planning standards and improve their sewage treatment plants, at a cost of $120 million.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 14, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about New York City's 10-year plan for protecting its drinking water quoted Mayor David N. Dinkins incorrectly about the city's contacts with communities in the watershed upstate. The Mayor said the city's approach was "a conscious rejection of the confrontation of the past" between downstate and upstate interests.

HEADLINE: VOTERS GUIDE;
Races By Borough

 BODY:

MANHATTAN
 
BOROUGH PRESIDENT
There is no primary. Ruth W. Messinger (D-L) is the incumbent.
1st COUNCIL DISTRICT
MARGARET S. CHIN (D) Director, Chinatown Center of La Guardia Community College; member of Community Board 1; a candidate for City Council in 1991.
KATHRYN E. FREED (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; tenant lawyer and former counsel to New York State Assembly Consumer Affairs Committee.
JUDITH JOICE (D) Businesswoman; co-owner of the Lion's Head, a restaurant and bar on Christopher Street; member, Greenwich Village Chamber of Commerce; member, Mayor's Small Business Advisory Board; former member, Community Board 2.
THE CAMPAIGN: Lower Manhattan Democrats have a rematch from 1991, but with strategic realignments. Councilwoman Freed won a four-way race two years ago by nearly 1,000 votes. Ms. Chin, the runner-up, is renewing her bid to become the Council's first Asian-American member. But 1991's two other losing candidates support Ms. Freed, a veteran party official and legislative aide who won many endorsements from political clubs, unions and elected officials. Ms. Chin's base is Chinatown. Ms. Joice, the new entrant, draws support from Greenwich Village. All are spending heavily. In their Aug. 13 financial filings, Ms. Chin led with $63,910 raised to $45,913 for Ms. Fried and $39,371 for Ms. Joice.
2d COUNCIL DISTRICT
MIRIAM FRIEDLANDER (D) Former City Council member who served for 18 years until 1991; created and was chairwoman of the Council's Committee on Women.
SYLVIA M. FRIEDMAN (D) Housing policy analyst with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development; former teacher; member, Community Board 6; chairwoman, Housing and Homeless Committee, Community Board 6.
ANTONIO PAGAN (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former executive director of Coalition Housing, a nonprofit developer of low- and moderate-income housing; former member, Community Board 3.
THE CAMPAIGN: At the age of 79, Ms. Friedlander is fighting to regain her seat from Mr. Pagan. She was the only Council member to lose in the 1991 primary, by barely over 100 votes out of 12,000 cast in the ethnic and political cauldron of Gramercy Park, the East Village and Lower East Side. While Mr. Pagan is gay, the city's other two gay legislators, Councilman Thomas K. Duane and Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, pointedly backed Ms. Friedlander. Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan also mobilized support for her. Mr. Pagan also has a long list of endorsements, and benefits from popularity with Hispanic voters. By Aug. 13, Ms. Friedlander had raised $64,960, compared with $56,509 for Mr. Pagan. Sylvia Friedman, a newcomer to the race, who could siphon votes from Ms. Friedlander's base as a liberal Jewish woman, raised $41,530.
3d COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Thomas K. Duane (D-L) is the incumbent.
4th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Andrew S. Eristoff (R-L) is the incumbent.
5th COUNCIL DISTRICT
BARBARA W. KLOBERDANZ (D) Political consultant; former teacher; former member, Community Board 8.
SAMUEL D. MORELL (D) Liquor sales, wine imports; former salesman in wholesale and retail clothing; a candidate for City Council in 1980, 1982 and 1985.
 No Republican primary. Charles Millard (R-L) is the incumbent.
THE CAMPAIGN: The Democratic winner here faces the unenviable task of running in November's election against Charles Millard, the Republican-Liberal incumbent. Ms. Kloberdanz, City Council President's liaison to the Council, is backed by several political clubs and legislators. She stresses quality of life issues and Council oversight powers. Mr. Morrell, who proposes a medical van for the elderly, Upper East Side jitneys and using vacant lots for parking, has run several times before.
6th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Ronnie M. Eldridge (D-L) is the incumbent.
7th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Stanley E. Michels (D-L) is the incumbent.
8th COUNCIL DISTRICT
WILLIAM DEL TORO (D) Minister, Chapel of the Sacred Heart of Jesus; chairman of the Community Housing Anti-Crime/Anti-Drug Task Force; a candidate for City Council in 1991.
FRANCISCO DIAZ JR. (D) District Manager, Community Board 11; former Housing Development Adviser for Homesteading Coalition; community organizer in East Harlem.
ADAM CLAYTON POWELL 4TH (D-L)City Council member elected in 1991; son of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the late Harlem Congressman; former assistant district attorney in the Bronx; worked for Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman.
THE CAMPAIGN: Adam Clayton Powell 4th, 31, is struggling to keep his seat in this district that encompasses part of the South Bronx. In 1991, William Del Toro squeezed by Mr. Powell with 34 votes in the first tally but lost to him in a court-ordered runoff after hundreds of voting irregularities were found. Mr. Del Toro has returned to challenge Mr. Powell. The Del Toro name carries clout in East Harlem, where most of the district's residents live. Mr. Del Toro is a minister and the brother of State Assemblyman Angelo Del Toro.
A wild card in the race is a third candidate, Francisco Diaz Jr. Mr. Diaz, who is on leave from his job as district manager of Community Board 11, has the backing of Congressman Charles B. Rangel.
All candidates claim to have toiled in different arenas to help solve the district's most pressing problems: drugs, crime, poor services and a housing shortage. But the outcome may be decided less on issues than on political alliances and the influence of the candidates' supporters.
9th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. C. Virginia Fields (D-L) is the incumbent.
10th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Guillermo Linares (D-L) is the incumbent.
 
BRONX
 
BOROUGH PRESIDENT
MONICA BRAGGS (D) Real-estate saleswoman; co-founder and chairwoman, CENBRO Local Development Corporation, a community outreach organization in central Bronx; member, N.A.A.C.P.; Executive member (Secretary), Community Board 4 and serves on its Economic Development and Youth committees.
FERNANDO FERRER (D-L) Borough President since 1987; former City Council member, served five years; former chairman, Council Health Committee; former Housing Director in the Bronx Borough President's office; member, N.A.A.C.P.
THE CAMPAIGN: Fernando Ferrer, one of the most powerful Hispanic politicians in the city, is seeking a second full term as Borough President. He was first elected to the post in 1987 to fill out the term of Stanley Simon, who resigned in a corruption scandal. Mr. Ferrer's opponent is a political newcomer, Monica Braggs, who works in real-estate sales.
11th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. June M. Eisland (D-L) is the incumbent.
 
12th COUNCIL DISTRICT
CAROLYN J. ALESSANDRO (D) Computer specialist; graduated from Brooklyn College; involved in successful campaign by husband, Francis, for Civil Court Judge in the Bronx in 1990.
SAMUEL BURKE (D) Supervisor of transportation, Montefiore Hospital; former legislative aide to Senator Jeff Korman; member, Community Board 10, serves on Health and Human Services Committee; member, Public School 178 Parents Association; member, N.A.A.C.P.
LAWRENCE A. WARDEN (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former health care administrator; member, N.A.A.C.P.
THE CAMPAIGN: Old political scores are being settled here. Councilman Warden was first elected in 1991 with the help of the Bronx Democratic chairman, George Friedman, but then backed an insurgent bid led by Larry Seabrook to oust Mr. Friedman. That failed, and now Mr. Warden now finds his renomination challenged by Mr. Burke, a party district leader endorsed by Mr. Friedman. Both candidates are black, but Mr. Burke's home base is Co-op City, which has a heavily voting white population. But Mr. Warden also has support in Co-op City, the advantage of incumbency and the Seabrook faction's backing.
13th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Michael DeMarco (D-R-C) is the incumbent.
14th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Israel Ruiz Jr. (D-L) is the incumbent.
15th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Jose Rivera (D-L) is the incumbent.
16th COUNCIL DISTRICT
WENDELL FOSTER (D-L) City Council member elected in 1978; minister, Christ Church; Chairman, International Intergroup Relations Committee; member, Finance, Education and Parks Committees; member, N.A.A.C.P., World Peace Council and the Urban League; Founder, Bronx Shepherds Restoration Corporation, which builds low-income housing.
CARMELO SAEZ JR. (D) Community advocate; management consultant; President, School Board 9; former member, Community Board 4; former director, Development of Youth Inc., a private nonprofit center for youth; former executive director, Alianza, a federation of Hispanic organizations in the Bronx.
THE CAMPAIGN: This contest pits a longtime minister against the chief of a scandal-ridden school board. The Rev. Wendell Foster has served on the Council 15 years. His challenger, Mr. Saez, was removed as school board president in District 9 last year, accused of mismanaging funds and using school equipment for private business.
The district suffers from low reading scores. Nine board members have been arrested in cases involving theft, extortion, kickback and abuse of office. Denying wrongdoing himself, Mr. Saez won re-election to the board this year. Mr. Foster raised a hefty $76,088 campaign chest by Aug. 13. Mr. Saez did not file a financial report by the deadline.
17th COUNCIL DISTRICT
RAFAEL CASTANEIRA COLON (D) City Council member elected in 1981; Chairman, Civil Service and Labor Committee.
DAVID ROSADO (D-L) New York State Assemblyman (74th Assembly District), elected 1990; former district leader; former member, Community Board 2 and Area Policy Board 2; former member, Community Board 1; Youth Coordinator, New York City Youth Bureau; administrative, alcoholism rehabilitation program; former machinist and garment worker.
ANDREW EATMON JR. (D) A Legal Aid lawyer.
THE CAMPAIGN: Despite a 704-count indictment accusing Councilman Colon of stealing $389,000 in city funds, he proclaimed his innocence and continued his reelection bid. Prosecutors said he cashed paychecks for phantom employees and also voted from a false home address.
Before being indicted, his career was already troubled. Democratic leaders and Ramon Valez, the powerful local head of private social service agencies, abandoned Mr. Colon after his girlfriend accused him of assault in a child support dispute. There were accusations that he lived outside the council district. Earlier, Mr. Colon's ex-wife said his failure to pay alimony forced her onto welfare. The new candidate backed by the party and Mr. Velez is Assemblyman Rosado.
Andrew Eatmon Jr. ran for this seat in 1991, but Mr. Colon prevailed.
A fourth contender, Rafael Mendez, a perennial candidate from the radical New Alliance Party, was removed from the primary ballot for lack of sufficient signatures in August, but he remains on the ballot in November as an Independent. Financial filings on Aug. 13 showed Mr. Colon had raised $39,1756. State filings showed that Mr. Rosado had $1,300 in loans and contributions.
18th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Lucy Cruz (D-L) is the incumbent.
 
QUEENS
 
BOROUGH PRESIDENT
 There is no primary. Claire Shulman (D) is the incumbent.
19th COUNCIL DISTRICT
ANTHONY P. AVELLA JR. (D-L) Columnist, "The Courier"; president, Joint Community Council of College Point; former Queens coordinator, Mayor's Community Assistance Unit; former member, Community Board 7.
EDWARD S. GITKIND (D) Special projects manager, New York City Department of Environmental Protection; former production manager; executive member, Bayside High School P.T.A..
 No Republican primary. Michael J. Abel (R-C) is the incumbent.
THE CAMPAIGN: Whoever wins this race faces a bigger challenge in November, opposing Mr. Abel in this district dominated by Republican voters. Democratic leaders are lined up for Mr. Avella. In the 1991 primary, Mr. Avella placed second among 10 candidates, the Council's most crowded contest that year. This time he faces only Mr. Gitkind, a business and government manager.
20th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Julia Harrison (D-L) is the incumbent.
21st COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Helen M. Marshall (D-L) is the incumbent.
22d COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Peter F. Vallone (D) is the incumbent.
23d COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Sheldon S. Leffler (D-L) is the incumbent.
24th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Morton Povman (D) is the incumbent.
25th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. John D. Sabini (D-L) is the incumbent.
26th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Walter L. McCaffrey (D-L) is the incumbent.
27th COUNCIL DISTRICT
GARTH MARCHANT (D) Former radio reporter, WLIB; former assistant to the Superintendent, Community School District 23.
ARCHIE SPIGNER (D-L) City Council member elected in 1973; chairman, Housing and Buildings Committee; member, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Spigner, who in 18 years in office has risen to deputy majority leader, trounced Mr. Marchant in 1991 with 70 percent of the vote. For this return match, Mr. Spigner had $111,975 in campaign funds on hand on Aug. 13, one of the largest campaign treasuries in the Council, while Mr. Marchant had $1,022.
28th COUNCIL DISTRICT
ALLAN W. JENNINGS JR. (D) Former investigator, New York City Department of Correction; former Democratic district leader, 31st Assembly District; former legislative adviser to New York State Assemblyman John Duane.
THOMAS WHITE JR. (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; founder and chief executive officer, Jamaica Community Adolescent Program (J-CAP); member, Aging, Contracts, Economic Development and Environmental Protection Committees.
THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman White swept nearly half the total vote when he won in 1991 against five primary opponents. Mr. Jennings, a district leader at odds with the county party, placed fourth with 9 percent of the vote. This time he is the only challenger.
Mr. White is a district leader, too, and is outspending his opponent. Mr. White, who runs a state-financed drug rehabilitation program, denied critics' charges that he pressured clients and workers to do political chores. He said there were 27 campaign workers, all voluntary, from 500 people in the program.
29th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Karen Koslowitz (D-L) is the incumbent.
30th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Thomas V. Ognibene (R-C) is the incumbent.
31st COUNCIL DISTRICT
EDWARD J. LEWIS (D) Business developer; marketing specialist; former director, Mayor's Office of African-American and Caribbean Affairs; member, N.A.A.C.P.; board member, Southeast Queens Park Association; vice chairman, Area Policy Board.
JUANITA E. WATKINS (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former Commissioner, New York City Civil Service Commission; former schoolteacher; former editor, McGraw-Hill Inc.
THE CAMPAIGN: Councilwoman Watkins eked out an initial victory of a few dozen votes out of 9,000 cast in 1991. The margin was so thin that a judge ordered a runoff with the runner-up from her eight opponents. She won that second primary by more than 1,200 votes. This time her only challenger is Mr. Lewis. By Aug. 13, her campaign had raised $41,476 to his $3,530.
32d COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Walter Ward (D-C) is the incumbent.
 
BROOKLYN
 
BOROUGH PRESIDENT
 There is no primary. Howard Golden (D) is the incumbent.
33d COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Kenneth K. Fisher (D-L) is the incumbent.
34th COUNCIL DISTRICT
F. LOUIS CARABALLO (D) Lawyer in private practice. Candidate for State Assembly in 54th District in 1992.
VICTOR L. ROBLES (D-L) City Council member, has served nine years; chairman, Youth Committee; supports creation of all-civilian complaint review board.
THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Robles has served nine years on Council and six in State Assembly. In four-way primary in 1991, he swept half the vote and led nearest rival by 2,600. His sole opponent this time, Mr. Caraballo, is a lawyer and community activist who ran unsuccessfully for Assembly last year.
35th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Mary Pinkett (D-L) is the incumbent.
36th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Annette M. Robinson (D-L) is the incumbent.
37th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Martin Malave-Dilan (D-L) is the incumbent.
38th COUNCIL DISTRICT
JOAN GRIFFIN McCABE (D) City Council member elected in 1991; former policy analyst, Public Education Association; member, Public School 154 P.T.A.; opposed Brooklyn Navy Yard Incinerator.
JOHN K. O'HARA (D) Lawyer in private practice; former cabdriver; member, Community Board 7 and Area Policy Board; chairman, Youth Services Committee of Community Board 7; candidate for City Council in 1991.
MIGDALIA RIVERA (D-L) President, New York Paralegal School, a private school she co-founded; interior designer.
THE CAMPAIGN: This strangely shaped district was designed to give Hispanic voters a majority and a Council member. But nine contenders crowded the 1991 ballot, including three Hispanics and a black who split the minority vote. The upshot was that Ms. McCabe, who is white, won with 22 percent.
This time the contest's ethnic makeup is reversed. Hispanic groups unified behind a single candidate, Ms. Rivera, who also has important union support. The second challenger, Mr. O'Hara, competes with Councilwoman McCabe's ethnic base. He drew 10 percent of the 1991 vote. Party organization leaders also oppose Ms. McCabe, who says she is too independent for their liking. Despite the odds, she is running hard, has her own organization and by Aug. 13 had raised $47,979, more than double the total for her two opponents.
39th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Stephen DiBrienza (D-L) is the incumbent.
40th COUNCIL DISTRICT
UNA CLARKE (D-L) City Council member elected in 1991; former educational consultant, Human Resources Administration; supports creation of all-civilian complaint board; member of Committee on Youth, Health and General Welfare.
ERNEST N. FOSTER (D) Businessman, has worked in catering and restaurants, real estate and building management; member, N.A.A.C.P.; supports creation of all-civilian complaint board; former member, Area Policy Board 14.
THE CAMPAIGN: Ms. Clarke became the first Caribbean-born Council member when she narrowly won a three-way primary in 1991. This year she has one challenger, Mr. Foster, an American-born black. He has allied himself with Alton Maddox and Al Sharpton and contends that blacks in Flatbush are "under 100 percent white control." Ms. Clarke claims broad support and by Aug. 13 had raised $52,195, compared with $3,300 for her opponent.
41st COUNCIL DISTRICT
ATCHUDTA BARKR (D) Union organizer; organizer, National Union of Health and Human Service Employees; former P.T.A. president, Boys and Girls High School.
ENOCH H. WILLIAMS (D) City Council member for 15 years; former executive director, Housing Development Corporation; member of the Brooklyn chapter of New York City Council of Churches; member, N.A.A.C.P. and New York Urban League; chairman, Health Committee.
THE CAMPAIGN: Mr. Williams, a longtime Council member and chairman of its Health Committee, won the 1991 primary by a ratio of 2-to-1. But his challenger this year, Ms. Barkr, is supported by several liberal and labor groups. Their Aug. 13 campaign financial filings showed him far ahead, with $30,250 to her $1,795.
42d COUNCIL DISTRICT
SANDY BENDER JR. (D) Administrative assistant to New York State Assemblyman William Frank Boyland; former civil servant, worked in Department of Social Services; former day care teacher; regional representative of Community Action Board for Area Policy Boards 5 and 16; former chairman, Area Policy Board 16.
DIANE GORDON (D)
PRISCILLA A. WOOTEN (D-L) City Council member since 1982; former assistant to the Board of Education; chairwoman, Education Committee; member, Finance and Land Use Committees; member, N.A.A.C.P.
THE CAMPAIGN: After a decade on the Council, Ms. Wooten faces two challengers. She is supported by the party organization, unions and the local United States Representative, Edolphus Towns. One opponent, Mr. Bender, has been outpacing her in fund-raising. By Aug. 13 he had raised $25,888, exceeding her $19,675. The other challenger is Diane Gordon, who is backed by a party district leader who has a longstanding rivalry with Ms. Wooten.
43d COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Sal F. Albanese (D-L) is the incumbent.
44th COUNCIL DISTRICT
SANDY ABBY ABOULAFIA (D) Businesswoman; personnel agent and data processing manager; member, Community Board 12; endorsed by Brooklyn Women's Political Caucus, Kings County Democratic Coalition and Progressive Democratic Club; candidate for City Council in 1991.
NOACH DEAR (D) City Council member since 1983; chairman, Transportation Committee; former district manager, Community Board 12; endorsed by Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden.
THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Dear, who nearly lost in 1991 to Robert J. Miller, is breathing easier this year. He has one opponent, Sandy Abby Aboulafia, who drew 7 percent of the vote as the third-place candidate the last time.
Mr. Dear is counting on his many endorsements, party organization support and an extraordinary campaign treasury of more than $90,000 as of Aug. 13, compared with $24,465 for Ms. Aboulafia. His July 13 financial report showed he had spent another $99,363, ranking him among the top Council campaign spenders, according to the New York Public Interest Research Group, which monitors the filings.
45th COUNCIL DISTRICT
LLOYD HENRY (D-L) Headmaster, St. Augustine's Day School; rector, St. Augustine's Church; member, Community Board 17, N.A.A.C.P., Kiwanis and the Boy Scouts of America.
COLIN A. MOORE (D) Lawyer in private practice; former Assistant District Attorney in the Bronx; former Law Clerk with State Attorney General's Office; member, 29th Street Block Association.
JANICE L. ROBERTSON (D) Community organizer; founder and president, East 49th Street Block Association of Flatlands Inc.; member, 63d Precinct Community Council; member, Public School 203 P.T.A.; endorsed by Kings County Democratic Coalition; candidate for City Council in 1991.
THE CAMPAIGN: This is shaping up as one of the city's most contentious Council battles. Carved out two years ago to encourage minority candidates, the largely working-class district is 75 percent black. Susan D. Alter, who is white, managed to keep the seat in 1991 by capturing the Jewish vote in the primary; she is abandoning her seat to run for Public Advocate and is endorsing Ms. Robertson, a black American-born community advocate.
Colin Moore, a 52-year-old Guyana-born lawyer who has developed a citywide reputation through his involvement in high-profile cases, came in second to Ms. Alter in 1991 and considers himself the logical heir to both the seat and the support of Democratic Party officials in Brooklyn. But the party has instead backed Lloyd Henry, a 45-year-old Belize-born Episcopal minister and newcomer to politics. An unusually wide array of elected officials are stumping for Mr. Henry, including the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, a United States Representative, Edolphus Towns, and Mayor David N. Dinkins.
46th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. Herbert E. Berman (D-L) is the incumbent.
47th COUNCIL DISTRICT
HOWARD L. LASHER (D-L) New York State Assemblyman since 1972; lawyer; chairman, Assembly Committees on Child Care, Housing and Insurance; member, Fraternal Order of Masons.
JOEL M. MICHAELS (D) Lawyer; former executive director, Jewish Community Council of Greater Brighton; member, Brighton Neighborhood Association and Nottingham Association; former social worker; a candidate for City Council (48th District) in 1991.
SHELDON PLOTNICK (D) owner of bookkeeping and financial services company; member, Community School Board 21; current member, Community Board 13; former Democratic State Committeeman.
THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Samuel Horwitz's retirement set off a brutal fight to succeed him. For 21 years Mr. Plotnick served on the community board and as school board president and local party leader. For 21 years, Mr. Lasher served as the local Assemblyman, gaining seniority to head committees.
Both sides are slinging charges: That Mr. Plotnick used the schools for patronage and nepotism, including a job for his mother and promotions for his wife; that Mr. Lasher took donations from insurance companies when he headed the Insurance Committee, and that he keeps a one-bedroom apartment to qualify for the Council district but his four-bedroom home is a few blocks over the border.
Although their Aug. 13 filings showed that Mr. Plotnick outspent Mr. Lasher by nearly double, $55,017 to $28,213, Mr. Plotnick said Mr. Lasher used his Assembly apparatus for mailings to voters. The third candidate, Mr. Michaels, said the others represent the abuses of entrenched politicians. Brooklyn's Democratic chairman, Clarence Norman, calling the contest "a slugfest all the way," made no predictions or endorsements.
48th COUNCIL DISTRICT
ALEXANDER STABER (D) Retired businessman, appliance repair; co-chairman, Brooklyn-wide Interagency Council of the Aging; vice president, American Association of Retired Persons, Flatbush Chapter; member, Straphangers Campaign; opposed rebuilding the Southwest Brooklyn incinerator.
ANTHONY DAVID WEINER (D) City Council member, elected in 1991; former aide to Representative Charles E. Schumer.
THE CAMPAIGN: Councilman Weiner squeaked into office in the six-way 1991 primary by a margin of slightly more than 100 votes. He faces only one challenger this time, Mr. Staber, a longtime activist on health, the elderly, war veterans and housing who has run for office often but unsuccessfully. Their Aug. 13 financial reports showed Mr. Weiner had raised $26,675 and Mr. Staber $7,737.
50th COUNCIL DISTRICT
 No primary. John A. Fusco (R-C) is the incumbent.

THE ECONOMY
 
Sending the Government Bureaucracy to Weight Watchers 
 
This is an earthshaking idea: show taxpayers "that their tax dollars will be treated with respect." No, that's not Ross Perot talking, it's a young man named Al Gore. Is he dreaming? Is there ever a taxpayer who, writing that painful check to the I.R.S., doesn't envision $1,000 toilet seats and "Star Wars" sinkholes? But Mr. Gore was dead serious last week when, against a backdrop of mountains of printed regulations on the White House lawn, he vowed to streamline "outdated Government," save $108 billion and cut 252,000 jobs. If companies can "downsize," why not Washington? Congress will have something to say about the plan, which was six months in the making. But much can be done by executive order, so Mr. Gore and Bill Clinton just might make a dent. And Mr. Clinton's first step to a slimmer Government? Adding one more tentacle to that sprawling monster, something called the Community Enterprise Board.
 
Medicare? How? Tell You Later.
 
In the last five years of this millennium, the way things are growing, the Government will spend $1.9 trillion on Medicare and Medicaid. The Clinton team thinks it can cut 12 percent from that, and told Congress last week that it planned to slash $238 billion in those years. "Politically unacceptable," pronounced Representative Henry Waxman. Medicare, after all, serves 36 million elderly and disabled people, and politicians mess with it at their peril. But the Administration says its new health system will pick up some slack, because when everyone has insurance, the drain on Government money will ease. And when will we be told how, precisely, this will work? "At the appropriate time," said Mr. Clinton.
 
Price Controls, by Another Name
 
Because Medicare and Medicaid account for half of all prescription drug sales, drug makers would probably be out of business without them. So when the Administration said last week that it wanted to deny Medicare coverage for any drugs it deemed too costly, it was understandable that the drug industry raised cries of "price control." President Clinton had recently ruled out specific price controls, but this policy would have the same result. How would such a policy affect the elderly? That's unclear. Prices would surely fall, but on the other hand, people might be denied coverage for some high-priced drugs that have no substitute.
 
Those Post-Labor Day Blues
 
The party ended, then began again. While the cats were at the beach in August, Wall Street's mice played, sending the Dow to record after giddy record. Maybe it really was low interest rates, maybe it was the heat. But when Labor Day barged in and told everyone to wipe away those vacation grins, the market, waking to a feeble economy, beat a hasty retreat, with the Dow dropping 45 points in two days. No surprise, really. The tireless statisticians -- like the tennis pundits who intone, "That's the 14th time Sampras wiped his brow this set" -- were quick to point out that in the last 21 years, the Dow has fallen two-thirds of the time the day after Labor Day. The gloom didn't last, though, as the Dow bounced back 32 on Friday, to 3,621.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Lorenzo's Flight Is Canceled
 
Frank Lorenzo, it seems, made some lasting enemies in airline unions in his stormy days at Continental and Eastern. When he said he wanted to get back in the business, sketching visions of a low-cost East Coast carrier, unions roared into action, placing ads telling lawmakers that that would be like letting Michael Milken and Charles Keating "return to the scenes of their crimes" and vowing to picket any Lorenzo operation. Last week a judge appointed by the Transportation Department gave the pilots their way, grounding Mr. Lorenzo's airline, perhaps for good. In a marvelous bit of legalese, the judge said that Mr. Lorenzo's company "lacks the proper compliance disposition" -- or, in English, that it seemed highly likely that Mr. Lorenzo would cause trouble.
 
It's Small. It's American. So?
 
Here are some Detroit axioms: 1. People in their 20's, who buy a lot of small cars, don't buy American cars. 2. Detroit can't make money on small cars. But Chrysler is out to rewrite the rulebook, introducing its Neon subcompact last week as a peppy, almost totally recyclable car aimed at those in their 20's. And, yes, aimed at turning a profit.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Signs of Life in Germany
 
Germany's deep recession has rippled to its neighbors, just as Europe is battling to transform itself into a strong, unified force in the global economy. And it has rippled across the world, since it's such a big potential market for goods from, say, the United States. But there was a glimmer of hope last week that the worst could be past, as the Government reported that western Germany's economy was growing for the first time in 15 months. "The first signs of light for overcoming the recession are unmistakable," one official said. . . . And later in the week the Bundesbank, perhaps emboldened by this economic news, took another step that could ease Europe's woes, lowering its key interest rates another half-point notch.
 
Cadbury Will Buy A & W . . .
 
What could be more British than Cadbury Schweppes? (It's hard to say the name without lapsing into a British accent.) What could be more American than A & W root beer? And what could be more a sign of the times than having all such distinctions blasted away? For Cadbury is about to become America's No. 4 soft-drink company. Having recently bought a big chunk of Dr Pepper, it agreed last week to buy A & W Brands for about $335 million. The gains are clear: Cadbury gets a solid distribution system, and A & W gets a strong foreign partner and access to markets abroad.
 
 . . . and Volvo Looks South
 
And here's a sign of Europe's times. Volvo, Swedish to the core, is merging with Renault, which couldn't be more French. The linkup announced last week reflects, most simply, the hard times that are facing Europe's auto industry, because by joining research, distribution and other such matters, the joint company -- which will be the world's sixth-largest car company -- is expected to save billions. But the move is also a symbol of Sweden's moving closer to its neighbors, hoping to join the European Community as a full member in 1995. Such European togetherness will be all the more important down the road, because in 1999 all restrictions on Japanese auto sales in Europe will be lifted.

Taking New York Home, Bric by Brac

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
RALPH SARWARI can tell when the economy is turning sour in Germany or Japan, perking up in Brazil or taking off in Taiwan. He can tell when the French franc is falling and the Swiss franc is soaring. And he can do all of this without leaving his place beneath the fluorescent lights of Xanadu.
 Not Kubla Khan's domed domain, not the too-opulent-for-words mansion in "Citizen Kane," but the casbah of kitsch, the Monte Carlo of mementos, the Shangri-La of souvenirs: a store at 1528 Broadway, at the northern edge of Times Square, that, under Mr. Sarwari's management, sells everything from Statuettes of Liberty to "I<heart>NY" cigarette lighters, "I<heart>NY" pencils and "I <heart>NY" T-shirts. Not to mention the $899 denim jackets with lower Manhattan hand-painted on the back under a sky of glittery spangles. One day, a Japanese man bought 12. 
No one, not Mr. Sarwari, not even Scott C. Borowsky, publisher of Souvenir and Novelty magazine, knows what part of the $1 billion-a-year national souvenir business is rung up on the cash registers of New York. In 1991, the most recent year for which figures are available, state economic development officials counted 693 gift, novelty and souvenir shops in the city.
 It's a competitive business, at least in midtown. Between 34th and 57th Streets are more than a dozen shops that sell only souvenirs, T-shirts and postcards. Then there are several dozen others that also sell what Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, calls "items of real use," from cameras to luggage -- merchandise that makes the souvenir business here different from most other places.
 Mr. Sarwari has other kinds of competition -- street vendors who sell identical-looking but less-expensive T-shirts. He says his, at $14.99 apiece, are all cotton, while the $5 ones on the street are a cotton-polyester blend.
 IN such a crowded marketplace, some retailers might try glitzy window displays or splashy marketing campaigns to set themselves apart. Not Mr. Sarwari, who spends less than $10,000 a year on advertising. Xanadu's secret, he says, is its location.
 "How," he asks, "can a tourist miss Times Square?"
 But like a hotel manager who sees red ink when bookings suddenly fall off, Mr. Sarwari is all too aware when consumer confidence 5,000 miles away hits an air pocket: foreign tourists buy the $2.99 Statue of Liberty ballpoint pen instead of the $99 replica the size of a soft-drink bottle.
 Mr. Sarwari said he has to take in $400 a square foot to break even. By most retailers' standards, that's a lot. Macy's toted up an average of $203.80 a square foot at its 110 stores last year, according to the Blackstone Group, an investment firm. Of course, department-store dynamics are different from the impulse buying that brings in big bucks at Xanadu, but both share the bad news. "When the recession hit, I saw it," Mr. Sarwari said. "The food industry, people don't stop eating, but they stopped traveling."
 Still, merchandise that says "New York" sells. "New York, there's that excitement," Mr. Sarwari said. "Coming from a small town somewhere, they want to be part of it. They don't want to live here." Xanadu's 16-member staff does; this showcase of American kitsch is totally run by immigrants. Mr. Sarwari, who was born in Afghanistan 35 years ago and arrived from Pakistan in 1982, can't imagine himself anywhere else.
 "I have relatives in Chicago, Virginia and California who say, 'How can you live here?' " he said. "But I love it. I was in Chicago for a sporting goods show last month. Very clean, very nice, but I'm sorry, it was boring."
 And no Statue of Liberty. It is the consummate New York icon (available at Xanadu in six sizes and three colors), but it took him years to visit the big one in the harbor. "I had out-of-town guests," he said. Did he like it? "Yeah. It had some meaning. As an immigrant myself, I felt the power."
 Ditto the World Trade Center, whose popularity surged after what Mr. Sarwari calls "the incident" -- the bombing in February. Postcards and T-shirts with the twin towers have been selling faster than tiny replicas, Mr. Sarwari said.
 "The Japanese love them. With Japanese, they don't buy one or two. Any piece they buy, they buy 20. They are great customers, but they all want different bags. They want 40 plastic bags so they can present the gifts individually."
 There is more.
 "Germans? Not like Japanese," he said. "French, they're cheap, I can tell. I speak the language, I overhear things. The sales tax is shocking. In France --even at 30 percent or 45 percent in Scandinavia -- they don't feel it, it's built into the price. But 8.5 percent? They never get used to it."
 In all kinds of languages. One customer, Giovanna Caprini, an 18-year-old university student from Milan, was buying a dozen pencils. "Piace," she said. A friend, Doris Pizzino of Floral Park, L.I., explained that this meant she liked Xanadu very much, despite the sales tax.
 INCREASINGLY, the souvenirs as well as the customers come from far away. Mr. Sarwari sells a made-in-Korea-or-Taiwan piggy bank that looks like a giant penny, and the ballpoint pens with King Kong climbing the Empire State Building are Danish imports. "Somebody came in wanting an American-made pen, a regular pen," he said. "I don't sell that."
Xanadu is not where Mr. Sarwari expected to end up. As a child, he wanted to be a doctor. He was in medical school in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but when his United States visa arrived in 1982, "I said, 'Hey, American dream,' " and he left. He was a stock manager at a midtown electronics store before moving to Xanadu and its monstrous 2,000-item inventory, from the green street sign that says "Times Square" to the key chain with a subway-token holder. Mets jackets? Of course, but there is a but.
 "The Yankees always sell, regardless of whether they are doing well," he said. "I sell more Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies jackets than the Mets. Anything more than the Mets."
OFF THE SHELF (The Can Is Not Included)
Bottoms Up ($9.99) provides the one thing a pop-top lacks: a handle. A pliable plastic statuette, it clips snugly onto the can. The manufacturer sold 9.9 million in six months. "I wish I could come up with something like that that I could market," said Ralph Sarwari, Xanadu's manager. He sold 48 last week.

At Pier 62, Start of Plan For Riverfront

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
It doesn't look like much: a bleak stretch of asphalt with volleyball and basketball courts, picnic tables and an information kiosk. But the new playground on Pier 62 at 23d Street is the first sign that after two decades of controversy, including the killing of Westway, plans to revitalize this section of the Hudson River waterfront are moving closer to reality.
 The Hudson River Park Conservancy, which will eventually manage the redeveloped waterfront from the Battery to 59th Street, installed the playground. And as limited as it is, it still attracts residents of the area, people who work nearby and summer campers from the local Y. 
Every Sunday afternoon, Tom Schuler, armed with beach chair, newspaper and fruit, heads for the playground. "It's my favorite all-purpose park where you can meet neighbors, play Frisbee or just sit and watch all the boats go by," said Mr. Schuler, who lives at 23d Street and Ninth Avenue.
 If the last hurdle -- approval by the State Transportation Department -- is cleared this fall, a privately financed $50 million rebuilding of the Chelsea Piers could start in November. On Piers 59, 60 and 61, now home to parking lots and the film studio where the NBC television series "Law and Order" is shot, plans call for two glass-enclosed ice skating rinks, film and television studios, an urban golf club, indoor jogging track and gymnasium, three waterfront retaurants, a two-and-a-half-acre park and a long public esplanade.
 But the Chelsea Piers project still faces opposition. Marcy Benstock, the environmental advocate who led the successful fight against Westway, does not support the plans. Her chief objection is that management of Chelsea Piers --along with the whole riverside project -- would be under the supervision of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, a subsidiary of the state Urban Development Corporation that she says is an autonomous agency "not accountable to the public." Her Clean Air Campaign and three other civic groups are suing to shift responsibility to public agencies.
 But many Chelsea residents who supported Ms. Benstock on Westway disagree with her about Chelsea Piers. "Any presence is better than the present wasteland," said Sybil Taylor, a writer, who now bikes to Battery Park for a waterfront view. MARVINE HOWE

Reborn Brownstones: Phase I

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The first stage of the Bradhurst redevelopment plan, one of the largest neighborhood-renewal projects ever undertaken by the city, is nearing completion. Starting this week, people with low and moderate incomes may request applications for the 236 apartments in renovated brownstones on Frederick Douglass Boulevard between 145th and 147th Streets and east along 145th Street.
 The renovations, which also include 60 apartments for people being displaced by the construction and five for superintendents, are part of a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate a troubled area that stretches from 139th Street to 155th Street and from St. Nicholas Avenue to Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. It is planned that by the year 2000, the city will construct or renovate more than 80 buildings, housing a total of 2,200 families. The project, being developed by a consortium of political, business and spiritual leaders, is being overseen by the Housing Preservation and Development Department. 
Almost 90 percent of the $24.5 million the city spent on Phase 1 went to architects and contractors from racial or ethnic minorities.
 The first apartments are for families with total incomes $13,120 to $47,000. They will be chosen by lottery, and neighborhood residents will have priority for 30 percent of the units. Sixteen studios are reserved for artists. The rents range from $350 a month for a one-bedroom apartment for a low-income tenant or family to $675 for a three-bedroom apartment for a moderate-income family.
 Phase 2 of the plan is near the construction stage. Anyone who wishes to apply for an apartment must request an application in writing -- enclosing a self-addressed, stamped envelope -- from Bradhurst Redevelopment Project, Morningside Station, P.O. Box 1588, New York, N.Y. 10026. Completed applications must be postmarked by Oct. 25. E.B.

In Chinatown, A Food Fight

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
The Silver Palace, which in 1981 became Chinatown's first unionized restaurant, is writing another new chapter in its labor relations. It has locked out the union and is being picketed.
 The popular restaurant, which opened in 1976 as New York's first Hong Kong-style dim sum mega-parlor and banquet hall, says it must cut costs because of the recession and new competition from banquet halls. 
On Aug. 19 the managers locked out 40 waiters, cart-pushers and busboys from Restaurant Workers Union 318 after they refused to give up paid health insurance, some paid time off and part of their tips.
 "The workers are fighting just to keep what they had," said Wing Lam, a union adviser.
 A waiter, Ming Wong, recalled the union's initial struggle.
 "This is like history repeating itself," he said. "We want to get our jobs back."
 Chinatown has the city's biggest concentration of restaurants, with a reputation for tasty food at modest prices.
 But those bargains are possible because the restaurants usually pay very low wages, often to illegal immigrants who have few other chances for employment and do not protest.
 In an advertisement in Chinatown newspapers, Silver Palace complained that while it has a 40-hour workweek and pays more than the minimum wage, all its competitors are nonunion and have 60- to 70-hour weeks, minimal pay and no health coverage.
 "I'm not asking for anything anyone else doesn't have," said Richard Chan, Silver Palace's executive director.
 And to attract business discouraged by picketing, the restaurant, which seats 900, has cut its prices by 30 percent. B.L.

HEADLINE: Learning to Cope With Hard Times

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
MATTIE CREECH lives in a ground-floor apartment in the Newhallville section of New Haven. Outside her front door, city buses sit idling and the blare of car stereos rattle the dishes in her cupboard. While sitting next to a window seat filled with herbs, Mrs. Creech said she reckoned that the country has been going downhill since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
"But let me add," said the 73-year-old, who retired in 1987 after working 20 years repairing guns for the Olin Corporation, "in the past five years, it's gone completely crazy." 
 She includes among her litany of contemporary ills the fact that the banks are always changing their names, the residents are overtaxed and, of late, the thieves in her neighborhood are stealing air-conditioners from people's windows. Such developments stand in stark contrast with the days when she first moved to Connecticut from rural Virginia in the 1940's.
"That was when everybody had a job and some respect," Mrs. Creech said. "There was always a park where a kid could play and everybody watched out. Now they've torn down all the parks to build condominiums and no one can buy them. And the young people are toting guns and selling drugs. That tells you how far we've come."
In recent interviews with residents across the state one thing became clear: these are confusing times for Connecticut. The recession that began around four years ago still lingers. The state's cities have become more impoverished and dangerous. AIDS, teen-age pregnancy, drug abuse and other social problems continue to take their toll. And the dream of finding a lifelong job that includes good benefits with a stable company has died.
No matter where people live and what their standard of living, the turmoil and economic difficulties of the past few years seem to have in some way altered their lives. For many, the period marks a time of financial and philosophical readjustment. While some say the worst is yet to come, others are hopeful, given the resourcefulness of the state's residents, that Connecticut's economy will revive. Over all, everyone agrees that things will never be the same. When it comes to stories about the pain of losing a job, Susan Troup Tolhurst of Waterbury said she had heard them all. She knows of one Bridgeport man who lost his printing business after 30 years and a former Hartford bank manager who now makes $15,000 working at a pharmaceutical laboratory scrubbing bottles. She knows people who have received exemplary evaluations from their employers one day and a pink slip the next.
 
Unemployment Problems
 In 1990 Ms. Tolhurst was laid off from her job as a computer trainer the same week her husband was laid off from his job as a computer engineer. "When you're both unemployed at the same time, it's no vacation," she said, "and I knew the worst thing would be to isolate myself."
After a thorough search she found only two support networks for people who had lost their jobs and decided to begin her own group. She sent out news releases to churches, unemployment centers, libraries and civic groups. In the spring of 1991 she held the first meeting at Silas Bronson Library in Waterbury. The group now draws 20 to 50 people weekly, most of whom are professionals over 40 who come from as far away as Danbury, Fairfield and New Haven. The two hours are spent sharing interviewing experiences, resume tips, job leads and listening to speakers.
Ms. Troup, 44, also publishes a brochure distributed by the State Department of Labor listing 55 similar support groups, which have emerged in the last three years. As a result of her contacts with thousands of unemployed people she said she had become an astute observer of the state and national economy.
"Most economists agree that because Connecticut was the first to be hit with the recession, it will be the last to come out of it," she said. "What we've got is a huge mismatch between our labor pool and what's needed to succeed in a global economy." She would like to see a state task force created that would be made up of jobless workers and employers; they would sit down together and redefine the types of skills workers need, and determine if businesses plan to hire more temporary as opposed to permanent, full-time employees.
 
Saw Recession Coming
 In addition, Ms. Troup suggested that the state finance a program to help unemployed people with similar talents form business cooperatives. Earlier this year she began a part-time job as a vocational trainer at Brookfield High School. Though there was no pay for her work on the brochure and outreach project, she did receive a letter from Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. commending her efforts.
"There's a book called 'If You Do What You Love Then the Money Will Follow,' " she said. "I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hoping that'll come true."
In 1989 Thomas Febbraio, sensed that the economy in the Fairfield area was beginning to crumble. As an owner of three restaurants -- Tommy's, Sidetracks and Arizona Flats -- he said he had kept in touch with the Welcome Wagon organization and had begun to notice that housing sales in Fairfield had dropped substantially.
"That was the real barometer," he said. The following year, Mr. Febbraio, 40, started to see a decline in the number of customers. Other businesses in the area were also struggling. At that point he began to analyze his business. He spent long evenings at his office on the Post Road calculating ways to reduce his expenditures and increase his revenues. He revised the menus and strengthened the style of each restaurant, which are completely distinct.
"I looked at everything down to how much it was costing us to put oil in our table lamps," Mr. Febbraio said. "I thought I was going to lose everything."
 
Difficulties of Self-Employed
 Substantially cutting costs and redefining goals has paid off, said Mr. Febbraio, who has been a restaurant owner for 16 years. Last year he and his partner, Thomas Sargent, a Westport lawyer, had their best year, he said. Although the number of customers has not reached the peak of the mid-1980's, he said, the financial adjustments they made have compensated for other shortfalls.
"In the 1980's restaurants did business by default because business was flowing," Mr. Febbraio said in a recent interview at Sidetracks, a family-style restaurant with a railroad theme. "In the 1990's you have to be more creative in your thinking. You have to know how to invest in what you already have."
In Cornwall, near the banks of the Housatonic River, Todd Piker, 41, uses an old chicken barn as his pottery studio. With a wood-fired kiln he turns out dishes, mugs and bowls, birdhouses and lamps, mostly in rich shades of red and brown. A self-employed artist for the past 20 years, Mr. Piker said he was no stranger to recessionary times. He and his family run the Cornwall Bridge Pottery store, where he sells his works along with Mexican blown glass, kitchen items and children's toys.
Because of its location, the flow of traffic is steady, yet in the past five years, Mr. Piker said, "There's so little discretionary income around, it's been harder and harder to convince people that a bowl of pottery will enhance their lives."
 
Impact on Tourism
 Mr. Piker said the challenge of generating new ways to make ends meet has become the only way to survive. He has expanded his merchandise to include cutting boards, post cards and children's games and makes sure his prices are reasonable.
Because the northwest corner of the state is so susceptible to the ebb and flow of tourists, he said, the recession has placed a strain on most businesses. The tax bases for some towns are eroding, the town roads are not as well maintained and "the schools are crying for every dollar they can get," he said. But despite it all, he said he would not trade his life style for another.
"You're a self-employed person for a reason," said Mr. Piker, the president of the Society for Connecticut Crafts. "And nowadays the economy is so fleeting, I wouldn't want to give up what I'm doing to try and work for some corporation."
Gina Dituzzi, 47, said that if she won the lottery, she would buy all the empty factories in Bridgeport and turn them into shelters for homeless people, complete with a cafeteria and medical staff. As a caseworker for the city's Spanish American Development Agency for the past six years, she has watched the lives of most of her clients deteriorate.
 
'My Heart Gets Broken'
 More and more of them have to collect cans and bottles to supplement their incomes, she said, and to ask for food vouchers, which are in limited supply. Elderly people are especially hard hit, she said, referring to one woman who lives on cat food and crackers because she needs the money from her meager pension to pay for her medications. Many of her clients have succumbed to AIDS, tuberculosis and drug overdoses.
"Every day my heart gets broken," Ms. Dituzzi said. She has fond memories of growing up in the Bullshead section of Bridgeport in the 1950's. "Those were the days when you could walk out and sleep on a bench with all your money on you and nobody bothering you," she said. "Some day I'd like to see it go back to that, but I know that'll never happen."
She raised three daughters on her own by washing people's clothes with a glass washboard in her bathtub, she said. Today she makes $300 a week as a caseworker helping people fill out their welfare forms, teaching English and lending a compassionate ear.
Instead of giving money to the drug addicts or alcoholics that cluster on corners and in boarded up buildings outside her office on East Main Street she will often take them to get something to eat. "People are doing what they're not supposed to be doing and that's why it's all going down the drain," she said. "That and the fact that there's no money. And in this world, it all comes down to money."
 
Wildflowers Amid Debris
 On a weekday afternoon, Ms. Dituzzi described her neighborhood as she walked past Julio's Furniture Store, two Spanish food markets and a stretch of boarded-up buildings sprayed with graffiti. The farthest from Bridgeport she has ever been is New Haven, she said, and she would not change that for anything.
Near a cluster of men swapping liquor bottles beneath the awning of an abandoned warehouse, Ms. Dituzzi talked about how unfairly people outside Bridgeport talk about the city. "To most people," she said, "Bridgeport's the place you go to get killed."
Farther down the street, past an empty lot strewn with broken bottles and litter, she paused to point out the clusters of Queen Anne's lace. Like the wildflowers sprouting amid the debris, Ms. Dituzzi pointed out that Bridgeport has a beautiful side that is often ignored. But unless everyone faces up to the realities of urban life, she said, the conditions are going to get much worse for the whole state.
"Everybody in Connecticut has to open their eyes and try to put our world back together again," she said. "Instead of being afraid of crime and poverty, I tell people not to be afraid. It's here, let's cope with it. Instead of running, we've got to start rebuilding. Instead of avoiding, let's try to reclaim at least some of what once made us a strong community."

Lego Blocks Keep Building a Growing Enfield

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHILE much of the economy languishes, parents still buy toys for their children at a phenomenal rate, and in this country they buy more than anywhere else in the world. The toy industry estimates that the United States accounts for 25 percent of worldwide spending on toys.
Few companies take toys more seriously than Lego Systems, the Enfield subsidiary of the Lego Group, a Danish company. From its opening in 1975 until last year the company has expanded its manufacturing plant six times, the last time to 525,000 square feet. 
 This year it opened a $25 million, 225,000-square-foot high-technology warehouse on its 147-acre Taylor Road property and has begun construction on a 100,000-square-foot, $14 million office complex.
Peter Eio, the subsidiary's president and chief executive, said he was also in the market for 75 or 80 acres to build a 150,000-square-foot injection-molding plant to make the company's famous plastic interlocking building blocks, and the company's long-term plans call for "other new facilities in Enfield," although he would not elaborate.
"We've been in the United States 20 years, and we've had 20 years of steady growth, and we hope to continue that," Mr. Eio said. Although the privately owned company does not disclose its annual revenues, Mr. Eio said sales had increased 13 to 14 percent annually for the last several years.
John D. Pagini, Enfield's director of planning and community development, said Lego, Phoenix Home Life, U.S. Shoe, and Hallmark Cards are the town's top employers, each with 1,000 to 1,200 employees, but Lego's growth rate will soon put it out in front.
Mr. Pagini said with the development of the office building, however, Lego will have used most of its available space.
"If they have plans to expand it will have to be in another location," Mr. Pagini said. "There's a lot of available land in the general area, though, so that won't be a problem."
Town Manager A. Louis Hayward said a recent survey showed 1,200 to 1,300 acres of industrially zoned land available for development. Most industrial land sells for $30,000 to $100,000 an acre.
Enfield, a Hartford bedroom community of 46,300, has come into its own because of its available industrial land and its highly skilled work force, Mr. Hayward said.
"Just in the last year, we've had something in the neighborhood of 22 businesses either move into Enfield or expand, with an estimated 1,000 new jobs," Mr. Hayward said. The new enterprises have ranged from Dairy Mart, which recently took over the old Digital Equipment Corporation building, to New Ventures Technology, a startup company manufacturing computer components.
Jacqueline S. Horner, administrative assistant at the North Central Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, said Enfield's access to Interstate 91 and Bradley International Airport in neighboring Windsor Locks are also selling points for foreign investors. Two other European companies, Jagenberg, which makes machinery for the paper industry, and Leybold Vacuum Systems, have come to Enfield since Lego arrived, she said. But the star of Enfield's corporate community is obviously Lego.
"One of the things we rely on is that having something like Lego in town will attract other companies," Mr. Hayward said. "If a corporation of that stature is here, it's an indication Enfield is a good place to do business."
"We use Lego as an example for other foreign companies considering an investment in the United States," said Joseph Cohen, a spokesman for the state's Department of Economic Development. "It's a good selling point when you can show a foreign-owned company is succeeding and is pleased with the business climate in Connecticut."
EGO was begun by Ole Kirk Christiansen in 1932. The name came from the Danish "leg godt," for "play well." He didn't know it at the time, but lego also means "I put together," or "I assemble," in Latin. His nontoxic and nearly unbreakable blocks were introduced in this country in 1961.
The company says that six of its basic eight-stud blocks can be combined in nearly 103 million ways, and its quality control program allows a maximum variation of 0.0008 inches, less than one-thousandth of an inch, in its bricks.
Lego sells more than 11 billion bricks a year in nearly 120 countries. Mr. Eio said Lego blocks were in 70 percent of the homes in the United States, a market penetration other toy companies envy.
In Europe, though, 80 to 85 percent of homes have Lego blocks. But all that means is that Lego has not realized its potential in this country, Mr. Eio said. And if the North American Free Trade Agreement is ratified, he said, the company hopes to begin distributing its toys to Mexico from Enfield.
Next to its warehouse is a 30-foot-long Lego-brick model of the Capitol in Washington. The visitors' waiting room has Lego sculptures of Donald Duck, and his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie, and a glass-topped treasure chest filled with the bricks.
But it is not all games at Lego. Its new distribution center has 50-foot ceilings, so the company can stack 40,000 pallets in its 10 million square feet of space. Dozen of loading docks are usually occupied by the familiar bright yellow trucks bearing the red and white Lego logo.
Inside, wire-guided turret trucks can unload trucks automatically, record on a central computer where each load is stored, and retrieve it without searching through paper records. The company also has an arrangement with its largest corporate customers so they can order via computer modem, and the confirmation comes back the same way.
"It's basically a paperless system," Mr. Eio said. "And they're notified the minute the truck leaves the distribution center, so they can immediately plan to receive it."
The new office building, scheduled to open in 1994, will house Lego's sales and marketing staff on two floors.

HEADLINE: Along Arkansas's Pristine Waterway

BYLINE: By DYAN ZASLOWSKY; DYAN ZASLOWSKY lives in Colorado and writes frequently about the outdoors.

 BODY:
AROUND 1979, the slogan on Arkansas license plates changed from "The Land of Opportunity" to "The Natural State," in a tribute to Arkansas's beautiful scenery and unsullied backwoods.
During the 1970's, Arkansans themselves seemed to be awakening to the native splendor of their state. There were a number of good reasons for raised consciousness; possibly the best of them was the establishment of the Buffalo National River in 1972. The Buffalo is a 132-mile free-flowing waterway that drains the 2,500-foot-high Ozark Mountains in the northwest portion of the state. As a result of a highly publicized alliance between Justice William O. Douglas and local preservationists, the Buffalo became the first river in the country to be proclaimed a National River. 
 Federal recognition hinged on its having miraculously remained undammed and unpolluted for its entire length. In a monumental effort to keep it that way forever, a 94,000-acre portion of the Buffalo's watershed was purchased in the 1970's by the Government from private landowners. The Buffalo National River is now administered by the National Park Service, and the United States Forest Service administers the one-million-acre Ozark National Forest where the river begins.
The Buffalo, a river the color of pale jade and with similar smoothness in some portions, has always appealed to canoeists in the region. But until the 1970's, when the Park Service began trail development, boaters were mostly confined to the river and its banks since the land around the river was privately owned and few, if any, public trails had been blazed cross-country. In the last 10 or 15 years, hundreds of miles of trails have been constructed, owing to the zealous efforts of volunteer builders and park employees. One example of their industry was the blazing of the 187-mile Ozark Highlands Trail through the dense heart of the Ozark National Forest in the 1980's. The route is now counted by Backpacker Magazine as one of the country's best long-distance trails. Dozens of trails ideal for day trips have also been constructed. Those of us who love to hike can now explore deep into the Arkansas woods -- countless waterfalls, swimmable oxbow-shaped pools, caverns, bluffs, hollows and old homesteader cabins -- as a result.
The 200-foot-high Hemmed-In-Hollow falls, which the National Park Service says is the highest waterfall between the Appalachians and the Rockies, is one of the big surprises of Arkansas's back country. I had heard about the falls 14 years ago from a man my husband and I often hiked with. Born and raised in Arkansas, our friend pressed us to go and see some of the beauty of his home turf.
I did so last April for four days, a month when my own home in Colorado is locked in interminable snow and cold, but the Ozarks are mild and leafing out. Covering the Ozark Mountain flanks down to the Buffalo National River were dark entanglements of oak, hickory, umbrella magnolia, beech, sassafras and maple etched against the infant green. Moon-white dogwoods and the magenta florets of the redbud trees spangled the understory -- in another week the dogwoods would saturate it with their light -- while the ground was dappled with wild iris, violets, fire pinks and buttercups. For all its delicate beauty, spring may well be surpassed by autumn, according to our friend, who married in late October because he loved the palette of the Arkansas foliage at least as much as he loved his bride. The trees begin to turn brilliant shades of red in late September, and are saturated in red, yellow and orange by the end of October. The days are dry and blue-skied, with daytime temperatures rising into the 70's and a touch of frost crisping the nights.
To reach the Buffalo National River one cool, clear morning, we drove east from Fayetteville for about an hour, through countryside that alternated between dense forest and undulating sward. The vistas were green, clean and downright prosperous judging from the appearance of the stout houses and barns. An indication of rural Arkansas's current economic vitality is the number of long, low chicken ranches that have been started up across the state, making it the top chicken producer in the nation.
We also drove through pretty, pre-Civil War towns and settlements the size of a heartbeat; though northwest Arkansas is the birthplace of the Wal-Mart juggernaut, tranquil Kingston, Possum Trot, Boxley, Ponca and Compton are not only pre-Wal-Mart, they look pre-20th century as well. Indeed, in the Boxley Valley you can spot a few iron kettles the Confederates used to manufacture gunpower from the saltpeter they mined in nearby caves. Farmers feed and water livestock from the enormous pots.
We pulled into the nearly empty Compton Trailhead to begin the five-mile round trip into Hemmed-In-Hollow.
After a rather steep descent through the forest, we turned off the main trail to see Wild Vic's Cabin, one of the original home sites and historic landmarks near the river that the Park Service has preserved. The cabins offer a glimpse of old hillbilly life, and provide minimal shelter when the weather turns foul -- a downpour can drive a hiker into one of them but so can the unexpected cold of a winter night.
Wild Vic's Cabin was built of hand-hewn logs in the early 1900's. A dead tree stands in the middle of the cabin's lower room and had been rudely fashioned into a spiral staircase leading to the loft. Wild Vic or his successor had presumably subsisted here into the 1960's, when the Government paid him to move out in preparation for the national river park.
We hiked for another hour or so -- crossing swift Sneed's Creek on a fallen tree trunk no wider than the width of our feet -- to reach Grandma Henderson's Cabin. It surprised me how few hikers we encountered along the creek, which flows out of the Buffalo, though the weather was fine and canoe traffic on the river was moderately heavy.
The corrugated tin roof of the empty cabin gleamed above a meadow carpeted with pale reindeer moss. The ground looked like foam and felt like pillows where we stepped on it. At Wild Vic's and at Grandma's, naturalized jonquils yellowed the ground around the cabins, providing gentle anthropological testimony to the gardening efforts of the former inhabitants.
While the flowers succeeded, the crops probably did not, since soil in these parts tends to be thin and easily sapped by cultivation. Left to its own devices though, the land yields trees.
Grandma Henderson's place, another landmark on the route, must have been a fine house for the neighborhood, handsomely shingled and with a wide veranda staring out the front and a root cellar in the back. Even in these backwoods she had cared enough about appearances to decorate with wallpaper and cover the floor with vivid linoleum. We studied her changing taste in color and pattern as they peeled away from the walls, and went outside to picnic on smoked turkey and croissants bought in Fayetteville. (The towns closest to the Buffalo River offer little in the way of accommodations or food. Before heading into the area, it is best to stock up at grocery stores in bigger towns like Harrison or Jasper.)
After leaving Grandma's, we walked beside the Buffalo for about two miles, then followed a stony finger of it into Hemmed-In-Hollow. About a dozen boaters had beached their canoes and were also proceeding on foot, their paddles slung over a shoulder or deployed as walking sticks.
The air had warmed up but was still on the cool side of comfortable, and even by the river it was too early in the season to be nattered at by mosquitoes and other winged pests. Bugs and humidity are the twin banes of summer, leaving the other nine months in which to hike in pleasant conditions.
Hemmed-In-Hollow, configured like a natural amphitheater recessed into the limestone bluffs, is probably the best known of Arkansas's secluded pools. The noise of the waterfalls at the very back of the hollow tumbling from a semicircular array of fissures in the sheer rock walls drowns out all normal conversations. Refreshing spray danced out and back, freighted with the pungent scent of juniper when the breeze was right. We stayed a while and watched two men rappelle down the face of the hollow, then disappear into caves hidden from our view.
All exits out of the hollow go up. We chose the steepest and therefore the shortest way that did not require a technical climb. The footing was so narrow that it occurred to me that I had not negotiated such a precarious ledge since hiking in the Swiss Alps two summers before.
Understandably, the Park Service discourages that particular route. At the far side of the hollow we clambered straight up a rock chimney, scrambling hand over hand until the ground leveled off.
The two hikes we took the next day, after spending the night in Ponca at the Buffalo Outdoor Center, afforded no such thrills. They were both easy, and very rewarding considering our low expenditure of energy.
The first was along three-mile Clark Creek. The hasty creek eventually empties into the Buffalo, and on its way has carved a jewel of a canyon called Lost Valley out of 50-foot limestone bluffs honeycombed with caves. Eden Cave is a wonderful one for neophyte spelunkers because it is so accessible and considered quite safe, though a stream flows through it and a waterfall pours out of its mouth.
The second hike was to Hawksbill Crag, which juts out 400 feet above the river, and provides exhilarating views of the vast, untrammeled Upper Buffalo Wilderness Area.
To get there, we drove a short distance through the Boxley Valley, briefly stopping by an old church cemetery to read the moldy gravestones.
Considering its fame, Hawksbill is poorly marked and trailed. I was puzzled to find that the one-mile path from the car pull-off to the outcrop was scarcely better than a game trail. While the terrain is flat, without some markings to show the way hikers new to the country could have found themselves perilously close to the forested edge of the mountain.
The difference between the Hawksbill Crag trail and the others I had hiked in the area lies, I suppose, in the philosophical difference between the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service. One agency throws open the lands it administers to all comers, the other is reluctant to promote its recreational resources. It might encourage more people.
Hikers from outside Arkansas have already begun to arrive in larger numbers, judging from how seldom we met people who spoke like natives.
Fortunately, my hiking companion was homegrown and spoke in the soft, melodic accents that I've come to appreciate. When we passed the sign on the highway for the Possum Trot turnoff, I chuckled over the town's colloquial spelling. He averred that by Arkansas standards the spelling was correct. I responded, "Then what about that opossum we saw squashed by the side of the road back there?"
"We don't have opossums down here," he said, lingering over the first o. "Just possums. Since you Northerners don't have any possums where y'all live, how come y'all the ones who get to decide how we have to spell the critters?"
 
 
 
TRAILS, CANOE RENTALS, LODGING AND HEARTY MEALS
If You Go
 The best seasons to visit the Buffalo National River are spring or fall, when the forest is aflame in color. Yet despite the heat, summer is still the most popular season. Hiking is possible throughout the mild winter, but winter canoeing, which requires wetsuits, is only for the hardiest recreationists.
For hikers, the trail guides by Tim Ernst, a local photographer and trail builder, are indispensable. "Arkansas Hiking Trails" is the most comprehensive of his guides. "Ozark Highlands Trail Guide" is for those planning a trek across the national forest. Both are published by Norwegian Wood in Fayetteville, Ark. They cost $12.95 plus $2 shipping and can be ordered from Ernst Wilderness, 411 Patricia Lane, Fayetteville, Ark. 72703; (501) 442-2799.
Canoes or river rafts can be rented in Ponca at the Buffalo Outdoor Center, at the junction of Highways 43 and 74 (501-861-5514), or Lost Valley Canoe and Lodging across the road (501-861-5522).

Tuesday to Saturday in the spring and until Nov. 1, when it closes for the winter. The dining room has fabulous views of Big Creek Valley. The Cliff House is known for its angel flake biscuits, and the dish proclaimed the official Arkansas state pie, Company's Coming, with meringue, pecans and pineapple. Entrees include grilled or fried chicken, country fried steak, mashed potatoes, trout and catfish, about $4.95.
Devito's, Highway 65 North, in Harrison (also in Eureka Springs), (501) 741-8832, is open for lunch Tuesday to Friday 11:30 A.M to 2 P.M. and dinner Tuesday through Saturday 5 P.M. to 9 P.M. It serves excellent pasta, with seafood fettuccine and chicken Parmesan specialties. Entrees are $5.95 to $13.50.
Rockhouse Barbecue, 416 South Pine, Harrison, (501) 741-1787, serves hickory-smoked pork loin ribs, steakburgers and catfish. Open Monday to Thursday 11 A.M. to 9 P.M., Friday and Saturday 11 A.M. to 9:30 P.M. A full rack of ribs with cole slaw, cornbread and baked beans for two costs $15.95.

HEADLINE: What the Navy Taught Allen Schindler's Mother

BYLINE: By Jesse Green; Jesse Green is the author of "O Beautiful," a novel.

 BODY:
Not far from the laminated portrait of Elvis, high on a shelf in her tumbledown house, sits the only photograph Dorothy Hajdys has of her father, who died in prison when she was 5: a dashing sailor with faraway eyes serving his country in World War II. The pictures of her first husband -- a man named Allen Schindler who decided he was John the Baptist and, she says, nearly drowned her in the bathtub to prove it -- are not on display. Water is a running theme in the family: Frank Hajdys, her second husband, was a Navy man as well; before he died in 1985 he regaled their young son, Billy, and his three stepchildren -- Dorothy's two girls and one boy -- with tales of his adventures aboard the battleship Arizona. The stepson, "little Allen," so called to distinguish him from his biological father, must have taken Frank Hajdys's stories to heart because in 1988, at the age of 18, he signed up and shipped out. "I thought I was the most proudest mother in the nation," Dorothy has said.
"I THOUGHT I WAS THE MOST PROUDEST MOTHER IN the nation," Dorothy was shouting into a microphone set up in front of the Capitol last April. A sad curiosity to the general public, which might have caught her on the evening news, Dorothy Hajdys (pronounced HAY-jiss) was a hero to the hundreds of thousands of people gathered before her at the gay-rights march on Washington. Earlier in the day they had cheered her wildly, this 47-year-old grandmother with the door-hinge voice and battleship proportions, marching at the head of a contingent of veterans and clutching a photograph of her son like a shield. 
 "Cheering me!" she said later. "Me who didn't even know a homosexual until January!" Yet that seemed to be what the crowd was responding to -- not the tragedy of her son's brutal murder but the swift education that had opened her eyes, opened her mouth and brought her here. If the Salvation Army bookkeeper from Chicago Heights, Ill., was scandalized by the Dykes on Bikes gunning their engines and the Gays in the Millinery prancing in fancy hats, she kept her disapproval to herself. Still, she seemed frozen, as if bracing for a blow; when the crowd started roaring, she just stared back, until a friend had to prompt her: "Wave, Dorothy, wave!" Which she immediately did, as if to a ship.
"I AM FINALLY GOING TO A SPECIAL PLACE," radioman Allen Schindler wrote on the first page of a pale green notebook he bought two years after entering the Navy. The special place was the aircraft carrier Midway -- "the mighty, mighty Midway," he called it -- and the notebook was to be a record of his happiness on board. Evidently he expected an abiding happiness, for he numbered the bottoms of the pages from 1 to 192. But in 1991 he was transferred to the Belleau Wood, a smaller ship with a reputation for mayhem. As his progressively less legible entries attest, Allen was miserable. At Christmas Dorothy saw he had removed stitches from the logo on his cap, turning the B in Belleau into an H. What she didn't know was that the hell he was suffering was the hell of a gay man in fear for his life.
Indeed, Allen Schindler would never get past page 64 of his journal. Two months before his 23rd birthday, on Oct. 27, 1992, while on shore leave in Sasebo, Japan, he was followed into a park bathroom shortly before midnight by two drunken shipmates, one of whom, Airman Charles Vins, watched and occasionally joined in while the other, Airman Apprentice Terry Helvey, kneed Schindler in the groin, struck him in the face and then, cradling his head in the crook of his arm, punched him repeatedly while lowering him to the floor. There, Helvey began stamping on him with the heel of his foot, striking blows from head to crotch that resulted, according to the pathologist who performed the autopsy, in abrasions, contusions and lacerations of the forehead, eyes, nose, lips, chin, neck, Adam's apple, trachea, lungs, liver -- which was pulped "like a smushed tomato" -- and penis. The pathologist compared the damage to that of a "high-speed auto accident or a low-speed aircraft accident" and said it was the most severe trauma he'd ever witnessed -- even worse than a case he'd seen of a man trampled to death by a horse.
A sailor who happened upon the scene but could only make out shadows through a window in the bathroom door described Helvey's footwork another way: "It seemed like he was dancing."
DOROTHY HATED TO LIE. SHE would teach her children never to lie. But with Allen Sr. unemployed because of a mysterious back problem, she needed a job to help pay the mortgage. And John's frozen pizza, a girlfriend told her, would not hire the mother of a newborn -- little Allen was just 1 month old. So Dorothy lied and got the job. But it wasn't enough. Two years later, with money still short, she took on another, at Burger King. Now she could fry fries from 10 A.M. to 2:30 P.M., change uniforms and dash across town to John's, where, from 3 P.M. to 1 A.M., she tossed pepperoni onto frozen pizzas as they whizzed past relentlessly. In the little time remaining she slept, and kept dreaming this image: Allen's bottle of milk emerging frozen among the pizzas on the endless conveyor belt.
His real bottle she rarely saw; it was her aunt Marie, living in the small apartment at the back of the house, who took care of Allen. Marie helped him through Dorothy's divorce from Allen Sr.; through Dorothy's marriage to Hajdys, her Burger King boss; through Allen's disappointment that his stepfather had plenty of time and money for Billy but none for his stepson. And so it was an understandably miserable 12-year-old who, upon Marie's death, lashed out at his mother, blaming her for ruining the family. "I said, 'If you think this is so terrible, go stay with your father for a week,' " Dorothy recalls. "But Allen Sr. slammed the door in his face, saying, 'You're her problem now.' That did the trick! Allen and me weren't real, real close, but after that I was his mother and father and we never had a problem again."
WHEN DOROTHY GOT HOME from the Salvation Army at 6:30 on Oct. 27, 1992, Billy had already left for his job at the Haunted House in nearby Park Forest. "I figured I wasn't going nowhere," she remembers. "So I just put on a nightshirt and did some work for this lady at church." What happened next, as she sat on the floor cutting crosses out of plastic to make bookmarks, she would hardly be able to relate if she hadn't at once begun dictating a journal of each day's events to her daughter Kathy. "Two sailors came to my door in dress blues," the log begins that night. "They told me that my son had been assaulted by two men in a park in Sasebo, Japan, and that he was dead." Ten pages and seven months later, it ends with "Allen's stone was put in at the cemetery." In between, in homely prose, it records Dorothy's struggle to bury her son and understand why he died -- a pursuit in which the Navy all but abandoned her. "Oct. 30: Heard nothing." "Nov. 1: Still heard nothing."
Waiting for answers, or even the body, she barely slept. It wasn't until the arrival, on Nov. 4, of the coffin -- bearing a corpse unrecognizable except by tattoos on its pale arms -- that Dorothy was finally told her son's assailants were shipmates. "But why would shipmates want to beat him so badly?" she wanted to know. "Nov. 9," the journal records, "No new information." It was left for a reporter from Pacific Stars and Stripes, an independent military newspaper, to tell her that Allen was gay, that he had met with a legal officer in hopes of getting off the Belleau Wood and that, according to a letter sent to the paper by three gay men who knew him in Japan, Allen's death was the result of violence encouraged, if not permitted, by a climate of bigotry aboard ship.
Dorothy at first denied her son was gay but soon realized that the reporter's scenario was credible, and that the Navy, in its stonewalling, was not. Previously she'd tended to be submissive in the face of mistreatment. "Oh yeah, anybody could do anything to me," she now says. It's a part of family folklore that as a child she had allowed some cousins (who, by a trick of remarriage, were also her half-brothers) to tie her to a homemade stake and set her on fire. And then there were the men in her life, who jilted her, sponged off her, told her lies to get their way. Frank Hajdys, it turned out, was not sterile from a "Navy injury," as Billy's birth proved. "And Allen Sr. wasn't all that faithful," Dorothy adds. "The night little Allen was born, he was in a tavern with a girl, and she actually came and stayed in our house!" She pauses. "But I will say she cleaned up." Allen Schindler Sr. could not be reached for comment.
But within weeks of the murder, Dorothy's reserve of humility was spent. The pronouncements of her Government and its agencies, which she had formerly either ignored or accepted, she now treated with suspicion bordering on scorn. When, in November, the accomplice, Vins, was tried without her knowledge and sentenced to what amounted to only four months in the brig, she was angry but not surprised. Nor did it surprise her to learn, in March, that a senior Navy official was leaking a story, later disproved, that her son's murder was the result of a romance with Helvey gone bad.
By then, Dorothy knew about disinformation. She had begun her own inquiry, working the phone and filling scrapbooks with relevant articles. When the first reporter had called, she was barely able to speak, but now she cultivated the press, prodding them to follow up on inconsistencies and feeding them pieces of one another's stories. "If one more reporter calls me with information before you do," she told the Navy commander in charge of the case, "you haven't even heard me scream!" It wasn't long before Dorothy began wondering who cared more about her son: the Navy, in which three generations of her family had served, or the gay community, which she had not until recently even known she was part of.
HE ORGANIZED GAY community is no more organized -- and no more a community -- than any other affiliation of people who have, at best, only one thing in common. A dysfunctional family, its various representatives spend a lot of time backbiting and defending their turf. But they all recognized a useful symbol when they saw one, and immediately began squabbling for Dorothy's attention like a brood of 7-year-old boys.
Dorothy, having lost a son, responded to the attention, albeit warily. When Michael Petrelis, an organizer for the voluble gay-rights group Queer Nation, called her six weeks after the murder, she was still uncomfortable with the word homosexual. Was she aware, he asked in his New Jersey honk, that gay activists were rallying around her son's cause, hoping to make him the gay Rodney King? "He scared the living daylights out of me, with his voice and all," Dorothy recalls. "There was no way he was getting me involved in no queer nations." But soon representatives of more polite groups began calling. The Human Rights Campaign Fund asked if it could fly her to a candlelight vigil in Washington. Not knowing it was a gay organization -- or that the vigil had been organized, in part, by Petrelis -- she said yes. Soon, the Campaign for Military Service, whose goal was to lift the ban on homosexuals, asked if she would sign a letter telling her story, as part of a mass-mail fund-raising effort. Yes, she said; and yes to the news conferences, the memorials, the crystal awards and sympathy plaques. After all, she brought home only $190 a week; she could never afford the kind of publicity these groups were willing to pay for. If they wanted to fly her and Kathy and Billy to some city they'd never seen, put them up in a nice hotel, pay for meals, let her say her piece, why should she refuse? It was more attention than she'd ever gotten from anyone in her life. And if they were using her only to further their aims, as some claimed, she would use them to further hers.
"I WAS LIKE A REFRIGERATOR who didn't want to be moved," Dorothy recalls of her first meeting with Jim Jennings, whom press reports, to her horror, had identified as her son's onetime lover. "I hate that word lover," she says. "And I didn't want to go. Meet all these gay people? I figured they were weird, like Klinger from 'M*A*S*H,' dressing like women, with their pinkies in the air." But Jennings had invited her to a memorial service in San Diego in honor of Allen, and Dorothy decided she had to attend. "And guess what? They were nice! None of them looked like Klinger."
In the months following Allen's death, Dorothy achieved what parents of living homosexuals often fail to, even after years of effort: an acceptance of her child's sexuality. Unfortunately, she now lives with the regret that it took a brutal murder to do it. For Allen had told her, in a phone call from San Diego long before he died, that he was gay. "I thought it was just him trying to get me," she says. "He was always doing things to drive me crazy. He sent a picture of himself in a white tux with some girl from the Philippines in a white dress and told me they got married -- he had me going for a long time with that, and it wasn't until later Kathy told me the girl was a guy. So I didn't believe him when he said he was gay. I thought if I just didn't take the bait, he'd give up. But right after, we went to Kings Island near Cincinnati, a really neat amusement park. We were in line to get on the roller coaster and this guy behind me said, 'Look at the faggot up there with the tattoos on his arms trying to make people think he's a macho man.' That really hurt me. And I didn't understand."
How could she understand? Allen looked nothing like Klinger: he was well built, handsome, with thick blond hair and blue eyes. He wore an earring, "but doesn't everyone?" Dorothy says. She ignored the incident, and over the next few years, if Allen mentioned men he liked, she didn't respond. But reading his journal, she knew she'd been wrong. The final entry, in purple ink, describes Allen's crush on a man he had met while on shore leave in Sasebo a few days before his death. Eric Underwood, who danced on Broadway in "La Cage aux Folles" and was now performing at a theme park commemorating the first Dutch settlement in Japan, was apparently everything Allen wanted. Everything except single; Underwood had a lover stateside. Still, their hours of conversation over several days left the enamored sailor feeling a bit less lonely. "I guess that means we are everywhere," he wrote, and for the last time closed his journal -- which bore on its cover a heart-shaped sticker and the legend "Be Kind to Me, I Gave Blood Today."
"TERRIBLE THINGS WENT ON on that ship," Dorothy believes. "Gay sailors being lost at sea, which really means thrown overboard." Dorothy has constructed a version of her son's last weeks aboard the Belleau Wood from the sometimes contradictory accounts of shipmates, reporters and her new gay friends. In Dorothy's mind it is better that Helvey be assigned the likely, if unprovable, motive of gay-bashing than that he have no motive at all, as the Navy seems to hold. It is better to think that Helvey was acting out a Navy-wide hatred than to think that, in essence, he acted alone.
One of Dorothy's best new friends -- and major informants -- is Eric Underwood. It was Underwood, along with two other performers at the theme park, who wrote the letter to Pacific Stars and Stripes. In his five months in Japan, he had heard plenty of stories about gay sailors being punched in the face while sleeping, or doused with lighter fluid and ignited. According to him, the Belleau Wood was the worst ship of all. "So bad," he says, "that Allen, after we talked, had a hard time going back to that environment. I'd have to coax him to the door. He said that people harassed him 24 hours a day."
The Navy says Schindler never reported any harassment, but harassed or not, he was scared. "More people are finding out about me," he wrote three weeks before he died. "You never know who will want to harm me or cease my existence." Still, in the struggle between circumspection and revelation, revelation had won. He now ate with a group of gay sailors who called themselves the Fab Five. He told the chaplain he was gay and wanted a discharge. And then, apparently desperate to announce the truth, Radioman Schindler broadcast what the Navy calls "an unauthorized statement" over the Pacific Command: "I'm too cute to be straight."
Whoever else may have heard the comment on the wide ocean, Schindler's shipmates now knew, if they hadn't before, that he was gay. One month later, he had his last talk with Underwood. Now Underwood has long talks with Dorothy instead. "She's like another mom to me," he says. Certainly she brags about him like a mother, showing visitors a photo he uses for modeling auditions. "Look at him in the bathing suit," she says a bit lubriciously. "He says he would have went for Allen." With that match impossible, Dorothy has dreamed up another: in the TV movie about her life -- now in development at Quest Entertainment -- she hopes Underwood will play her son. "He's a knockout," she says. "Blond and blue-eyed like Allen." Or, she might have added, like Helvey.
IN THE BEGINNING I wanted nothing but to go to Japan and stomp Helvey's head as he had stomped my son's, but I didn't want his mother to have to go through what I'm going through." Dorothy was speaking at the Fourth Annual Homicide Memorial, a day of sermons and singing and light politicking sponsored by the Cook County State's Attorney's office. It was a blistering day, threatening rain, but Dorothy had made the trip to Grant Park in Chicago, on the shores of Lake Michigan, because talking about her son has virtually become her profession. (Having flown only twice before Allen died, she has since racked up more than 40,000 miles.) The Salvation Army hadn't seen a full week of her since kettle-counting time at Christmas. And now that Dorothy had expanded her venues to include non-gay events, it didn't seem likely that her schedule would abate. She didn't want it to: it scared her when a week went by with no calls from the press or requests for her presence. "You need to release your anger or it can build inside you," she told the hangdog audience of survivors, who sat at picnic tables, sobbing into their soft drinks. "And if that happens, you can become something terrible. Thanks to the media, I was able to tell my anger over and over and over."
It does sometimes seem that Dorothy has only a half-dozen phrases to describe her feelings and beliefs -- phrases that roll out of her in rotation, as identical as bullets, or pills. "The Pledge of Allegiance says justice for all," goes her brief for gay civil rights, "not justice for all except homosexuals." Another favorite is: "You can mess around with a lot of things, but don't mess around with my kids!" Simplistic as they are, these unscripted formulations, expounded by a woman who calls herself "the stupidest person on earth," always hit home. Certainly no one is intimidated by her vocabulary, her manner or her attire. "If she were a New York sophisticate and wore clothes by Galanos," says Thomas Stoddard of the Campaign for Military Service, "it wouldn't have the same effect."
Ellen Meyers, who arranged for Dorothy's appearance at the memorial, puts it more bluntly. "Dorothy's spectacular," she says. "I mean, her child is dead from a hate crime. And down in Springfield she's been lobbying for the state gay-and-lesbian-rights bill. Usually we have professional queers spouting statistics, but to have a mother! And a mother from a white, working-class Republican town -- how could you beat that?"
It was hard to beat. Hearing her testimony -- "Allen was my son but he could have been the son of any of you here" -- the Judiciary Committee of the Illinois House of Representatives, wiping back tears, approved the bill for consideration on the floor, where it also passed. "It was like maybe Allen's death had finally done some good," Dorothy exulted. Two months later, however, the bill was killed by a State Senate committee.
ON MARCH 30, William Bracken, a lawyer Dorothy retained on the advice of Miriam Ben-Shalom, a lesbian veteran, filed a Federal tort claim of $8 million against the Navy for the wrongful death of Allen Schindler. Bracken likens the atmosphere aboard the Belleau Wood to "willful endangerment." The Navy, which must deny or accept the claim by Sept. 26 or risk a full-blown lawsuit, has not yet responded, though it has conducted an investigation into the "conditions and attitudes which prevailed at the time of the murder." The investigators concluded that "the ship, the command and those senior personnel responsible for the ship actively discouraged violence, threats and illegal discrimination of any type, including against homosexuals."
If the Navy nevertheless agrees to a settlement, Dorothy may find herself a rich woman. She says the TV movie, if it is made, will bring her $100,000; an agent has dangled before her the prospect of $2,000 per night on the lecture circuit. In anticipation, Kathy has urged her mother to move to a nicer house, but, planted in her armchair, glancing first at her curio cabinet crammed with dolls, then at a boomerang and a black velvet map brought back from one of Allen's adventures, Dorothy appears unable to move.
Not that she loves Chicago Heights, a woeful town of 36,000 some 30 miles from Chicago. Once, when the steel mills prospered, there was probably a good side of the tracks, but that was long ago. In any case, Dorothy lives virtually on the tracks, 50 yards from the railroad's deafening rattle. There she has tried to make a home of a grimy 100-year-old frame house that cost $10,900 in 1969 and might not fetch much more today. A rainbow banner flies from the porch; a plastic goose and a miniature windmill stand sentry in the pebbled front plot. Inside, the house hardly seems large enough for Dorothy and 18-year-old Billy to move around in, but hovel or not, it's the only house Allen knew. To leave it would erase him further. His tiny room has been preserved as it was, except for the emptying of the fish tank, the "adopting out" of the parrots and the removal of the huge cage in which Allen kept his three-foot-long monitor lizard, Junior -- named, it would seem, after himself. "Allen wanted to work in a zoo, or at Sea World," Dorothy says. "When he got home from the Navy." She spends little time in his room -- unnerved, perhaps, by the photographs of the Midway lovingly arranged on the sea-blue walls.
VISITORS ATTENDING Terry Helvey's court-martial last May at the Naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, were directed to opposite sides of a small gallery in the courtroom, as if for a wedding. On the left sat the defendant's party: Helvey's mother, Regena, and aunt Sheryl Sarchette. On the right, the victim's: Dorothy, Kathy and, not incidentally, most of the press. Separated from onlookers by a partition, Helvey and his lawyers on one side were not quite mirrored by the prosecutor and an empty seat on the other -- a seat that seemed to stand for the absent victim himself. Also absent from the ceremony were any of the many fathers, stepfathers and paternal surrogates associated with the event. Allen Schindler Sr., who according to Dorothy's sworn testimony never paid child support, took no interest in the case beyond attempting to claim half of his son's life insurance. As for Helvey, his father, a tattoo artist, had long since decamped. So had his stepfather; Regena Helvey testified at the court-martial that, among other disciplinary acts, he had forced Terry to eat his own excrement and amputated half of his left middle finger by slamming it in a door when the boy was 6.
Dorothy was painfully aware of the symmetries and asymmetries in the room. Her background was strikingly similar to Regena Helvey's: small towns, hard lives, bad men. Like Dorothy, Regena had scraped by with factory and fast-food jobs (in her case, at Kentucky Fried Chicken); she had left her son in the care of Aunt Sheryl. But Regena Helvey was clearly a different kind of woman from Dorothy; slim, almost sultry, refusing all interviews, she seemed to be trying to take up as little space on earth as possible, but to take it up attractively. Reporters were thrilled by the prospect of the mothers meeting, but Regena wasn't about to let that happen; during recesses, she rushed outdoors to smoke, making herself scarce before Dorothy lumbered into the hall. And Dorothy wasn't keen on meeting Regena, either. As the trial began and the defense outlined its intention to pin the blame on Helvey's terrible upbringing, Dorothy turned toward the reporters behind her and, only half whispering, said: "We had a bad life too, but my son wasn't a murderer."
Although the press was literally on Dorothy's side, it was hard not to sympathize with Regena Helvey and even to some extent with her son, who shaved neatly for each day of the trial, occasionally wore glasses and looked utterly bereft. When he rose to speak on the third day -- the court permitted him to make an unsworn statement -- he virtually decomposed before the jury's eyes, stuttering, crying, choking back yelps of pain, spitting out pieces of apology until, collapsing back into his seat by the window, he ducked his head under the Venetian blinds. His defense was barely more coherent: some mumbo jumbo about steroid use from a robotic psychiatrist, a photomontage of Helvey's high-school sports team, a two-hour testimonial video from his hometown. "Our little dog, who didn't like anyone, loved Terry," said a girlfriend. "Well groomed," said a minister. "Shared his pizza."
By the time the eight-officer panel began deliberations, Helvey's fate no longer seemed to be the dominant issue. Having avoided the possibility of the death penalty by pleading guilty to a lesser charge, the defense suggested a sentence of 21 years -- since, at 21, this was all of life Helvey knew. But whether 21 years or 60, his life was ruined. Something else was on trial: the American family, and all in all the proceedings did not constitute much of a vindication. Marriage had brought happiness to no one; men were "lazy rats," as Dorothy put it; mothers were left to mourn and fight and pay the consequences. Regena Helvey took the stand to corroborate the defense's contention that she had been an inadequate mother -- even admitting she had tried LSD while pregnant with Terry -- hoping that her confession would somehow mitigate his sentence. Dorothy took the stand to describe again her son's ruined body, hoping to earn Helvey a life in prison. In the end, the court-martial was indeed a kind of marriage, for the two families would forever be locked together in regret, one mother participating in her owncharacter assassination in order to save her son's life, the other reliving her son's murder over and over in order to save her own. And Helvey, if there was any justice, would spend a long time dreaming of the man he had danced upon.
THE MOTHERS, AS it turned out, did meet. Minutes after the jury sentenced Helvey to be confined for the length of his natural life, Dorothy was led into a small room where the convict was waiting behind a table. Once inside, she began screaming. He had destroyed her life. He had destroyed her family. Her 8-year-old granddaughter could not fall asleep without clutching her picture of Uncle Allen. "I'm sorry," Helvey stammered, over and over, unable to look at her directly. It was then that his mother came into the room; Helvey motioned her away, but she stayed and put her arm around his waist -- "like she really cared," says Dorothy sarcastically.
The three of them remained in the room a few more minutes, Dorothy yelling, Terry repeating his two pathetic words. Regena Helvey, perhaps aware that words are sometimes worthless, said nothing.
DOROTHY SITS IN HER chair at home, sorting through the blue nylon knapsack returned to her at the end of the trial. Inside it, her son's belongings have been stored in plastic sandwich bags, as evidence. "What kind of evidence is this?" she asks, holding up a bottle of shampoo. Also in the knapsack are keys and a checkbook, snapshots and loose change, some drawings of lizards and a pink-triangle pin with the caption "Non-Breeder." She begins to tremble. Not that Dorothy hasn't gotten what she wanted: back in Yokosuka she had been so elated that she even embraced Queer Nation's Michael Petrelis. "If there's a place in the Guinness Records for the woman kissed most by gay men, I'm it!"
She has embraced Petrelis's methods, too. She has learned the lessons of the loudmouths: without them, justice would not have been done. Having become a loudmouth herself, however, she is faced with the realization that she can never stop. She spends her days waiting for more chances to "tell her anger" -- to broadcast unauthorized statements, as Allen did. The subject doesn't matter much: how the military ban helped kill her son, how gay marriages would be beneficial. What matters is that she is at war, and will be at war, one way or another, for the rest of her life. After all, Helvey's mother still has Helvey; he might even be paroled someday. Allen is now just a bag of mementos -- another man gone.
Billy clomps into the house on a new pair of Rollerblades. Dorothy points her thumb at him. "The Navy called here trying to recruit him -- can you believe it?" she snorts. "Weeks after Allen was killed. But no way are they going to get their hands on him."
Perhaps it was once possible to think of the Navy as a substitute father for America's lost boys, but no longer. In this regard, the Navy failed Helvey as much as Schindler. In his unsworn testimony at the court-martial, Helvey said that all he had ever wanted was a family, and that the Navy, with all its "fights, typhoons and hurricane warnings," provided it. But what kind of family, Dorothy likes to ask, would reject a loving son merely for being what he is? And that's how the Navy failed Allen Schindler. He loved the Navy, and died of unrequited love; it shipped him back, an anonymous pulp, unrecognizable even to his mother, except for the insignia tattooed on his right arm -- of the U.S.S. Midway.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Galveston

BYLINE: By GEOFFREY LEAVENWORTH; GEOFFREY LEAVENWORTH is a freelance writer based in Galveston.

 BODY:
Galveston lies just 32 miles from Mission Control and the Johnson Space Center, but its towering Greek Revival palaces and abundant magnolias, oleanders and pecan trees evoke the Old South. The city -- the place is too densely populated and the structures too vertical to be called a town -- seems to have one foot in the past and one in the present.
Galveston began life as a safe haven for pirates, most notably the privateer Jean Lafitte around 1820. Confederate forces were more vulnerable -- the island was captured by Union forces in the Civil War. By the end of the 19th century, Galveston was the commercial center of the State of Texas, full of banks, cotton traders, shipping companies and merchants. A powerful hurricane, most often called the 1900 Storm, destroyed a large part of the city and killed 6,000 people. The island was rebuilt and thrived again for almost two decades after the Depression as a sanctuary for illegal gambling and other vices. 
 Galveston's misfortunes, as well as its size -- it is a narrow, 32-mile-long barrier island -- meant that its economy languished while neighboring Houston grew exponentially. However, Galveston's setbacks served to leave much of its Victorian architecture untouched. It is this large collection of buildings, including many lacy Carpenter Gothic homes, iron-front commercial buildings and abundant interpretations of Greek Revival style , that is the heart of Galveston's appeal for tourists. Juxtaposed with the historic districts are several new attractions, including a harbor development, a 10-story glass pyramid filled with tropical flora and fauna and a flashy IMAX Theater.
Galveston's readily accessible beaches also draw visitors. While river drainage and the prevailing currents of the Gulf of Mexico conspire to create brackish surf most of the year, autumn does bless the island with some days of clear blue water.
The island also has more than its share of tourist traps, unsightly motels, blighted neighborhoods and seedy buildings. But Galveston's tawdriness is often perceived as part of its charm.
 
Events
 This season marks the reopening of the Strand Street Theater, 2317 Ship's Mechanic Row, (409) 763-4591, an Actors' Equity house and a pioneer in the Strand Historic District. The theater will open its newly restored Victorian building on Oct. 7 with "The Immigrant," by Mark Harelik, running through Nov. 7. Performances on Thursday, Friday and Saturday are at 8 P.M., Sunday at 2:30 P.M. Tickets are $16, students and the elderly $14.
The Grand 1894 Opera House, (409) 765-1894, a splendid red brick pile at 2020 Postoffice Street, will open its performing arts season with national touring companies offering the musicals "Brigadoon" on Oct. 2 and "Once on This Island" on Oct. 16. Steve Allen, with Louis Nye, Bill Dana and Marilyn Maye, appears on Oct. 17. Tickets for each event are $30.
One of the most pleasant ways to spend an evening is to attend the Galveston Artwalk, a free monthly art opening held simultaneously at about a dozen galleries near the Strand. Visitors can stroll through the historic district, check out the art, eat free Brie and meet the artists. The October Artwalk is from 6 to 9 P.M. on Oct. 16. The center of activity is the Galveston Arts Center, (409) 763-2403, a nonprofit foundation with galleries in a handsome old bank building at 22d Street and the Strand. "Observations/Notations," a mixed-media exhibition of seven artists' work runs through Nov. 21.
Two festivals celebrate the influence of the island's large immigrant populations. The Octoberfest Heritage Festival, Oct. 2 and 3, will be celebrated at the Garten Verein, 27th Street and Avenue O, an octagonal dancing pavilion that served as the center of German social life in the 19th century. Food, music, dancing and crafts of various ethnic groups will be featured, and admission is free. For more information call (409) 763-5326. The Greek Festival, sponsored by the Assumption of the Virgin Mary Greek Orthodox Church, 19th and Ball Streets, offers Greek fare, gifts and entertainment on Oct. 16 and 17, noon to 8 P.M. For tickets ($2, or $8 including dinner) and information, call (409) 762-3930.
 
Sightseeing
 The Strand Historic District is the place where most visitors begin. Imposing 19th-century banks and merchant houses have been transformed into restaurants, taverns and museums that coexist with fruit markets, marine suppliers and other workaday endeavors. The Strand Visitors Center, 2016 Strand, (409) 765-7834, offers information, books and gifts. It also sells tickets for the Galveston Trolley ($2, students $1), which provides rail service between the Strand, downtown and the sea wall.
A block north of the Strand is Galveston harbor, home to the tall ship Elissa, an iron-hulled barque built in 1877 that is fully restored and open for tours. Adjacent to the tall ship is the 1991 Texas Seaport Museum at Pier 21, (409) 763-1877, with exhibits, a theater and a boat shop used for crew training and ship maintenance. The museum is open 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and tickets are $5, $4 for students. The ship will be unavailable for touring Oct. 13 to 19, because it will be plying the Gulf under full sail, usually within sight of the sea wall.
Pier 21, a waterfront development that opened early this summer, includes restaurants, a hotel, shops, a marina and a theater. Showing at the latter is "The Great Storm," an excellent multi-image documentary of the 1900 hurricane. The feature is shown on the hour 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Sunday to Thursday, until 8 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Tickets are $3.50, $2.50 for students. Information: (409) 765-7834.
Midway down the island is Moody Gardens, a vast oasis of flowers, palms and lush greenery. Its most conspicuous structure is the Rainforest Pyramid, a 110-foot-tall glass pyramid opened in March that contains more than 1,000 species of tropical plants, birds, butterflies and fish from Asia, Africa and South America. Tickets are $6. Next door is the IMAX 3-D Theater, showing "The Last Buffalo" hourly 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. and at 8 P.M. and "Behold Hawaii" at 7 and 9 P.M. Tickets are $6 and include the use of glasses to achieve the three-dimensional effect. The Colonel, a replica of a 19th-century paddlewheeler, departs daily for a one-hour cruise from Moody Gardens at 2 P.M. Tickets are $6. The 800-passenger vessel also makes dinner cruises on Saturdays at 7 P.M. ($27.50, $15 for children). For more information about Moody Gardens, call (800) 582-4673 or (409) 744-1745.
All Galveston's beaches are open to the public and access routes are marked. The city, county and state operate a variety of beach parks. For directions and information, call the Convention and Visitors Bureau, 2106 Seawall Boulevard, (409) 763-4311.
The Silk Stocking Historic District and the East End Historic District, which include some 700 historic residences representing Greek Revival, Carpenter Gothic, Queen Anne, Italianate and other architectural styles, are good places for walking and cycling. The Bishop's Palace, (409) 762-2475, a monumental Renaissance Revival fortress at 1402 Broadway, can be toured Wednesday through Monday, noon to 4 P.M. Admission is $3.50, $2 for students; children under 12 are 50 cents. Another excellent house museum is the 1890's Moody Mansion, 2618 Broadway, (409) 762-7668, where a tour and film are offered Monday through Saturday 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Sunday 1 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. Admission is $6, children $3.
 
 
Where to Stay
 For a view of the waterfront, there's Harbor House, (409) 763-3321, a new and tasteful 42-room hotel on Pier 21 in a building intended to resemble an old warehouse. Doubles are $105 and boat slips are available.
Because it is built atop a World War II artillery bunker, the San Luis, 5222 Seawall Boulevard, (409) 744-1500, has a good view of the Gulf, even when you're poolside. This is a high-rise 244-room resort. Doubles are $89 to $119.
Tucked away in the quiet Silk Stocking Historic District is the Virginia Point Inn, 2327 Avenue K, (409) 763-2450, a bed and breakfast where the five guest rooms have private sleeping porches. Doubles are $85 to $125.
Budget: With its proximity to the beach, Gaido's Seaside Inn, 3828 Seawall Boulevard, (409) 762-9625, is a particularly good value: with 108 rooms, doubles with Gulf views are $49 on weekends and $39 on weekdays; rooms without a view are less.
Luxury: The Tremont House, 2300 Ship's Mechanic Row, (409) 763-0300, is an elegant 117-room hotel one block off the Strand. The exterior dates from 1879 but the interior is entirely rebuilt with soaring ceilings, brass beds and tile and marble in the bathrooms. Doubles are $130 to $175.
 
Where to Eat
 Gaido's, 3828 Seawall Boulevard, (409) 762-9625, is a local landmark serving Gulf seafood. Charcoal-grilled red snapper ($16.50) is a favorite entree, and crab bisque, seafood gumbo and pan-grilled snapper are all excellent. Dinner for two, around $60 with a modest bottle of wine.
Nash D'Amico's Pasta and Clam Bar, 2328 Strand, (409) 763-6500, is a popular Strand spot. Seafood specials like red snapper with crabmeat and peppers are delicious ($18). Dinner for two, about $55 with wine.
For shrimp and oyster poorboys ($4.25) and cold beer on the waterfront, stop by Hill's Pier 19, 20th Street at the harbor, (409) 763-7087. Dining rooms on three levels provide views of the fleet of shrimp boats. Lunch for two, with beer, about $15.
 
Shopping
 The Strand is full of shopping opportunities and possesses an entire Victorian row devoted to factory outlets. Here are two of the more eclectic possibilities:
Hendley Market, 2010 Strand, (409) 762-2610, specializes in 19th-century Mexican retablos, religious images painted on tin. A painting of Madonna and Child ($300) looks stunning in a contemporary hand-tooled tin frame ($125). Also: antique ribbon and lace, Mexican folk art and tin pins starting at 50 cents.
Russian army jodhpurs ($9.95) and a World War II China gravy boat ($9.95) are among the finds at Colonel Bubbie's Strand Surplus Senter, 2202 Strand, (409) 762-7397. Quartered in a huge yet oddly claustrophobic Victorian warehouse, Colonel Bubbie's houses surplus goods from the armies of more than 60 countries.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: The Overview;
Arafat Arrives in U.S. to 'Make Peace'

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
After a lifetime of violent struggle for a Palestinian homeland, Yasir Arafat set foot on American soil today and expressed hope that an agreement with Israel would bring peace to the Middle East.
There was no red carpet or military brass band for Mr. Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who smiled broadly as he greeted about 70 P.L.O. officials, Arab ambassadors and Palestinian-Americans with kisses on both cheeks. 
 Banned from the United States for nearly two decades, he arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington today to visit the White House Monday for the 11 A.M. signing of an accord that will usher in Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied territories.
 
No Private Talk With Clinton
 Mr. Arafat will not have a private meeting with President Clinton, although Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel will.
But in the first formal American diplomatic contact ever with the P.L.O. leader, Edward P. Djerejian, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, shook hands with Mr. Arafat.
"Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the United States Government, I welcome you to the United States on this historic occasion which we hope will lead to peace throughout the Middle East," Mr. Djerejian said.
 
'We Can Make Peace'
 Mr. Arafat replied, "I thank you and I too am hopeful that this will lead to peace."
Mr. Arafat spoke briefly to reporters before climbing into a black limousine and leaving in a motorcade to his hotel. "We are very happy to come in this historic moment when we can make peace, a real peace," he said.
Shortly before midnight, Mr. Arafat appeared on a stairway in the lobby of the ANA Westin Hotel, where he is staying.
"This is the beginning of the future," he said in Arabic, according to a supporter who translated. Flashing a V-for-victory sign with his fingers, he told a large crowd of cheering Palestinian-Americans and a few Jews: "This is just the interim phase because the Palestinian flag will fly over Gaza and Jericho. In the end it will be on top of East Jerusalem and we will be living side-by-side with the Israelis."
After Mr. Arafat said, "This is the first time the Palestinian state has a geographic map," someone in the crowd yelled: "What about Jerusalem?"
"You will have to be patient," Mr. Arafat responded.
At another point, a person in the crowd shouted: "Arafat sold out!"
Mr. Arafat responded: "I never stopped anybody from freeing Palestine. If they thought they could do better, why didn't they?"
A few minutes later, he returned to his tightly guarded suite.
Neither Mr. Arafat nor Mr. Rabin, who left Israel for Washington this evening, will actually sign the accord. Instead, the two aging warriors will appear together as witnesses to an experiment in peace that will change the shape of the Middle East.
 
They May Shake Hands
 The general who led Israel's armies on their lightning conquest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip 26 years ago and the guerrilla leader who fought to liberate them from Israeli rule may even shake hands.
When a CNN interviewer in Jerusalem asked whether the two enemies will shake hands, Mr. Rabin said tersely, "If it will be needed."
Even though he is not signing the document himself, Mr. Rabin said, "I am behind it full-heartedly, knowing the chances, the prospects, at the same time the difficulties and the dangers in which we embark."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher was more upbeat about the handshake issue today on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," saying, "This is going to be a monumental occasion, and I expect everyone present will act as statesmen."
The agreement will actually be signed by Shimon Peres, Israel's Foreign Minister, and Mahmoud Abbas, the P.L.O. official who conducted the secret negotiations that led to the breakthrough.
Mr. Arafat's fortunes and the course of Middle East relations have been transformed since his only other visit to the United States, when he came to the United Nations in 1974, his black leather pistol holder on his hip, and said, "I come with an olive branch in one hand and a freedom fighter's gun in the other."
Although Mr. Arafat wore military fatigues and his pistol as he boarded a Moroccan Government Boeing 707 in Tunis today, he emerged wearing an olive military dress jacket and trousers, a tan open-collared shirt and his trademark black and white kaffiyeh and ascot. No pistol was visible.
Mr. Arafat had been advised by friends not to wear his pistol, and Washington informed him to come unarmed to the White House for the ceremony, a senior Administration official said. "It is a longstanding policy of the White House that firearms are not allowed," the official said. "That applies to everybody."
After the ceremony, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Rabin will meet at the White House, and Mr. Christopher will receive Mr. Arafat at the State Department.
"An awful lot of taboos are being broken in the last few days," said Mr. Christopher, whose closest encounter with Mr. Arafat was passing him in a motorcade in Alexandria, Egypt, last month. "We're all blinking our eyes at how much is new."
The White House and State Department insisted that Mr. Clinton's decision not to meet privately with Mr. Arafat was not intended to be a rebuff.
"Given our special relationship with Israel, it is natural for the President to see Rabin, a head of state with which we've had long and important relations," a senior Administration official said. "We're just beginning our dialogue with the P.L.O., and we are doing it in a dramatic way."
President Clinton, in an interview in Monday's Washington Post, called on Mr. Arafat to condemn the attacks by Palestinian militants who killed four Israelis earlier today.
Former President Jimmy Carter met with Mr. Arafat soon after he arrived at his hotel, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader and a long-time champion of the Palestinian cause, also visited him.
 
Some Hatchets Unburied
 Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin dispelled any notion that they had buried all their hatchets.
While praising the agreement before leaving Tunis, Mr. Arafat also told reporters that it would pave the way to "an independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital."
"He can forget about it," Mr. Rabin retorted when told of Mr. Arafat's prediction. He said that "Jerusalem will remain always united under Israel's sovereignty and our capital forever."
The White House went into protocol overdrive today as hundreds of bureaucrats and Secret Service agents struggled to complete arrangements for a ceremony that White House officials describe as an ever-moving target and the largest security challenge in American history.
 
3,000 Folding Chairs
 Three thousand white plastic folding chairs were positioned on the South Lawn of the White House, where the 535 members of Congress and their spouses, Cabinet members, 10 Foreign Ministers, the Washington diplomatic corps, former Presidents and Secretaries of State, leaders of American Jewish and Arab groups and other dignitaries from around the world have been invited to witness the ceremony.
Mr. Carter, who brokered the agreement that brought peace between Israel and Egypt in 1979, will attend, as will former President George Bush, whose Administration succeeded in creating a framework for peace talks that began in Madrid 22 months ago.
 
Dinner Plans Change
 The White House initially had planned to hold a black-tie dinner Monday night for about 120 people, who would have included the Israeli and Palestinian delegations and the Foreign Ministers. But Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres, who are trying to weather a political crisis at home, declined, saying their presence was needed at a Parliament session on Tuesday. That means that Mr. Arafat will be left to make his own dinner plans.
The White House dinner will now exclude the delegations and will honor the former Presidents and Secretaries of State instead, a senior Administration official said.
Before Monday's ceremony, Mr. Arafat and Mr. Abbas on the P.L.O. side and Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres on the Israeli side will sign the White House guest book before Mr. Clinton greets them in the Blue Room along with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia, co-sponsor of the American-led peace talks, Mr. Christopher, Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Carter Mr. Bush.

Chart: "Highlights of the Peace Agreement"
 The main points of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, which is to be signed in Washington today:
 
PALESTINIAN AUTONOMY
 The agreement calls for a five-year period of limited autonomy for Palestinians in the occupied territories, beginning in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Before the beginning of the third year, the two sides are to begin negotiating a permanent accord.
 
ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL
 Israeli forces are to withdraw from Palestinian areas of the Gaza Strip, from the town of Jericho, probably defined along municipal borders, and from population centers in the West Bank within four months of the signing of the agreement. The extent of the troop withdrawal, and the spheres of control between Israel and the Palestinians, are vague.
 
ELECTIONS
 Within nine months, Palestinians are to hold elections for a municipal council to oversee education, economic development, environmental protection, taxes, and social welfare.
 
SECURITY
 The Palestinians are to form a police force. Its responsibilities, including its relationship with Israeli forces, is to be determined.
 
RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES
 Disputes between Israel and Palestinians are to be settled by a joint committee, or referred to an arbitration committee if both sides agree.
 
SETTLEMENTS
 Israel is to continue to provide protection to Israeli settlers living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The agreement is vague on how Israelis will protect settlers, particularly when they are outside of their settlements.
 
REFUGEES
 The agreement provides for discussion of the method of return for the nearly 200,000 Palestinians who fled the West Bank and Gaza during the 1967 war. It does not guarantee their return, and it puts off discussion of refugees who left in 1948 until the final negotiations on a permanent accord.
 
JERUSALEM
 The future of Jerusalem, claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians as their eternal capital, was postponed until the final negotiations.
 
ECONOMIC AID
 The agreement calls for the establishment of a joint Israel-Palestinian Economic Cooperation Committee to carry out economic development programs for the Gaza Strip and West Bank.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
INDUSTRY SEES HINT OF SLOWER GROWTH IN HEALTH SPENDING

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
After years of startling increases, the growth in health spending unexpectedly appears to have relented somewhat over the last 12 months, according to unpublished data from insurance companies, employers and hospitals.
The signs of a slowdown in medical costs, which have surged by about 11 percent annually over the last five years, are scattered and too recent to show up in official national statistics. And despite new evidence of restraint, the growth remains head-turning, certainly far above the growth in total spending in the economy, which is now around 5 percent. That means health care will continue to consume an ever-greater share of the gross national product. 
 While the country has seen health spending dip temporarily before, only to resume wild growth, many health industry officials and economists say the current slowdown at least partly reflects long-term changes in the way medical care is organized, changes that are pulling down prices and boosting efficiency.
 
Advantage for Clinton
 Other factors may be the recession and self-imposed restraint on price increases by doctors, hospitals and drug companies hoping to forestall severe Federal restrictions.
If the slowdown proves lasting it would be a boon for President Clinton, in helping him keep his vow to tame a health-care dragon that is expected to consume more than $900 billion this year. The rise is driven mainly by higher prices, increased use of medical services, new technologies and the growth and aging of the population.
Federal agencies have projected that medical spending in the next several years will grow 10 percent to 15 percent annually. But the emerging data are raising questions. "What I'm seeing suggests that those projections may be unduly pessimistic," said Charles T. Bell, senior vice president of Aetna Health Plans in Hartford, who described the decline in growth within his company's health plans as several percentage points.
Still, health economists warn that medical inflation has proved to be tenacious. "I've been in the field long enough to be rather skeptical" about such short-term declines, said Daniel R. Waldo, deputy director of the Office of National Health Statistics in the Department of Health and Human Services. The most recent figures on health spending his office has are for 1991.
"But we're also on the verge of a sea change," he added. "And sea changes sometimes fool the experts."
Mr. Clinton hopes by late in the decade to bring growth in health spending in line with growth in the economy. His proposals would encourage competition among health providers and, if that fails to do the job, would impose Federal caps on insurance premiums. To the extent that health expenses are already slowing, the task should be easier, though a wide gap remains between his goal and even the most encouraging recent data.
 
Signs of a Slowdown
 But already, it appears certain that many buyers of health insurance will face less steep rate increases in the coming months than they have become accustomed to.
The signs of a slowdown come mainly from private insurance companies and employers who pay for health benefits, which collectively cover about one-third of the country's health costs. Private plans have long faced much faster price escalation than the average. This is in part because doctors and hospitals heap extra charges on the privately insured to make up for the lower payment they get for patients in the Medicaid and Medicare programs and to pay for patients without insurance at all.
Using the past as a guide, many employers who offer health benefits had budgeted spending increases of 15 percent to 18 percent for 1993, said David Wilson, chief actuary for health with Foster Higgins, a consulting firm that advises major insurers and hundreds of employers around the country.
But since early 1992, costs have instead grown at about 8 percent to 12 percent, he said, and as little as 6 percent in a few cases where workers have joined health maintenance organizations. "I think the downward trend has accelerated in the last 12 months," he added.
Many large insurers have also seen a recent, unexpected drop in claims for hospital and doctor fees and prescription drugs. Early last winter, actuaries at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New York projected that the percentage growth in benefit claims in 1993 for its one million individual and small-group contracts would be in the "mid teens," in keeping with several previous years, said Michael Blumenfeld, a company spokesman. But in the first seven months, claims have been running "roughly half that, in the high single digits."
"This should bode well for the size of rate increases for our customers," Mr. Blumenfeld said.
Aetna, a national insurer that covers 13 million people, has experienced a less steep but significant falloff in the total cost of claims since early 1992. "The decline has been consistent and gradual," Mr. Bell said. "I think it's been particularly evident over the last 9 months."
For most of its clients, the company was used to seeing annual percentage increases in claims in the "low 20's," Mr. Bell said, but over the last 18 months that has fallen to the "high teens." For the four million clients in its health maintenance organizations, percentage growth in spending that had been in the "low to mid teens" has declined to the 10 to 12 range, and in some cases lower, he said.
Prodded by insurers and squeezed by government programs, many hospitals have begun reorganizing to save money by sharing costly equipment, using cheaper drugs and shortening hospital stays. In the first three months of 1993 average hospital expenditures per patient, adjusted for the kind of care provided, rose by 6.2 percent over the same period in 1992. In recent years the growth was 8 percent to 10 percent, according to data compiled by the American Hospital Association.
"Let's be clear: we're still going up, but it's moderating quite a bit," said James Bentley, senior vice president for policy with the hospital association. "The question is whether this is long-term or a blip."
 
H.M.O.'s and a Slump
 Experts attribute the slowing to three major factors. First, with politicians and patients alike glaring at medical costs, many doctors and hospitals appear to be holding down price increases; leading drug companies have pledged publicly to do so. As Mr. Blumenfeld put it, "They all want to stay off of Hillary's list of who is responsible for high costs."
Whether these self-imposed restraints represent a lasting commitment is unclear, and there are doubters. But experts also say that a multitude of changes in the way doctors and hospitals are organized and paid, under the heading of managed care, is wringing waste from the medical system and forcing providers to be more frugal.
By 1992, 41.4 million Americans were enrolled in health maintenance organizations, and many more were in plans involving some oversight. "The world is changing to managed care and it's proving to be effective," said Mr. Bell of Aetna.
A third factor of unknown importance is the sluggish economy, which may to some degree have reduced elective medical procedures and deterred some construction by hospitals.
The recent experience of Federal medical programs, which account for 4 in 10 of the nation's health dollars, has been mixed. Medicare and Medicaid, the main programs, pay preset prices to doctors and hospitals that are already below the average in the private sector, and their short-term spending trends are less a reflection of the marketplace than of government policies.
Spending for doctors services by Medicare, which serves the elderly and disabled, has been lower than projected in the 1992 and 1993 fiscal years, for undetermined reasons. But those gains have been offset by a climb above projections in hospital bills.
Spending this year for Medicaid, the program for the poor, appears likely to come in under the projected amount, congressional analysts said, but for reasons more to do with changes in law than medical practices.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: Doctors and Insurers Say Program Would Tread Too Heavily on Their Turfs;
Cap on Premiums Is Seen as Stifling Real Competition

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
The nation's big health insurance companies, who would be central players in President Clinton's plan for overhauling the health care system, say the Administration has taken a perfectly good idea called managed competition and turned it into something more like managed condescension.
In their first reaction to a working draft of the Clinton plan, executives of leading health insurance companies said last weekend that two crucial elements of the plan -- ceilings on insurers' premiums and the powers given to the insurance purchasing groups at the center of the plan -- would leave lumbering government agencies, rather than consumers, to choose what kind of health care Americans receive. 
 Even the large companies that were expected to benefit most, like Prudential, Cigna, Aetna and Metropolitan Life, say the purchasing groups, or health alliances, as envisioned, would make real competition impossible.
 
'Wolf at Their Door'
 Such criticism of the Clinton plan is arguably self-serving, since insurers' profits depend on how much they can charge in premiums. But several experts on the subject said yesterday that the criticism reflected a concern shared by economists that excessive regulation on insurance premiums would make innovation in the entire health care marketplace impossible.
"What might happen if you have too tight a cap on insurance company premiums is that their profit margins get wiped out," said Uwe D. Reinhardt, a professor of political economy at Princeton University and a medical economist. "The whole health care sector is the biggest wolf crier you have ever seen. But every so often there is really a wolf at their door."
Paul Ellwood, a physician and health economist who is considered the father of managed competition, said he found many aspects of the plan workable and found it a good basis for discussions with Congress. But he said he, too, was troubled by the ceilings on premiums.
"What I am afraid of is that the Government becomes the market and not the public, and that ceilings on premiums set by Government will become the floor that everyone will charge," he said. "I think it is appropriate for Government set a certain date for health costs to be growing at the same rate as the rest of the economy. But this plan makes it too soon."
The health insurers' concerns were not shared throughout the industry. Spokesmen for leading providers of automobile and workers compensation insurance, including the largest, State Farm, generally praised the plan's final draft, which was disclosed Friday.
 
Corporations Divided
 The plan left other sectors of corporate America divided, as it has been for months over the effort to overhaul health care.
The National Federation of Independent Business, representing tens of thousands of small companies, many of whom do not provide health insurance for their employees, has emerged as the major opponent in the business community.
The federation is mainly opposed to the requirement that all employers would have to insure their workers. John Motley, a federation vice president, said that to offset the costs employers would have to cut wages, shrink other fringe benefits, raise prices, cut profits or do a little of each.
The National Association of Manufacturers, on the other hand, favors the Clinton proposal, with some reservations, as the best way to lower the health insurance premiums of its 12,000 members, most of whom have company policies for their workers.
Gerald Mossinghoff, the president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represents more than 100 drug companies, said he was disturbed by a provision giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services the power to deny reimbursement for a new drug by Medicaid if the price was deemed excessive. He said it would have a devastating effect on the biotechnology industry and a "chilling effect on venture capital."
The draft of the plan says the Federal Government would enforce a national health care budget by regulating the annual increase in premiums that could be charged for private health insurance. From 1994 to 2000, the President says the growth of private spending would be cut in half.
The regional health alliances, which would bargain on behalf of consumers with insurance companies and other operators of health networks, like health maintenance organizations, would decide which health plans would be offered in a form of a menu mailed out once a year.
The variety of choices, according to the theory of managed competition, would allow the public to determine which health networks provide the right combination of high quality and low price. Operators of the networks would figure out new ways to force prices down and quality up.
Wall Street analysts say that among the biggest winners under such a system of alliances would be five giant insurance companies that have invested most heavily in managed care systems, Prudential, Cigna, Aetna, Metropolitan Life and Travelers, as well as the nation's 69 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
But leading insurance executives said yesterday that certain aspects of the draft caused them great dismay.
The Administration would give the alliances the power to exclude health care networks whose proposed premiums exceeded the average of all other plans in their region by more than 20 percent. The draft also envisions that the alliances would limit annual premium increases. Beginning in 1996, the limits on increases would be that of the Consumer Price Index plus population growth and 1.5 percent. The allowable increase above the index would decline by 0.5 percent for each of the next three years.
"If you believe in the market, you believe customers will make the trade- offs between how much they will pay for quality care and how much they will be willing to go to the low-cost plan," said Michael Stocker, the president of Cigna Health Plans. "There are so many good ideas in the Clinton proposal, but this shows a fundamental distrust of the market."
 
Frozen Out of Market
 Thomas O. Pyle, the chief executive of Metropolitan Life's health care division, said the proposal would mean that plans that are initially expensive would simply be frozen out of the market and would die. But a company with a brilliant new idea for delivering care might have high capital costs in the first few years, he added, on its way to becoming the least expensive.
It could also put a chill, executives said, on investment into new managed care systems.
Mary Nell Lehnard, the senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in Washington, said the budgets of some alliances would be bigger than those of some state governments. Since the alliances would require huge Federal subsidies, he said, the temptation of Congress would be to ratchet down premium increases ever further as it struggled to reduce the Federal deficit.

NEW YORK CITY
 
AN UNUSUAL PRIMARY CAN SHAPE NOVEMBER
New York City headed into an unusual Democratic primary, the first time in decades that the battle for the Democratic mayoral nomination has been overshadowed by November's general election. As the candidates raced through last-minute appearances, campaign managers and political strategists predicted a desultory Primary Day with a turnout so low as to confound predictions in the races for Comptroller and Public Advocate, whose outcome could affect the dynamics of what is expected to be a bruising confrontation between Mayor David N. Dinkins and the Republican-Liberal candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani. A1.
 
COMPTROLLER UNDER FIRE
Two days before a Democratic primary that has emerged as the most contested race in the city, and at the end of a week in which she broke down in tears when asked to sum up her career, Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman found herself under fire from former Representative Herman Badillo and Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi in the final debate of the campaign. Questions focused on her refusal to allow the lease of an official city report on a loan to her Senate campaign. B3.
 

BADILLO: SUCCESS EVEN IN LOSING
On the final weekend before the Democratic primary, Herman Badillo can afford to feel light-footed. He is guaranteed a spot on the November ballot as part of the fusion ticket led by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for Mayor. For Mr. Badillo, there can be success even in losing if he draws loyal Democrats, the type who typically vote in the primaries, into Mr. Giuliani's fold. "We feel the better Herman Badillo does, the better it is for the whole ticket," said Mr. Giuliani, who has invested a lot of money and staff time in the Badillo campaign, hoping that it will swing Hispanic voters away from Mayor David N. Dinkins. B3.
 
WORDS, FEELINGS AND RACE
"More Than Words," the title of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's latest book, might also sum up the 1993 mayoral campaign in New York City, except that the candidates' words have been less eloquent or consistent than Mr. Cuomo's. Most of their words may prove to be much less vital in this election than the unspoken way that people feel. And some of those feelings, political observers concede, reflect the race of the voters and the candidates. Metro Matters. B2.
 
A TROUBLED FAMILY MEETS
The annual gathering of the National Baptist Convention, which brought almost 50,000 pastors and church members to New York City last week, has the mood of a gigantic family reunion. But it was a family burdened with a sense of urgency. Virtually no session or sermon at the meeting, which opened Tuesday at Madison Square Garden, passed without pleas for action on the ills troubling black America: inner-city crime, drugs, AIDS, teen-age pregnancies and unemployment. B4.
 
FATAL STABBING IN SUBWAY STATION
A man was fatally stabbed and robbed in a subway station in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Saturday night in full view of a token booth clerk and other witnesses. The Transit Police said the victim had just pocketed the winnings from video gambling games in a grocery store above the station, and his assailant had followed him into the subway. A suspect was arrested. B4.
 
REGION
 
GREAT HOPES IN WESTCHESTER
This should be a time of great expectations for the Democrats of Westchester County. As they cast their votes in the primary tomorrow, they can take comfort that they now outnumber Republicans in this traditionally Republican county. And for the first time in generations, they have a solid chance to win the county's top two posts. Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican County Executive for the last 11 years, is vulnerable. And Carl A. Vergari, the District Attorney for 25 years, is retiring. B5.
 
FIRST TROOPER CASE GOES TO TRIAL
A New York State Police investigator charged with faking evidence in two criminal cases goes on trial today in Binghamton, becoming the first of five investigators to challenge the charges in a growing scandal. Prosecutors say the investigators waited for their colleagues to identify suspects, then claimed to have found evidence linking those suspects to crime scenes, thus earning respect and praise on the job.

HEADLINE: Confusion Ruled First Tests For Asbestos, Workers Say

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
It started with a growing public panic over the dangers of asbestos -- fears that led a jumpy Congress to pass a law in 1986 requiring asbestos inspections of schools nationwide.
But the Federal rules putting the law into effect were sloppily written and confusing. And the New York City Board of Education soon made a bad situation worse, jury-rigging a plan for inspections and hiring a consulting firm with no track record in the field. 
 In the end, New York's inspection effort careered into a complete debacle, with gangs of inexperienced workers racing frantically through the city's 1,069 schools, collecting only a fraction of the asbestos samples needed and dashing off reports that turned out to be totally unreliable.
That is the picture that emerges from interviews with members of the school board's Asbestos Task Force -- none of whom have spoken publicly of their work before -- and from inspection records at several city schools and interviews with city, state and Federal officials.
 
'An Accumulation of Problems'
 "There was an accumulation of problems," said an engineer who was a member of the city's task force when it carried out the federally mandated survey. "Grab 100 people off the street, make them inspectors after a few days' training, give them no supervision, and they won't do the job right. I never felt comfortable that the work would be of good quality."
After inspections this summer turned up asbestos in buildings reported to be clean in the original surveys, Mayor David N. Dinkins on Aug. 6 ordered all the city's schools reinspected immediately. That enormous undertaking has delayed the opening of schools, disrupted the families of a million schoolchildren, cost tens of millions of dollars and further weakened public faith in the nation's largest public school system.
Some experts have questioned whether the dangers from asbestos are as critical or widespread as Congress believed when the 1986 law was passed. And other school districts nationwide have apparently also had trouble complying with the Federal regulations. A 1991 study by the Environmental Protection Agency found that nationwide, inspectors missed about 11 percent of all the asbestos in schools, and that in 82 percent of the 85,000 buildings inspected, inspectors missed at least one asbestos deposit.
Since Aug. 6, the 53 members of the Asbestos Task Force have been reassigned to temporary duties unrelated to asbestos and barred by supervisors and by their union from speaking publicly. Until now, none have.
But in recent weeks, three of them, speaking on the condition of anonymity in separate interviews, offered the first direct accounts of the original troubled effort. They said it was marred by staff discord, equipment that malfunctioned and, perhaps most important, fundamental confusion over how to carry out the inspections.
"At that time, nobody knew what they were doing," said one inspector who helped survey some 70 schools. "We had to learn everything as we went along." Investigators from six different agencies are seeking to determine whether fraud or other crimes also played a role. So far, no one has been charged. But even if the officials or consultants involved in the original inspections are found to have engaged in intentional wrongdoing, the effort was doomed from the start as error piled upon error.
 
A Challenging Inspection
 After Congress passed the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act of 1986, known as Ahera, all of the nation's 40,000 school districts were required to designate one local official to oversee a complete inventory of the asbestos in their buildings and to develop plans to eliminate hazards.
In New York City, that official was Robert Pardi, an architect from the board's division of school buildings. Appointed just months earlier to head the asbestos task force, Mr. Pardi had virtually no background with asbestos inspections and only limited administrative experience. Yet the asbestos-testing effort required him, almost overnight, to quintuple the size of his staff and to administer one of the most challenging building inspections in city history.
Mr. Pardi rejected repeated requests for an interview delivered by telephone and in person to his Long Island home in recent weeks.
In 1988 board officials signed a $1.4 million contract with a company then known as Envirosafe Corporation -- now called Envirospan Safety Corporation -- to design the survey and to train and supervise the inspectors. Envirosafe was a small asbestos-cleanup company that until then had no experience in conducting large, complex inspections. An investigator said choosing Envirosafe was like hiring a carpenter instead of an architect to draw the blueprints for a building.
In early 1988 Mr. Pardi interviewed hundreds of applicants for the inspector jobs, and hired 26 men. Most were foreign-born and unemployed, though many had training as engineers; virtually none had asbestos experience. One inspector said his starting salary was about $26,000.
 
A Five-Day Workshop
 The training came at Envirosafe's Manhattan headquarters on West 39th Street, where an official lectured for three days on sampling techniques and for two more on how to draw up plans for managing hazardous asbestos found in schools.
The training appears to have been similar to that offered to inspectors elsewhere in the country, and the Environmental Protection Agency approved the course. But some asbestos experts have questioned how well prepared inspectors certified in a five-day workshop could be.
"To come up with an asbestos inventory for a school building is a tremendously complex task," said Dwight E. Brown, a former regional coordinator in Atlanta for the Environmental Protection Agency who now runs his own asbestos consulting concern. "The suggestion that a person with a few days of training can go out and do this work is completely laughable. It ain't for novices."
In fact, the inspectors said that they learned most of their techniques on the job once the survey got under way in the summer of 1988. One inspector said his first experience came at a Manhattan high school, where he joined five other novices working under the supervision of another, slightly more experienced inspector hired weeks earlier.
 
Learning to Collect Samples
 Working through classrooms and hallways, he learned how to collect samples, using a brass core-bore and other tools to gouge or burrow into plaster, lathe or other building materials. He would patch the resulting holes with glue or duct tape once the sample was taken. The samples were put into plastic bags, labeled and sent to laboratories for analysis.
But many of the workers appeared to misunderstand the purpose of the sampling, the inspector said. Asbestos is found in hundreds of building materials, from boiler insulation to roofing tiles to the fireproofing sprayed onto ceiling ducts. Collecting samples from many of these is relatively straightforward, but plaster walls and ceilings -- where much of the asbestos is being found in the current inspection -- present complications. Just knowing where to sample, so that an accurate map of the hidden asbestos emerges, is not easy.
For decades, wall masons added asbestos to wall and ceiling plaster as a bonding agent, in concentrations that often varied widely from batch to batch. So the asbestos content of plaster at one end of a corridor wall may be well below the Federal limit of 1 percent while concentrations at the other end may be far higher. Remodeled schools pose special challenges, because although walls in old and new wings may look identical beneath a new paint job, their asbestos content may differ greatly.
 
Sampling Method Faulted
 The process is so tricky that experienced asbestos technicians recommend that any methodical inspection begin with a study of building plans and interviews with custodians or others who may know the structure's construction history.
Many Ahera inspectors, however, saw the project as a simple harvesting of samples, a member of the task force said. "They would go into a school, just grab a few rooms and take some wall samples," the task force member said. "If there was any single thing that went wrong with this program, it was the sampling method."
Part of the misunderstanding appears to have arisen from the 1987 E.P.A. regulations themselves, which required that a legal minimum of seven samples be collected from any wall, ceiling, or other surface area that was "uniform in color and texture" and was larger than 5,000 square feet. In scores of city schools, many of which have been rebuilt one or more times and may have 300,000 square feet or more of wall space, inspectors collected the legal minimum of just seven plaster wall samples, the records show.
 
Not Enough Samples
 Joseph S. Carra, a deputy director at the E.P.A., said in an interview that only a misreading of the regulations could have led to the routine collection of so few samples in such large schools. But the procedure appears to have been codified in the board's contract with Envirosafe, which set the average number of samples to be collected -- from all building materials that might contain asbestos in each school -- at just 30.
"That would be about right for Little House on the Prairie," said Bernard P. Orlan, the top asbestos expert at the School Construction Authority. In contrast, inspectors working on the authority's reinspection effort have collected as many as 300 samples in some schools.
Even those original inspectors who understood the process often had trouble, however. In each report, inspectors were supposed to pinpoint locations of the samples they took, using X-Y coordinates on a diagram. But the cheap compasses issued to them frequently didn't work. Some inspectors sought to orient themselves with street maps, and there was plenty of margin for confusion.
"A guy might call a wall north, and it might be south," one inspector said. That may explain why investigators in June found some Ahera reports in which the coordinates intersected in illogical places, even outside of buildings.
 
Insufficient Supervision
 Competent supervision might have prevented such errors, but inspectors said the project never had any. The contract required Envirosafe to "supervise (with three industrial hygienists) a thorough and complete asbestos survey of all spaces within each school building."
But Philip E. Klein, a lawyer for Envirospan Safety Corporation, the company's current name, argued that the company's responsibilities did not include supervision.
Mr. Pardi also offered little direct supervision, the inspectors said. The headquarters for the survey were set up at 49 Flatbush Extension in Brooklyn, but Mr. Pardi maintained his office at building division headquarters in Long Island City, visited the Brooklyn offices only occasionally and never went to schools, the inspectors said.
"Pardi came over sometimes," one said. "He'd stop by the office to lend us some support, to tell us we were doing a good job."
The inspectors said it was difficult to tell who was in charge at the Ahera offices during much of the project, partly because of staff turnover. The top Envirosafe official at the Brooklyn offices quit in a salary dispute before the project was finished, the inspectors said, and Mr. Pardi's top aide was often absent, caring for an ailing wife.
The last months of the project were dominated by a frantic rush to meet the May 1989 deadline. Inspection crews worked 14-hour days for several months, earning tremendous amounts of overtime. Entire high schools, with 300 or more rooms, were "inspected" in as little as one day.
"There was panic," one task force member recalled. "Everybody was running like crazy."
The enormousness of the current reinspection effort has raised concerns that errors made during the original survey could be repeated. But Meyer S. Frucher, a trustee of the School Construction Authority, the state agency leading it, said: "We too are working under extraordinary pressure, but we've thrown enormous resources into this up front, and we have built major quality controls into our process."

HEADLINE: A Killer in Law School: Admirable or Abominable?

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEMPE, Ariz., Sept. 10

 BODY:
If ever there was a model prisoner it was James J. Hamm, who mortally shot a man during a drug deal in 1974, pleaded guilty against the advice of his lawyer and spent the next 18 years in state prison "shaken to my moral core and determined to build a new way of looking at myself and the world."
While others lifted weights and fashioned zip guns, Mr. Hamm studied Jungian psychology, sociology and Taoism. He enrolled in stress management classes and meditation groups and every other self-improvement program the Department of Corrections had to offer. 
 He earned a summa cum laude college degree while in prison, passed the law boards with a score in the top 4 percent and won the admiration of professors who count him among their best students ever and guards who had never urged early release for anyone else before or since.
Now, a year after his life sentence was commuted, Mr. Hamm, 45, is a first-year law student at Arizona State University, an exemplar to some and an abomination to others. And his presence at the College of Law here has stirred a debate about whether a convicted first-degree murderer has any right to attend a tax-supported law school or has any real hope of admission to the state bar.
But the debate is less about Mr. Hamm's worthiness, experts say, than about America's frustration with the criminal justice system and ambivalence regarding crime and punishment, vengeance and mercy.
Mr. Hamm is a "lightning rod" for these issues, said John M. Johnson, a professor of justice studies at the university here, who taught Mr. Hamm inside the prison a decade ago. And the case, he said, "reflects a millenium-old conflict in our culture, between the idea of unforgiving punishment as expressed in the Old Testament and the hope of rebirth as expressed in the New Testament."
 
What Should Society Do?
 Mr. Hamm is composed amid the clamor and convinced that his situation is raising important questions.
"What does our society want to do with people who have served their sentences?" he asked. "Do we block them and frustrate them? And what about rehabilitation? Do we believe in it? And how do we accomplish it?"
Arizona, like all but six other states, does not bar convicted felons, murderers among them, from admission to the bar. But they face a higher-than-average hurdle when they go before the Character and Fitness Committee.
"I understand up front I'll have a more difficult time meeting their standard, but I'm not daunted by that at all," said Mr. Hamm, who cannot vote, own a gun or work as a stockbroker or a barber in Arizona because he is a felon on lifetime parole. "And if I can't be a lawyer I'll do something else, because what I'm about now is doing something with my life."
A half-dozen convicted felons are members of the Arizona bar, officials say, although none are murderers. But even murderers practice law elsewhere, one of them before the Federal bar in the District of Columbia.
Mr. Hamm's record, including a 3.964 grade-point average, won him admission here, one of 161 first-year students chosen from 2,300 applications. "He had every right to apply to our law school and then every right to a meaningful consideration of his application," said the law school dean, Richard J. Morgan.
 
A 'Kinky Candidate'
 Several legislators and editorial writers in Arizona disagreed. John Greene, the president of the State Senate and a proponent of capital punishment, argued that Mr. Hamm's "precious seat should go to one of the thousands of applicants who didn't shoot somebody in the head." And The Phoenix Gazette complained in an editorial about "liberal academics" who considered it a "dangerous thrill" to admit a "kinky candidate" like Mr. Hamm.
Since Mr. Hamm's admission, Dean Morgan has faced threats from some top legislators that the law school, one of two in the Arizona system, might lose its annual $4 million in state financing or even be closed. And the dean has agreed to review admission policies regarding convicted felons, although he said he did not expect them to be disqualified.
Mr. Hamm did not hide his past on his application, which he larded with references to his time behind bars, citing awards for tutoring other prisoners and work as an inmate legal assistant. "I don't want to put it behind me," he said. "I want to bring it with me. It's who I am, the foundation on which my personality is based."
In the application, Mr. Hamm also highlighted the half dozen lawsuits against the Department of Corrections that he has researched, filed and won along with his wife of five years, Donna Leone Hamm. Mrs. Hamm is a former justice of the peace here, who met her husband during a prison tour and founded an organization that provides legal advice and counseling to inmates and their families.
Over the several years that the two courted in the prison's visiting room, Mr. Hamm told his wife-to-be of his Kansas childhood: his eight siblings; his father, an itinerant wheat cutter, and his mother, who dominated the family and whose death sent him reeling toward an emotional breakdown.
He told her of his time in Bible college, where he was indifferent about academics and later lost his faith, and of his brief, failed first marriage. He told her how he drifted out to Arizona, unemployed and irresponsible, and wound up dealing $10 bags of marijuana to college students in Tucson.
 
A Story of a Murder
 And he told her about the Saturday in September nearly two decades ago when he crossed the line from being a small-time drug dealer, who spent most of his days stoned, to a murderer who agreed to help an acquaintance rob two young men of $1,400 by luring them into a bogus drug deal.
The two victims were in the front seat of the car and the two gunmen in the back as they drove out to the barren reaches of the city. "I wanted to tell them to stop the car so I could get out, and just run away, but I'd open my mouth and nothing would come out," Mr. Hamm said.
The car grew thick with tension as it became clear that no drugs would change hands, Mr. Hamm said. In the back seat beside him, his acquaintance drew his semiautomatic pistol. Mesmerized, Mr. Hamm watched his own hand pull a .38-caliber revolver from inside his shirt. "In the next three seconds, many shots were fired," he said. "Many, many shots."
The racket of bullets deafened him and he felt "like a stick of dynamite had gone off in my mind." He remembers firing the gun but not deciding to fire it. He killed the driver with two quick bullets to the head. The other gunman, who remains in prison, wounded the second young man, then chased him from the car and finished him off in the desert.
Mr. Hamm said the horror of what he had done "shook my mental house down." He now says he had a nervous breakdown that expressed itself in "a criminal context because of the life I was living."
But he never considered an insanity plea, Mr. Hamm said, because only by acknowledging his guilt could he begin the process of self-discovery and perhaps redemption.
"This was not a legal issue to me," he said. "I had to find some meaning for the death I caused. I can only pay in the coin I have. My acts have been acts of atonement and will be for the rest of my life."
 
A Life of Self-Control
 This is the story that Mr. Hamm now tells his fellow law students, who have welcomed him. They are tentatively coming to know the soft-spoken man in their midst who does not have the tattoos or bulging muscles they expected of an ex-prisoner.
"When you hear him talk about how he feels about what he did, how it pretty much crumbled who he was, it's hard to put that together with the picture of a hardened killer," said Richard Traulsen, student body president at the law school.
Having once lost control so completely, Mr. Hamm now minds his every move. His wife describes him as "excessively meticulous," a man who mows the lawn as if his life depended on each and every blade of grass, who never fails to take his shoes off before putting his feet on the coffee table.
"I'm not dangerous today because I pay attention to what's happening in my life and my psyche," Mr. Hamm said, comparing himself to the brimming serving of iced tea in front of him. "It's like emptying the glass at the right time so it doesn't overflow."
Mr. Hamm agrees that in the annals of crime, punishment and rehabilitation he is special because he had the intellect and resourcefulness to make the most of his opportunities in prison. But he insists he is not alone.
"There are many people in prison who swim against the tide," Mr. Hamm said. "What's unusual is how far upstream I was able to swim, with the help of others."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: Jordan;
Jordan and Israel in Accord On Agenda for Negotiations

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Senior officials in Jordan have for the first time outlined the basis of planned negotiations with Israel in a detailed agenda that has been approved by both countries.
The agenda is the first step toward the establishment of diplomatic relations and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, according to a draft copy of the document obtained in Amman. 
 The final document, which will not be made public until Tuesday but bears a close resemblance to the draft, senior Government officials say, will be formally accepted by the Israelis and the Jordanians after the White House meeting between Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian Liberation Organization chairman, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Jordanian officials said that the country's delegation to Mideast peace talks in Washington would not sign any document with Israeli officials. They did say that the Jordanian delegation might be allowed to initial the agenda with their Israeli counterparts.
 
Officials 'Optimistic'
 The agenda calls for a series of agreements on water resources, boundary disputes, the plight of the 1.5 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, and the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction.
Jordanian officials said they and the Israelis had delayed endorsing the agenda for several months until the Palestinians and Israelis concluded their own agreement.
These officials said they were "optimistic" about resolving the outstanding issues, but cautioned that it would take two or three years to bring about peace between the two neighboring countries for the first time in 45 years.
Any actual peace treaty, they said, would be signed only after the Palestinians had complete sovereignty over the territory they controlled in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
But senior Jordanian officials, while disconcerted about being left out of the secret Israeli-Palestinian talks in Norway, said that the direct talks between the P.L.O. and Israel would allow Jordan to push ahead, unencumbered by the Palestinians, to resolve a series of bilateral issues with Israel. The Palestinian representatives to the formal talks were part of the Jordanian delegation.
 
'The Toughest Issue'
 "The Israeli-Palestinian agreement is a tremendous breakthrough which will leave Jordan freer of Palestinian constraint in its policy making," said Crown Prince Hassan, the brother of King Hussein and heir to the throne. "I say this because we have held the agenda for up to a year now."
Jordanian officials said the most difficult dispute facing the two countries was the repatriation of the 1.5 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan.
"The toughest issue will be the status of the refugees," Jowad al-Anani, the Minister of State for the Prime Minister's office, said today. "The Israelis see the option of allowing the refugees to go back to Israel, to live under Israeli rule, as suicidal."
But Jordanian officials insist that they cannot be expected to continue to absorb the cost of housing and maintaining such a huge refugee population. They say that any bilateral agreement must contain some solution to the problem, especially for the one million or so Palestinians and their descendants who left homes inside Israel after the 1948 war.
"Jordan is not simply a host country for Palestinian refugees," the Crown Prince said on Saturday, seated in a small office in the palace. "We have absorbed the effect of three waves of migration and our economic and social development has been shaped by the conflict. The question of the future of Jordan's demography is a question of the future of Jordan's sovereignty."
 
'A Very Thorny Issue'
 There are other difficult issues that must be hammered out between the Israelis and Jordanians, including the Dimona nuclear power plant near the Jordanian border, the refusal to allow Jordanian exports into the occupied territories, the allocation of scarce water resources and the final demarcation of the common frontier.
"There are two or three security dimensions," Mr. Anani said. "We have to prevent infiltration across the border, discuss the positioning of troops and not intervene in each other's business. Jordan will also raise a very thorny issue as far as Israel is concerned, and that is the Dimona nuclear reactor, which is near the Jordanian border. We do not want another Chernobyl."
The Jordanians say the Israelis, however, insist that the reactor is part of Israel's defense program, established to counter a threat from countries that have advanced nuclear weapons programs, like Iraq and Iran.
"When you talk about nuclear or mass destruction weapons that Israel is producing, the Israelis expand the geographical configuration where Israeli security is concerned," Mr. Anani said. "It spreads up to Turkey and Iran and Iraq."
 
Water a Big Issue
 The Israelis and Jordanians are working on a formula that would resolve the issue by agreeing to work together to make the Middle East free of nuclear weapons of mass destruction, a Jordanian official said.
The issue of water is especially important to Jordan. The country of four million has a water shortage and has had to introduce rationing. But Jordanian officials involved in the talks said they believe that the Israelis appeared ready to accept Jordanian demands.
"I don't think we should have a great problem," Mr. Anani said, "if the Israelis are intent on solving that issue. We have agreed on the items to discuss, but we have differences over the priorities. The Israelis want to talk about regional water projects, to replenish resources, which are not going to be sufficient, given the water supply and the needs of the future. Then they want to talk about rightful riparian shares, but we insist that we should settle the issue of riparian shares first."
Finally, the Jordanians say they will call on Israel to allow them to export Jordanian products to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices, Plunging, May Not Have Hit Bottom

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 12

 BODY:
A steady drop in the demand for fuel and energy around the world, combined with record high oil production in the North Sea as well as by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has pushed world oil prices down to the lowest level in three years, and many experts predict that prices may fall to a low not seen since the oil price collapse of 1986.
Since June, oil prices have dropped more than $3 a barrel, bringing the average price late last week to about $15.50 a barrel on spot markets in London and about $16.75 a barrel in the United States. 
 Industry executives and analysts say oil markets are so flooded with oil that prices might slide to about $10 a barrel in the next few months, around the low point of the mid-80's, presenting the industrial economies with a welcomed lift and consumers around the world with a windfall.
For consumers, the drop in oil prices has brought unexpected benefits. Gasoline prices have fallen to less than a dollar a gallon in some parts of the United States this summer, though in a survey taken at about 10,000 stations on Sept. 10, the price of regular unleaded gas at self-service pumps was $106.7 a gallon, according to The Lundberg Letter, which tracks prices.
 
The Past as a Guide
 Seven years ago, when oil prices were falling, the biggest beneficiaries were the industrialized nations -- nearly all of them major oil importers. If the past is any guide, lower oil prices will aid economic growth, which could give a definite lift to the weak economies in Europe and Japan and coax along the fledgling recoveries in the United States and Britain. And since energy costs are a large component of a range of goods -- from food to machinery -- lower oil prices generally hold down inflationary pressures.
And for some fuel-dependent industries, like airlines, lower oil prices have meant that fuel costs have remained at last year's level, slightly lower than had been expected.
Aviation fuel is a comparative bargain. From a systemwide average of $1.14 a gallon in October 1990, in the months leading to the Persian Gulf war, it fell steadily soon after. American Airlines said it paid an average of 77 cents a gallon in 1990, 68 cents a gallon in 1991 and 62.5 cents last year. The price has remained in the low 60's this year.
"That's a penny or two a gallon lower than we expected in 1993," said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American. He attributed the lower-than-expected price to the inability of OPEC to maintain production quotas and downward pressure on oil prices from Iraq's eagerness to export oil again.
But lower oil prices have brought problems to OPEC producers, including Saudi Arabia, the largest in the world, and Kuwait. In terms of the dollar's purchasing power today, OPEC is now collecting less than it did in 1973 from its oil sales. The current price is also far below the OPEC target of $21 a barrel.
With oil revenues shrinking steadily, the Saudi and Kuwaiti economies have gone into deficit spending that will probably get worse, experts predict, forcing hard choices like slashing welfare spending, arms purchases and foreign aid.
Poorer OPEC countries like Venezuela, a main OPEC member, have gone through significant political turmoil in the last year because of economic depression stemming from lower oil revenues. Similarly, Nigeria, which is in a severe political crisis, as well as Iran, Libya and Algeria, all of which have economies that are largely dependent on oil revenues, are coping with severe budgetary problems.
"The situation is very grave" for OPEC countries, said Waleed Khadouri, the executive editor of the Middle East Economic Survey, an influential oil industry newsletter based in Nicosia, Cyprus.
 
'Apocalyptic Terms'
 "In real terms, oil prices today are comparable, or lower, than their level 20 years ago which means virtually all of the OPEC producers are much poorer today than they have been in decades," he added. "People in the industry are speaking of the situation in apocalyptic terms, worried about a drop in prices to $10 a barrel if this chaotic situation goes on unchecked."
In Mexico, which is not an OPEC member, the drop in prices has further slowed an already weakened economy. Crude oil accounts for 30 percent of exports and 20 percent of all federal revenues in the country.
Oil affairs experts said these developments in the last year had pushed prices lower:
*Oil production in the North Sea is climbing beyond expectations, with many industry executives saying that Britain and Norway, which are the principal North Sea producers, are expected to pump 5.3 million barrels a day in Western Europe's primary oilfields. That is a million barrels a day -- or 23 percent -- more than last year, and far more than oil analysts had expected the North Sea would produce. A few years ago, the experts expected the North Sea would produce about 3 million barrels a day.
*Economic recession in Europe, the United States and Japan continues to push demand lower. The International Energy Agency, the Western watchdog on energy matters, recently cut its forecasts of global oil demand by 300,000 barrels a day over the next month, setting world oil consumption at 66.9 million barrels a day at a time when usage was widely expected to rise. Among other things, the once robust demand for oil in Asia has slowed substantially, and the depressed economies of the countries of the former Soviet Union are cutting their consumption and increasing exportable amounts of their oil.
*The production discipline of OPEC, never exemplary, has gone awry. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Nigeria, and the United Arab Emirates have entered into a virtual war over production, with each denying that it was selling oil at a discount to generate income. That has raised the possibility that the oil group, which has always suffered from an inability to police itself, is on the verge of losing more members. Last year Ecuador quit OPEC, and there is speculation that more members are set to follow.
*Iraq, with a potential to pump as much as two million barrels a day immediately, is widely expected to finally agree to export oil under the rules of the United Nations, a move that would add to the worldwide oil surplus.
 
Severe Dip Expected
 Oil prices are certain to take their most severe dip this year, experts say, if the bickering 12 members of OPEC fail in their meeting, scheduled for Sept. 25 in Vienna, to stem their production of 25 million barrels a day. That is at least 1.5 million barrels a day above the ceiling the group had set, and most experts said they saw little or no chance of any credible OPEC accords.
"OPEC is dysfunctional now, and the market has lost its respect for its ability to control world oil prices," Gary Ross, the chief executive of Petroleum Industry Research Associates in New York, said in a recent telephone conversation. "The problem is that no one else controls prices either except supply and demand."
He added: "Right now and into the foreseeable future, demand will be too little."
 
A Cut in Income
 Experts like Mr. Khadouri, the editor, and others estimated that each dollar drop in the price of a barrel of oil represented a cut in the income of the 12 OPEC members of $10 billion a year. Since June, oil prices have dropped about $3 a barrel, making the total loss in revenues so far this year close to $30 billion.
Worse for the oil producers, experts said, was that with more crude oil production set to enter world markets from Western Europe, the former Soviet Union and new producers like Oman, Yemen and Colombia, the general outlook was for the cheapest oil prices in several decades.
"The outlook is awful," said Peter Gignoux, the head of the London energy trading desk at Smith Barney Shearson. "This is OPEC's worst crisis. We are moving closer to the dance floor." .
Still, some oil industry executives and analysts are not too perturbed by the falling price of crude and the possibility that there will be a surplus of oil. There is also the view that the different factions in OPEC will find a way to agree on production quotas if the price of crude begins to fall well below $15 a barrel.
 
Unexpected Consumer Benefits
 For consumers, the drop in oil prices has brought unexpected benefits, allowing Western Europe to maximize the taxes it charges on oil exports without upsetting its consumers and giving industrial states, including the United States and China, the cheapest fuel prices in two decades.
Despite historically low oil prices in the past decade, production in difficult fields like those beneath the North Sea has kept growing. New technologies have been found to drill deeper and better beneath the seas. Also, technologies are improving production in jungles, mountain regions and other areas once thought too troublesome.
The North Sea's prodigious production has defied all predictions of a decade ago when many experts estimated that its producing years would be over by now. Instead, production there has increased by more than 25 percent over expectations, giving Europe a principal and less costly source of oil nearby.

Rewriting Rules for Book Sales

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
To understand something of the sea change taking place in bookselling across the country, it helps to visit the flagship store of Kroch's & Brentano's, Chicago's proud old bookstore chain, and take a look down the street.
There, on a corner in the heart of the downtown Loop, sits the new age of bookselling, a six-month-old Crown Books superstore that offers a dizzying number of titles, a no-frills feel and, most important, steep discounts on every book. "If you paid full price, you didn't buy it at Crown," is the chain's motto, and that was exactly why 33-year-old Margaret Geary of Chicago was in the store looking for a computer book recently. 
 Ms. Geary knew that Kroch's & Brentano's had closed half of its 20 stores, citing changing consumer habits and too-strong competition from national chains. "I feel bad for Kroch's because they've been around for so long," she said. "But do I feel bad about shopping here instead? No, because I want to save money."
 
A Battle for the Future
 What is happening, here and around the country, is a full-scale war over the future of bookselling -- not just over where books are sold, but very possibly over how they are published, distributed and marketed. On one side are the independent bookstores, many founded years ago by people who always seemed to know more about books than about business and who intimately understood their customers' tastes. On the other are the national chains, which offer discounts, coffee bars and reading nooks but which, in the minds of independents, care more about profits than books.
It isn't just Crown that is threatening Kroch's. Virtually every major national bookstore chain has muscled into the Chicago market, blanketing its downtown and suburbs with names like Barnes & Noble, B. Dalton, Waldenbooks, Borders and even Waterstone's, a British chain. Many new stores are superstores, which can offer more than 100,000 titles.
"I think many independents are going to find it difficult to compete with the superstores," said Walter Loeb, a retail consultant in New York. "Many of them don't have the assortment and the buying power to compete, and they're going to go out of business."
 
'The Nature of the Beast'
 The independents may hiss "predator," but Glenn E. Hemmerle, the chairman and chief executive of Crown Books, says, "We're a free-market economy; that's the nature of the beast." At the booksellers' annual convention in May, he said, he " listened carefully to the pleas and the emotional statements and the hand-wringing and the 'woe is me' attitude, and I came away thinking that if they all took the same energy and effort and emotion and put it into running their business, they'd be much better off."
Strategies vary from chain to chain, with Barnes & Noble promising that each of its stores will reflect its community and Crown seeking a McDonald's-like uniformity from store to store. But all the major chains have moved decisively, taking the example of retailers in industries like home furnishings and toys to open one-stop shopping behemoths.
Barnes & Noble, which recently announced plans for a stock offering, has opened 170 superstores and plans to open 40 this year and 75 more in each of the next three years. Crown expects to have 70 superstores by the end of January, and Borders, owned by the Kmart Corporation, plans to open 45 superstores by the end of 1993 and 25 more next year.
 
Sales Increase Cited
 Can the book-buying public, whose purchases have held relatively steady over the last five years, support a marketplace that has expanded so drastically?
Leonard Riggio, chairman and chief executive of Barnes & Noble Bookstores Inc., cites an industry study showing that book sales increased 5 percent from 1991 to 1992. "The market is expanding dramatically," he said, and "you're going to see significantly greater numbers for book sales in the next few years. We're entering what you could call the golden age of bookselling in the 1990's, where people are finding ever more interesting ways to be competitive."
But many independent booksellers say oratory about healthy competition and market forces ignores the values at the core of bookselling: a love of books and an understanding that owning a bookstore is often an idiosyncratic and highly personal venture.
"Books have gone the way of toothpaste -- who can sell more for less," said Adam Brent, whose father founded Stuart Brent Books on Michigan Avenue here. Its walls are covered with photographs of Mr. Brent, now 81, with literary figures and friends like Saul Bellow, Bennett Cerf and Studs Terkel. "You can have everything you want in the world, but if you don't have someone telling you, 'This is a really good book,' or 'This is terrible,' then you're only buying inventory."
 
A Move to Mass Appeal
 Mr. Brent and other independents say that if the chains killmany of them off, publishers will change the kind of books they publish, focusing more on lower-common-denominator best sellers and ignoring books with limited, but worthwhile, appeal.
"The long-term question that gets raised by all this is what might happen in a book business that is dominated by a handful of people," said Charles Robinson, president of the American Booksellers Association and the owner of an independent store in Bellingham, Wash.
Many publishers, of course, say that they will go on publishing what they like, that the chains have no more power than before and that the effect of the expanded marketplace has been only positive.
"I've been in publishing for over 30 years and I've heard the same concerns expressed in several different generational folds," said Bruce Harris, president of trade sales and marketing for Random House Inc. "There's sometimes a very elitist view of all this that I find very pernicious. It's hard to think of what everything would be like if we didn't have some of these chains moving in and opening up bookstores and reaching out to new readers."
But independents say the chains cannot match their passion for books.
"I think the chains have stolen or borrowed the whole concept of the independent bookstore," said Lucy Moynihan, one of three main buyers at Kroch's & Brentano's. "They've learned the style, they've learned the buzzwords, they have the newsletters and the readings. But it's a marketing ploy. They don't really hand-sell books, and a lot of the books many of us love have to be hand-sold."
 
Competition Seen as Unfair

Many independents feel they are victims of unfair competition. The chains, which buy books in bulk, qualify for enormous discounts and other financial incentives, like cooperative advertising, from publishers.
Small publishers have the same concerns, fearing that if they lose the independent stores, they lose their books' natural champions.
"I really think that the chains are reaching out and serving readers that might not be reached by the independents," said Catherine Fry, the assistant director and marketing manager at Louisiana State University Press. "But I've been here for 15 years, and my experience has been that independent booksellers take the time to read galleys from small presses and university presses. They cultivate their customers and they know which ones appreciate serious works such as literary fiction or scholarly books."
Still, the most successful independents say the competition might actually end up helping them; they may be forced to streamline their operations and to play to their strengths: organizing readings, aggressively promoting the books they love and finding new ways to woo customers.
"We get much more involved with a customer, instead of just saying, 'Here's the rack; help yourself,' " said Mitch Brown, the general manager of Kramerbooks and afterwords, an independent store in Washington. He said sales had increased 10 percent since Crown's opened a superstore nearby last April.
Instead of discounting and displaying separately the books on the New York Times best-seller list, as many chains do, Kramerbooks gives better display to its customers' and employees' favorites. "We pride ourselves on not having to consult the computer if a customer asks about a title," Mr. Brown said. "We'd rather sell 1,000 separate titles than 1,000 copies of the same book."

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Return Signals Revival for Argentina

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Fifteen years ago General Motors left Argentina, fed up with coups, military governments and economic policies that produced only inflation and instability. For Argentina, the closing of G.M.'s two plants was more than just the departure of a giant foreign corporation. It symbolized industrial descent, a country abandoned by most international businesses.
But things change, and G.M. has now come back to Argentina. 
 Last month, President Carlos Saul Menem signed an agreement reopening the country's doors to the world's largest car maker. In a joint venture with Cidea, the local assembler and distributor of Renault cars, a $100 million plant is scheduled to start production of G.M. pickup trucks next year, eventually producing 25,000 a year.
And just as G.M.'s departure in 1978 was an emblem for Argentina's breakdown, the company's return is a sign of revival, a signal that rejuvenating policies -- open markets, low inflation, stable currencies and sales of state-run enterprises -- are here to stay.
"This is an international vote of confidence of enormous proportions, to have the world's leading industrial company come to Argentina," said Manuel F. Antelo, president of Cidea. "This without a doubt will lead to other companies' following General Motors to Argentina."
Though G.M.'s initial investment here is tiny compared with the billions the company pours into new models in the United States, Latin American sales are nevertheless creating profits at a time when the car makers are struggling to be profitable in their largest markets.
Latin sales are exploding. In 1990, fewer than 100,000 cars were sold in Argentina. Then came President Menem's economic changes and a lowering of import tariffs. Car sales rose 40 percent in 1991, then doubled in 1992 and are up 40 percent this year. Auto executives estimate sales in 1993 of almost 400,000.
Throughout Latin America the same kind of statistics are seen as these economies grow at rates faster than those of the developed countries. In Colombia, car sales will double this year. In Venezuela, they have risen 80 percent in the last two years. And in Brazil, car sales are up 50 percent this year and may reach a record 1.2 million. Some analysts are saying that sales throughout Latin America could surpass the record of 2.4 million cars and trucks set in 1980.
"If you look around the world, where are the tremendous growth opportunities?" said Steven T. Darch, general director of the Banco Mariva in Buenos Aires. "One of the few places is Latin America."
Now there is a rush of manufacturers from South Korea, Japan, Europe and the United States into these countries to get a piece of the market.
On the same day that G.M.'s return to Argentina was signed by President Menem, Mazda also signed contracts with the Menem Government to set up a $35 million pickup assembly plant. Industry executives here say unofficially that Chrysler and Honda are looking to set up operations as well.
Volkswagen has established a joint venture with Ford Motor called Autolatina. And in Peru, the South Korean company Daiwoo has announced plans to build an auto assembly plant with a capacity to produce 20,000 vehicles a year, primarily for export.
"If you are an auto maker operating in the United States, every bit of new market share you win is at the expense of another company, which means costly competition," said Leo Kunigk, president of General Motors of Argentina. "Here you can come in and capture market share and profits, and not have to take it away from anyone. The region is one of the top 10 markets in the world, and G.M. cannot afford not to be in all of those markets."
Another drawing point is that union militancy has significantly diminished here. When General Motors left in 1978, the cost of shutting down the two plants was extremely costly, in large part for severance pay to production workers.
Beginning next year, General Motors plans to begin production in a converted warehouse that now stores spare parts for Cidea. Of the $100 million investment, G.M. will put up $80 million and Cidea $20 million. The factory will produce Chevrolet pickup trucks selling for about $22,000.
Full production of 25,000 trucks a year will be reached by 1996, Mr. Kunigk said, adding that G.M. chose to form a joint venture because it meant it could start producing cars much faster.
 
Getting in at the Start
 "From a stand-alone approach, it takes too much effort and time to produce locally here," Mr. Kunigk said. "Things are moving so fast in this market that we felt that if we didn't get in now, it would be too late to get in without a big fight."
Mr. Kunigk says the relatively small number of vehicles that the plant will turn out does not justify a high degree of automation, but part of that lack of automation will be compensated by the high level of education in the Argentine work force, compared with that in other Latin American countries.
While G.M.'s entry is significant to Argentina, there are even wider implications for South America, particularly for the free-trade zone called Mercosur that is being negotiated by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
Though economists and politicians at times question whether a true barrier-free regional market will be created, the plan of the four Governments is akin to the North American Free Trade Agreement, with only minimal trade barriers and effective free flow of goods.
Economists note that Mercosur, scheduled to go into full effect in early 1995, will be a market of 200 million people.
 
Trade Zone Is Centerpiece
 Mr. Kunigk said Mercosur was at the center of G.M.'s plan to move all its pickup truck operations from Brazil and center them in the central Argentine city of Cordoba, some 450 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. From Argentina it will ship trucks duty free to Brazil and from Brazil it will send passenger cars duty free to Argentina.
Though many companies have been preparing for the opening of Mercosur, G.M.'s actions are seen as among the most important signals yet sent to the governments and markets that such a regional free-trade zone has the confidence of the world business community.
"We may be one of the events that makes Mercosur happen," Mr. Kunigk said.
And for Argentina, the added 500 jobs the plant will produce are only part of the benefit. Last week, Cidea signed an agreement with E.D.S., the computer services company of General Motors, to handle Cidea's technology and information systems.
Also, according to Mr. Antelo of Cidea, the company is planning on bringing in the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the auto maker's financial subsidiary, to provide credit to auto buyers.
 
'Broad Ripple Effects'
 "These are arrivals of very important companies in the country that will have broad ripple effects," Mr. Antelo said. "These not only bring in more jobs, but add to modernization of Argentine business."
He estimated that while the current market was for 400,000 cars and light trucks a year, it could easily reach 500,000 or more. For one thing, the average life of a car in Argentina is 10 years, compared with 6 to 7 years in the United States. There has been no real financing of auto purchases. And demand is now so high car buyers have to wait months for delivery.
Amid the rosy projections, Mr. Kunigk concedes there may be some risks, like the collapse of Mercosur and a return to a form of political instability of the past.
"If Mercosur fails, there will be some sort of alternative program of free trade put in place, and there is less political risk than before," he said. "I would say they are minor risks, compared with the potential of this market."

HEADLINE: As Mayor of 20 Years Retires, Detroit Faces a New Kind of Election

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Detroit voters go to the polls on Tuesday in the first round of a nonpartisan Mayoral election that all 23 candidates seem to agree is this troubled city's most interesting and important contest in two decades.
Not coincidentally, it is also the first time since 1969 that the incumbent, Coleman A. Young, will not be on the ballot. Battling emphysema and declining political support, Mr. Young, 75, who built a powerful political machine in 20 years as Mayor, announced on the very last filing day, June 22, that he would not seek a sixth four-year term in the office he first won in 1973. 
 His retirement ends an era in which Detroit politics had been overwhelmingly dominated by the Mayor, and in which most of the levers of power came to be controlled by blacks, who now make up 76 percent of the city's population of one million.
But most of Mr. Young's years have also been grim ones for the city. The auto industry withered, white and affluent voters fled from the city, and the number of jobs and people both fell by about a third.
 
Looking for Consensus
 Mayor Young maintained power and popularity despite economic decline, however, partly by giving blacks a sense of pride and partly by seeking to rally city residents against the mostly white surrounding communities, calling them the "hostile suburbs."
But in this election things are different. All the leading candidates are black; the leader contender to succeed Mr. Young, Dennis Archer, a 51-year-old former State Supreme Court Justice, has run on a platform of consensus and cooperation with the surrounding communities. He has earned the Mayor's wrath by conceding that concerns about crime, drugs and inadequate city services have made it hard for Detroit to lure new residents and businesses.
Mr. Archer, a soft-spoken, buttoned-down partner in one of Detroit's more prominent law firms, pledges a "well-run, well-managed city."
"We will pick up our garbage on time, our police officers will be in the neighborhoods, and we will have a master plan," he vowed. "Detroit is a $2 billion a year business without a business plan."
 
Leader Pulls Away
 Mr. Archer stepped down from the State Supreme Court two years ago to explore running for Mayor. He had previously managed a number of political campaigns, including Mr. Young's in 1977, and has now built an impressive campaign organization that raised $1.6 million, far more than any other candidate.
Every poll shows he is likely to win one of the two run-off spots on Tuesday. A survey conducted on Labor Day for WDIV television found Mr. Archer the strong favorite among likely voters. Trailing well behind him were Sharon McPhail, an assistant Wayne County prosecutor, and Arthur B. Blackwell 2d, chairman of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners. Representative John Conyers Jr., who has run a somewhat mercurial campaign, ranked fourth.
The surprise of the campaign so far has been the strength of Ms. McPhail, a 44-year-old native of Cambridge, Mass., who was not taken seriously by many when she began campaigning last year. "This is a big industrial town, and a lot of people were hostile to the idea of a woman candidate," she says. Despite raising little money, she has been a strenuous campaigner and has been very effective in televised debates.
Ms. McPhail's positions are difficult to categorize. She talks tough on crime and says she would repeal the city's corporate income tax to attract new businesses. But she has also expressed concern for the homeless and wants to establish a network of child-care centers. Some questions have been raised about her ethics in handling private legal cases while employed full time as a county prosecutor, and she has been criticized for having failed to vote in many city elections, but these matters have so far had little effect.
 
The Mayor's Man
 Her main challenger for the second run-off position, Mr. Blackwell, is the only candidate running as the Mayor's man. Mr. Blackwell, 40, does pledge to do more for the city's crumbling neighborhoods than did Mr. Young, but he has otherwise run as a consummate Young loyalist. Though the Mayor has not made a formal endorsement, he did give $500,000 from his own campaign fund to two groups that have endorsed Mr. Blackwell, and the Blackwell campaign has been able to afford numerous television and radio advertisements that Ms. McPhail has not.
Mr. Blackwell has been the subject of an avalanche of news reports hinting at financial irregularities. The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press have detailed how he built a recreational area onto his house with a political expense fund, which he also used to pay an array of consultants, including his sister, father and teen-age son.
Questions have also been raised about some of Mr. Blackwell's travel at public expense, for his voting to give county business to companies he served as a consultant and for accepting a $42,000-a-year second job, at the Detroit Fire Department. Some fire fighters said he was never seen at the office. Mr. Blackwell has denied any impropriety.
Mr. Conyers, who helped found the Congressional Black Caucus and is now one of the most senior members of the House, has run a campaign with peculiar lapses. He sometimes does not show up for scheduled speeches and at one point arrived for a televised debate wearing a three-piece suit but without socks. In response to questions about such things he has replied, "I don't have to explain myself to the voters; the know who I am."
Mr. Conyers married three years ago for the first time, at age 62, and has said he is running for Mayor to make Detroit a better place to live for his infant son.
Other candidates include Paul Hubbard, the former president of New Detroit Inc., a civic action group; George Cushingberry Jr., a Wayne County Commissioner, and Charles Costa, a paint store owner who is the only well-known white candidate.
Even if one candidate gets more than half the vote on Tuesday, a nonpartisan runoff will be held on Nov. 2. Ms. McPhail and Mr. Blackwell have pledged to back whichever of them survives the primary, and Mr. Young is expected to work to defeat Mr. Archer.
Mr. Archer says: "In my own mind I have no opponents. I am not running against anybody; what I am running for is the vision of what Detroit can be."

HEADLINE: Prayers and Pleas for Action Mingle at Baptist Gathering

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
The annual gathering of the National Baptist Convention, which brought almost 50,000 pastors and church members to New York City last week, had the mood of a gigantic family reunion. But it was a family burdened with a sense of urgency.
With a membership estimated at about three million, the National Baptist Convention is the nation's largest organization of black Americans. Virtually no session or sermon at the meeting, which opened on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden and closed yesterday with a worship service at the New York Hilton, passed without pleas for action on the ills troubling black America: inner-city crime, drugs, AIDS, teen-age pregnancies and unemployment. 
 Sometimes those pleas for action clashed uneasily with the personal style and relaxed pace of the meeting.
But there were also signs that the National Baptist Convention is edging steadily toward a more nationally coordinated program and a higher visibility in the national news media.
 
Signaling Change
 The change was signaled by the denomination's very decision to meet in New York City for the first time in almost 60 years. One aim was to offer moral support to Mayor David N. Dinkins in his campaign for re-election. But clearly another was to send a message through news coverage.
Juxtaposing prayer and politics, the convocation preached a message that should have suited the Clinton presidency -- a blend of traditional moral discipline with support for government programs.
"We are intelligent, decent, attractive citizens, and that is different from the way that African-Americans are portrayed in the media," said the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, the general secretary of the convention and pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
"We pray, we have our children, we have our spouses. We understand the other images -- we're not denying that there are people on drugs and grabbing bags -- but we want the whole story told."
The evolution in the convention began a decade ago when the Rev. Theodore J. Jemison was elected president. Under his conservative predecessor, the Rev. J. H. Jackson, many socially active black clergymen and supporters of the civil rights movement formed a separate group, the Progressive National Baptist Convention, in 1961.
 
Healing the Breach
 Dr. Jemison, who is pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Baton Rouge, La., moved quickly to heal the breach. He honored the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He became one of the earliest supporters of Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign in 1984, and this year, as in preceding ones, he embraced the head of the Progressive National Baptists on the podium.
But Dr. Jemison, whose own father headed the denomination before 1952, also personifies a kind of old-fashioned church leadership featuring personal charisma and loyalty.
Dr. Jemison presided over the convention in a manner mixing the authority and prerogatives of a pope -- the Rev. Al Sharpton, a guest at the convention, actually called him the "black pontiff" -- with the familiar manner of a grandfather at the family dinner table.
Dr. Jemison verbally patted every speaker and musician on the head: "Wasn't that wonderful? Aren't you all having a good time? Amen." His introductions of dozens of church leaders, frequently embellished with information about whose son, daughter or nephew they were, reinforced the sense of the denomination as an extended family.
Indeed it often seemed that introductions were not preludes to the meeting's business; they were the meeting's business.
Discontent and rivalries were not absent from the meeting, but as at regular family reunions they tended to be acknowledged obliquely.
Most obvious were the declarations defending the construction of a $12 billion world headquarters in Nashville, a point of pride for Dr. Jemison but also a subject of criticism by some others in the church.
Beyond questions of expense, the Nashville building represents the movement toward a stronger centralized program for the denomination. "We're going to put some programs in it like black people have not seen before," Dr. Jemison said at the closing service yesterday.
Local black Baptist churches, like other Baptist churches, are independent, self-governing bodies. Their pastors have often wielded political and economic as well as spiritual influence on the local scene but made a mark nationally only when they entered politics.
Dr. Richardson strongly endorsed the growth of a central program on Friday when he announced his own candidacy to head the denomination.
Dr. Richardson has been a loyal lieutenant to Dr. Jemison, who has endorsed him as a successor and, at the Sunday service, underlined the importance of loyalty in the organization.
Just before Dr. Jemison adjourned this year's meeting of the National Baptist Convention, Dr. Richardson announced a forthcoming conference on AIDS. In no uncertain terms, he warned the delegates that "we've got to rid ourselves of any biblical notion that AIDS is some kind of plague that God has put on the unrighteous."
The question of AIDS "is not an issue that the church can walk away from," he said. "It is an issue the church has to walk toward."

HEADLINE: At 32, He Bows Out;
A Connecticut Whiz Quits Politics

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANSFIELD, Conn., Sept. 8

 BODY:
Jonathan Pelto won his spurs as a certified wunderkind of Connecticut politics at age 23 when, as Gary Hart's state campaign manager, he led a kiddie corps of Hart zealots to a victory over Walter F. Mondale in the 1984 presidential primary.
Elected to the state Legislature that same year, appointed statewide strategist for the Democratic Party at 25, his track seemed set and ever-upward. The young Congressman from Connecticut, maybe? With a top-loaded resume and a resonant if nasal baritone, who could tell? 
 Now, in political retirement, if not exile, at the ripe age of 32, Mr. Pelto sits in the wooded silence of his family's hilltop home here in sandals and torn jeans, nursing a handful of grudges, but also savoring, he said, the small joys and worries for which he never had time. Politics is out. Life is in. These days, he worries about simpler matters, such as whether his 8-week-old daughter, Mara, has an ear infection. He is negotiating for his first job ever in private industry. His resignation from the General Assembly, the last mooring to his old life, takes effect on Monday.
Twenty-one years after he stuffed his first envelope as an 11-year-old volunteer for George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, Mr. Pelto is officially out of the game.
"So many of my colleagues that I watched through the years would go home at the end of a legislative session and find out that their kid had learned to walk or talk, or graduated from high school while they were away," Mr. Pelto said. "Or worse, you go home at the end of the session and there's nobody there, which happened to one person. As important as the Legislature was, as important as politics is, that's not a price I was willing to pay."
Should this story really be called, "Mr. Pelto Gets a Life?" Or perhaps more aptly, "Another One Bites the Dust?" Did the prodigy who at age 18 ran United States Representative Sam Gejdenson's first come-from-nowhere race for Congress walk away from politics, or was he pushed?
 
Stress in High Places
 Over the last 18 months, his career has read like a how-to manual for inducing a midlife crisis, even if he is a bit young for the role: He was shoved aside from his leadership role in the state House of Representatives, fired from his job as political director of the Democratic Party, and rejected by many of his own constituents when he tried and failed to get the nomination for a state Senate seat.
The prospect of becoming a parent, Mr. Pelto said, also drove home the reality that Connecticut's Legislature, which pays rank-and-file members only $16,760 a year, is no place to save for college.
His friends say he was the victim of a new, more conservative regime in the Democratic Party that simply no longer needed -- or could tolerate -- the presence of a liberal firebrand like Mr. Pelto, and that stories like his probably litter the landscape in other parts of the country as local Democrats recast themselves to conform with President Bill Clinton's moderate New Democrat vision.
Moreover, much of the legislative agenda Mr. Pelto espoused in Hartford -- gay rights, abortion rights, a progressive income tax -- had been either achieved or left behind as public and legislative attention turned during the recession to bread-and-butter issues of jobs and of economic development.
And there is the question of personality. The state Democratic Party chairman, who dismissed Mr. Pelto from his party job last year, says it is a case of a boy wonder being too smart for his own good.
"Jonathan's demise, though part of it is voluntary, is something caused by Jon Pelto," said the party state chairman, Edward L. Marcus. "I think that Jonathan tended to act as if he indeed were the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader and the party chairman all in one, and it all came back to haunt him.
"To be part of leadership and secure nominations for higher office, you have to be somewhat of a team player," Mr. Marcus added. "I really think that's more the issue than anything else."
So is Mr. Pelto bitter?
At first he said no, just "disappointed a little bit," Only later in the conversation did he confess to "maybe a little bit of bitterness."
Bitter enough perhaps that he might be pulled back into politics, say, to work for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s re-election as a third-party independent if the Governor decides to run for a second term?
"Probably not," Mr. Pelto said.
Only later, in response to another question, did he equivocate again, just enough to make a reporter's head dance with the possibility of a "cast-out-son-wreaks-vengeance," angle in next year's gubernatorial election: If William J. Cibes Jr., Mr. Weicker's budget director and one of Mr. Pelto's oldest friends in the Legislature, personally called and said, ' "I know it's for the Governor, but I need your help,' " Mr. Pelto said, "I'd have a tough time saying I really can't do it -- I probably would."
 
Building Coalitions
 In any case, Mr. Pelto, still courted by some in his party like a 32-year-old wiseman, and now free to counsel and kibitz as he chooses, believes that the Democrats could easily go down in flames next year if Governor Weicker does run, regardless of who does or doesn't help the Governor.
The Democrats polled barely 20 percent of the vote for governor in 1990, when Governor Weicker, a former Republican, ran for the first time as a third-party independent candidate in a three-way race against a Democrat, Bruce A. Morrison, and a Republican John G. Rowland.
The political reality, Mr. Pelto said, was demonstrated in that election, and again last year with Ross Perot's Presidential campaign, is that coalition building among the shifting fragments of the two major parties will be the only way to win or govern both on the state and Federal levels.
"What got Lowell Weicker over the top last time -- should he run again -- is not the same coalition that will get him over the top this time," he said. "The Democratic Party doesn't realize that, and certainly the Ed Marcuses of the world don't realize that."
Then of course, there are new challenges of life that preoccupy Mr. Pelto: like his daughter, there in his arms. Did someone say politics was important?
"Not to be melodramatic, but I'd always thought the way to save the world was to go out there and be a politician and do your part," he said. "But I'm not really so sure that doing your part isn't just making sure your kid grows up the right way, and that's saving the world. I wouldn't have been able to imagine saying that before we had the baby."

Move by Patriots Will Involve Taxes

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 12

 BODY:
A move by the New England Patriots to Hartford would benefit Connecticut, but require millions of dollars in tax increases, according to a study commissioned by the state more than a year ago.
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s administration released the report on Friday. It was conducted by the University of Connecticut's Center for Economic Analysis at the direction of the Department of Economic Development. 
 The department would help finance a $252 million stadium in Hartford for the Patriots if they relocated here from Foxboro, Mass.
Legislative leaders have endorsed Weicker's attempts to bring the Patriots to Connecticut if the stadium can be built without massive public subsidies.

A Renovated 'Turandot,' With New Choreography

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
At their best, the standard repertory productions at the New York City Opera are economically staged, yet without an unreasonable sacrifice of detail or even, in some cases, the appearance of lavishness. This can be a difficult balancing act, but one way the company has made it work is by creating hybrids: productions in which the sets and costumes are retained, but which are reworked, sometimes considerably, by new directors.
The company's "Turandot" has had three directorial renovations since it opened in 1976, the latest being Jonathan Eaton's 1991 restaging, with new choreography by Shi Zheng Chen. Mr. Eaton's version returned to the New York State Theater on Saturday evening. 
 Mr. Eaton revitalized what had become a sagging production, sharpening its dramatic edges and building wisely on the dark, hazy atmosphere suggested by Beni Montresor's impressionistic sets. Exoticism, color and spectacle, all essential elements in "Turandot," are retained, but they never overpower the work, as they do in Franco Zeffirelli's production at the Metropolitan Opera.
The company has assembled a cast of competent, conscientious singers, but the vocal thrills a "Turandot" should provide were in short supply. A few were provided by Oksana Krovytska, in her company debut as Liu. Her sound is appealingly rounded, and fairly consistent through her range. And if her first contributions led one to doubt the strength of her upper voice, her sweetly phrased, delicate account of "Signore, ascolta" put those doubts to rest. More crucially, in the last act Miss Krovytska made Liu's combination of pain and dignity tangible.
Paul Lyon, also making his house debut, was a solid but generally unexciting Calaf. At his best, he moved through the role with confidence and command, and he gave an entirely respectable account of "Nessun dorma." But he was not always able to make himself heard over the orchestra, even at key moments.
It can be tempting to blame that on the orchestration or the conductor, and Guido Ajmone-Marsan did not seem particularly inclined to suppress Puccini's waves of densely textured coloration. But a tenor needs more power for Calaf than Mr. Lyon had available.
Catherine Kelly's portrayal of Turandot has grown noticeably since she made her company debut in the role last season. The main innovation was in the finale, in which she now conveys the power and emotional context of Turandot's transformation, crucial elements one missed in her performance last year. There is still a slight stridency in her voice when the music demands volume, and moments that sounded forced tarnished an otherwise gripping "In questa reggia."
There was some fine singing in the smaller roles. Eugene Perry, Michael Hayes and Gordon Gietz made the music of Ping, Pang and Pong into something more than the window dressing it often seems to be. And Philip Cokorinos, as Timur, and Don Yule, as the Emperor Altoum, brought a touching emotional resonance to their characters' few moments in the spotlight.

Missed Opportunities As Time Speeds By

 BODY:
"Later Life," initially produced by Playwrights Horizons, has reopened at the Westside Theater, 407 West 43d Street, Clinton. Following are excerpts from Frank Rich's review, which appeared in The New York Times on May 24. Josef Sommer has succeeded Charles Kimbrough in the role of Austin.
In the multicultural American theater, A. R. Gurney may be the last playwright who writes full time about that quaint old bird, the New England WASP. Maybe it's an unfashionable calling, but Mr. Gurney's view of his terrain is so objective that his plays often fill in the missing pieces of the fractured American social puzzle. When you meet the economically rarefied yet often emotionally disadvantaged characters in Gurney plays, you remember just why the rest of the country has spent 25 or so years fleeing in the opposite direction. 
 Austin, the Boston banker at the center of "Later Life," Mr. Gurney's enjoyable new 80-minute comedy, is one of the playwright's saddest creations. (Or half-creations. In the Playbill, Mr. Gurney acknowledges a debt to Henry James, whose tale "The Beast in the Jungle" seems the play's point of departure.) A smart and genial preppie in late middle age, Austin rather resembles the President he voted for in the last election. He's likable and polite, and he puts in his time at the office, but what exactly is he doing with his life? His children grown, his marriage ended by divorce, he is an empty suit longing to breathe free.
"Later Life" tells what happens when Austin is unexpectedly thrown together at a cocktail party with Ruth (a mysterious and alluring Maureen Anderman), a woman he met as a serviceman one night in Capri 30-odd years ago. Still young, single and "relatively free and clear," the pair almost spent the night together. But Austin was seized by the premonition that "something terrible was going to happen" to him in later life and dismissed Ruth with a kiss rather than risk ensnaring her in his cloudy future.
Now later life is accelerating, and the plot question of Mr. Gurney's play is whether Austin and Ruth will seize the second chance for happiness they have been handed. But that question cannot be answered until they resolve the question that hangs over the decades separating their brief encounters: Did something terrible ever happen to Austin? Apparently not. He has gone on to what he considers a lucky life, notwithstanding his divorce and his current need for Prozac. Ruth, by contrast, lost a child to leukemia and is now trying to flee her fourth marriage, to an abusive gambler in Las Vegas. It's almost as if she had been given the terrible future Austin once imagined for himself.
Or so it might seem. The drama in Mr. Gurney's plays can never take place on the surface because it is the very nature of his characters that their surface remains impeccably civilized while all hell breaks loose underneath. It is also typical of Mr. Gurney's writing that he strips down his reticent WASP's to the sound of laughter, not sentimental strings. "Later Life" is no exception, offering more than a few lines worthy of New Yorker cartoon captions.
Many of the funniest passages belong to Anthony Heald and Carole Shelley, two of our best comic actors, who are here given the delightful task of playing all the revelers who wander onto the high-rise terrace where Ruth and Austin are trying to have their quiet tete-a-tete. Although some of their roles are one-joke stereotypes that reveal the limits of Mr. Gurney's range -- a Route 128 computer nerd, an acerbic lesbian, a Jewish earth mother -- the performers' own range seems limitless. And they are unexpectedly moving as two old friends who preside over the party: a Harvard professor's widow who is the hostess and a prematurely retired Brandeis professor who has channeled all sorts of disturbing rage into his doomed effort to quit smoking.
True to form, Mr. Gurney sometimes uses the various interlopers to spell out his themes, a tic that mars most of his plays. There are far too many lines reminding the audience that a literal and figurative twilight (and autumn) is at hand, that vulgar Southern and Western new money has overtaken Eastern old money, and that it is now or never if Austin is to follow the example of many of the party guests and break out of his Brahmin rut. This congenital refusal to let the audience discover his plays' characters and themes for itself is in part what often reduces Mr. Gurney's Jamesian and Cheeveresque esthetic designs to facile boulevard comedy.
But Mr. Gurney's boulevard comedy is of a high order, at times achieving the luster of Philip Barry and S. N. Behrman even in this one-act piece. "Later Life" has been directed in the appropriately elegant, old-school Broadway style by Don Scardino on a starry romantic set by Ben Edwards.

In its exertions to dredge up support for the North American Free Trade Agreement in Congress, which will receive all 2,000 pages of it tomorrow, the Administration may have failed to notice that the battle of the tube is well on its way to being lost. The weeks of battering are not the work of conspiring news producers or reporters; one imagines that this cadre, sympathetic to ideals like breaking down barriers among neighbors and in no danger of having their jobs shipped to Mexico, would be favorably inclined to the proposed treaty. The problem for the Administration is with television itself.
Discussions of the agreement, like those on the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour," have been performed through a glass dimly. It takes a powerful dose of civic responsibility to sit through the opposing predictions and predilections; the screen turns as smoggy as Mexico City. When these encounters are not incomprehensible, they are inconclusive. Talk show interviewers must be forgiven for fleeing the details of the pact for the good old question of how many votes it will get in the House of Representatives. 
 But clear and strong signals about the agreement, particularly regarding Mexico, have come in other forms, and they have been predominantly negative: reports of companies moving across the Rio Grande accompanied by pictures of shut-down factories and interviews with shut-out American workers; stories about goods produced by low-paid foreigners being sent north to replace those with made-in-America labels; scenes of smoke and sludge pouring from Mexican factories untroubled by environmental busybodies.
Any accounting of the television balance finds the Administration with a heavy deficit. The main argument in behalf of the pact seems to be that as the appeal of living in the United States diminishes, so will illegal immigration.
The Administration has run up against some abiding rules of television: pictures stay with one longer than words; specifics hit harder than abstractions; victims touch hearts more deeply than ideas touch minds; a moment of reality has more force than a world of prophecy.
If that were not enough, featured among opponents of the agreement are some of the most picturesque public figures ever to enliven the screen: the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Patrick J. Buchanan, Ralph Nader, and, pre-eminently, Ross Perot. Showboats every one. They have been joined by clean-air advocates and other avatars of righteousness. What can such ineffably colorless and creaky Washington artifacts as Representative Thomas S. Foley do against this dazzling ecumenical alliance? How many testimonials to the pact from Nobel Prize-winning economists does it take to counter one sarcastic crack by Mr. Perot on the "Tonight" show?
If a nation still afflicted by high unemployment has not risen in more clamorous opposition to the trade agreement, it may simply be because many people just cannot get excited about anything known as Nafta. (Didn't it used to be a laundry detergent?)
Perhaps the White House will be able, as it was with its budget package, to eke out a victory of sorts in Congress, where free trade in North America may benefit from some private trades around Capitol Hill. But if the Administration needs to rouse enough national enthusiasm to impress a resistant Congress, it will have to confront its television problem.
President Clinton is to present his case for the agreement in a talk to the nation, but even with graphs, he will be hard put to make the promise of long-term benefits as vivid to viewers as the short-term costs have already been made. Replacing the images of certain loss tomorrow with the might-bes of gains the day after will strain the know-how of David R. Gergen, the talents of Bill Clinton and the imaginations of their audience.

 BODY:
Better breeding and management in animal agriculture, dominated by the dairy industry, has pushed up production in the New York metropolitan region in the last two years, while the number of livestock actually fell. Dairy operations, which account for more than 50 percent of New York's $3 billion-a-year farming industry, put the state in the third ranking among milk producers nationally and continue to be the strongest form of animal agriculture in Connecticut and New Jersey. But while allowing farms to increase production, better management has also led to consolidation. There are about half as many diary farms in the region as 10 years ago. The beef industry in all three states occupies a small niche in the agricultural economy. (Sources: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, N.Y.

A Talk With Clinton

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
What does President Clinton think of the muttering on the right in Israel that when Likud comes back into power, today's agreement with the P.L.O. would be abrogated?
"It concerns me, although our information is that Mr. [Benjamin] Netanyahu has been quite careful about his comments. Israel is a democracy, and historically democracies have honored the commitments that their governments have made with others along their borders, even with a transition government," President Clinton said in an interview on the eve of the signing of the first pact between Israel and the P.L.O. 
 "But I think to insure that, what we have to do is make this agreement as popular as possible in Israel," he added, "and I mean popular in the deep sense. I don't mean some fleeting poll numbers. The people of Israel need to feel this agreement enhances rather than undermines their security."
He is not troubled by Prime Minister Rabin's unwillingness to put his name on the treaty. "I think the fact that he's coming is a major step. I don't want to put myself in his mind," he said, and then did: "First he wants to give the Foreign Minister [Shimon Peres] credit for the work he did. . . . And secondly this has psychologically got to be still a difficult thing in Israel. So I'm not troubled."
I am. Perhaps Rabin personally thinks Peres deserves the honor; maybe he doesn't want to upset Israelis politically by going all the way; or it could be he doesn't want to put Yasir Arafat diplomatically on the same level as a head of state. Whatever the reasons, this is Rabin's historic deal and his name belongs on it. He cannot take everyone else overboard unless he jumps himself.
The gamble on the new Arafat will succeed if Israeli public opinion believes it is succeeding, which depends on (1) future P.L.O. discipline, (2) new treaties with Israel's neighbors and (3) strong new American military, economic and diplomatic support. Clinton is asserting the third.
Question: When the world clamors for the U.S. to pressure Israel to make concessions, will he -- as George Bush did -- use economic aid as a lever on Israel?
Answer: "I do not believe we can get from here to where we want to have to go to wrap this whole thing up by trying to weaken the position of the Israeli Government. The answer to that is yes, I'm not going to do that."
How about asking King Fahd to stop the boycott, asking the Pope to expedite Vatican recognition of Israel, extending the present "strategic cooperation" to a defense alliance, removing restrictions on the sale of supercomputers to Israel to give them a technological edge, pressing ahead with missile defense aid?
"When I have a strategy for what happens next in countries outside, I'll be glad to announce it; I m not trying to be fuzzy. . . . When I talked with Prime Minister Rabin . . . we agreed we would have to get through Monday first, and then we would talk about that, so I would be interested in knowing from the Israelis what they believe we ought to do next. . . . I'm going to develop a whole strategy and I just haven't had time to do it yet, and I can't do it in the course of this interview."
Though a bit behind the power curve, Clinton believes his refusal to criticize Rabin after the Hamas expulsion and the Lebanon raid "helped set the conditions in which this agreement could occur." I think the replacement of Bush with a President disinclined to pressure Israel helped push Arafat into direct negotiations.
In inducing American support for risk-taking, Rabin has clearly not been saying we'll-do-this-if-you-do-that; his more trusting approach makes good sense. In first forging his daring (if personally unsigned) agreement with his lifelong foe today, the Israeli leader challenges the rest of the world to pitch in tomorrow.
Clinton's message to Americans who identify with the Israeli settlers who feel abandoned and endangered?
"This agreement, if we do it right . . . will make the people of Israel safer and more secure and it's worth taking some risks for peace. . . . I'm going to do everything I can to minimize those risks. That's what I believe the obligation of the United States is. . . . We've only said if you believe it's worth it, to take risks for peace, we're going to be there for you. That's what I would say to them, not only to the Israelis, but to their supporters in the United States."

HEADLINE: Indonesia Still Caught In Population Squeeze

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 27 front-page article on Indonesia states that "Indonesia averted a population disaster" by dropping its annual growth rate from 2.4 percent to 1.8 percent. 
 This drop only means that the population will double in 38 years, rather than 31. The island of Java is the size of New York State and has 120 million people -- one of the densest populations on earth. At its current rate of growth, Java will have 160 million people by the turn of the century.
World Bank optimism for Indonesia contrasts starkly with the World Health Organization's bleak population forecast. Can a doubling of the per capita income be sustained if the population doubles in 40 years?
The population program of President Suharto has failed because Indonesians perceive the central government as less the governing force than customary village law.
My experience is that most Indonesians still regard a large family as status symbol and social security. Their "cooperation" with government family planning programs is mainly a put-on.

HEADLINE: Thinking the Unthinkable, Japan May Curb Its Bureaucrats' Power

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Like most countries, Japan works best when it is closing ranks to battle a perceived foe. When they were struggling to rebuild after World War II, the Japanese seized on the threat of Communism. As the cold war faded, overtaking the United States in world markets spurred workers to toil selflessly.
Now, with a new Government and a new generation in charge, Japan has found a new demon, this time from within -- the Government bureaucracy. 
 Talk of change is everywhere in Japan these days. Since the coalition Government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa took office last month, ending 38 years of one-party rule by the Liberal Democrats, nearly every aspect of the old system has been blasted as corrupt and in need of rejuvenation.
 
Criticism From Top Officials
 The minister responsible for Japan's industrial policy has denounced the tendency to create industrial cartels, which his ministry helped foster. The new Finance Minister criticized a recent optimistic economic report not just as wrong, but as bureaucratic obfuscation.
"One of the driving forces behind the advent of coalition government in Japan is the view that the nation's highly centralized bureaucracy has acquired too much power," Eiji Suzuki, the chairman of the Mitsubishi Kasei Corporation, Japan's largest chemical company, wrote recently. The new Government, he added, "should take a sledgehammer" to the collusive "iron triangle" of politicians, bureaucrats and industrialists that for decades sacrificed consumer interests for industrial competitiveness.
Indeed, if words were stones, the Government district in the heart of Tokyo would now be buried under a Mount Fuji of wrath. A country that once rejected foreigners who made these same criticisms as "Japan bashers," or "revisionists," has suddenly embraced at least part of the revisionist agenda -- which also happens to be part of the Clinton Administration's agenda for opening Japanese markets.
"Kisei kanwa," or deregulation, has become the latest buzzword.
"It is perfectly acceptable to say things now that five years ago were not acceptable at all," said Karel Van Wolferen, a Dutch journalist whose influential book, "The Enigma of Japanese Power," argued that bureaucrats had long ago seized control of the policy-making apparatus from politicians.
 
Regaining the Initiative
 A key tenet of the seven-party coalition Government, for instance, is that politicians must retake the policy initiative back from the bureaucracy. There is even talk of giving the Prime Minister's office something it has never had, a large staff of independent policy experts.
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former United States trade negotiator, has long been reviled by many officials here for advocating that Japan be forced to meet targets for reducing its trade surpluses. But last week Takeshi Nagano, the powerful president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, exhorted Mr. Hosokawa to agree to slash Japan's current account surplus, the broadest measure of trade, to a level equal to 2 percent of the gross national product, or almost half its current level.
Responding to the new mood, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet have put forward a dizzying array of proposals. As his first priority, Mr. Hosokawa has promised to remake the discredited electoral system, creating a new kind of election district and tightening laws on political contributions.
His Government has also said it will stimulate the flagging economy, which is threatening to slip back into recession after brief signs of a recovery; restructure the tax system; deregulate the economy; lower what are some of the world's highest consumer prices, and reduce the yawning trade surplus.
 
List of Rules to Be Scrapped
 At Mr. Hosokawa's insistence, the bureaucrats recently put forward a list of 60 regulations that could be scrapped or eased, a sort of deregulatory downpayment. These ranged from lowering the minimum production levels before a beer brewery can obtain a license to permitting the sale, rather than the mere leasing, of cellular telephones. They would also ease restrictions on trucking and taxi fares and making it easier to import construction materials.
But the list was quickly denounced as trivial. "We cannot remove the impression that the ministries are loafing on the job by offering piecemeal proposals," snapped Kozo Uchida, an official of the Keidanren, a trade group that represents Japan's largest corporations.
So the Keidanren responded with its own list of 30 regulations it proposed changing, from ending restrictions on department store hours to reducing the price of wheat and cutting electricity and gas rates.
Although popular sentiment has traditionally had only slight impact on Government policies, the Hosokawa Government is drawing on the growing recognition that the benefits of Japan's extraordinary economic success have not been shared with consumers, who pay astronomical prices, live in relatively small homes that are long commutes from their workplaces and enjoy few amenities like public parks and efficient sewerage systems. For instance, only 47 percent of Japanese live in homes connected to sewage treatment plants, with the rest relying on septic tanks or other facilities.
 
Few Say Life Has Improved
 In a recent Government survey, a minuscule 4.8 percent of those queried said their lives had improved over the last year, and only 17.7 percent said they expected a better life in the future.
Despite the frailty of Mr. Hosokawa's coalition, his clean image and boldness in speaking out have earned him the highest approval ratings in the postwar era, about 70 percent, according to several newspaper opinion polls published on Wednesday.
And he and other recent converts to his populist vision leave no doubt whom they see as the enemy in their struggle to turn the situation around: the bureaucrats.
"I personally have had more than enough of the resistance from this group," said Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Fuji Xerox Company and a member of a commission Mr. Hosokawa has just named to trim bureaucratic powers and improve stunted living conditions.
"On the other hand, these people are finding out a number of things from this new Government," Mr. Kobayashi added. "The bureaucrats are sensing that the air is different."
Kazuo Ogura, the Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs, conceded, "I sense tremendous hostility toward the bureaucracy by members of the coalition, which I can understand very well."
 
Who Will Benefit?
 Whether the new Government can fulfill the soaring expectations remains an open question. Skepticism abounds, even among people like Mr. Kobayashi, who said he expected real change to take years. Mr. Van Wolferen said he saw little substance behind the oratory. And almost no Japanese analysts believe that the deregulation campaign, even if it succeeds, would help the United States lower the trade surplus much.
Some members of the new Government are encouraging the idea that foreign companies will benefit from the removal of barriers. In fact, some of the proposals would ease the way for imports like construction materials and autos. But Japanese experts make it clear that such benefits will be limited at best. These proposals, they say, are aimed at Japanese interests first.
"This is not for the United States," said Mr. Kobayashi. "This is part of a Japanese effort to improve the quality of life in Japan as much as possible."
The lingering question is which Japanese interests should be served. Few here doubt that the bureaucracy has a different agenda and that it will resist many of the proposals. That is one point on which many bureaucrats agree, since they insist they will frustrate what they see as attempts to set a dangerous new course for the country.
The bureaucrats argue that this is just a matter of maintaining balance and fairness in the system; the growing ranks of critics counter that the bureaucrats are simply struggling to hold on to their power.
 
Opposition to Tax Cut
 For instance, bureaucrats at the Finance Ministry, the most powerful and conservative of the ministries, have insisted they will fight any attempt to stimulate the economy through a tax cut that would create a budget deficit.
"We won't accommodate them, I assure you," a top Finance Ministry official said. "They will accommodate us."
The new commission has been informally dubbed the second Maekawa commission, after a similarly high-minded group of Government officials, academics and business leaders that proposed sweeping deregulation and a restructuring of the economy in 1986.
The original report's aim was to reduce the soaring trade surplus by making consumer demand rather than exports the engine of economic growth, and to improve the quality of life.
The Prime Minister at the time, Yasuhiro Nakasone, hailed the report during a trip to Washington as marking a "historic change," and the Reagan Administration agreed. Seven years later, the trade surplus has more than doubled after a brief decline -- it is expected to come to more than $150 billion this year -- and personal consumption accounts for 56.9 percent of the annual gross national product, less than the 58.7 percent in 1985.
"The course the Japanese economy has taken since then was a little different from the one we had hoped for," said Takao Akabane, a former top bureaucrat at the Economic Planning Agency, who was a key staff member and supporter of the original commission. "The Japanese Government quickly became less serious about pushing the original scheme."
 
The Japanese Power Elite
 Speaking of the new commission, he added: "I would like to be optimistic, but I'm not. The bureaucrats will resist this too."
While in most developed countries the word "bureaucrat" carries a negative connotation, suggesting a petty official who obstructs because of a preoccupation with form over substance, the term has stirred respect among most Japanese.
Young Japanese who excel on the grueling exams toward which the education system is pointed tend to go to Tokyo University, and the most accomplished graduates of the university generally enter the bureaucracy. The bureaucrats, who are overwhelmingly male, often marry the daughters of other bureaucrats or of bankers and industrialists, adding to the sense that Japan is run by a new aristocracy.
There are just 19,000 of these mandarins, but they administer a system that influences nearly every economic decision in Japan, from the way banks operate and how much doctors can charge to how businesses grow or shrink. Even regional and local governments are subservient to central Government dictates. The Government now has nearly 11,000 business regulations, and the number is growing.
 
'Guidance' Is Potent
 Even that does not give the whole picture, since bureaucrats also have the power to issue informal dictates known as "guidance." Bureaucrats can retaliate against companies that resist these informal orders, making guidance a more potent weapon for regulating businesses than the law. Bureaucrats also write legislation on behalf of Parliament and staff committees exploring new policies.
That is why many experts are pessimistic, or at best guarded in their hopes for lasting change.
"The bureaucrats may just want to throw away the paper a day after it is completed," Mr. Kobayashi conceded, speaking of the report his commission will produce.
Yukio Noguchi, a former Finance Ministry official who is now a professor of economics at Hitotsubashi University, said: "I am rather pessimistic. I expect the same kind of abstract recommendations as we had the last time, partly because the present Government is a coalition. It will be hard to harmonize all the different opinions."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 24, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sept. 13 about curbs on the Japanese bureaucracy omitted a word from a remark by Kazuo Ogura, a senior Foreign Ministry official. He said "some" members of the governing coalition -- not all -- were hostile to the country's career civil servants.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "Lowering Economic Barriers in Japan"
 
Government Ministry Proposals
 Under the new government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, there has been a blizzard of proposals to deregulate the economy. Some of the proposed measures:
 -- Lower the minimum amount of beer a brewery must produce to obtain a license.
 -- Lower prices on electricity and natural gas.
 -- Introduce a system to sell, rather than just lease, cellular telephones.
 -- Make it easier to obtain licenses to enter the cable television business.
 -- Lower the high costs of auto safety inspections.
 -- Ease restrictions on imports of construction materials.
 -- Make it easier to use satellite broadcasts across borders.
 -- Revise the system for dating perishable foods to the last date food can be consumed from the current system, stamping the date of production, which is believed to discriminate against imports.
 -- Ease restrictions on trucking and taxi fares.
 
Business Proposals
 Following are some of the deregulation measures proposed by Keidanren, The Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, which represents Japan's largest corporations:
 -- Ease restrictions on department store hours.
 -- Reduce prices on government-controlled wheat supplies.
 -- Simplify standards on imported autos.
 -- Reduce regulations on shipping within Japan.
 -- Ease local regulations on construction of housing.
 -- Permit convenience stores and other retailers to sell rice.
 -- Ease restrictions on buying and selling television programming. (pg. A3)

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: The Overview;
RABIN AND ARAFAT SEAL THEIR ACCORD AS CLINTON APPLAUDS 'BRAVE GAMBLE'

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
In a triumph of hope over history, Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister of Israel, and Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the P.L.O., shook hands today on the White House lawn, sealing the first agreement between Jews and Palestinians to end their conflict and share the holy land along the River Jordan that they both call home.
At 11:43 A.M. on the sun-splashed South Lawn of the White House, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel and Mahmoud Abbas, the foreign policy aide for the Palestine Liberation Organization, signed a Declaration of Principles on Palestinian self-government in Israeli-occupied Gaza and the West Bank. Three thousand witnesses watched in amazement, including former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George Bush. 
 Mr. Rabin, whose face is etched with the memories of every Arab-Israeli war, captured in his remarks the exhaustion of all parties with the centuries-old conflict. "We the soldiers who have returned from the battle stained with blood," he said, "we who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you today in a loud and clear voice: 'Enough of blood and tears! Enough!' "
Mr. Arafat, relishing his moment of acceptance on the White House lawn, strove to give Mr. Rabin the appropriate response, declaring in Arabic: "Our two peoples are awaiting today this historic hope, and they want to give peace a real chance."
 
An Awkward Moment
 And President Clinton, who gracefully shepherded Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin through their awkward moment of public reconciliation, hailed them both for their "brave gamble that the future can be better than the past." [Transcripts of the leaders' remarks are on page A12.]
The agreement, which will eventually allow Palestinians to run their own affairs as Israeli troops pull back within months from the Gaza Strip and Jericho in a first step, was reached during secret negotiations over the past few months between Israelis and Palestinians, under the direction of Mr. Peres and Mr. Abbas, through the mediation of Norway.
The documents were signed on the same wooden table on which the Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel was signed in 1979. That table stood today as a silent memorial to the assassinated Egyptian President, Anwar el-Sadat, whose path-breaking visit to Israel in 1977 and subsequent agreements at Camp David brought him denunciations as a traitor by Mr. Arafat.
But the audience in attendance, and perhaps the millions more watching back in the Middle East, seemed less interested in the formal signing than in the visual moment that would somehow make this tentative peace real: the handshake between the two old warriors who personified the conflict between their peoples.
 
A Nudge, a Hand, a Smile
 Moments after the documents were signed, Mr. Clinton took Mr. Arafat in his left arm and Mr. Rabin in his right arm and gently coaxed them together, needing to give Mr. Rabin just a little extra nudge in the back. Mr. Arafat reached out his hand first, and then Mr. Rabin, after a split second of hesitation and with a wan smile on his face, received Mr. Arafat's hand. The audience let out a simultaneous sigh of relief and peal of joy, as a misty-eyed Mr. Clinton beamed away.
Two hands that had written the battle orders for so many young men, two fists that had been raised in anger at one another so many times in the past, locked together for a fleeting moment of reconciliation.
But much difficult work, many more compromises, will now have to be performed by these same two men to make it a lasting moment.
That reality was underscored by the fact that both Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat invoked their peoples' undying attachment to Jerusalem in their respective speeches.
[Later in Jerusalem, Israeli Radio reported that Mr. Rabin, accompanied by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, was traveling to Morocco on Tuesday for a surprise meeting with King Hassan to discuss establishing diplomatic relations. The report said said Tunisia was among several Muslim and Arab countries now ready to establish ties with Israel. ]
In an opening speech that was both eloquent and moving, Mr. Clinton described the history of the effort to make peace in the Middle East and paid tribute to Mr. Rabin and Mr. Arafat. He also pledged United States support for their effort.
"The United States is committed to insuring that the people who are affected by this agreement will be made more secure by it and to leading the world in marshaling the resources necessary to implement the difficult details that will make real the principles to which you commit yourselves today," President Clinton said.
"Together let us imagine what can be accomplished if all the energy and ability the Israelis and the Palestinians have invested into your struggle can now be channeled into cultivating the land and freshening the waters; into ending the boycotts and creating new industry; into building a land as bountiful and peaceful as it is holy.
"Above all, let us dedicate ourselves today to your region's next generation. In this entire assembly, no one is more important than the group of Israeli and Arab children who are seated here with us today."
 
Meeting in White House
 Before the ceremony, the Israeli and Palestinian leaders did not shake hands as they came together for the first time in the White House, officials said. They both walked to the Blue Room, where several people were already drinking coffee and orange juice, including Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and diplomats from Russia and Norway. The Israelis clustered at the southern end of the oval room, with Mr. Arafat and Mr. Abbas gravitating to the west end, about 15 feet away.
After all the other dignitaries filed out of the Blue Room to be introduced, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin were left alone together for a minute in the Diplomatic Entrance and it was then that the two old antagonists exchanged their first words.
"You know, we have a lot of work to do," Mr. Rabin said somberly, according to a Clinton aide.
"I know and I am prepared to do my part," Mr. Arafat answered.
Once they reached the podium, the contrast in demeanor between Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin was striking. Mr. Arafat was relaxed and ebullient -- a man who had spent a lifetime in the political wilderness suddenly finding himself at the pinnacle of power on the White House lawn. Mr. Rabin, the general-turned statesman, was nervous and palpably uncomfortable -- staring down at his shoes, never applauding anyone, shifting nervously and taking his speech in and out of his pocket.
When he delivered that speech, though, Mr. Rabin was both eloquent and frank. He articulated the deep ambivalence that he and so many Israelis felt about this reconciliation with a man they have only known by the name "terrorist" for 30 years. Mr. Rabin made clear that this was a moment he came to not out of some soaring vision of peace, but out of a grudging acknowledgement of reality: that Israel could no longer go on ignoring the P.L.O., the organization that represents the Palestinian people.
"This signing of the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principles here today, it's not so easy, neither for myself as a soldier in Israel's war, nor for the people of Israel, nor for the Jewish people in the diaspora who are watching us now with great hope mixed with apprehension," the 71-year-old Israeli Prime Minister said.
"It is certainly not easy for the families of the victims of the wars, violence, terror, whose pain will never heal; for the many thousands who defended our lives in their own and have even sacrificed their lives for our own. For them, this ceremony has come too late."
Mr. Arafat's speech was delivered with a resonant timbre and in a flowing, classical Arabic, translated by the official State Department interpreter. It was less memorable for its substance than for the simple sight of Mr. Arafat, dressed in his familiar khaki uniform and black-and-white-checked Arab headdress, framed between the President of the United States and the Secretary of State.
 
Appeal to American Public
 Mr. Arafat, whose face was painted throughout with the broad smile of a man living a dream, actually addressed himself as much to the Americans as to the Israelis, seeking to remind Washington that he will expect -- and need -- its continued involvement as he negotiates the details of today's peace accord with Israel.
"Mr. President, I am taking this opportunity to assure you and to assure the great American people that we share your values for freedom, justice and human rights -- values for which my people have been striving," Mr. Arafat said. "We are relying on your role, Mr. President, and on the role of all the countries which believe that without peace in the Middle East, peace in the world will not be complete."
In an overture to Israelis, though, Mr. Arafat refrained from articulating his goal of creating an independent Palestinian state, and stressed that Palestinian self-determination should not come at the expense of Israeli security.
"Our people do not consider that exercising the right to self-determination could violate the rights of their neighbors or infringe on their security," he said. "Rather, putting an end to their feelings of being wronged and of having suffered a historic injustice is the strongest guarantee to achieve coexistence and openness between our two peoples and future generations.'
Mr. Arafat received warm applause from the audience, which was made up of all the members of Congress, former Secretaries of State, including Henry Kissinger and James A. Baker 3d, who organized the Madrid peace talks, the ambassadors from key countries, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, as well as hundreds of Jewish and Arab Americans, who seemed to waver between enthusiasm and expressions of disbelief.
 
Last-Minute Dispute
 A last-minute dispute over the wording of the peace agreement between Israel and the P.L.O. resulted in a small, but crucial, alteration in the text. A White House official said that in a Blue Room reception just before the signing ceremony, the word "Palestinian" was changed to "P.L.O." in the preamble of the agreement, at the insistence of Mr. Arafat, who wanted to make sure that his organization was being acknowledged as the representative of the Palestinian people.
The Israeli-Palestinian accord in many ways grows out of the 1978 Camp David accords, with its emphasis on an interim stage of Palestinian autonomy before the two sides negotiate a final status for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But today's agreement goes beyond Camp David by accepting the notion that Israeli troops have to actually withdraw from some territory on the West Bank, and to give Palestinians far broader control so that the agreement would have credibility with Palestinians.
It also goes beyond Camp David in its recognition that such a deal could only be struck between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, not with Jordan or the Palestinians of the occupied territories, both of whom are the relevant parties of the Camp David accords.
The parties now must move into negotiations that will translate today's declaration of principles into an detailed, working plan for carrying them out. That will include deciding exactly where Israeli troops withdraw, not only from Gaza and Jericho, but from all Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, by the end of next summer. The parties also have to agree on such matters as how the Palestinians will establish their own police force and either elect or appoint a self-governing council.
 
Clinton Defines U.S. Role
 The United States role, Mr. Clinton said in an interview on Saturday, will be to help the parties work out these details, while also generating financial support for the new Palestinian homelands in Gaza and Jericho.
Mr. Clinton seemed to see his role today as creating the emotional space for Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin to come together. With the biblical allusions of his remarks and his politician's natural instinct for conciliation, the President seemed at ease in his role -- even introducing Mr. Arafat and Mr. Rabin to his daughter, Chelsea, who was seated with a group of Israeli and Palestinian schoolchildren.
"Today we bear witness to an extraordinary act in one of history's defining dramas, a drama that began in a time of our ancestors when the word went forth from a sliver of land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea," said Mr. Clinton.
After the ceremony, Mr. Clinton held a brief, unscheduled 10-minute, one-on-one meeting with Mr. Arafat in the White House map room, urging him to work quickly with Israel to implement the new peace agreement, and to remember that Israelis must feel confident of their security if this deal is to work, aides said. From there, Mr. Clinton met with a group of Jewish and Arab Americans.
"I think this is a very big deal," he told them, adding that everyone now had to work to insure that the Rabin-Arafat handshake, "instead of being a magic moment in history will truly be a turning point."

HEADLINE: SALINAS ATTACKED ON ELECTION BILLS

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, September 13

 BODY:
In what was to be the central political reform effort of Carlos Salinas de Gortari's presidency, the governing party is pushing to change electoral laws over the objections of opposition parties. The effort is drawing much criticism and clouding the outlook for the presidential election next year.
After a run of elections in which victories by the governing party were mired in allegations by the opposition of fraud or unfair advantage the proposed laws and changes to the constitution this month are supposed to smooth the way to a cleaner, less contentious vote in August. The proposed changes, which were approved on Sunday by the governing party's majority in the lower house, or Chamber of Deputies, would include some limits on campaign contributions and spending, Government control of election officials and the governing party's traditional dominance of the press. 
 Opposition groups and others said the changes would be paltry and, in some cases, might perpetuate the power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico since 1928.
"Democracy cannot be built on cowardice!" the leader of the conservative National Action Party in the lower house, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, bellowed at legislators from the governing party on Sunday. "The law is yours. Do with it what you wish!"
 
Issue in Debate on Trade
 The outcome of the push is crucial for the Government, because it is quite likely to determine whether the election of a successor to Mr. Salinas, who cannot be re-elected, will be viewed as legitimate here and abroad. In 1988 the vote that brought Mr. Salinas to power was widely considered fraudulent, and he has worked to dispel the authoritarian image of Mexico. The pressure for change has also increased as the shortcomings of the political system here have become an issue in the debate in Washington over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Members of Congress from the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party walked out of the Chamber last week to protest what they said was the Government's refusal to discuss meaningful changes. By contrast, Mr. Fernandez and his colleagues negotiated the new measures with the governing party and had agreed to vote for them.
As passed, the revised code would set the first limits on campaign contributions, but it would still allow for contributions that critics of the Government call unreasonable for a developing country where, according to the World Bank, the per capita gross national product was $2,870 in 1991. Under the law, every Mexican would be allowed to give a party up to 1 percent of the total public financing for all parties. This year the maximum would be $436,051. Next year, officials said, the ceiling would rise, to $654,077 or more.
 
Appeal to Wealthy Industrialists
 After a scandal in March over a direct request by Mr. Salinas to wealthy industrialists for contributions of $25 million to the ruling party, the party promised to limit voluntarily contributions to its activities fund to one million Mexican pesos, or $322,000. By comparison, individual contributions to parties in the United States cannot exceed $20,000 a year.
The new laws would prohibit corporations from contributing, but they would continue to allow each union, nonprofit organization and semi-independent group, which corporations might form, to give up to five times the limit for individuals. Anonymous donations would also be permitted, although the total of such contributions to all parties would not be allowed to exceed 10 percent of all public financing.
As 16 hours of floor debate was ending the conservatives accused the governing party of repudiating critical agreements. Despite its pledge of support, Mr. Fernandez's party, known by its Spanish initials as PAN, voted against the entire package. The measures can be modified by the Senate, which is expected to vote on them this week. Major changes are unlikely, however, because the governing party holds 61 of the 64 Senate seats.
 
Defense From Governing Party
 No sooner did criticism of the new measures erupt than the governing party moved vigorously in their defense. Articles today in pro-Government newspapers were full of complaints by legislators from the party that it had given away too much. A party member, Maria de los Angeles Moreno, president of the Chamber, denied that commitments had been broken, saying, "In no way does this frustrate the electoral reform."
National Action leaders said although they had been criticized for supporting the changes they had fought for an even higher limit, saying anonymous contributions were crucial to the opposition parties because they allowed for the support of people who were afraid to let their opposition to the Government be known.
In interviews today party leaders said that they had initially agreed to the high ceilings on contributions under the assumption that strict limits would be set on spending. Yet almost a year after Mr. Salinas issued a broad commitment to spending limits, the changes include no limits. Rather, the revision specifies that the Federal Electoral Institute would set the limits.
But a National Action leader, Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, said the complaints were far broader. "There really is no will here to establish a democratic system," he said. "That would be too dangerous for the P.R.I."

HEADLINE: In Auto-Making Country, Trade Accord Is the Enemy

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., Sept. 11

 BODY:
If there is an emotional heart to the movement against the North American Free Trade Agreement, it may be here, among the auto workers who fear that the agreement would be one more devastating blow to a way of life.
The attitudes are clear-cut, concrete, utterly removed from the theoretical debates of Washington and from the certitude of the pact's advocates that free trade is inevitable and good for the American economy over the long term. 
 Scott Herrick, a 35-year-old auto worker, simply terms the agreement a bad deal. "I'm of the belief," he said, "that most of our jobs are going to follow it." John Klutts, another auto worker, flatly said of Mexican workers, "There's no way we can compete with them on their wages."
It is Ross Perot who has captured the nightmare of auto workers -- an economy drained of well-paying manufacturing jobs, an economy with no place for people like them, where their jobs simply disappear across the border. Greg Klingler, a skilled tradesman in a General Motors engine plant, quoted Mr. Perot with a smile: "The big sucking sound, right?"
 
Political Mixed Bag
 The prospect of an agreement that would gradually eliminate tariffs and other trade and investment barriers among the United States, Mexico and Canada is scrambling politics here in the way that only a visceral issue like abortion usually does.
Mr. Perot's popularity among Michigan auto workers has soared, according to a poll released this weekend by The Detroit Free Press. He will stand shoulder to shoulder with labor leaders and prominent Democrats like Senator Donald W. Riegle of Michigan on Saturday at an anti-trade agreement rally at the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing. "He's a pretty good watchdog," said Jay Varvel, another auto worker, an opinion of Mr. Perot echoed again and again in three days of interviews in a city that has already seen more than its share of job losses.
The attitudes toward President Clinton are troubled. He carried this district in November, with 44 percent of the vote to President Bush's 35 percent and Mr. Perot's 21 percent, and many of the people who voted for him then are reluctant to turn on him now.
"I don't like it," Earl Henry, who retired after "34.7 years" with General Motors, said of the trade pact. "But if every time I had a disagreement with my wife, I kicked her out, she'd be gone a lot."
Many auto workers remember that Mr. Clinton supported the concept of the trade agreement during the campaign; during the Michigan primary campaign, in fact, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California had a boomlet of support here, fueled, in part, by auto workers looking for someone they perceived to be friendlier to labor.
 
Straddling and Finessing
 But Mr. Clinton tried to finesse the issue for much of last year, ultimately promising to negotiate tough side agreements to ease the anxieties of environmentalists and organized labor. And perhaps because of all the straddling and finessing, many of these auto workers said they did not expect him to end up pushing an agreement that they said would be, despite the side agreements, so hurtful to them.
Tom Nethaway, a 53-year-old toolmaker, struggled for an explanation: "I don't know if it was the lobbyists -- or who -- got a hold of him," he said.
Frank Garrison, the president of the Michigan A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "We need to save this President from himself."
William M. Daley, the Chicago lawyer who is heading the Administration's campaign on behalf of the trade pact, contends that the agreement is an attempt to change a system that has already seen jobs moved from the United States to Mexico.
Americans will have more jobs from the trade agreement, which will open new markets in Mexico, Mr. Daley asserted. Moreover, he said, "The notion that they can't compete is absolutely wrong."
He cited a study by the Congressional Office of Technological Assessment that showed that despite the disparity in labor costs, it was still cheaper to produce a car in the United States than in Mexico because of variables like transportation costs.
Still, the anxiety is strong here, given an added edge from the contract talks for the auto industry. It is no accident that Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the majority whip, is leading the opposition to the trade agreement.
 
Reality in Midwest
 Representative Dale E. Kildee, a Democrat and former Latin teacher who has represented Flint since 1976, said he had tried to explain to this Administration the political realities of selling the agreement in the industrial Midwest.
At the Labor Day Parade in Detroit, for instance, he said he ran into former Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston who was recently named Ambassador to the Vatican and who is the Administration's informal envoy to traditional Democrats. "Ray said, 'The President sent me here to try to calm things down about Nafta,' " Mr. Kildee said.
"I said, 'Ray, go down to Reedy's Bar, get yourself a pint, and don't even talk about Nafta,' " Mr. Kildee said.
Context is everything in politics, and the context for Nafta in this region is more than a decade of sagging employment in the auto industry. Dave Yettaw, president of the United Automobile Workers Local 599, which covers the Buick complex in Flint, says the average age of his membership is now 46, with 25 years of seniority.
Around Flint, workers talk worriedly about "getting my 30 years," the term necessary for a full pension. The days when young men and women could expect to be hired off the street for an auto industry job are an ever-more-distant memory, local union officials say.
 
Loss of 'the Good Job'
 Mr. Kildee agrees: "For about the last 12 years, G.M. has hired virtually no new hourly workers here. So anyone under the age of 30 basically does not have what was always considered the good job, the General Motors job. And for so many in this age group, these are the years when families are started.
"So you have a generation here, even without the Mexican Free Trade Agreement, as they call it here, that's suffered a great deal already," Mr. Kildee said amid the Saturday morning rush at Angelo's Coney Island restaurant in Flint. "And they worry that the agreement will only accelerate the loss of jobs."
So the strange brew of trade politics simmers. Mr. Kildee was asked to speak to the Flint branch of the Perot group, United We Stand America, the other night; the members of the group asked how they could help in the fight against the agreement. (Mr. Kildee urged them to concentrate on swaying the wavering members of the House.)
Mr. Garrison said, "We are working with anybody who will work with us to defeat Nafta." About Mr. Perot, he said, "God knows what his future plans are, but he's right on this issue."
And Charlie Coy, president of Local 598 of the U.A.W., says, "Back in the 60's, there was a guy named Ralph Nader, who brought a lot of attention to a lot of problems that were going on. I see Ross Perot in the same kind of light, but on a different scale. He's going to bring attention to issues the country has to deal with. I mean, Ross Perot is for America. Who couldn't like that?"
Those are, some Democrats say, some troublesome signs for a President who proudly carried this state 10 months ago.

HEADLINE: Israel Files Bond Offering

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Government of Israel sought clearance from American securities regulators yesterday to sell $400 million in bonds, saying it would use the proceeds to pay for projects like absorbing immigrants and building houses.
Israel's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission coincided with the signing of the peace pact between Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
 A spokesman for the Development Corporation for Israel, the New York-based underwriter for Israeli Government bonds, said the bond sale was not timed to benefit from the good feelings over peace. But the spokesman, Mark Benson, said the publicity would help bond sales, which have been increasing over the last few years. Israel sold $712 million in bonds in global financial markets so far this year.
"More people have been inquiring about purchases of state of Israel bonds since discussions of the peace process were in the media," he said. "More people are inclined to inquire about an area of peace than an area of war." .
Israel, in its S.E.C. filing, said the $400 million in bonds involves two types of securities, each ranging in maturity from 10 to 12 years with yields from 4 percent to 6 percent.
Half the offering are "zero coupon" bonds, which do not pay regular interest but instead pay a lump sum upon maturity. Another $200 million of bonds would pay regular interest.
The proceeds will be used to help pay for absorbing immigrants, housing projects, infrastructure development and other economic development purposes, the filing said.

HEADLINE: Transportation Stocks Surge; Dow Up 12.58

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The lowest oil prices in three years propelled transportation stocks to strong gains on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, as the stock market posted modest advances on the strength of a few blue chips.
The Dow Jones transportation index surged 23.30 points, to 1,634.76, while the Dow Jones industrials gained 12.58 points, to 3,634.21. 
 The big story of the day was the "huge gain" in the transportation average, said Lawrence R. Rice, chief market strategist for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "But the breadth is poor," he said of the overall market. "The advance today is very narrow, which is something to watch."
Mr. Rice also noted further evidence that the stock and bond markets were not necessarily moving in lockstep, at least for the time being. Bond prices were up again early yesterday, but the rally fizzled in late trading, leaving the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond unchanged at 5.87 percent.
 
Nasdaq Index Down
 Other market indicators were mostly flat. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.34 point, to 462.06. But the American Stock Exchange composite index slipped 1.76 points, to 454.30, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 3.99 points, to 740.32. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 245 million shares, down from 270 million on Friday.
Oil prices hit three-year lows on Friday, although they rebounded slightly yesterday. But with oil prices possibly heading even lower, airlines and other companies that stand to gain from cheap energy did well.
Among the airlines, UAL, the parent of United, jumped 3 1/2, to 146 1/2;, AMR, the parent of American, rose 1 5/8, to 64 3/4, and Delta Air Lines gained 1 3/8, to 54 1/4. Among the railroads, Norfolk Southern picked up 1 1/2, to 68 3/8, and Union Pacific rose 1 5/8, to 63 1/4. And American President Companies, the shipping line, rose 1 1/8, to 50 1/8.
Shares of auto makers were among the blue-chip stocks that rose. General Motors was up 3/4, to 47 1/2; Ford was up 1 3/8, to 55, and Chrysler was up 1 1/4, to 45 1/2.
Drug stocks were broadly lower on concern over President Clinton's health plan. Pfizer was down 1, to 60 3/8; Eli Lilly was down 7/8, to 47 3/8, and Bristol-Myers Squibb was down 7/8, to 56 3/8.
 
Gain for Paramount
 One of the day's biggest gainers was Paramount Communications, up 3 3/8, to 64 1/2, on news that it is about to be acquired by Viacom. The prospective buyer did not fare as well; Viacom class A shares closed down 1 7/8, at 64 1/8, while class B shares were down 2 5/8, to 56 3/4.
Du Pont was up 1 5/8, to 49 1/2, on the news that it would cut 4,500 jobs. Caterpillar, the construction equipment maker, was up 1/2, to 80 1/4, on news that it expects a $350 million tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service.
Broderbund Software rose again yesterday on last week's news that it would join with Random House to publish multimedia children's software. Broderbund shares were up 3 1/8, to 44 1/8.
I.I.S. Intelligent Information Systems, an Israeli company that makes networking and communications equipment, closed down 7 1/4, to 25, a decline of 22.5 percent. The company announced late Friday that its third-quarter revenue would be poor.
Middleby, a maker of food-service equipment, closed up 3/4, to 2 3/4, for a gain of 37.5 percent. Middleby announced Friday that it would get a $19.5 million settlement in a lawsuit.
Gold mining stocks also fell yesterday, following a continuing selloff in the metal. Gold for October delivery dropped $7.60 an ounce, to $343.10, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, reflecting confidence that inflation would not return. Among the gold losers were Pegasus Gold, down 1, to 18 3/4; Newmont Gold, down 1 7/8, to 38 1/2, and Placer Dome, down 1 1/8 to 16 7/8.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious Metals Continue Their Low-Inflation Slide

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Gold and silver prices continued to slide yesterday amid expectations of continuing low inflation and slow economic growth.
On other commodity markets, oil prices rebounded from their three-year lows on Friday. 
 The precious metals markets have been shaken by the increasing signs that inflation is under control, especially since the Government reported on Friday that its Producer Price Index in August fell for the fourth straight month.
Investors buy gold when rising inflation threatens the value of other assets, and low inflation often leads to lower gold prices.
"The precious metals are just a disaster area," said Daniel Weissman, head of precious metals trading at MTB Bank in New York. The Producer Price Index, he said, "just reinforced the fact that the economies of the world are growing slowly, without inflation."
 
Lowest Level Since April
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for October delivery fell $7.60, to $343.10 an ounce, gold's lowest level since late April. December gold, the most actively traded futures contract, also lost $7.60, settling at $344.80. December silver dropped 16.2 cents to settle at $3.938 an ounce, its first drop below $4 an ounce in five months.
"There's the expectation of a deflationary environment," said Michael Spriggs, an analyst with S. G. Warburg in London, and "the sentiment has certainly turned negative toward gold."
Gold could even fall back to its lowest price this year -- $326 an ounce -- this week, Mr. Weissman said.
Elsewhere, crude oil futures rebounded on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a decline of about 11 percent over the last two weeks. Light sweet crude oil for October delivery gained 19 cents, to $16.95 a barrel. October heating oil edged up 0.4 cent, to 51.39 cents a gallon, and October unleaded gasoline rose 0.1 cent, to 48.57 cents a gallon.
Traders attributed the weakness in oil to heavy OPEC production and sagging worldwide demand. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet in Geneva on Sept. 25 in an attempt to bolster prices.
"The preliminary uncertainty going into the OPEC meeting is helping to lift prices," said Roger Voltz, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group in New York.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD;
Statements by Leaders at the Signing of the Middle East Pact

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Mahmoud Abbas, a P.L.O. negotiator, at the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement yesterday in Washington, as recorded by the New York Times. Mr. Arafat and Mr. Abbas spoke in Arabic, and portions of remarks by Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres were in Hebrew. Mr. Clinton's closing remarks were recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription service, and provided by Reuters.
"For too long the young of the Middle East have been caught in a web of hatred not of their own making. For too long they have been taught from the chronicles of war; now we can give them the chance to know the season of peace." -- PRESIDENT CLINTON 
 PRIME Minister Rabin, Chairman Arafat, Foreign Minister Peres, Mr. Abbas, President Carter, President Bush, distinguished guests. On behalf of the United States and Russia, co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, welcome to this great occasion of history and hope. Today we bear witness to an extraordinary act in one of history's defining dramas -- a drama that began in a time of our ancestors when the word went forth from a sliver of land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. That hallowed piece of earth, that land of light and revelation, is the home to the memories and dreams of Jews, Muslims and Christians throughout the world.
As we all know, devotion to that land has also been the source of conflict and bloodshed for too long. Throughout this century bitterness between the Palestinian and Jewish people has robbed the entire region of its resources, its potential and too many of its sons and daughters. The land has been so drenched in warfare and hatred, the conflicting claims of history etched so deeply in the souls of the combatants there, that many believe the past would always have the upper hand. Then, 14 years ago, the past began to give way when, at this place and upon this desk, three men of great vision signed their names to the Camp David accords. Today we honor the memories of Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat. And we salute the wise leadership of President Jimmy Carter.
Then, as now, we heard from those who said that conflict would come again soon, but the peace between Egypt and Israel has endured. Just so this bold new venture today, this brave gamble that the future can be better than the past, must endure.
Two years ago in Madrid another President took a major step on the road to peace by bringing Israel and all her neighbors together to launch direct negotiations, and today we also express our deep thanks for the skillful leadership of President George Bush.
Ever since Harry Truman first recognized Israel, every American President, Democrat and Republican, has worked for peace between Israel and her neighbors. Now the efforts of all who have labored before us bring us to this moment -- a moment when we dare to pledge what for so long seemed difficult even to imagine: that the security of the Israeli people will be reconciled with the hopes of the Palestinian people, and there will be more security and more hope for all.
Today the leadership of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization will sign a declaration of principles on interim Palestinian self-government. It charts a course toward reconciliation, between two peoples who have both known the bitterness of exile. Now both pledge to put old sorrows and antagonisms behind them and to work for a shared future shaped by the values of the Torah, the Koran and the Bible. Let us salute also today the Government of Norway, for its remarkable role in nurturing this agreement.
But above all, let us today pay tribute to the leaders who had the courage to lead their people toward peace, away from the scars of battle, the wounds and the losses of the past, toward a brighter tomorrow. The world today thanks Prime Minister Rabin, Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat.
That tenacity and vision has given us the promise of a new beginning. What these leaders have done now must be done by others. Their achievement must be a catalyst for progress in all aspects of the peace process. And those of us who support them must be there to help in all aspects, for the peace must render the people who make it more secure. A peace of the brave is within our reach. Throughout the Middle East there is a great yearning for the quiet miracle of a normal life. We know a difficult road lies ahead. Every peace has its enemies, those who still prefer the easy habits of hatred to the hard labors of reconciliation, but Prime Minister Rabin has reminded us that you do not have to make peace with your friends, and the Koran teaches that if the enemy inclines toward peace, do thou also incline toward peace.
Therefore, let us resolve that this new mutual recognition will be a continuing process in which the parties transform the very way they see and understand each other. Let the skeptics of this peace recall what once existed among these people. There was a time when the traffic of ideas and commerce and pilgrims flowed uninterrupted among the cities of the fertile crescent. In Spain, in the Middle East, Muslims and Jews once worked together to write brilliant chapters in the history of literature and science. All this can come to pass again.
Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Chairman, I pledge the active support of the United States of America to the difficult work that lies ahead.
The United States is committed to insuring that the people who are affected by this agreement will be made more secure by it and to leading the world in marshaling the resources necessary to implement the difficult details that will make real the principles to which you commit yourselves today. Together let us imagine what can be accomplished if all the energy and ability the Israelis and the Palestinians have invested into your struggle can now be channeled into cultivating the land and freshening the waters; into ending the boycotts and creating new industry; into building a land as bountiful and peaceful as it is holy. Above all, let us dedicate ourselves today to your region's next generation. In this entire assembly, no one is more important than the group of Israeli and Arab children who are seated here with us today.
Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Chairman, this day belongs to you. And because of what you have done, tomorrow belongs to them. We must not leave them prey to the politics of extremism and despair, to those who would derail this process because they cannot overcome the fears and hatreds of the past. We must not betray their future.
For too long the young of the Middle East have been caught in a web of hatred not of their own making. For too long they have been taught from the chronicles of war; now we can give them the chance to know the season of peace. For them we must realize the prophecy of Isaiah, that the cry of violence shall no more be heard in your land, nor wrack nor ruin within your borders. The children of Abraham, the descendants of Isaac and Ishmael, have embarked together on a bold journey. Together today with all our hearts and all our souls, we bid them Shalom. Salaam. Peace.

SHIMON PERES
Foreign Minister of Israel
MR. President, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
 Mr. President, I would like to thank you and the great American people for peace and support. Indeed I would like to thank all those who have made this day possible. What we are doing today is more than signing an agreement; it is a revolution. Yesterday a dream, today a commitment.
The Israeli and the Palestinian peoples who fought each other for almost a century have agreed to move decisively on the path of dialogue, understanding and cooperation. We live in an ancient land and as our land is small, so must our reconciliation be great. As our wars have been long, so must our healing be swift. Deep gaps call for lofty breezes. I want to tell the Palestinian delegation that we are sincere, that we mean business. We do not seek to shape your lives or determine your destiny. Let all of us turn from bullets to ballots, from guns to shovels. We shall pray with you. We shall offer you our help in making Gaza prosper and Jericho blossom again.
As we have promised, we shall negotiate with you a permanent settlement and with all our neighbors a comprehensive peace, peace for all. We shall support the agreement with an economic structure. We shall convert the bitter triangle of Jordanians, Palestinians and Israelis into a triangle of political triumph and economic prosperity.
We shall lower our barriers and widen our roads so goods and guests will be able to move freely all about the places holy and other places. This should be another Genesis. We have to build a new commonwealth on our old soil: a Middle East of the people and a Middle East for their children. For their sake we must put an end to the waste of arms races and invest our resources in education.
Ladies and gentlemen, two parallel tragedies have unfolded. Let us become a civic community. Let us bid once and for all farewell to wars, to tricks, to human misery, let us bid farewell to enmity and may there be no more victims on either side.
Let us build a Middle East of hope where today's food is produced and tomorrow's prosperity is guaranteed, a region with a common market, a Near East with a long-range agenda. We owe it to our own soldiers, to the memories of the victims of the Holocaust. Our hearts today grieve for the lost lives of young and innocent people yesterday in our own country. Let their memory be our foundation we are establishing today, a memory of peace on fresh and old tombs.
Suffering is first of all human. We also feel for the innocent loss of Palestinian lives. We begin a new day. The day may be long and the challenges enormous. Our calendar must meet an intensive schedule.
Mr. President, historically you are presiding over a most promising day in the very long history of our region, of our people. I thank all of you ladies and gentlemen, and let's pray together. Let's add hope to determination as all of us since Abraham believe in freedom, in peace, in the blessing of our great land and great spirit.
[Speaking in Hebrew]. From the eternal city of Jerusalem, from this green, promising lawn of the White House, let's say together in the language of our Bible: "Peace, peace to him that is far off and to him that is near," sayeth the Lord, "and I will hear."
Thank you.

MAHMOUD ABBAS
P.L.O. Negotiator
MR. President, ladies and gentlemen: In these historic moments with feelings of joy that are mixed with a maximum sense of responsibility regarding events that are affecting our entire region, I greet you and I greet this distinguished gathering. I hope that this meeting in Washington will prove to be the onset of a positive and constructive change that will serve the interests of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.
We have come to this point because we believe that peaceful coexistence and cooperation are the only means for reaching understanding and for realizing the hopes of the Palestinians and the Israelis. The agreement we will sign reflects the decision we made in the Palestine Liberation Organization to turn a new page in our relationship with Israel.
We know quite well that this is merely the beginning of a journey that is surrounded by numerous dangers and difficulties and yet our mutual determination to overcome everything that stands in the way of the cause for peace, our common belief that peace is the only means to security and stability and our mutual aspiration for a secure peace characterized by cooperation -- all this will enable us to overcome all obstacles with the support of the international community. And here I would like to mention, in particular, the United States Government, which will shoulder the responsibility of continuing to play an effective and distinct role in the next stage so that this great achievement may be completed.
In this regard, it is important to me to affirm that we are looking forward with a great deal of hope and optimism to a date that is two years from today, when negotiations over the final status of our country are set to begin. We will then settle the remaining fundamental issues, especially those of Jerusalem, the refugees and the settlements. At that time, we will be laying the last brick in the edifice of peace whose foundation has been established today.
Economic development is the principal challenge facing the Palestinian people after years of struggle during which our national infrastructure and institutions were overburdened and drained. We are looking to the world for its support and encouragement in our struggle for growth and development, which begins today.
I thank the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation for the part they played and for their efforts and their sponsorship of the peace process. I also appreciate the role played by the Government of Norway in bringing about this agreement. And I look forward to seeing positive results soon on the remaining Arab-Israeli tracks so we can proceed together with our Arab brothers on this comprehensive quest for peace.
Thank you.

YITZHAK RABIN
Prime Minister of Israel
PRESIDENT of the United States, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: This signing of the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principle here today -- it's not so easy -- neither for myself as a soldier in Israel's war nor for the people of Israel, not to the Jewish people in the diaspora, who are watching us now with great hope mixed with apprehension. It is certainly not easy for the families of the victims of the war's violence, terror, whose pain will never heal, for the many thousands who defended our lives in their own and have even sacrificed their lives for our own. For them this ceremony has come too late.
Today on the eve of an opportunity, opportunity for peace and perhaps end of violence and war, we remember each and every one of them with everlasting love. We have come from Jerusalem, the ancient and eternal capital of the Jewish people. We have come from an anguished and grieving land. We have come from a people, a home, a family that has not known a single year, not a single month, in which mothers have not wept for their sons. We have come to try and put an end to the hostilities so that our children, our children's children, will no longer experience the painful cost of war: violence and terror. We have come to secure their lives and to ease the soul and the painful memories of the past -- to hope and pray for peace.
Let me say to you, the Palestinians, we are destined to live together on the same soil in the same land. We, the soldiers who have returned from battles stained with blood; we who have seen our relatives and friends killed before our eyes; we who have attended their funerals and cannot look in the eyes of their parents; we who have come from a land where parents bury their children; we who have fought against you, the Palestinians -- we say to you today, in a loud and a clear voice: enough of blood and tears. Enough.
We have no desire for revenge. We harbor no hatred towards you. We, like you, are people -- people who want to build a home. To plant a tree. To love -- live side by side with you. In dignity. In empathy. As human beings. As free men. We are today giving peace a chance -- and saying to you and saying again to you: enough. Let us pray that a day will come when we all will say farewell to the arms. We wish to open a new chapter in the sad book of our lives together -- a chapter of mutual recognition, of good neighborliness, of mutual respect, of understanding. We hope to embark on a new era in the history of the Middle East. Today here in Washington at the White House, we will begin a new reckoning in the relations between peoples, between parents tired of war, between children who will not know war.
President of the United States, ladies and gentlemen, our inner strength, our high moral values, have been the right for thousands of years, from the book of the books. In one of which, we read: To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to love and a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace. Ladies and gentlemen, the time for peace has come.
In two days the Jewish people will celebrate the beginning of a new year. I believe, I hope, I pray that the new year will bring a message of redemption for all peoples-- a good year for you, for all of you; a good year for Israelis and Palestinians; a good year for all the peoples of the Middle East; a good year for our American friends who so want peace and are helping to achieve it.
For Presidents and members of previous Administrations, especially for you, President Clinton, and your staff, for all citizens of the world, may peace come to all your homes. In the Jewish tradition it is customary to conclude our prayers with the word Amen. With your permission, men of peace, I shall conclude with the words taken from the prayer recited by Jews daily, and whoever of you who volunteer, I would ask the entire audience to join me in saying Amen. [Speaking in Hebrew]. May He who brings peace to His universe bring peace to us and to all Israel. Amen.
 
YASIR ARAFAT
P.L.O. Chairman
IN the name of God the most merciful, the passionate. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: I would like to express our tremendous appreciation to President Clinton and to his Administration for sponsoring this historic event, which the entire world has been waiting for. Mr. President, I am taking this opportunity to assure you and to assure the great American people that we share your values for freedom, justice, and human rights -- values for which my people have been striving.
My people are hoping that this agreement, which we are signing today, marks the beginning of the end of a chapter of pain and suffering which has lasted throughout this century. My people are hoping that this agreement which we are signing today will usher in an age of peace, coexistence and equal rights. We are relying on your role, Mr. President, and on the role of all the countries which believe that without peace in the Middle East, peace in the world will not be complete.
Enforcing the agreements and moving toward the final settlement, after two years to implement all aspects of U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 in all of their aspects, and resolve all the issues of Jerusalem, the settlements, the refugees and the boundaries, will be a Palestinian and an Israeli responsibility. It is also the responsibility of the international community in its entirety to help the parties overcome the tremendous difficulties which are still standing in the way of reaching a final and comprehensive settlement.
Now, as we stand on the threshold of this new historic era, let me address the people of Israel and their leaders, with whom we are meeting today for the first time. And let me assure them that the difficult decision we reached together was one that required great and exceptional courage.
We will need more courage and determination to continue the course of building coexistence and peace between us. This is possible. And it will happen with mutual determination and with the effort that will be made with all parties on all the tracks to establish the foundations of a just and comprehensive peace. Our people do not consider that exercising the right to self-determination could violate the rights of their neighbors or infringe on their security. Rather, putting an end to their feelings of being wronged and of having suffered an historic injustice is the strongest guarantee to achieve coexistence and openness between our two peoples and future generations.
Our two peoples are awaiting today this historic hope. And they want to give peace a real chance.
Such a shift will give us an opportunity to embark upon the process of economic, social and cultural growth and development. And we hope that international participation in that process will be as extensive as it can be. This shift will also provide an opportunity for all forms of cooperation on a broad scale and in all fields.
I thank you, Mr. President. We hope that our meeting will be a new beginning for fruitful and effective relations between the American people and the Palestinian people.
I wish to thank the Russian Federation and President Boris Yeltsin. Our thanks also go to Secretary [of State Warren] Christopher and Foreign Minister [Andrei V.] Kozyrev [of Russia] to the Government of Norway and to the Foreign Minister of Norway, for the positive part they played in bringing about this major achievement.
I extend greetings to all the Arab leaders, our brothers, and to all the world leaders who contributed to this achievement.
Ladies and gentlemen, the battle for peace is the most difficult battle of our lives. It deserves our utmost efforts because the land of peace, the land of peace yearns for a just and comprehensive peace.
[Speaking in English] Mr. President, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

PRESIDENT CLINTON
 WE have been granted the great privilege of witnessing this victory for peace. Just as the Jewish people this week celebrate the dawn of a new year, let us all go from this place to celebrate the dawn of a new era, not only for the Middle East but for the entire world.
The sound we heard today, once again as in ancient Jericho, was of trumpets toppling walls, the walls of anger and suspicion between Israeli and Palestinian, between Arab and Jew. This time, praise God, the trumpets herald not the destruction of that city but its new beginning.
Now let each of us here today return to our portion of that effort, uplifted by the spirit of the moment, refreshed in our hopes and guided by the wisdom of the Almighty, who has brought us to this joyous day. Go in peace. Go as peacemakers.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: News Analysis;
The Next Challenge for the U.S.

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
As he himself said, this was not Bill Clinton's day. It was not he who brought together the sober old soldier and the grinning guerrilla fighter in the leafy calm of the South Lawn of the White House, far from the battlefields of the Middle East, for a paean to peace.
However deft, however sagacious, he was but the master of ceremonies. He thanked those who had labored to bring about the latest in a series of once-inconceivable changes that have remade the world in five short years. He bestowed the congratulations of the world's only superpower. And he gave Yitzhak Rabin a timely little nudge when he seemed reluctant to grasp the outstretched hand of Yasir Arafat. 
 Now, though, President Clinton will have to assume the central role if the momentum toward a comprehensive peace settlement is not to be lost. That is likely to be a long, messy job of diplomatic donkey work in the dark corners of history -- a much less gratifying chapter than today's carefully scripted pageant of good intentions.
Israel and Jordan are poised to move forward tomorrow. But the other Arab nations whose representatives watched today's ceremony from the front rows know that only the United States can provide the impetus needed for the next round of negotiations. Mr. Arafat spoke for them, too, when he said his people "are relying on your role, Mr. President" to "usher in an age of peace."
So this President, who so longs to concentrate on problems at home, is thrust like so many of his predecessors into an international arena not of his choosing. Along with the rest of the world, the United States has a new ward, the inchoate entity called Palestine, and it has the main responsibility for fostering Israeli settlements with its other neighbors while deepening the one with the Palestinians.
It will be up to Mr. Clinton, who does not much like doing so, to butt heads between the Israelis and the Syrians, and perhaps take considerable heat from American Jews in the process, which he did not have to endure this time.
Neither Mr. Clinton nor any other American President has ever wanted to do business with Mr. Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization. As Mr. Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister, said in one of his many moments of eloquence this morning, "It's not so easy," swallowing all this change.
But in the end even as stiff-necked a leader as Charles de Gaulle had to deal with the National Liberation Front in Algeria. Henry A. Kissinger had to deal with the Vietcong, South Africa's white leaders had to deal with Nelson Mandela and now the United States must deal with the P.L.O. If rebellions succeed, or even end in stalemate, the rebels win a place at the table.
The United States will have to do its utmost to make this accord work. That means, first and foremost, helping to persuade ordinary Israelis and Palestinians that their self-interest lies in its working, not in its failing. The nay-sayers among both peoples will have to be answered with accomplishments -- Benjamin Netanyahu and his followers, settlers and others, in Israel, and the prophets of continuing violence both inside and outside the P.L.O.
Much will depend on building viable economies in the areas that the Palestinians are to take over. Waxing poetic, the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, promised to help them in "making Gaza prosper and Jericho bloom again." Arab countries will also help, and so will Japan, but some of the money will have to come from the overburdened United States Treasury.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has suggested that at some point American troops will probably have to play a role in keeping the peace, perhaps replacing the Israelis who now man the Golan Heights overlooking Syria.
After this week, perhaps even by Wednesday or Thursday, the attention of the capital will turn back to the twin domestic issues that Mr. Clinton has put atop his agenda, the North American Free Trade Agreement and reform of the nation's health-care system. They will once again be viewed as the prime measures of the President's success over the next 12 months or so.
 
Clinton Accepts New Role
 But to them, and not far below them, must now be added the Middle East.
Mr. Clinton accepted his new role in his speech, asserting that "the United States is committed to insuring that the people who are affected by this agreement will be made more secure by it, and to leading the world in marshaling the resources necessary to implement the difficult details."
No doubt the details are difficult. Such questions as the nature and borders of any Palestinian state, whether the Israeli settlers are to remain on the West Bank, and especially the question of Jerusalem have been put aside. Mr. Arafat continued to promise that the Palestinian flag will fly over Jerusalem in the next two years; Mr. Rabin replies curtly, "Forget it."
Moreover, Mr. Clinton concedes that he does not know quite how to proceed. In an interview over the weekend, he said, "I'm going to develop a whole strategy; I just haven't had time to do it yet." Much will depend on whether he gets it right when he does.
For this is a part of the world where the United States has vital interests, economic as well as political. It is also a part of the world where the United States has a long if not always successful record of involvement.
If the United Nations operation in Somalia fails, and United States policy fails with it, that is embarrassing. The President, according to his aides, rebukes himself for the failure of the Western nations to end the suffering in Bosnia. But he is unlikely to suffer politically, even if the United States suffers strategically, for miscalculations in the Balkans or in Africa.
The Middle East is another matter. If Mr. Clinton bungles there -- if he shows an unsure touch or fails to follow through -- his reputation and that of his country will suffer.
Not that success will guarantee a second term. When Jimmy Carter pulled off the Camp David agreement between Egypt and Israel, one of his top aides asked another, "If this doesn't get us re-elected, what will?" It did not, of course, in large part because of trouble in another part of the Middle East.
There was plenty of euphoria at the White House today, but not that kind; the lesson of 1992, when George Bush won in the Persian Gulf but lost at the ballot box, is far too fresh.
By all accounts, a settlement between Syria and Israel, which once seemed far more likely than what was achieved in recent days, now seems the most difficult item on the agenda. A senior White House official said that a lot of low-level talking would be necessary before President Clinton could take a more direct role in talks with President Hafez al-Assad and the Israelis.
Because of the difficult road ahead, there was a concerted effort by the participants in today's drama to diminish expectations. But that was hard to do, when something everyone had considered impossible -- even Mr. Kissinger, by his own account -- was unfolding there on the Lawn, bigger than life.

HEADLINE: Fleet Securities Officials Say They Lobbied Holtzman

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Executives of Fleet Securities met with New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman at a fund-raising breakfast to lobby for a greater share of the city's underwriting 10 months before Ms. Holtzman claims she first became aware the firm was seeking city business, bank and law-enforcement officials said.
Ms. Holtzman has maintained that she was unaware Fleet was vying to become a member of the syndicate of firms that sells city bonds until a reporter told her in April that the firm had been selected. She said her deputy, Darcy Bradbury, selected Fleet in March. 
 Fleet's selection has become the focus of a city investigation because seven months earlier, Ms. Holtzman's Senate campaign borrowed $450,000 at a favorable interest rate from Fleet Bank, which is part of the same Rhode Island financial conglomerate.
Ms. Holtzman said she did not promise the firm anything. "I have never promised anybody any city business in return for any campaign contributions," she said, through her spokeswoman, Maerwydd McFarland. "I am outraged that on the eve of a primary these smear tactics and allegations continue."
In an interview on New York 1 News last night, Ms. Holtzman declined to say whether city business had come up at the breakfast. But asked later what she would have done had it come up, she said, "I would say there are ways of applying for it or terminate the conversation immediately."
 
Not Waiving Confidentiality
 The timing of the disclosure, on the eve of the Democratic primary, left Ms. Holtzman with little time to counter it. The information was reported by bank executives and law-enforcement officials, and it was not clear whether any of them had specific political motives against Ms. Holtzman.
Last night, Ms. Holtzman again refused to allow the release of a report by the city Department of Investigation about the loan. The report has been forwarded to the city Conflicts of Interest Board, which is reviewing it and could release it if Ms. Holtzman waives her right to confidentiality.
Bank officials and investigators said Ms. Holtzman received about $3,000 in campaign contributions from executives of Fleet Securities at a breakfast meeting with her on June 11 last year, just moments after the officials had pitched the firm's desire to obtain a greater share of the city's bond underwriting. Such fund-raising events are routine in New York and both the city and the state comptrollers have held them.
The 45-minute meeting between Ms. Holtzman and the firm's president, John O'Brien, took place about 8 A.M. in the Vista Hotel in the World Trade Center, participants said. The other Fleet officials at the meeting were Brigitt Jandreau-Smith, Joseph Bosch and Gregory Licalzi. The meeting was also attended by Sheila Levin, the Holtzman campaign's finance director.
Over breakfast, the executives tried to convince Ms. Holtzman that Fleet should be given a greater share of city bonds to sell, participants in the meeting said. They specifically mentioned that Fleet was interested in being promoted to co-manager, a coveted status in municipal bond underwriting, bank officials said.
Senior managers and co-managers, which are selected jointly by the Mayor and the Comptroller, are guaranteed a larger share of the city's $5 billion-a-year bond business than other firms, which sell bonds on a free-lance basis.
 
$3,000 in Contributions
 At the end of the meeting, as the group stood to leave, Mr. Bosch handed Ms. Levin an envelope containing about $3,000 worth of campaign contributions from Fleet executives, some of whom were not at the meeting, according to participants and Federal Election Commission records. The records show that Ms. Jandreau-Smith contributed $500; two other Fleet vice presidents, John Flynn and Robert Speer, gave $1,000 each, and a fourth executive, William Homann, contributed $500.
Thomas Lavelle, a spokesman for Fleet Bank, confirmed that the meeting had occurred and said Fleet wanted to call attention to "its interest in expanding business within the city."

HEADLINE: Questions Linger in Explosion Case;
Trial of Four of Seven Suspects in Bombing of World Trade Center Opens Today

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Under extraordinary security, the trial of four of the seven men charged in the World Trade Center bombing opens today in Federal Court in Manhattan, promising the first comprehensive picture of a crime that shook American complacency about terrorism. After almost seven months of investigation, prosecutors have concluded that the plotters had sought to collapse a 110-story trade center tower, killing thousands.
The defendants -- Mahmud Abouhalima, a 33-year-old Egyptian cabdriver, and three men with Palestinian roots, Ahmad M. Ajaj, 27, Nidal A. Ayyad, 25, and Mohammed A. Salameh, 25 -- contend that the charges are flawed by false identifications and that the Government is putting Islam on trial. 
 For all the attention the case has generated, many questions linger: How did the scheme come together? Did the bombers act alone or with the help of a foreign power or international terrorist group? Why did they strike? The riddles may not be solved at the trial. But here is what has come to light on some of the key points.
 
Motives and Clues
 Why the plotters picked the World Trade Center as a target and what they hoped to gain through the attack remains unclear. Some evidence suggests political motives but lawyers close to the case say the plot was propelled by religious fervor. Some experts believe the trade center was chosen as a symbol of Western power. Others believe it was simply chosen at random from a list of possible targets.
Perhaps one of the most explicit pieces of evidence is a letter sent to The New York Times four days after the blast and signed by the Liberation Army Fifth Battalion that claimed responsibility for the bombing that killed six people. It said that unless the United States cut ties with Israel and met other demands involving Middle East policy, more attacks would follow.
The letter, which Federal agents described as authentic, also claimed that "more than 150 suicidal soldiers" were ready to attack other United States targets.
Investigators said that by retrieving an erased computer file and comparing saliva samples, they were able to trace the letter to the personal computer of Mr. Ayyad, a Kuwaiti-born chemical engineer, who worked at Allied-Signal in Morristown, N.J.
Later in March, United States officials said they were given a report of an alleged confession by another defendant, Mr. Abouhalima, during his detention in Egypt.
Egyptian officials told the United States that Mr. Abouhalima had said the blast was to punish the United States for meddling in Middle Eastern affairs. Mr. Abouhalima, they said, told them that the plotting had been done in Afghanistan among veterans of the anti-Soviet war, that two self-described Iranian intelligence agents had approved the plan and that two Iraqis who disappeared before the blast had aided in the crime.
Mr. Abouhalima also reportedly said that the plotters had been sent money collected by the militant Islamic Group, whose spiritual leader is Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, and the Muslim Brotherhood. They were also financed, the Egyptians say he told them, by Iranian businesses and Islamic institutions from Saudi Arabia and Europe.
 
Disavows Confession
 Mr. Abouhalima was returned to United States custody on March 24 and was found to have burn marks on his groin. He later disavowed making a confession, saying any statements were extracted under torture and were unreliable. They will not be introduced in the trial.
Nevertheless, the other two suspects in the case, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, 25, and Abdul Rahman Yasin, 33, are both missing and believed to have fled to Iraq. Federal officials have offered $2 million rewards for each of them. Another man, Bilal Alkaisi, 27, a Jordanian, is charged in the case, but was set aside for later trial.
Investigators, meanwhile, have tried to trace hints of international involvement through bank and telephone records. Early reports cited transfers of large sums of money from abroad into some of the defendants' bank accounts and telephone records show numerous calls from their homes to Germany, Iraq and Egypt.
But without more evidence, prosecutors are not expected to tie the attack to foreign sponsorship.
The Government has, however, through an indictment in another bombing case, linked the trade center bombing to a larger terrorist conspiracy, centered on a group that it says is headed by Mr. Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric who was tried and acquitted in the assassination of Anwar el-Sadat.
Members of that group, they say, including Mr. Abouhalima, El Sayyid A. Nosair and Clement Rodney Hampton-El, met as early as January 1990 at Kennedy International Airport and later gathered at mosques and homes in Brooklyn and Jersey City. Mr. Nosair was charged but acquitted in the killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the militant Jewish leader, later that year. Mr. Hampton-El, Mr. Nosair and others are now charged with belonging to a terrorist group that is accused of plotting not only the trade center blast, but also the bombing of the United Nations and the Hudson and Lincoln tunnels and the murder and kidnapping of civilians and officials.
Transcripts from the second case, made from secretly taped meetings with a Government informer, also indicate that the trade center bombers may have believed that attacking the Lower Manhattan landmark dominating the city's skyline would deal a crippling economic blow to New Yorkers, while striking at an important symbol of the Western world.
But lawyers close to the case suggest the 110-story tower may also have been chosen at random from several New York City landmarks.
Mr. Ayyad's lawyer, Atiq Ahmed, has challenged the Government's evidence on the letter from the Liberation Army to The Times, claiming that the retrieved computer file does not match the letter.
As for the financing, defense lawyers say that the Government's evidence suggests that the sums expended in the plot were negligible, conflicting with Mr. Abouhalima's reported statements about major foreign contributions.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks to Keep World Trade Talks on Track

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
With France waging a strenuous campaign to overturn last winter's trans-Atlantic deal on farm subsidies, top American and European officials met here today in an effort to prevent the dispute from tearing apart seven-year-old world trade talks.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's vice president for external economic affairs, met twice today with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, in search of concessions to offer the French without actually renegotiating the farm subsidy deal. 
 But Mr. Kantor, who expressed skepticism at his Senate confirmation hearing in January about previous American concessions, said in a telephone interview afterward that he offered nothing new on the deal, which the Bush Administration completed last November at Blair House, the White House guest quarters.
"We're not going to reopen Blair House -- we made that quite clear to Sir Leon," Mr. Kantor said.
A European official who insisted on anonymity said that the community still hoped to complete world trade talks that began seven years ago this month in Punta del Este, Uruguay. "Sir Leon remains optimistic that the Uruguay Round will be completed by the Dec. 15 deadline and will include the Blair House accord," said the official, who declined to elaborate.
The goal of the global talks is to put trade in agriculture and services under the free-trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
Bentsen Expresses Concern
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said this afternoon that he had warned European leaders against any effort to change the farm subsidy deal. "I'm deeply concerned about any possibility of opening up the Blair agreement," Mr. Bentsen told a small group of reporters. "I strongly urged a number of the European leaders not to do that, that I thought it would endanger GATT and the Dec. 15 deadline."
Reuters reported from Brussels today that Spain had aligned itself with France in opposing the Blair House agreement.
Mr. Kantor said that the United States had recently sent letters to a number of European capitals warning them against any retreat from the agreement. He said he was not surprised by the current frictions within the community and remained hopeful that the global trade talks could be completed.
"Any time you come to an end of a negotiation as important as the Uruguay Round, with as many diverse interests, there are a number of parties who will begin to negotiate strongly," he said.
The Bush Administration's farm subsidy agreement headed off planned American tariffs of 200 percent on white wine and oilseed from the European Community. The Bush and Clinton Administrations have never taken the legal steps to end the threat of retaliation, and American officials are discussing the possibility of reviving it if the community retreats from last year's deal, Washington trade experts said.
But Mr. Kantor said that he never raised this possibility during his conversations today with Mr. Brittan, and that neither side made any threats at all.
The Blair House Agreement was actually two pacts. One pact resolved a long-simmering trade dispute over the community's subsidized production of soybeans and other oilseeds. The other pact was a deal to set limits on subsidized grain exports as part of ongoing global trade talks.
Officials involved in the deal have said that the United States made large concessions in the oilseeds talks while the European Community made concessions on grain exports. France has since expressed a willingness to accept the oilseed deal but not the grain export pact.
The French strategy has infuriated Clinton Administration officials and amused trade analysts. "They're trying to treat Blair House like salami, where you can cut off one piece, when it's really a pot au feu," a stew, said Carol L. Brookins, the president of World Perspectives Inc., a Washington agriculture consulting firm.
"This really is typical French negotiating strategy -- they love to negotiate a deal and then keep what they want out of it and renegotiate the rest," she said.
French officials have contended in recent weeks that the Blair House Agreement is not final because the community's member governments have not formally endorsed it. So they say they want further negotiations, not renegotiation.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Little Changed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury bonds and intermediate Treasury notes rallied most of yesterday as traders and investors seemed to be betting that today's inflation report will be moderate. But late in the afternoon, as traders and investors seemed to lose some of their nerve, prices fell and the market wound up little changed on the day.
"Traders were reluctant to stay with this thing in front of a high-risk number," said Joel Marver, the chief technical analyst at Technical Data in Boston. 
 It is not that forecasters expect bad news when the Labor Department releases the Consumer Price Index for August this morning. But with prices so high and yields so low, they fear there could be some sharp selling either today or later this week as the market finally takes a break after one of its sharpest rallies in recent years.
"Say the number is bullish and the market moves up but not sharply," Mr. Marver said. "That is where you could look for the correction to begin."
The price of the 30-year bond finished unchanged with the yield at Friday's 5.87 percent, just above the 25-year low of 5.86 percent reached last Wednesday.
The prices of the 10-year and seven-year notes each inched higher, rising by 1/32 . The yield on the 10-year note remained unchanged at 5.27 percent, while the yield on the seven-year note slipped to 4.86 percent from 4.87 percent. These yields are still a little above their recent lows.
But as the prices of longer-term securities were unchanged or slightly higher, the prices of shorter-term securities fell. The price of the two-year note was off 2/32 as the yield, which moves in the oppositie direction, rose to 3.81 percent, from 3.77 percent Friday. The price of the three-year note slipped 3/32 , with the yield rising to 4.10 percent from 4.07 percent.
In the weekly auction of Treasury bills, the average discount rate on the three-month bill was 2.98 percent, up from 2.95 percent a week ago, while the average discount rate on the six-month bill was 3.06 percent, up from 3.03 percent.
On Wall Street the consensus for the Conseumer Price Index is for no change to a slight increase of just one-tenth of 1 percent.
At the same time, the Commerce Derpartment will release the retail sales data for the last month. The consensus forecast here is no increase in sales.
If the forecasts are correct, both pieces of data should reinforce the beliefs that underly the recent bond market rally: that inflation will remain moderate, with prices possibly rising this year at a slightly slower rate than in 1992. And the economy continues to be sluggish, defying expectations that growth would pick up in the second half of the year.
But the market may have set itself up for a little disappointment. The reason is that the unexpectedly sharp decline in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, which was reported Friday, raised expectations for the consumer price report due out today.
The producer index dropped six-tenths of 1 percent last month because of a 25 percent decline in tobacco prices. After the report, many forecasters revised their predictions for the Consumer Price Index, generally reducing their forecasts by about one-tenth of one percentage point.
Before Friday, the consensus for the Consumer Price Index had been an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent. Now if the report shows an increase of two-tenths, it could prompt some selling.
The continuation in the decline in the price of gold seemed to add to the feeling that inflation, which is the bond market's biggest headache, is well in check. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the price of gold dropped $7.60, to $343.10 an ounce. The price of gold is now down 16 percent since it reached a recent high of $408.10 an ounce on Aug. 2.
While gold is often seen as a barometer of inflation, it is probably not as significant right now as the decline in oil prices. A drop in demand and record production levels have combined to push the price of oil to its lowest level in three years. Some analysts now believe the price of oil could reach its lowest levels since the price collapse of 1986, when the price of a barrel of oil dropped below $10 and the Consumer Price Index rose just 1.1 percent for the year.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Judge Names Panel to Study Life on Juries

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Concerned that for many people, jury service is unpleasant and a financial burden, and that juries may not adequately reflect the ethnic makeup of their areas, two of New York State's top judges yesterday named a panel to propose an overhaul of the jury system.
The marching orders that Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye gave the committee include looking into the use of unemployment rolls or other lists to broaden the pool of potential jurors, improving the chances that a person called up for a pool of potential jurors will actually serve on a panel, eliminating some exemptions from jury service, and increasing the $15 a day jurors are now paid. She also asked the panel to look into the possibility of providing child care and work areas for potential jurors. 
 Her suggestions for obtaining candidates from untapped sources and raising their pay would require action by the state Legislature. But with others, like speeding up the system for calling and processing jurors, she has the authority to order changes.
New York jurors are now drawn from voter-registration, motor-vehicle and tax rolls, which together include about 90 percent of the people, but which tend to miss transients and many of the poorest.
Judge Kaye made the announcement along with the state's Chief Administrative Judge, E. Leo Milonas. The 30-member committee -- made up of judges, lawyers, executives and academics -- was told to report its recommendations by Jan. 1.
Colleen McMahon, the panel's presiding officer and a partner at the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, said that "half of all the jury questionnaires sent out get thrown away." To many jurors, she added, "it seems like everything is done for the lawyer's convenience or the judge's convenience, and nothing for their convenience."
Judge Kaye said a matter of particular concern was how much time the members of jury pools spend doing nothing. "When people are brought in and have to wait a great deal, sometimes in uncomfortable places, and don't ever get to serve on juries, I think that feeds a negative perception of the system," she said.
If jurors' time could be used efficiently, she said, fewer jurors would have to be called, service could be shorter, and there would be a greater chance of hearing cases.
The panel will also address concerns raised two years ago by the state's Judicial Commission on Minorities, which concluded that blacks and Hispanics were generally underrepresented on juries.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Both Sides Voice Optimism About Avoiding Ford Strike

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 13

 BODY:
With the deadline closing in on them, officials on both sides continued to predict today that the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union would sign a new labor contract by Tuesday night, avoiding a strike.
Even if they miss the deadline, which falls at 11:59 P.M. Tuesday, negotiators are likely to continue talking, officials said, since they have not reached an impasse. 
 Such 11th-hour bargaining is not unusual in automobile talks. If the two sides settled early, it would be harder for the company to convince its shareholders, and the union to convince its members, that they achieved, respectively, the scrawniest or the fattest deal possible.
"They're working hard, and they'll work into the night," said David M. Caplan, a Ford spokesman.
 
Separate Situation in Canada
 In Canada, where the Canadian Automobile Workers are facing a Tuesday deadline on a separate agreement with the Big Three auto makers, talks appeared to be making progress today. After making an initial offer that displeased the union, the Chrysler Corporation, the lead company in the Canadian negotiations, made a richer offer over the weekend. The Canadian auto workers are seeking wage increases and more holidays.
Chances of avoiding a strike had improved, said Miriam Edelson, a spokeswoman for the Canadian union, but she added, "There is still a long way to go."
Investors appeared to be optimistic about settlements. Ford stock gained $1.375 a share, to $55, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. Chrysler rose $1.25, to $45.50, and the General Motors Corporation was up 75 cents, to $47.50.
In the bargaining at Ford, the top negotiators -- Jack Hall, a Ford vice president, and Owen F. Bieber, president of the U.A.W. -- did not plan to meet today, instead directing bargaining by several subcommittees of representatives.
The negotiations are occurring at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, just west of Detroit. A strike against Ford has been authorized by the U.A.W. membership.
The most contested issues, including how to cut health care costs and insure greater job security, have not yet been settled, but such matters are traditionally not settled one by one. Instead, each subcommittee determines the cost of the benefits, and then the lead negotiators total them up to perform their last-minute horse-trading on the basis of a total economic package.
Under the current contract, an assembly line worker at full scale earns $17.01 and hour, with 35 paid days off each year.
Once finished at Ford, the union will use the agreement as a pattern in bargaining with Chrysler and the General Motors, where the current three-year contracts have been extended indefinitely.
Once ratified by the U.A.W. membership at the Big Three, the contracts will cover about 400,000 active workers and 390,000 retirees and surviving spouses.

Zen of First Impressions About Being in College

BYLINE: By George Judson

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
FOR more than an hour, the students in English 101 had wrestled with an essay seemingly written not merely to challenge them, but to defeat them. Now the instructor, Monica Marciczkiewicz, urged them to reflect on the author's argument. "It's so much in the air," she said, "that it's very easy for us to agree with what she is proposing." She added, "You can think about it at home."
Home? An abstract concept if there is one, on the campus of Rutgers University in the first weeks of the fall semester. Several thousand 18-year-olds have left home to come here, and finding a new one in this academic community of 33,000 is likely to take a while. They are assumed to be stunned, dazed and overwhelmed, even those who couldn't wait to get away, who endured high school like the line in a Morrissey song, "I'm just passing through here on my way to somewhere civilized." 
 Do they miss home?, ask parents, for whom sending a child off to college holds all the thrills and anxieties of launching a rocket. In Tinsley Hall, a dormitory for first-year students on College Avenue, the answer is a qualified yes from those gathered on a recent afternoon.
What do they miss? "The food." "Security." "My mom." "A bathroom around the corner." "Towels in the bathroom." "Soap." What don't they miss? "Parents." "Brothers." "Sisters." "Having to say where you're going."
Suddenly they lead communal lives, young men and women passing each other in the hallway in bathrobes each morning, open doors inviting unexpected visitors, dinner served not at their seat in a dining room, but at the end of a long line in a dining hall.
"The worst thing is just adjusting to the lack of privacy, to having a roommate," said Bil Curran, from Berkeley Heights. "To your roommate's music," someone added.
"I'm more adjusted than I thought I'd be," said Amy Smith of Anderson, S.C. "But we're all lost together," said Joanna Lindenbaum, of Paramus.
Rutgers' mission may be research and education, but its first order of business each fall is getting everyone settled. The first-year students ("freshmen," to older, less correct generations) arrive early for three days of orientation. Workshops and discussion groups explain how to use the library and the computer center, how to avoid sexual assault, how to get along with classmates who don't look like the neighbors back home.
Registering for courses offers a first lesson in bureaucracy. Crowding onto the buses that shuttle students and professors between classes on the four campuses here offers a first lesson in commuting. At night, fraternity parties serve free beer, and the "grease trucks" parked near the fraternities are still selling gyros and burgers at 3 A.M. Education can strike anywhere, anytime.
"I'll speak for everyone," said Thomas Grimaldi, also of Paramus, taking on the subject of drinking. "I don't do it, but all my friends do." His friends all laughed.
In the 1980's, when New Jersey had money, Rutgers spent hundreds of millions on its research centers, leading to complaints that undergraduates were being neglected. In his three years as president, Francis L. Lawrence, a scholar of 17th-century French literature, has worked to address those complaints, even as recession has eroded the Legislature's support, requiring both higher tuition and larger classes.
He celebrates the liberal arts, while his deans try to open up the immense university to students who sometimes sit in lecture sections larger than their entire high school class.
"The professors want to interact, but a student has to take the initiative," said Susan G. Forman, the dean of undergraduate studies. "The individual attention is there if they want it."
At midday in the student center on College Avenue, students -- nearly all of them male -- fed quarters into video games in an arcade. But across the hall, every terminal in the computer center was taken.
In English 101, Ms. Marciczkiewicz guided students through the killer essay, an appeal for multicultural education by Mary Louise Pratt, a Stanford University professor. A few buildings away, a political scientist lectured on dead white males named Hobbes and Locke and Jefferson.
A new, all-embracing way of life was taking shape. "You're not part of the world," said Theresa LeComte, of Lenox, Mass. "You're just part of the Rutgers world."
Yet what a world. In Mattia Hall, other students talked about their new home. "In high school, it's total routine," said Kristen Tahan, of Kinnelon. "It's the same exact thing every day. Here, it's something different every day."
Robert Skinner leaned forward and held out his wrist. "It's true," he said. "I never owned a watch before. I had to buy one to know what time it is."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Slow Trading Before Price and Sales Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies in light trading yesterday in anticipation of fresh reports on the American economy.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6085 German marks, up from 1.5975 marks on Friday. It also rose to 106.27 Japanese yen, from 106.10. 
 Traders said the dollar strengthened against the German mark as investors positioned themselves for the economic reports scheduled today on consumer prices and retail sales for August. In addition, they said, investors locked in profits by selling currencies that had recently gained against the dollar.
 
See Dollar Advancing
 Some traders also appeared optimistic that the dollar would strengthen further as European central banks pay off loans they had taken from the Bundesbank of Germany to defend their currencies during the monetary turmoil in Europe in July.
In recent weeks, the European central banks have been selling dollars and buying marks to repay their loans, causing the dollar to decline.
Albert Soria, a vice president at Kansallis Osake Pankki, a Finnish bank, said the strengthening of the dollar was "partly a correction to a serious downtrend established in conjunction with the replenishment of Deutsche mark reserves."
The dollar also gained on the yen as traders anticipated an interest rate cut and other measures to stimulate Japan's economy and shrink the Japanese trade surplus.
The head of the Bank of Japan, Yasushi Mieno, said at a news conference yesterday that the central bank was not considering a rate cut. Such cuts, however, are not normally disclosed in advance.
"The market is still expecting a cut" in the Japanese discount rate, said Margaret Kudarauskas, a foreign exchange specialist with Technical Data in Boston. A lower interest rate would be likely to push the yen down because yen-denominated investments would earn less and therefore be less popular.
Among other currencies, the British pound fell to $1.5455 in New York yesterday, from $1.5520 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Buffalo Election Finds Troubled City at Crossroads

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Sept. 13

 BODY:
There is a sense in this city of aging factories and corner taverns that things are at a turning point, and not only because the man who has been Mayor for 16 years is not seeking re-election this year.
Crime is more widespread and more violent. City finances are increasingly desperate. The schools are struggling. And the middle class is fleeing. 
 With 73 percent of the city's voters registered Democrats, there is a good chance that the winner of Tuesday's Democratic primary will become the Mayor who has to deal with it all.
In the view of Henry L. Taylor Jr., director of the Center for Applied Public Affairs Studies at the State University of New York at Buffalo, voters will choose "a leader who will guide Buffalo through one of the most complex and difficult periods in its history."
 
A Difference in Spending
 The Democratic candidates are Anthony M. Masiello, 46, a state senator who is also running on the Liberal Party line, and Eugene M. Fahey, 42, majority leader of the city's Common Council, also running on the Conservative line.
The Erie County Democratic party and a number of unions, black lawmakers and community leaders and others have endorsed Mr. Masiello, and he is ahead in the polls. Mr. Fahey has fewer endorsements, which he says proves his independence.
Mr. Masiello said he would spend $400,000 to $500,000 on the primary, and Mr. Fahey said he expects to spend about $150,000.
There is no Republican mayoral primary since no one is challenging the party's endorsed candidate, Richard A. Grimm 3d, a 32-year-old lawyer in his first run for office. Though Mr. Grimm has been waging an active campaign, Republicans constitute only about 15 percent of the city's 165,000 registered voters.
 
A Focus on Crime
 The new Mayor will replace James D. Griffin, the independent Democrat who announced his retirement in May. During 16 years in office, Mr. Griffin presided over redevelopment of the city's downtown and waterfront, but his relations with the Common Council, minorities, businesses and other groups have grown increasingly antagonistic.
As the Democratic primary campaign has unfolded in this city of 328,000 people, crime has been by far the hottest issue.
Buffalo had a larger increase in property crime last year than 14 other cities of similar size, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Buffalo also posted the second-largest increase in murders among those cities.
Both Mr. Fahey and Mr. Masiello say they would put more officers on the streets by reorganizing the Police Department, a plan that includes closing some precinct station houses to reduce desk jobs.
 
Concern About Deficit
 Mr. Fahey, the son of a retired Buffalo police captain, said he would add 150 officers to the current police roster of about 920. He said he would get the $4.3 million to pay for it by finding savings in other city operations. Mr. Fahey also advocates a youth curfew.
Mr. Masiello, whose father is a retired city streets department foreman, said the city could not afford to hire more police officers. He dismissed a curfew as unworkable, instead suggesting more recreation programs to keep youths off the streets.
The candidates also have focused on Buffalo's fiscal problems. The city raised property taxes 20 percent last year, but it still faces projected deficits of more than $20 million a year for the next four years. Both candidates said they would consider reorganization of city agencies and employee concessions to save money. Both say they want to avoid tax increases but will not rule them out.
Andrew J. Rudnick, president of the city's Chamber of Commerce, said Mr. Fahey and Mr. Masiello have done a good job of discussing the issues. Rather than endorse either candidate, the chamber announced this week that it considered the two equally qualified.
Mr. Taylor, from the State University of New York at Buffalo, said he has been disappointed by the campaign. He said the focus on crime, for which he blamed polls and the media as much as the candidates, has crowded out a more visionary debate that could have helped develop a new consensus among the city's fragmented constituencies.
 
Backgrounds in Politics
 "I know both candidates well, and this campaign has not reflected the depth of their understanding," Mr. Taylor said.
"Crime and police enforcement is a problem," he added, "but it's not nearly as big a problem as economic development and neighborhoods in decay."
Mr. Fahey said the issues were all tied together, but crime must be a priority. "It's affecting our ability to do anything else," he said. "Neighborhood preservation, education, it's all being undermined by crime."
For his part, Mr. Masiello said his many endorsements show that he can forge consensus. "I'm the candidate who can bring all the factions of the city together," he said.
A Buffalo News poll of 1,000 Democrats, published on Sunday, found that 51.1 percent of respondents supported Mr. Masiello and 21.8 percent supported Mr. Fahey, with a margin of error of 3 percentage points. But Mr. Fahey said his own most recent poll shows that 44 percent of voters were still undecided.

HEADLINE: Some Doubts On Economy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
A leading Administration economist said today that there were substantial risks that economic growth over the next year would fall short of the 3 percent rate the Administration has forecast.
The economist, Alan Blinder, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, also said that the unemployment rate, currently 6.7 percent, would probably remain stuck near 6.5 percent at the end of 1994, helping to make life difficult for Democrats in next year's Congressional elections. 
 Just last month, the Administration lowered its economic forecast for the year, and Mr. Blinder's remarks indicated that more reductions might be forthcoming. He said factors that could keep growth lower than forecast were a delay in the expected pickup in housing construction and the deeper-than-anticipated recession overseas.
Speaking at an economic conference here, Mr. Blinder said the Administration did not need a cut in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve to maintain the economic recovery, but he also seemed to warn the Fed against raising rates. He said that because of recent good inflation news, he thought the Federal Reserve was no longer thinking of raising short-term interest rates soon.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in July that he was uneasy about having short-term interest rates so low because those rates, after subtracting inflation, are around zero. But Mr. Blinder said he saw no reason for the Fed to raise rates, arguing that inflation remains under control and that it is not at all unusual for inflation-adjusted interest rates to remain near zero during periods of economic sluggishness.

HEADLINE: Compaq Disputes Japan Ministry's Bid Procedure

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 13

 BODY:
In what could be the start of another dispute between the United States and Japan, the Compaq Computer Corporation has complained about a recent decision of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to obtain more than 2,000 notebook computers from the NEC Corporation of Japan.
In a letter sent earlier this month to Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of the trade agency, Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president, raised questions about NEC's low bid, which was half that of Compaq's. Mr. Pfeiffer also said the agency's emphasis on price alone, rather than on machine abilities, made it difficult for foreign companies to participate in Japanese Government procurements, according to a Compaq spokeswoman. 
 Mr. Pfeiffer's letter comes as the United States and Japan are beginning negotiations to flesh out a new trade framework agreed to in July. Procurement of foreign products by Japan's Government is one of the major areas to be covered by the framework.
 
Procedure Called Fair
 Any dispute with a procurement by the ministry itself would be particularly embarrassing because it is the agency that negotiates trade agreements and because it has assumed the mantle of promoting imports to Japan.
A ministry official involved in the computer procurement, who asked that his name not be used, said the procedure was fair. "Among the proposals that met the requirements, we picked the lowest-priced bid," he said. An NEC spokesman said the company's bid was not unfairly low.
Mr. Pfeiffer's letter also comes as Japan's Government is preparing to buy 11 new supercomputers and thousands of personal computers as part of an effort to stimulate Japan's slumping economy. The American computer industry and the American Government have been pressing Japan to make sure that American companies have a fair chance to compete for the orders.
American computer companies have long complained that while they have competed successfully in selling to Japanese companies and individuals, they have been virtually locked out of the public sector market.
"If there was truly a transparent and open and clear bidding system, these questions wouldn't be coming up over and over again," said David Pollack, director of Japan market development for the American Electronics Association, a trade group.
 
Accord Signed in 1992
 To address these concerns, an agreement calling for increases in Japan's procurement of foreign computers was signed by the United States and Japan in 1992. But the agreement has not been carried out because the two countries cannot agree on whether a foreign computer means a computer made by a non-Japanese company, as the United States contends, or a computer made outside of Japan, even by a Japanese-owned company, as Japan contends.
Still, Mr. Pfeiffer's letter apparently is relatively mild and might not escalate into a big dispute. There is an argument to be made that Compaq offered machines that were more powerful and therefore more expensive than was required.
The ministry asked for bids to supply 2,250 notebook computers using chips that process information 32 bits at a time along with software and maintenance. Compaq offered computers based on the Intel Corporation's powerful 486 microprocessor. NEC offered machines based on the less powerful 386 microprocessor, which is becoming obsolete.
NEC proposed to rent its machines to the ministry for 4,750 yen, or roughly $45, a month for each machine. Compaq's bid was 10,500 yen, while Fujitsu bid 7,250 yen and Toshiba 10,300 yen.
Yukiko Nemoto, a spokeswoman for Compaq's Japanese subsidiary, agreed that NEC's computers met the ministry's requirements. But Compaq was questioning why the ministry did not pay more attention to its future needs and buy a more powerful machine. She also said Compaq suspected that NEC's bid was extremely low because the company was clearing its inventory of machines that have little market life left.
 
The 'Compaq Shock'
 Compaq itself is no stranger to competing on price. The Houston company broke into Japan's personal computer market last October by introducing machines selling for half the price being charged by Japanese companies. The resulting "Compaq Shock" set in motion a restructuring of Japan's insular personal computer market.
Cray Research, the leading American manufacturer of supercomputers, complained last year of unfair procedures when it lost a bid to NEC to supply a machine to a Japanese Government research institute. A Japanese review panel, however, upheld the award.

At Last, a Game That Counts (for the Phillies, That Is)

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

 BODY:
The Phillies had come, and so there was significance, if not electricity, at Shea Stadium last night. Oh, the sounds of individual vendors could be heard, and almost any seat in absolutely every section was available. But there was meaning in the innings, and a passion about the final result.
And when the game was over, the Phillies had reduced their magic number to 14 because the blind magic of the schedule had made the Mets their opponents. The Phillies, with an economy of effort and a mimimum of drama, beat the Mets, 5-0. 
 No runs, no more damage, one more reason to believe that the immense lead the Phillies had constructed early on in the National League East was going to survive. The Montreal Expos, on fire but on hold last night, fell to five and a half games back.
The Phillies, profiting from six walks and casually overcoming the minor mental strain of having stranded eight men in the first six innings, outwaited and outmaneuvered Bobby Jones. Against the rookie right-hander, who was alternately unhittable and uncertain, the Phillies took a 1-0 lead on Lenny Dykstra's run-scoring single in the third. A sacrifice fly by Pete Incaviglia in the sixth increased the lead to 2-0, and a pair of runs off Jones in the seventh sealed the deal.
"This club does what it has to do," said Manager Jim Fregosi.
Tommy Greene, hardly indomitable, was too much for the Mets. The right-hander struck out six and allowed only six hits, and he kept a serene Shea perfectly silent.
The evening began with plenty of noise, all of it coming from the clubhouse of the Phillies. Clubhouse noise. It is baseball's great September insulation -- from fear, from reporters, from thinking too much.
And so, the radios, television sets, air conditioners, music and talk in the visitors' clubhouse at Shea was all vibrating, with all dials turned up. The footsteps of the Expos couldn't be heard -- at least not as loudly as they had been.
"Mood? You're asking my mood?" Dykstra said in answer to a question. "Hey, man, I just walked in."
The mood was one of cocky arrogance, and the question had nothing to do with Lenny's afternoon cup of coffee. The idea was to get a handle on a club that has lost most of its grip on the N.L. East. The Phillies, nine and a half games up a week ago, began last night only five games ahead of the Expos.
"As long as you have a lead," said Milt Thompson, the outfielder for the Phillies, "you don't have a worry."
And so Darren Daulton and Incaviglia, shirtless and profane, sat and played cards in the clubhouse. Dave Hollins, the third baseman with the noted game face, sunk into his personal existential exile in front of his locker. Dykstra, who long ago lost his limberness because of injury and his inflated pectorals, awkwardly muscled his way into his unirform.
"Worried? Do I look worried?" asked Dykstra. "Man, worried. That's a big word."
 
Kruk Human, Mulholland Hurt
 Big and bad, a lot like the Phillies looked for most of the season. But then the Expos went 18-4 and first baseman John Kruk went from machine (.340 for the season's first half) to mortal (he has hit barely .260 over the second half). The Phillies went 2-5 at Veterans Stadium recently against the Cubs and the Astros. And the status of Terry Mulholland, who went out with a hip flexor injury in his last start, is uncertain for the rest of the season. The city of Philadelphia, with the collapse of 1964 etched forever in its memory, made the worst sort of September noise. It doubted out loud.
"It'd be kind of messed up to lead the whole season and then blow it at the end," said Thompson.
"Hey, the fans are knowledgeable in Philly," said Dykstra. "They expect good things to happen at home. What happened wasn't good."
 
Please, Not to Worry
 What will have to happen for the Phillies to fold is still extraordinary. For example, the Phillies, who have played .602 baseball for more than five months, could go 8-10 and the Expos would have to post a 14-5 mark to finish dead even at the top. And the Phillies, who will play their final three games against the Expos in Montreal this weekend, play five of their next eight games against the Mets and Marlins, clubs that are a combined 67 1/2 games out of first place.
"We can turn it around right here," said Hollins. "Look, the Expos are a good club that's played unbelievably. They would have made up ground on anyone."
The Expos, though, might have made up as much ground as they are going to. After all, they don't get to play the Mets again until later in the month. The Phillies might have played the Mets just enough to have put the race out of reach by then.

HEADLINE: Illiterate Americans

 BODY:
Half the adults in the United States can't read or do simple math, according to an Education Department study. Pretty shocking; but what does it really tell us about America's ability to function as a society?
First of all, things are not getting worse. As the study observes, "Today we are a better educated and more literate society than at any time in our history." Second, even those who do have problems with sentences and sums don't seem to feel at a disadvantage. Most of the respondents at the two lowest levels of proficiency (respondents were divided into five levels) said they could read or write English "well" or "very well." 
 What has changed -- and it's a recent change -- -- are our expectations. Only in the last 20-odd years, for instance, have colleges and universities become truly serious about increasing the diversity of their student bodies. Only in that period have we begun to expect anything like truly equal opportunity at success for all Americans.
As a nation, we are still shedding the durable assumption that a literate elite would make the decisions for a less educated majority. The kind of egalitarianism that demands truly equal opportunity is still in its infancy, a struggling legacy of the civil rights movement and idealism of the 1960's.
Another change during the last two decades is in the nature of work in America. Well-paying jobs requiring little education have been disappearing. At the same time, the growth of the suburbs has depleted the cities of their middle-class residents, the people who pay property taxes to finance schools and who protest most effectively when schools don't deliver. Just as it becomes harder to get good work without a good education, good education itself is becoming more elusive for the increasingly isolated children of the cities.
The survey, conducted by the people who also conduct the Scholastic Aptitude Tests for college admission, confirms conventional wisdom: The more literate you are, the less likely you are to depend on food stamps or to be in prison, and the more likely you are to have a decent income.
But it's almost certain that the same things could have been said at any point in our history. The difference now is that our sensibilities have changed, and so has the job market. In earlier decades Americans were more accepting of social inequities, while the economy was kinder to those without much learning.
For those who can read it, the lesson is pretty clear. Disinvestment in American cities, and particularly in their public schools, is dangerous. While more Americans expect a fair shot at success, the gap between skilled and unskilled workers' income, particularly between those with and without college degrees, gets wider.
A large percentage of people who scored in the bottom group on this survey were older, or were immigrants, or had physical, mental or health problems. But that still leaves many who couldn't solve everyday problems such as reading a pay stub or a bus schedule. The workplace of the 21st century will have very few places for such people.
Such a message tests another kind of literacy: Americans' ability to read the message in conflicting social and economic trends, and to act accordingly. Reading this survey, it's hard to escape the conclusion that we are badly undereducated for our times and that the United States needs to invest widely in public education.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Now, What Arabs Can Do

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
So now it is up to the Arabs, Arabs in the new Palestine being created, and Arabs far beyond.
On Feb. 15, 1993, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel said that the more the Palestine Liberation Organization lost its authority the better it would be for progress toward peace. 
 Two weeks later he said Yasir Arafat himself was a big obstacle to peace. And on May 3, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres wrote a letter to the American Zionist Organization: "Supported by hard evidence we believe the P.L.O. is engaged in terrorist activities and is therefore no partner for any negotiations or dialogue."
But six months later, in a day that would move a stone to hope, the two Israelis stood with Mr. Arafat at the White House. They had opened its doors to him by recognizing him and his organization as the representatives of the Palestinian people. And they had agreed to a peace plan that is bound to lead to an independent Palestine, sooner than later.
For Mr. Arafat it was sudden pinnacle -- recognition, world applause, immediate control over Gaza and Jericho, and the clear road to Palestine.
In exchange, he had only to repeat earlier commitments -- to kindly recognize Israel's right to exist, and to end terrorism and violence. He forgot to say that last part at the White House.
As The Jerusalem Post has asked, what happened in the past six months to make the Israeli leaders change their minds about the worthiness of Mr. Arafat and the P.L.O. as partners in creating peace? Labor gives no clear reply I can find. But in the logical answer lie the clues as to whether the hopes will live or die.
The P.L.O. was staggering, bankrupt, abandoned by most of its Arab allies because of Mr. Arafat's adoration of Saddam Hussein during the gulf war as the true hope of the Palestinian cause.
The fundamentalists were growing in power on the West Bank. Recognition of the P.L.O. by Israel can cut either way -- reduce fundamentalists' influence or put them in position to take over an independent Palestine, perhaps by ballot. Israel will not be able to send in the army when it does not like a change in the new Palestine's government.
It was not a sudden burst of confidence in Mr. Arafat that was the key to the Labor Government's decision. It was the belief that the Arab nations, bereft of Soviet support and fearful of the fundamentalists they helped create, were ready for peace with Israel and that a deal with the Palestinians would speed the day.
So now it is up to the Arabs in and beyond Palestine.
If they will it, peace can happen. But they will have to reach for it, stretch for it, accept risks -- as has the current Government of Israel in its own desire for an end to fear and killing.
As Mr. Rabin said about his decision on the P.L.O., it will not be easy. For a half-century, officials, intellectuals, journalists, teachers and clergymen have supported and sustained the war against Israel.
In their press, preaching and in broadcasts beamed to the world they vilified Israel not just as their own enemy but as the agent of imperialism, the enemy of all peoples newly come to freedom.
In countries in Africa and Asia where Jews had never lived they came to be seen as evil. The line between Arab anti-Israeli propaganda and anti-Semitism is often impossible to find because often it does not exist.
Foreigners who have an Israeli visa in their passports are barred at Arab borders. For a half-century, Israel has been boycotted politically and economically without protest from most of the world.
A declared end to boycotts, to ceaseless hate propaganda, not as the price of treaties but now simply as acceptable international conduct -- is that asking too much too early, as I am often told? No -- it is a half-century overdue.
Geography has not changed for Israel. Mr. Rabin, like his predecessors, once believed that the West Bank was essential to give Israel the needed mobilization hours if war came. Now he believes security lies more in peace arrangements than in time and space. Many Israelis and foreign friends of Israel, including me, are nervous about that.
Having committed itself, as is its right, the Labor Government can say or do little to assuage those fears. From now on, it is up to the Arabs to do that, Arabs in Palestine and far beyond.

HEADLINE: Scientists Confront Renewed Backlash on Global Warming

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
AS the Clinton Administration prepares to announce in the next few weeks a plan for controlling waste industrial gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, conservatives and industry groups have mounted a renewed assault on the idea that global warming is a serious and possibly catastrophic threat.
In a drum roll of criticism over the last few months they have characterized the thesis of global warming as a "flash in the pan," "hysteria," "scare talk" and a ploy by socialists to justify controls on the economy. 
 The rhetoric is the mirror image of some that was heard five years ago, at the height of the 1988 North American heat wave, when some environmentalists and politicians warned of climatic apocalypse on the basis of assertions by a minority of scientists that global warming was already under way.
The evidence that warming or harm from warming will occur in the foreseeable future is "ludicrously small," argues a 1993 book published by the Cato Institute, a free-market research organization in Washington. Reining in global warming "will require a degree of bureaucratic control over economic affairs previously unknown in the West," wrote Ben W. Bolch and Robert D. McCallum, professors of economics and chemistry at Rhodes College in Memphis, in the book, "Apocalypse Not: Science, Economics and Environmentalism."
Dr. Dixy Lee Ray, the former Governor of Washington and a former chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Commission, called carbon dioxide "an unlikely candidate for causing any significant worldwide temperature changes" in another 1993 book, "Environmental Overkill: Whatever Happened to Common Sense?"
In recent months, a number of newspapers, including The Washington Times and The Wall Street Journal, have published articles debunking global warming. In the July issue of Commentary, Jeffrey Salmon, executive director of the George C. Marshall Institute in Washington, stated categorically that there is "no solid scientific evidence to support the theory that the earth is warming because of man-made greenhouse gases."
In the midst of this revisionist onslaught, whom is the public to believe?
Global warming is not a cut and dried issue, and scientific experts are still debating most of its aspects. But few scientists are to be found at either of the extremes that have characterized the political debate. A substantial number of highly regarded climate researchers have long believed that global warming set off by industrial and automotive emissions is a real possibility that could have serious consequences sooner or later. But they cannot say exactly how severe the effects of the warming will be or when it will come. And very few climatologists are ready to declare that global warming has begun. Most believe that no clear sign of human-induced change has yet made itself apparent amid the wide natural fluctuations of the earth's climate.
There are two undisputed facts about global warming: first, carbon dioxide, the waste gas produced by burning coal, oil and wood, has been accumulating in the earth's atmosphere over the last century; and second, the gas traps heat that is produced when the sun's energy is absorbed by the earth and then re-radiated.
Given those physical facts, the practical question of interest is how much the earth's climate will heat up after injection of a given amount of carbon dioxide. Since no experiment can answer that question, other than the global one now in progress, scientists have turned to their next best method, which is to simulate the earth's climate system in a series of equations that are run on a supercomputer. This exercise, known as computer modeling, is somewhat contentious because the models are far from perfect and represent a simpler, stripped-down version of the earth's real climate.
After examining results from the best computer models, a scientific advisory committee to the United Nations concluded in 1990, and again in 1992, that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide -- expected to occur by the year 2100 without remedial action -- will raise the average global temperature by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit. In comparison, the earth has warmed by only 5 to 9 degrees since the last ice age.
The United Nations panel and various committees of the National Academy of Sciences, made up of leading experts in the field, have consistently found merit in the global warming theory. Still, the issue is far from settled and critics of global warming continue to attack the models' predictions on various grounds.
One, Dr. Richard Lindzen, a meteorologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argues that the computer models fail to account accurately for the role of water vapor, a heat-trapping gas which by its sheer quantity exerts a far stronger greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide.
Most climatologists believe carbon dioxide is pivotal because the warming it induces, though quite small in itself, causes more water to evaporate from land and sea. The water vapor in turn traps more heat, thus amplifying the effect of the carbon dioxide.
Dr. Lindzen denies that this amplification takes place, and if he is right, then a doubling of carbon dioxide would indeed cause little or no greenhouse problem. But other climate researchers dismiss his argument as speculation, whereas the amplifying role of water vapor is well documented, in their view.
Critics of global warming say that the computer models cannot be trusted because they fail to reproduce the exact pattern of warming actually experienced over the last century. The models predict that in response to a 25 percent rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the last century, average global temperature should have risen by 2 degrees. In fact the climate has warmed by 1 degree.
Defenders of the models counter that with an extra refinement -- taking into account the fact that industrially emitted sulfate aerosols reflect sunlight -- the models' forecasts match the historical record much better.
Besides the imperfections of computer models, critics point out an apparent anomaly in global warming theory: that over the last century the chief rise in global temperature occurred before 1940, though most of the carbon dioxide has been spewed out since then. Defenders respond that the climate is an erratic system and that a neat, constant relationship between gas input and temperature rise should not be expected.
The critics go on to say that the small temperature spike seen so far could easily be nothing but another jiggle in the zigzag course of the climate's normal variability. Climatologists almost universally agree that this is indeed possible. The United Nations panel said it was equally possible, however, that a natural cooling trend could be masking an even larger greenhouse warming than what has been observed.
 
Estimates of Global Warming
 Conservative columnists and industry groups have jumped on another apparent discrepancy, that the models predict greater warming in the arctic than seems to be the case. Defenders say the measurements were not made in places where the warming would be most manifest, and that many observations have borne out the greater warming predicted for northern latitudes.
The models appeared to gain some important empirical support last December when Martin I. Hoffert of New York University and Curt Covey of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory reconstructed two ancient climates, one much warmer than today's and one much colder. Since they were able to estimate temperature changes and prevailing carbon dioxide levels from evidence in the geological record, they were then in a position to answer the critical question -- at least for those two periods -- of how much warming is produced by a given rise in carbon dioxide levels.
Their answer was that when carbon dioxide levels double, the temperature of the atmosphere rises by about 4 degrees. This figure agrees well with the best estimate from the computer models which, in the view of the United Nations panel, is that a doubling of carbon dioxide induces a 4.5-degree rise in average global temperature. Some scientists believe the Hoffert-Covey findings rule out a warming in the lower end of the panel's broader range of 3 to 8 degrees. A climate system that responds so sluggishly to external forces could not have produced the great temperature swings of the past, they say.
Dr. Lindzen, on the other hand, questions the Hoffert-Covey study's utility in predicting future climate change on the ground that the climate may have behaved differently in the remote past.
Critics note that evidence for the observed global warming trend ofthe 1980's depends on ground-based measurements of temperature, which amount to only a sampling of the whole earth. These measurements are also suspect, in the critics' view, because many of the measuring sites are near cities, which are warmer than the surrounding countryside. Satellite observations that started in 1979 failed to see any warming trend. Defenders say the satellite measurements could be distorted by atmospheric factors, that their record is too short to support any generalization and that the ground-based temperature measurements have been correctly calibrated to discount warmth from cities.
Some critics contend that even if the atmosphere does heat up, the warming will be benign. Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, a meteorologist at the University of Virginia, points out that the warming seen so far has made itself evident mostly at night and in winter. If that continues, he argues, global warming will be a boon, not a catastrophe. Growing seasons will be longer, winters less harsh and plants invigorated by rising carbon dioxide will grow faster.
But Thomas R. Karl, chief of the global climate laboratory at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., responds that the warmer nights may have other causes, possibly natural, quite apart from greenhouse gases. James E. Hansen, a climatologist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, notes that warmer winters, far from being welcome, could disrupt the chilling that many plant seeds must experience to germinate properly in the spring. Botanists have found that carbon dioxide does spur plant growth, but also that the plants can then outgrow their nutrient supply, making them less nutritious as food.
As for other effects of the predicted warming, the United Nations panel estimated that an average global warming of 4.5 degrees would cause sea level to rise by two feet by the year 2100 and would make heat waves more frequent and cold spells rarer. Model simulations have suggested that although average global rainfall would increase, the interiors of continents would become drier, droughts more common and tropical storms more violent. Some climatologists also believe that climatic zones would shift and regional weather patterns would be dislocated, disrupting agricultural production and natural ecosystems. But these effects are regarded by climatologists as being uncertain.
Where does all this leave the debate?
Issues in science are not decided by taking votes, but polls of climate researchers show that most believe there is a better than even chance that the climate will warm by at least 3.5 degrees over the next century.
Climatologists also know that once in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide stays there for centuries; whatever climatic effect it has will not be reversed in several human lifetimes. This may partly explain why the weight of opinion among climate scientists, as measured by polls, is that lack of certainty should not stand in the way of prudent steps to control greenhouse gas emissions.
Indeed, a panel of the National Research Council -- the Government's chief source of scientific advice -- concluded in 1991 that "despite the great uncertainties, greenhouse warming is a potential threat sufficient to justify action now."
How much action, what kind and how soon is an economic and political issue of great consequence in a world that runs on the burning of fossil fuels. Proponents of the greenhouse theory therefore need not be surprised at the intense fire now being rained down on their ideas.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: The Overview;
JORDAN AND ISRAEL AGREE ON A BASIS FOR FINDING PEACE

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Basking in the afterglow of the accord on Monday between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel and Jordan signed an agreement today that provides the basis for resolving 45 years of hostility between them.
Although on paper the Israeli-Jordanian agreement merely sets out a formal agenda for negotiations, it represents the most important step the two countries have taken toward making peace. 
 Some of the issues described in the document have essentially been resolved in negotiations in Washington over the past year. But the accord gives both sides the ability to put some of these agreements into effect, a process that could lead to normal relations between the two one-time foes even without formal diplomatic ties and a peace treaty.
 
First Steps
 Within weeks, the ban on travelers with Israeli stamps in their passports could be lifted, phone and communications links set up, water resources allocated, boundary disputes settled and joint industrial and maritime projects begun, Jordan's Prime Minister, Abdel Salem Al-Majali, told foreign journalists today.
The breakthrough between Israelis and Palestinians has created a palpable sense of momentum toward peace in the Middle East, tearing down formidable barriers with breathtaking swiftness.
En route home from Washington, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel made a surprise visit to Morocco today for talks with King Hassan, an important move toward establishing relations with Morocco as well as with a number of other Arab countries. [Page A16.]
 
Arafat on Capitol Hill
 In Washington, Yasir Arafat courted Congress, appealing during a breakfast with 20 Senators for loan guarantees for the Palestinians and winning a promise that the Senators will review American laws that bar financial aid to the P.L.O. As part of a media blitz to convince skeptics here and in Israel that he will be a responsible partner in peacemaking, Mr. Arafat said over lunch at the National Press Club that he believed that even the status of Jerusalem could be resolved.
But in a grim reminder that the process of peacemaking is only beginning, a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip died in a suicide attack on an Israeli police station and another tried to stab a soldier before being shot to death.
 
Jordan Under Constraints
 For Jordan, it is one thing to sign an agenda and quite another to make a formal peace with Israel. King Hussein, by tradition and temperment a cautious man, for years has functioned under internal constraints that include the presence of a large Palestinian refugee population and demands for increasing democratization; there are also external constraints, including the fact that he is flanked on part of his border by an important financial power, Saudi Arabia, and on other parts by two militarily superior countries, Iraq and Syria.
Although the King has met Israeli leaders in secret at times during his 41-year reign, he has not so far indicated any willingness to follow the lead of King Hassan by welcoming Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, to Amman.
Caught off guard by the secret negotiations between the P.L.O. and Israel, he has a major stake in how the Israeli-Palestinian agreement is implemented and for geographic and demographic reasons cannot take himself out of the Palestinian equation.
His brother, King Crown Prince Hassan, said last week that Jordan was concerned that the creation of an autonomous Palestinian enclave, as envisioned by the Palestinains and Israelis, could unleash factional violence in the occupied territories that could spill over into Jordan, home to 1.5 million Palestinian refugees. Jordanian officials have said they will try to prevent a new influx of Palestinian refugees if security in the territories deteriorates.
Compared to the celebration on the White House lawn on Monday, today's moment of contact between Israel and Jordan in the State Department's Jefferson Room was brief, subdued and anti-climactic. Only a few dozen Administration officials, Israeli and Jordanian officials and journalists looked on as Elyakim Rubinstein, Israel's chief negotiator, and Jordan's Ambassador, Fayez Tarawneh, sat at a table covered in cranberry-colored cloth and initialed what is called an "agenda for peace."
 
'Another Step'
 "Today we are making yet another step in the long road to peace between Israel and Jordan," Mr. Rubinstein said. Mr. Tarawneh expressed hope that it will produce "a comprehensive peace that will transform the lives of all peoples in the area."
In one of the many ironies of the rush to peace, Mr. Rubinstein, who opposed the P.L.O. agreement, boycotted the White House ceremony on Monday and flew to Washington only to sign the Jordanian agreement he helped broker.
Despite today's agreement, it could take a number of years before Jordan and Israel sign a formal peace treaty. Just as Jordan's agreement with Israel was ready to be formally announced early this year, but put on hold because the King wanted progress on the Palestinian front, Jordan has made clear that it will only sign a peace treaty with Israel as part of a comprehensive Middle East peace. "When we talk about the demarcation of borders of any kind or normalization of relations, they would have to be in the context of the comprehensiveness of the peace process," Mr. Taranweh said in an interview. "Normalization should follow a peace treaty. We have to keep balance with our other partners."
Jordan and Israel are expected to begin negotiations on the agenda signed today in a new round of talks in Washington in October, he added.
Until now Jordan, as well as Syria, has refused to agree individually to any settlement with Israel comparable to the step Egypt took at Camp David in 1978, when it negotiated the return of the Sinai Peninsula.
 
A State of War
 Technically, Jordan and Israel, whose armies clashed in 1967 and again in 1973, are in a state of war. In 1990, the tacit support King Hussein of Jordan gave to Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait and his opposition to the deployment of American troops in Saudi Arabia enraged Israel.
But the two countries have cooperated for more than a decade to stop guerrilla attacks along their common border and are in a de facto state of peace. In the American-led peace talks in Washington over the last year, they have made progress toward resolving many of their differences.
But in response to a question after the ceremony, Mr. Tarawneh stressed that any final peace treaty would depend on agreements between Israel and its other Arab neighbors.
The Jordanian-Israeli agreement could lead to settlement of their joint border, guarantees for Jordan's security and joint efforts to harness water resources, protect the environment and develop the Dead Sea region. But the most divisive issue between the two countries is the future status of the 1.5 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan.
 
Request for Aid
 Jordan will ask Israel for compensation for maintening such a large refugee population, Mr. al-Majali told reporters in Amman, although he declined to say how much Jordan would seek.
At the White House today, President Clinton built on the optimism left over from Monday's agreement, saying, "I'm looking forward to beginning work immediately on the United States' part of implementing this agreement." One illustration of the Administration's commitment, and concern, was a cable sent Monday night by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to about a dozen American embassies in Europe, Asia and the Arab world instructing them to raise money from their host governments for an American-led fund for Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
Mr. Clinton also praised King Hassan of Morocco for receiving Mr. Rabin today, predicting that other Arab countries will follow suit. Morocco and Tunisia are expected to formalize diplomatic ties with Israel within weeks.
Now that a day has passed, some of the mysteries surrounding Monday's events have been solved. Asked on the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour on Monday night why he had shaken Mr. Arafat's hand, Mr. Rabin replied, "I couldn't in front of the President of the United States and enormous number of people, dignitaries that were invited from the Arab World, from the United States, from Israel, from Europe, when he offered his hand, to say no in front of all the cameras of the world."

-- A just solution to the problem of refugees and displaced persons.
 
-- Efforts to secure "the right for water shares of the two sides" and to find ways to alleviate water shortages.
 
-- Settlement of territorial matters "and agreed definitive delimitation and demarcation of the international boundary between Jordan and Israel."
 
-- Exploration of possible bilateral cooperation, within a regional context where appropriate, on natural resources, human resources, infrastructure, economic areas including tourism.

HEADLINE: Tourist Killed in Florida, Prompting New Patrols

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 14

 BODY:
A British tourist driving in Florida was shot to death in an apparent robbery attempt today, the second such slaying in less than a week. Hours later Gov. Lawton Chiles, facing reports that frightened vacationers are canceling their travel plans, ordered state law-enforcement agencies to begin guarding all Interstate highway rest areas across Florida.
The Governor's action came only hours after a British tourist, 34-year-old Gary Colley, was shot to death at a rest stop on Interstate 10, about 35 miles east of Tallahassee, becoming the ninth foreign tourist killed in Florida in the last year. His companion, Margaret Ann Jagger, 35, was wounded in the early morning attack. 
 Officials also announced that because of the rash of attacks on foreign visitors in recent months, the state was indefinitely suspending its tourism advertising in the United States and abroad. Greg Farmer, Secretary of the Florida Department of Commerce, described the twin killings as "catastrophic" for tourism and said the percentage of vacation cancellations from abroad was reaching double digits.
 
Huge Losses Feared
 "Right now there is a great amount of interest in these unfortunate incidents," Mr. Farmer, whose office oversees the $31 billion-a-year industry that is the backbone of the state's economy, said this afternoon. "To be running ads saying everything is wonderful, come on down, only highlights the problem and is counterproductive."
That decision means an advertising campaign begun in July and based on the slogan "One Florida, Many Faces" will be canceled. About $2 million was to be spent in the United States and abroad for those print and television ads, officials said.
Mr. Farmer said that it would be several days before the full economic impact of the killings could be measured but that losses "could be in billions" of dollars. He and other officials said calls to European tour operators and Florida tourism offices abroad indicated that canceled reservations might reach 30 percent.
 
500 Officers Deployed
 Governor Chiles deployed more than 500 auxiliary highway patrol officers for temporary patrol duty at the 76 rest stops along the state's main highways, and he said several hundred more may be summoned. The round-the-clock patrols will continue, he vowed, until a permanent private security force can be hired.
"We are not going to tolerate these kinds of offenses against our citizens or against our visitors," Mr. Chiles said at an afternoon news conference in Tallahassee, the state capital.
Since last October, nine foreigners, two of them Britons, have been killed during robbery attempts while vacationing in Florida. Mr. Colley's death comes six days after a German tourist, Uwe-Wilhelm Rakebrand, was shot to death in Miami as he was driving from the airport to a hotel.
Mr. Rakebrand's killing was widely publicized in Europe, which has been the fastest-growing market for Florida tourism in recent years, and raised questions about the safety of the 42 million people who visit the state each year. There has been a series of break-ins at hotels frequented by tourists in the Orlando area, and a black visitor from New York was kidnapped and set on fire in a racially motivated attack near Tampa in January.
In addition, the Jacksonville area was plagued last year by random sniper attacks on motorists on Interstate 95, the main highway connecting Florida to the Northeast. The three dozen attacks led to one death, several automobile accidents, a blizzard of negative publicity and a rare travel alert by the American Automobile Association. The attacks ended after Mr. Chiles called out the Florida National Guard and the police arrested gang members and charged them with the crimes. The patrols have also ceased.
 
National Problem?
 Today's killing, coming barely a month after the father of the basketball star Michael Jordan was discovered slain in similar circumstances in North Carolina, seemed likely to add to fears about highway safety in Florida and beyond. Some state officials here, arguing that the problem is national in scope, called for legislation to make any criminal attack on tourists a Federal offense.
Sheriff Ken Fortune of Jefferson County, where the attack occurred, said Mr. Colley and Ms. Jagger, both from Yorkshire, in northern England, were attacked shortly after pulling into a rest area on a remote stretch of the highway, which runs from Los Angeles to Jacksonville. He said the couple were preparing to sleep in the car about 2:25 A.M. when two men on foot approached the vehicle on both sides and tapped on the windows.
"I think the motive was robbery," Mr. Fortune said during a telephone interview. "When the couple began to pull out in the car, these fellows cut loose shooting at them."
Mr. Fortune said they had only a sketchy description of the assailants, provided by a rest stop attendant. They were described as young black males, possibly teen-agers, and were last seen heading east on Interstate 10 in a red car. A car matching that description was found late today in nearby Monticello.
The police said Mr. Colley and Ms. Jagger rented a red Chevrolet Cavalier in Orlando on Thursday and drove to New Orleans, where they remained until Monday. They were apparently on their way to the Tampa Bay area, where they were scheduled to return the car later this week, when they were set upon.
Sheriff Fortune said nothing about the attack indicated that Mr. Colley and Ms. Jagger were preyed upon because they were foreigners or tourists. He noted that their car had no stickers or corporate logos that would identify it as a rental vehicle and that it bore ordinary Florida license plates without the prefix formerly used to identify rental cars.
"There's nothing there" to reveal to criminals that they were not native Floridians, he said.
Last year, 1,263 homicides were reported in the state, but Sheriff Fortune said they were rare in his rural county and that this was the first of the year.
Nearly 1.1 million Britons visited Florida last year. In Britain, Mr. Colley's death was treated as major news on radio and television newscasts tonight and by afternoon national newspapers. The Evening Standard ran a front-page headline that proclaimed "Florida Gang Shoot Britons," and the BBC broadcast a tape recording of Ms. Jagger's frantic 911 phone call to police.
"He's dying, he's really dying," she could be heard crying. "Please help."

Dividing a Homeland

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
And now for the hard part.
The importance of Monday's handshake between Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel is that with one gesture it transformed the problem between them from an ideological struggle over who is the rightful owner of historic Palestine into a practical one over how to share the same living space. 
 Indeed, the document they signed was less about how they should live separately -- that won't happen for a while -- and more about how they are going to live together for an interim period of five years while Israel tests the P.L.O. as a secure and stable neighbor. Only after the P.L.O. proves it can live with Israelis might it be allowed to live entirely without them.
The reason that this sharing will prove difficult is that up to now Israel has physically controlled it all, and not simply in military terms, but also in functional ones: from education text books, to the number of oranges that a Gaza farmer can export, to taxation, tourism, and even permission to dig for archeological artifacts.
 
'He Needs Space'
 "For us to finally recognize Arafat from the outside is one thing," said Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli historian. "I can say hello to him on the street. But that is not all. Now he is coming into my house. We are going to share some of the rooms. And he needs space, and that is going to be the difficulty at all levels. Because we are not just talking about physical space. We are talking about everything. It is much more complicated than the peace treaty with Egypt. There, space was being divided. Here it is being shared."
At least for a few years.
The agreement between Israel and the P.L.O. sets a timetable for the two sides to negotiate the details of their coexistence. Their quick calendar looks like this: Within 30 days Israel and the P.L.O. begin negotiations over the details of Israel's troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Within two months those negotiations are supposed to be completed, and a Palestinian police force, made up mostly of pro-Arafat P.L.O. fighters from abroad, will be imported to keep order in Gaza and Jericho. Quietly, Israeli and P.L.O. intelligence services will then have to begin cooperating to protect Mr. Arafat and to contain the militants who oppose the agreement.
At the same time, elsewhere in the West Bank, the Israeli military government and civil administration will transfer power to "authorized Palestinians" in five spheres: education and culture, health, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism.
 
Completion of Withdrawal
 Four months after that, Israeli troops are supposed to be fully out of Gaza and Jericho, although they will just be down the road, surrounding both places. Within 10 months of today, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are to hold elections for a self-governing council, the exact powers of which Israel and the P.L.O. still have to define.
Two issues will be critical: who will control water resources and who will control land-use zoning. Both are now in Israeli hands. Somehow they will have to share, because Israel draws water, for instance, from under the West Bank to irrigate fields as far away as Tel Aviv.
Also in the 10th month, by the eve of the Palestinian elections at the latest, Israeli military forces, by then already withdrawn from Gaza and Jericho, will redeploy outside populated areas in the rest of the West Bank. Israeli forces will remain responsible for protecting Israeli settlers and the roads they use, as well as the external borders.
 
Talks on Final Status
 In two years, negotiations between Israel and the P.L.O. over final status of the territories are to begin, and within five years the final status of who will control what is to be resolved. Only then will real, and total, separation be theoretically possible.
Until then, the Israelis will be doing most of the giving, and Mr. Arafat will be doing most of the taking.
Consider a few examples:
*It is very difficult in Israel to get mobile telephones because the army controls so much of the air waves for its own communications. How many channels will the Palestinians get? In such a small space, everyone has to share.
*Israel now tightly controls the exports of fruits and vegetables to different markets, always making sure that lower-cost Palestinian farmers are limited in what they can sell to Israel's prized markets in Europe. Now they will have to share those markets.
*The accord speaks about the possibility of Israel granting Palestinians a broadcasting license and television station. Again, space will have to be found on the air waves to accommodate them. Will Palestinian broadcasts be subject to Israeli military censorship?
*The vast majority of males in the Gaza Strip work in Israel. Mr. Arafat cannot afford for Israel to seal its border with the Arab populated areas of the Gaza Strip; otherwise, his population will not have enough work, at least in the near future.
*Territorial boundaries remain to be determined. Jericho, for instance, is both a town and a governmental district. Jericho town is a few square blocks that can be traversed by car in five minutes. The Jericho district is almost as big as the Gaza Strip. Which area the Palestinians will control -- the town or the district -- still has to be negotiated.
Whatever the outcome, Israel will still need free civilian access to Jericho, which sits astride a main north-south highway and the bridges over the Jordan River.
These negotiations, and the degree of sharing between Israelis and Palestinians, are going to be influenced by several factors.
The most important is money. It is no accident that Mr. Arafat's influence in the West Bank has fallen since Saudi Arabia and the other Persian Gulf states cut off his money two years ago because he supported Iraq in the gulf war. Iran stepped into the vacuum and began giving money to the Hamas Muslim organization, which then began to dominate politics in Gaza.
 
Money Brings Power
 If Mr. Arafat can begin to pour money into Gaza, Jericho and the rest of the West Bank, he can enlarge the pie that he and the Israelis will have to share and thereby get a bigger slice for himself. The less dependent he is on Israelis for creating jobs, the more he is able to improve roads, sewers and communications in Gaza and Jericho, the more popular he is going to be; if there is no money, he will be in trouble.
The second factor that will influence the negotiations is the interplay of Arab politics on the Israeli psyche. It was a breakthrough for Prime Minister Rabin to go to Morocco on his way home from Israel, and a critically important overture by King Hassan II to receive him.
For the message it sends to the Israeli public is that reconciliation with Mr. Arafat means more than just getting him as a neighbor, which doesn't exactly thrill most Israelis. It also means opening up the Middle East to Israelis, for travel and commerce. Again it comes down to space. It is a lot easier for Israelis to share their limited home with Mr. Arafat if they feel a neighborhood that previously shunned them was now ready to embrace them.
 
The Syrian Factor
 But there is a wild card in this inter-Arab game and it is called Syria. Although President Hafez al-Assad's Ambassador in Washington attended Monday's signing ceremony, Mr. Assad cannot be happy that Mr. Arafat, his old rival, has stolen a march on him. The Clinton Administration and Mr. Rabin's Government have only so many economic and political resources they can devote to peacemaking at one time, and it is likely that the P.L.O. is now going to take up most of them.
Mr. Arafat needs space not only from Israel, but from the Arabs as well. If Mr. Assad is unhappy, he can use his surrogates in the Palestinian community to shrink Mr. Arafat's political space, by challenging his legitimacy, forcing him to drive unrealistic bargains with Israel and even threatening his life.
Neither Israeli nor American officials have an answer yet as to how they intend to keep Mr. Assad interested enough to leave Mr. Arafat alone, but not so interested that Mr. Rabin feels pressured to withdraw on both the Syrian and Palestinian fronts at once.
But if Mr. Assad is unhappy, the region will know about it. As one Syrian official put it: "How do you think President Assad felt watching Yasir Arafat received at the White House while Syria is still on the State Department terrorism list?"

HEADLINE: U.A.W. and Ford Bargain Past Deadline for a Strike

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Wednesday, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Unable to resolve issues that have dogged labor negotiations for months, leaders of the United Automobile Workers continued talking with the Ford Motor Company early today as they passed a midnight deadline, rather than striking its plants.
For days, union and company officials had predicted they would sign a new labor agreement before the deadline. But in a marathon session on Tuesday negotiators found they still could not agree on answers to such thorny questions as how to control health care costs, how long the contract should run and how to preserve and create more jobs at Ford. 
 The 96,000 U.A.W. members who work for Ford had authorized the union to call a strike. An hour after their deadline had past, U.A.W. leaders still had not indicated whether a strike would be necessary.
During the 1990 negotiations with the General Motors Corporation, bargainers continued their talks for 44 hours past the deadline. Fatigue, union officials said, can make both sides more reasonable.
Meanwhile, negotiators for the Canadian Auto Workers said they had reached a tentative agreement with the Chrysler Corporation on a three-year contract covering about 10,500 workers in Canada. Details of the agreement were not disclosed. In both the United States and Canada, the unions negotiate an agreement with one of the Big Three auto makers that then serves as a pattern in bargaining with the other two.
Here at Ford's headquarters, the company continued to press the union for concessions on health care, seeking to erect a two-tier system whereby newly hired workers would have a less generous benefits plan than current workers, whose health care costs are fully paid. Ford plants are operating at full capacity, and the company is expected to hire thousands of new workers in coming years.
While opposing such permanent changes between the compensation for current and new workers, the union has left open the possibility of letting the companies pay new workers lower wages, provided they eventually "grow in" -- that is, catch up with current workers. The U.A.W.'s firm position made the company's continued insistence surprising, and raised the possibility of a strike that both sides had repeatedly predicted would not come.
"They are playing a game of very hard bargaining close to the wire, which means neither side can fully predict the outcome," said Harley Shaiken, a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in labor relations. "When you have the ability to settle, and yet some tough issues involving matters of principle are still on the table, that means there's still some uncertainty."
The U.A.W. began negotiating with Ford, Chrysler and G.M. on June 26 -- a month earlier than usual, because, union officials said, the issues this year are so complex. On Aug. 30, the union selected Ford, the No. 2 auto maker with 96,000 workers, as the lead company in negotiating a pattern agreement.
 
Intense Bargaining at Ford
 Since then, negotiators have been bargaining intensely on the second floor of Ford's headquarters here. At a less frenzied pace, bargaining has continued at G.M. and Chrysler, where the existing contracts have been extended indefinitely. Once signed, the contracts will cover 400,000 active workers and 390,000 retirees and surviving spouses.
Leaders of U.A.W. locals around the country said Tuesday that they were preparing to strike, but did not expect to. "You always have to prepare, just in case," said Al Kent, vice president of Local 882 in Hapeville, Ga., who was rounding up people to walk picket lines.
At Local 182 in Livonia, Mich., leaders prepared to set up a strike fund. "If Ford wants a strike over the issues, we should," said E. A. Bundoff, the local's recording secretary. Mr. Bundoff rejected the idea of paying new workers less. "I don't buy it," he said. "I'm ready to hit the bricks for it and shut Ford down."
Cutting wages or benefits for new hires, some U.A.W. members argued, could pit workers against one another and jeopardize the benefits of retirees down the road, when the new workers collectively have enough votes to strike back.
 
Warning by Union
 For days, company and union officials had been predicting a settlement by the deadline. The first sign of a snag came Tuesday morning, when Owen F. Bieber, the U.A.W. president, who had avoided reporters during negotiations, strode into the press bivouac on the first floor here and called a briefing. Mr. Bieber criticized news reports earlier Tuesday that he said suggested the contract was "an automatic fix" and that negotiators were merely marking time until the deadline.
"The process better speed up, or the clock will catch up with us," Mr. Bieber said. He said there were "major problems that have to be resolved."
Despite that warning, Mr. Bieber went on to sound the same grimly optimistic tone that union officials have been striking in recent days: "We can get a settlement, in my opinion, by the deadline, but it's going to take a lot of tough work to get there."
The statement, carried live by some Detroit television stations, may have been intended as a signal to reassure the membership, and warn the company, that union negotiators were still pushing for an agreement on their terms.
 
Length of Pact at Issue
 Among other issues still on the table Tuesday night was the length of the contract itself. Normally, the contracts run for three years, but this time Ford is trying to extend its life to six. In 1950, G.M. negotiated a five-year contract.
"For a prosperous firm like Ford, it makes some sense, because it gives them stability," said Richard N. Block, a professor at the School of Labor and Industrial Relations at Michigan State University. Communication between the union and Ford is so good, he said, that "the need for the three-year get-together to check up on each other is less now."
While a six-year term would probably also be good for Chrysler, he said, the benefits to G.M., the industry's ailing giant, are less clear. "I think that it would make less sense at G.M. -- it would be less attractive to lock something in for six years," Mr. Block said.
Late in the bargaining, officials on both sides assign economic costs to each of the changes they are seeking to make. By adding those costs together, they arrive at the total package they consider acceptable. As a result, issues are not resolved one by one and taken off the table, and negotiators can still find themselves trading a concession on one issue for a gain on another at the 11th hour.
In Canada, workers had been seeking improved pension and higher wages from their target company, Chrysler. In addition, the union wanted more holidays and limits on overtime, changes that officials argued would force the companies to hire new workers.
"We've reached a tentative settlement, and it's a very good agreement," said Miriam Edelson, a spokeswoman for the C.A.W., in a telephone interview from Toronto. "It includes wage increases, some movement on pensions, and some movement on reduced work time that we were looking for."

HEADLINE: THE 1993 PRIMARY;
Turnout Is Low For the Primary

 BODY:
Fewer people voted in yesterday's Democratic primary then in any other Democratic primary since World War II. Only about 520,000 voters bothered to vote, or 23 percent of the city's 2.3 million registered Democrats.
That was fewer even than in 1981, when 578,000 Democrats, or 32 percent of those registered, voted in a race between then-Mayor Edward I. Koch and Frank J. Barbaro that was confused by a 12-day delay in the primary caused by court actions over a re-districting plan for the City Council. 
 In the last mayoral primary in 1989, when David N. Dinkins beat out Mr. Koch, more than 1 million voters went to the polls, or about 50 percent of registered Democrats.

HEADLINE: THE 1993 PRIMARY: BUFFALO;
As Expected, State Senator Wins Democratic Mayoral Primary

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Sept. 14

 BODY:
State Senator Anthony Masiello, endorsed by the Democratic Party for Mayor of Buffalo, easily fended off a challenge today from City Councilman Eugene Fahey.
Polls that showed Mr. Masiello leading Mr. Fahey by a more than 2-to-1 margin going into the primary proved fairly accurate: with 94 percent of the vote in, Mr. Masiello had 63 percent of the vote and Mr. Fahey had 37 percent. 
 "It teaches me a few lessons," Mr. Fahey said in his concession speech an hour after the polls closed at 9 P.M. "Maybe I'll start believing in polls before I announce for another office."
Mr. Masiello called Mr. Fahey "a worthy opponent" and said he wanted him in his campaign.
"As a fellow Democrat, I extend my hand to Eugene Fahey to join our campaign of inclusion," Mr. Masiello said.
Buffalo is overwhelmingly Democratic, and a primary win should virtually assure Mr. Masiello a victory in the November election to succeed Mayor James D. Griffin, who is stepping down after 16 years.
The Republican candidate, Richard Grimm 3d, does not see it that way.
"When people see how hard we're running, I don't think people are going to think that for very long," he said.
The main issues in the campaign have been economic development, housing, rising crime and poverty in Buffalo's minority neighborhoods.
Mr. Fahey had proposed creating local economic development zones to spur business, including one along Buffalo's waterfront, which the city is trying to redevelop. He also favors converting empty retail space in downtown Buffalo into housing.
Mr. Masiello wants to open a city commerce office to coordinate Buffalo's economic development strategies. Buffalo's economy has been hurt by the loss of major manufacturing employers, but Mr. Masiello said future job growth in the city rests with small businesses.
In the Albany mayoral race, Alderman Gerald Jennings narrowly defeated Harold Joyce, chairman of the county legislature, in the city's Democratic primary.
Mr. Jennings had gained support with calls to open up and diversify city government after decades in which party insiders had handpicked their candidate for mayor, who was then swept into office by the party faithful.
Incumbent Mayor Thomas M. Whalen 3d has been nominated to a Federal judgeship for the Northern District of New York and is not seeking re-election.

HEADLINE: THE 1993 PRIMARY: WESTCHESTER;
Democrats Pick Brodsky To Challenge O'Rourke

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Richard L. Brodsky, an outspoken six-term assemblyman, captured the Democratic nomination for Westchester county executive today and with it a chance to topple the Republican incumbent, Andrew P. O'Rourke.
After weeks of nasty crossfire over personal ethics and tax policy, the 47-year-old Mr. Brodsky defeated Andrew J. Spano, County Clerk for the last 11 years. His victory, by 51 percent to 49 percent, came even though the county's Democratic leaders supported the 57-year-old Mr. Spano. He immediately turned his fire on Mr. O'Rourke. 
 In declaring victory tonight, Mr. Brodsky, who lost to Mr. O'Rourke four years ago, said: "Andy O'Rourke is a tired, self-contented politician who cannot face the future with a clean slate or a clean plan."
The Democrats believe they have their best chance in years to win the county executive contest because Mr. O'Rourke is considered vulnerable. He admitted earlier this year that three people close to him -- his daughter, the woman he lives with and her son -- all obtained work with county contractors. An investigation by Mr. Vergari found that none of these transactions violated state laws.
Mr. O'Rourke tonight dismissed Mr. Brodsky as a "hack politican from Albany" and said his frequent votes to raise taxes in Albany would make him an easier opponent to defeat than Mr. Spano.
At 10:45 P.M., Mr. Spano refused to concede victory, saying he wanted to take a closer look at the possibility that mistakes were made in transmitting results. But he acknowledged: "I'm not ecstatic."
With 97 percent of the votes counted, these were the results:
Brodsky 16,010 (51.5%)
Spano 15,068 (48.5%)
In a second closely watched race, Michael G. Cherkasky, a longtime Manhattan prosecutor, easily beat back a lackadaisical challenge by Paul W. Pickelle, a criminal lawyer, to win the Democratic nomination for district attorney.
With 97 percent of the votes counted, these were the results:
Cherkasky 17,397 (67.5%)
Pickelle 8,378 (32.5%)
"The Democrats of Westchester have overwhelmingly endorsed our vision of the D.A.'s office where merit and experience matter and political connections and family influence do not," Mr. Cherkasky declared tonight.
For the first time in a quarter of a century, the Democratic desigation means something because the popular Republican incumbent, Carl A. Vergari, is retiring and his successor, Jeanine Pirro, may not be as invincible in the Nov. 2 election.
There were also several municipal races in Westchester.
In Greenburgh, the largest town in the county, Supervisor Peter J. Feiner easily won renomination in the Democratic primary. His defeat of Susan P. Tolchin, the Town Clerk, removes the biggest obstacle to winning a second term in the town, which is overwhelmingly Democratic.
In Mount Pleasant, Robert F. Meehan, the Republican incumbent, easily won a third term over Phillip A. Grimaldi, a former grants coordinator. Mr. Meehan will face M. Gail Grimaldi, a Democrat not related to Philip Grimaldi, in November.
Election officials said it appeared that roughly 20 percent of Westchester's 178,000 registered Democrats cast ballots. In last year's Presidential primary about 31 percent of the Democrats voted.
The low turnout had been expected to help Mr. Spano and Mr. Cherkasky, the candidates supported by Democratic leaders. But there was a sizable vote in Mr. Brodsky's hometown of Greenburgh, where voter interest was quickened by a race for town supervisor, and a light turnout in Yonkers, where Mr. Spano was said to have many supporters.
With Republicans dominating the county government, there has not been a Democratic primary for countywide office in more than a decade and many of county's 178,753 registered Democrats have lost the habit of primary voting. Still, many Democrats and Republicans were drawn today by local primaries for positions ranging from mayor to highway superintendent in which the candidates were often their neighbors.
Mr. Brodsky kept Mr. Spano on the defensive, sounding the theme of the "two Andys" to liken Mr. Spano to the incumbent, Mr. O'Rourke, on issues like personal ethics and high taxes.
Mr. Brodksy said Mr. Spano had staffed the top tiers of his clerk's office with his wife, Brenda Resnick, and party functionaries and had hired low-level staff members in secret deals with Republican leaders.
Mr. Spano responded that Mr. Brodsky, as chairman of the Assembly's environmental committee, had taken donations from power and waste management companies disciplined for pollution. He also said his "arrogant" opponent lacked the consensus-building temperament needed to run the county government.
Grappling with Westchester's floundering economy, Mr. Brodsky proposed retraining and entrepreneurial advice for laid-off white-collar workers. Mr. Spano stressed a partnership between government and private industry to invigorate the county's economy and proposed a re-engineering of county government, much as he did when he computerized the clerk's office.
Of the two candidates for district attorney, the 43-year-old Mr. Cherkasky ran a far more aggressive campaign. Mr. Cherkasky stressed his record as the chief of the Investigations Division of the Manhattan District Attorney's office and his legal attacks against such organized crime figures as John Gotti and the sons of Carlo Gambino.
The 54-year-old Mr. Pickelle, a former assistant district attorney in Queens who twice lost to Mr. Vergari, portrayed Mr. Cherkasky as a "Johnny-come-lately Democrat" and a carpetbagger who had no experience in Westchester courtrooms.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: The Economy;
Israelis Expect Peace in Mideast Would Bring Big Dividends

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Many Israeli economists and business analysts are confident that a settlement with the Palestinians and normalization of relations with the more conservative Arab countries will lead to a burst of growth not experienced by Israel since the 1960's.
Their aplomb is unrelated to any immediate opportunity to beat swords into plowshares. Nor is it linked to visions of oil wealth flowing from the Persian Gulf. The most important peace dividend, experts widely agree, is probably the least tangible: an end to the outcast status that has blocked closer trade and investment links with the advanced industrial powers. 
 "Watch what the multinational corporations do," said Pinchas Landau, the editor of The Telegraph, Israel's business daily. Mr. Landau expects the collapse of the Arab economic boycott and the fading prospect of military conflict to yield "tremendous changes in attitude, particularly in Europe and Japan."
 
Military Aid Could Decline
 A reduction in tensions with Israel's neighbors and an end to the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip might be expected to reduce Israeli military spending and thus allow Israel's economic resources to shift to investment to increase productivity. But economists dismiss the idea, at least for the immediate future.
The military challenge will change, as Israel prepares to defend a smaller territory and cope with a Palestinian authority over which it has no direct control. But "it wouldn't surprise me if the redeployment of the army actually cost money," said Ephraim Kleiman, an economist at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
The pullback from Sinai generated parallel costs after the Camp David accord. And as with the Egyptian settlement, the financial burden may be offset by one-time gifts from Israel's foreign friends. But dependence on foreign military aid is a double-edged sword, noted Herbert Stein, an economic adviser to Republican Presidents who is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
A substantial part of Israel's military budget is now covered by grants and loans from Washington. The Pentagon trims the cost of Israel's military spending in many other ways, ranging from procurement of Israeli military equipment to the licensing of advanced technology.
Thus as the diminished Arab threat leaves America less inclined to subsidize the Israeli military, a shekel saved on defense in the long run may not prove to be a shekel earned. "The Israelis ought to plan to phase out this aid," Mr. Stein said.
Economists are also doubtful that Israel could soon become a Middle Eastern trading center.
True, Israeli businesses familiar with Arab culture are already eyeing the market. Benjamin Gaon, the chief executive of Koor Industries, Israel's largest private corporation, is exploring the idea of minority participation in joint ventures for manufacturing in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Moreover, Leonard Hausman, the director of the Institute for Social and Economic Policy in the Middle East at the Kennedy School at Harvard, believes that the smaller Persian Gulf nations are open to trade with Israel -- indeed, eager for it. "Dubai is the new Hong Kong of the Mideast," he said, a place where the only ideology is selling the most for the highest price.
But Israel's regional prospects must be put in perspective, said Stanley Fischer, formerly the chief economist for the World Bank. "The economy of the entire Arab world is smaller than Canada's," he pointed out. And at least partly in response to half a century of Arab boycott, Israeli industry makes little that the Arab economies lack.
Mr. Landau concurred. "Why would Saudi Arabia buy computers from Israel that they now get from America, Japan or Taiwan?" he asked.
There is another area in which economists believe the conventional wisdom exaggerates the benefits of peace. The five-and-half-year-old Palestinian uprising has hurt Israeli tourism, and the Persian Gulf war of 1991 was also a blow to the multibillion-dollar industry. But the Economist Intelligence Unit, part of the Economist Magazine group, says the Israeli airline and hotel industries also share the blame for stagnant tourism. Winter vacations for Europeans have been hindered by a failure to encourage air charter competition.
The uprising further disrupted the economy by limiting both the supply and reliability of low-cost Palestinian day labor in Israel. Today, just 45,000 residents of the occupied territories, less than half the number of the mid-1980's and only 2 percent of the total Israeli labor force, commute to Israel.
But with the exception of farming, Israel has largely adjusted to the scarcity of Palestinian labor. Mr. Kleiman pointed out that chronic double-digit unemployment, increased by the flow of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union, has made Israelis willing to do jobs they once refused.
Given these diluted expectations, what explains the widespread optimism that peace would make a big economic difference? The hope that it will enable Israel to complete its transition from an inefficient if self-reliant siege economy to a full-fledged member of the technological elite.
Israel has the educated work force, particularly in the sciences. And it has a fair share of domestic and foreign companies operating at the technological edge. Israel is a low-cost producer of chemicals and a world leader in specialized electronics. Intel, Motorola and I.B.M. are among the American companies doing research as well as manufacturing in the country.
But Howard Rosen, an economist at the Competitiveness Policy Council in Washington, argues that Israel's economic opportunities have been deeply handicapped by the Arab boycott and the uncertainty of investing in a country permanently at war. Peace could quickly change that, particularly with Japanese and European companies that have longstanding business arrangements with the gulf nations.
Mr. Fischer agrees, noting that Israeli business and Government leaders who could barely get the time of day from their counterparts in Europe and Japan can no longer accommodate all the requests for appointments.
 
Tensions Could Stay High
 Israelis remember the high economic hopes dashed by a cold peace with Egypt. And this time, too, events short of an outright collapse in the peace efforts could curdle the outlook.
The obvious worry is that tensions will remain high enough to cancel out the advantages of the deal on paper. Sporadic terrorism, sustained by Palestinian militants, is a serious risk. So is a breakdown in negotiations over water rights, import duties and Palestinian access to Israeli markets.
Still, optimism remains the order of the day. "This is the external shock the Israeli economy has been waiting for," Mr. Rosen said.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD: Arafat;
Arafat Shifts Quest From Peace to Funds

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Visiting old haunts like the United Nations and new, previously forbidden ones like the halls of Congress, Yasir Arafat today appealed to the United States and the world community to provide funds to help build the new entity he says will lead to a Palestinian State.
"We are in need of the help," Mr. Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said during an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington. "Our infrastructure has been completely destroyed." He said that unemployment in some areas of the West Bank and Gaza was about 56 percent and that "there is real starvation in Gaza." 
 But so far, Mr. Arafat has received more compliments on his willingness to make peace than cash for him to construct a Palestinian state. "We have to wait and see," he said at the United Nations when asked whether he was getting enough financial support from the West. "We have promises."
P.L.O. officials estimate that they will need about $11.2 billion over 10 years to create an economically viable entity in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. While talk of reconciliation fills the air, firm commitments of cash have yet to follow. The Clinton Administration is trying to put together a $590 million start-up fund, but has yet to obtain solid commitments from other important donors.
Administration officials have stressed that most of the financial aid would have to come from other countries, like the Persian Gulf states and Japan. In meetings with Congressional leaders today, Mr. Arafat said he understood the fiscal limitations on the United States.
"He understands that we are under great constraints because of budgetary problems," said Senator Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, who along with 20 other senators met with Mr. Arafat for about an hour this morning. "But he expressed the hope that the United States would participate as a signal to other countries."
Mr. Arafat sought a promise from Congressional leaders to repeal laws prohibiting the United States from giving any funds to the P.L.O. or requiring it to vote against any loans for the organization from international financial institutions like the World Bank.
Many laws contain such amendments. After meeting with Mr. Arafat, George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, promised that he and Mr. Dole would "review and assess" such legislation."
 
Stressed Stability Factor
 In seeking financial commitments from major donors for his new governing authority in Gaza and Jericho, Mr. Arafat stressed the importance of stability in a region that still has the world's largest oil reserves. He also put on a charm offensive that would make him the envy of many an American Presidential candidate.
He sought to allay Israeli concerns about the establishment of a Palestinian nation by saying that once such a state is created, he would seek a confederation with Jordan -- a long-held Israeli position. At the same time, he defiantly refused to back away from his claim to East Jerusalem.
He chided rejectionists like Iran. "Slogans, slogans," he said of Iranian criticism of negotiations with Israel. "What we have achieved from slogans?"
He played down differences with Saudi Arabia, spoke of his solidarity with Libya and Iraq and strummed the chords of militant Palestinian pride by declaring that he would not turn in his familiar khaki-colored uniform and kaffiyeh for a business suit, now that he supposedly had changed from guerrilla leader to head of state.
"I am not a lizard," Mr. Arafat said, then realizing that that was not the right word, fumbled for the correct one. "Lizard. Lizard? I am not a chameleon. I am commander and chief of our army, and I am proud to have this dress."
At 7:10 P.M. Mr. Arafat strode into the United Nations to meet with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. It was the first time in 19 years that the P.L.O. chairman had set foot inside the United Nations headquarters.
In 1974 Mr. Arafat addressed the General Assembly, but his appearance sparked criticism when photographs showed that he wore a pistol holster beneath his shirt. Five years ago, Mr. Arafat was again scheduled to speak to the General Assembly, but his entry visa was denied by the United States.
In his appearances today he displayed a wit that at times won over his audience. At one point, Clayton Boyce, president of the National Press Club, who read Mr. Arafat questions submitted by the audience, asked him to name his enemies, now that he had made peace with Israel. The P.L.O. chief answered quickly, "You."
As he grabbed Mr. Boyce's hand, Mr. Arafat told the crowd, "He is quizzing me too much with his questions."

HEADLINE: Splintered on Trade;
2 Unusual Political Alliances Reflect Long-Term Gain and Short-Term Fear

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Seldom in American politics have there been such strange bedfellows.
Bill Clinton, George Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter stand together in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ross Perot, Jesse Jackson, Patrick J. Buchanan and Ralph Nader are lined up against it. 
 The Republicans in Congress, who were united just last month in their opposition to President Clinton's budget, are generally on his side on Nafta. Democrats in Congress are mostly opposed.
Thomas S. Foley, Newt Gingrich, George J. Mitchell and Bob Dole are working together on behalf of the pact. Greer, Margolis, Mitchell & Associates, the political consulting concern that handled Mr. Clinton's advertising in the Presidential campaign last year, is now running the advertising campaign against the agreement.
The scrambled politics are grounded in this fundamental precept: The benefits of the trade agreement, like those of free trade generally, would be diffuse and would accumulate gradually. The dislocations and disruptions, while probably smaller than the benefits in the aggregate, would be immediate and concentrated.
 
'People Will Blame Nafta'
 Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief economist, put the matter this way: "Boosting trade with Mexico will create a few jobs in this machine tool factory and a job in that advertising agency. Circulation in this magazine will rise, and the financial district of New York will have a new job here and there. It will all largely be invisible. But when the glass factory in Toledo closes or the textile plant in South Carolina or the furniture manufacturer in North Carolina because those low-wage jobs move to Mexico, it will be highly visible, and it will be attributable to Nafta. Or at least people will blame Nafta for it."
What that means first of all is that the pact's opponents are much more passionate than its supporters. "They feel their livelihoods are at stake," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "The supporters tend to deal with Nafta on a more intellectual level."
It also means that for many politicians, a vote against the trade agreement is the safer vote. If the trade pact goes into effect, it is sure to be blamed, fairly or not, for every factory that closes over the next few years, and the politicians who voted for it will be held accountable.
The way the benefits are spread thin explains why the larger a politician's constituency is, the more likely he or she is to support the trade agreement. Every President since Herbert Hoover has been an advocate of free trade, presumably because they have represented the overall interest of the entire country rather than the interests of narrower segments. Governors and senators are more likely to be in favor of the trade pact than are members of the House of Representatives.
And the way the drawbacks are concentrated explains the ferocious opposition from organized labor. Some union leaders have threatened to work against any politician who votes for the agreement, regardless of where the politician stands on other issues.
These are tough times for the unions. The industries where they are strongest are shrinking, and the places where jobs are expanding tend not to be unionized. Nafta seems to symbolize the frustration blue-collar workers feel about the changing world economy, and the issue is the first in Congress on which this frustration is really framed.
 
Democratic Party Fissure
 "I don't think there is an issue," Mr. Garin said, "that quite so distinctly separates those who think they will succeed in the new world order from those who see themselves as victims of the changing economic structure."
This has created a fissure in the Democratic Party. Labor unions are a relatively small element in the national economy nowadays, representing only 16 percent of the work force. But they are an important aspect of the Democratic constituency, central to the party's financing and organization.
Some party leaders with close labor connections like Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip in the House, are actively opposing the trade agreement. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, may announce his position this week. The best the White House can hope for is that he will not lead the fight against it.
David Mitchell, a partner in the firm that produced Mr. Clinton's campaign advertising, said he was working against the trade agreement because of his strong ties to the labor movement.
The official view at the White House is that the unusual political lineup on the trade pact will actually help Mr. Clinton when it comes to other issues like health care because it shows how, in contrast to the battle over the budget, the President can operate in a bipartisan fashion.
In Congress, the trade agreement is put in the same category as gun control: an issue on which little effort is made to enforce party discipline, leaving legislators free to vote their political instincts.
 
Negative House View
 As matters stand today, a small but solid majority of senators seems to be in favor of the trade agreement. But the legislation may never get to the Senate. Under the rules, the House must vote first, and at last count, the Administration was well shy of the 100 or so Democrats (out of 258) needed to form a majority with about 120 Republicans (out of 175) who appear to be in favor.
Mr. Perot is presenting the Administration with a serious obstacle. He is back on the talk shows with his charts and homilies. His new paperback is titled "Save Your Job, Save Our Country," and has the subtitle, "Why Nafta Must Be Stopped -- Now!"
His hyperbole is unrelenting. On NBC's "Tonight Show" last week, he showed a photograph of Mexicans living in cardboard shacks and suggested that this was what could happen to American workers. His estimate that 5.9 million American jobs would be threatened by the trade pact is not accepted by any mainstream economist.
But it is hard to answer specific charges like that with academic theory. So the proponents of the trade agreement have raised the stakes themselves. In the televised White House ceremony today, Mr. Clinton said that one million new jobs would be created by the pact over the next five years. (The White House later backed off the assertion, attributing the mistake to "a staff error.")
The dominant view of economists is that the effect on the trade pact on the total number of jobs in the United States over the next few years would be negligible -- nowhere near the two million jobs that might be lost from cuts in military spending or the 360,000 jobs that stand to be generated if long-term interest rates fall another half a percentage point. The net jobs gained or lost probably would not even reach the 252,000 that Vice President Al Gore said last week should be cut from the Federal Government.
Still, as the political debate wears on, the exaggerations of benefits and drawbacks will surely increase. "In this town," said Mr. Reischauer, the Congressional economist, "if one person shouts at a high decibel level, the only way to counter it is to shout in the other direction at a similarly high level."

HEADLINE: Data Spur Inflation Concerns

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Government reports today showed that both retail spending and consumer prices were a bit more vigorous in August than had generally been expected and the bond market promptly seized on the figures as an excuse to sell.
The Commerce Department reported that $173.5 billion passed across retail counters last month, two-tenths of 1 percent more than in July, as merchants racked up their fifth consecutive advance since the late-winter blizzard that crippled much of the East Coast. A large part of the gain reflected the automotive sector, though the contribution was less than in July. 
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department calculated that prices at the retail, or consumer, level rose three-tenths of 1 percent as sharp deceleration in medical inflation and hefty declines in the price of gasoline and tobacco products were more than offset by increases for clothing, food and shelter.
 
 
Bond Market Selling Spree
 Although neither set of figures was far from what had been anticipated, they -- together with modest upward revisions for sales in earlier months -- combined to touch off a selling spree in the bond market that pushed long-term interest rates sharply higher, to 5.97 percent.
"I think the train overshot the station at 6 percent," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank in Pittsburgh, referring to the fact that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond had tumbled to a 5.86 percent close last Wednesday.
"The market is very sensitive" even to "shadings" in economic prospects, Mr. Hoffman said.
According to John R. Williams, chief economist for the Bankers Trust Company, the August rise in retail sales showed "the consumer is doing O.K. in the third quarter" and apparently more willing to spend than suggested by surveys of consumer confidence.
Indeed, a related report from the Labor Department today showed that average weekly earnings jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent last month after adjustment for inflation and seasonal variation.
This resulted from a longer workweek and higher hourly earnings partly offset by a small rise in prices.
Retail sales, which account for one-third of the entire economy, continued to show considerably more strength in typically big-ticket, long-lasting goods like lawn mowers than in perishables like restaurant meals. For August, in fact, durable goods jumped six-tenths of 1 percent to account for the entire sales gain.
Economists suggested that at a time of insecurity about jobs, interest rates have fallen low enough to induce consumers to make commitments for expensive goods.
Automotive dealers had a seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in receipts last month while merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes gained 1.8 percent -- with the help of extra demand caused by the rebuilding from Midwest floods.
Sales of furniture and other equipment for the home, on the other hand, slumped 1.7 percent, the Commerce Department report showed.
Excluding the automotive sector, retail sales edged up 1 percent last month after being unchanged in July.
 
 
Gasoline Declines
 Among nondurables, gains of 1.1 percent in food stores, eight-tenths of 1 percent in stores selling apparel and accessories, and four-tenths of 1 percent in general merchandise stores were offset by declines of 2.5 percent at gasoline service stations, seven-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars, and two-tenths of 1 percent at drug and proprietary stores.
Lower prices for gasoline contributed to the decline.
So far this year, sales of durable goods are running 12.1 percent above the 1992 pace, compared with a 3.1 percent gain for nondurables.
Today's report of a three-tenths of 1 percent rise in consumer prices was to an unusual extent a result of big swings in various items, including a rebound in the cost of shelter, a category accounting for 28 percent of the Consumer Price Index and two-thirds of the August acceleration.
Housing, which includes utilities and other housekeeping costs as well as shelter, rose three-tenths of 1 percent after showing no change in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed.
Clothing jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent in August, the first rise since February, mainly reflecting an earlier than usual introduction of women's autumn and winter clothing.
 
 
Surge in New York Area
 It also contributed -- along with meats and poultry and entertainment -- to a six-tenths of 1 percent surge in consumer prices in the New York City metropolitan area last month. This rise, raising the area's inflation rate over the latest 12 months to 3 percent, was the largest for any of the five metropolitan areas for which figures were published today.
Food prices advanced three-tenths of 1 percent nationally after an unchanged July, with fresh fruits and vegetables up 2.7 percent, causing most of the acceleration in groceries.
Medical inflation, however, eased two-tenths of 1 percent, the weakest monthly showing since March 1984. The change was concentrated in drugs and supplies but inflation in medical services also slowed.
"It's not bad -- but it could be better," Lawrence Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said of today's inflation figures. Many analysts expect the central bank to make no overt shift when its chief policy body meets Tuesday, but to abandon its inclination to tighten in favor of neutrality.
During the first eight months of this year, consumer inflation was running at a pace of 2.9 percent, the same as for all of 1992.

HEADLINE: Mexican Shifts Tone on Trade Accord

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 14

 BODY:
After months of promoting the virtues of a free trade agreement with the United States and Canada, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari shifted his tone today, telling Mexicans that the troubled accord is not "a panacea."
Moments after President Clinton used his signing of side agreements to the pact as the occasion to launch his uphill campaign for Congressional approval, Mr. Salinas took the same opportunity to deflate expectations that until now he has steadily pumped up. 
 "The Mexicans know that the agreements and treaties will not by themselves solve our problems," Mr. Salinas told an audience of Government officials, legislators, and foreign diplomats at the presidential residence, Los Pinos. "That depends on our internal effort, which, without doubt, we will redouble."
 
Focus on Ties With U.S.
 The 45-year-old leader's new caution was not a matter of saying things he has not said before. Domestic critics of his Administration's focus on the North American Free Trade Agreement say that he has sacrificed Mexican independence to improve ties with the United States and their complaints prompted him long ago to describe the pact as part of a broader process of economic change in Mexico.
Until now, however, Mr. Salinas has virtually ignored the possiblity that the agreement might not go into effect as scheduled on Jan. 1.
Even today, his acknowledgement that American legislators could delay or defeat the accord was no more than tacit. But with Mexican officials privately expressing growing concern about the accord's prospects in Washington, aides to Mr. Salinas confirmed a change in his message.
 
Expectations 'Too High'
 "The signal is that the expectations around Nafta have been built too high," one senior official said after the President's speech, referring to the agreement by its intials. "Everyone thinks they are going to get a new house when the treaty goes into effect."
Mr. Salinas's stake in the trade agreement, high from the outset, has risen significantly over the last year.
The Government has brought inflation down below 10 percent for the first time in years, but economic growth has slowed from 4.4 percent in 1990 to 1.3 percent for the first half of this year.
Supporters of the trade agreement say that by dropping barriers to trade and investment, it will draw enough new capital to Mexico to increase the growth rate by about one percentage point a year.
 
Pressure for Devaluation
 The agreement's impact on foreign investment is critical to the Government's ability to cover the huge deficit in its current account, the broadest measure of trade. Last year, Mexico imported $22.8 billion more in goods and services than it exported. The trend has increased the pressure for a devaluation of the Mexican peso that would almost certainly raise memories of Mexico's past economic instability.
The trade agreement is supposed to be put into effect by Jan. 1, but lately some American Congressional leaders have said that a vote might have to be delayed until after the first of the year.
While economists here say an American Congressional delay of the agreement for a few months would probably not have a drastic impact on the Mexican economy, many political analysts say a delay could complicate the process by which Mr. Salinas will choose among his aides for the governing party's candidate to succeed him. The election is set for Aug. 21.
 
A Setback for Salinas
 In the hope of limiting political conflict next year, officials said that the governing party renewed its efforts today to gain opposition support for changes in the country's electoral laws to make them more democratic.
In the last couple of days, the Government has come under sharp criticism as the ruling party's large majority in the lower house of Congress forced through a series of changes in the laws over the objections of the conservative National Action Party.
The National Action legislators had initially negotiated the changes with the governing party, whereas the country's main leftist party quit the Congressional debate to protest what it said was the Government's unwillingness to allow real democracy.
 
Election Change Delayed
 Later, however, the National Action Party accused the governing party of backing away from some of their agreements, and turned against the new laws. The criticism centered on the ruling party's move to delay until after next year's election a measure that would limit Government influence over 300 district electoral boards.

HEADLINE: Start of School in Doubt After Review of Asbestos

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
A portrait of a school system in disarray emerged yesterday as teams surveyed all of New York City's public schools, leading several superintendents and the teacher's union to question whether schools could open on Monday as planned.
But the new Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, said in an interview that he would recommend again in a Board of Education meeting today that the schools open on Sept. 20. 
 "I'm sticking to that date," Mr. Cortines said. "We've just got to open. I don't think we have any choice."
During the citywide surveys -- carried out yesterday by teams of principals, teachers, custodians and parents at Mr. Cortines's request -- yesterday sealed off hundreds of rooms that had not been closed, making a bad space shortage even worse. Some of the district superintendents flatly called for a delay.
Eight of the 25 schools in District 30 in Queens, for instance, must remain closed, and three others have most of their rooms sealed because of wall damage, said Dr. Angelo Gimondo, the superintendent in the district, which includes Jackson Heights.
"Based on today's findings, the situation is much worse than it was yesterday. I just don't have any room," he said, urging that school be delayed "even a couple of days -- some time to do some planning."
Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers, said, "If the opening of the schools depends on the results of the surveys taken today, they clearly cannot open on Monday."
Mr. Cortines ordered yesterday's survey by the school-based committees to help the city's 39 superintendents make last-minute contingency plans for the city's one million schoolchildren, who were to have reported on Sept. 9. The request came after the agency that has been leading the emergency asbestos inspections failed on Monday to report which schools were ready to open.
During yesterday's inspections, the school committees unexpectedly closed off hundreds of additional rooms after finding widespread wall and ceiling damage that had gone unreported. For example, at Murry Bergtraum High School, at 411 Pearl Street in Manhattan, where just five rooms had been closed previously, the committee closed 25 more rooms yesterday, Ms. Amlung said, based on reports from teachers union representatives who participated in the surveys. At the High School for the Humanities, at 351 West 18th Street, also in Manhattan, the committee closed 25 more rooms, Ms. Amlung said. On Staten Island, so many rooms have been closed that less than half the schools could open today, the union said.
In many cases, the rooms closed by the committees have been inspected and cleared, and the local districts lack only the inspection reports from the School Construction Authority, the agency that has been conducting the emergency inspections, to reopen the rooms, Ms. Amlung said.
A spokesman for the authority, Jacques DeGraff, said the agency was working hard to prepare for today's Board of Education meeting a list of what classrooms within what schools will be safe for school opening. "We are working as diligently as we can," Mr. DeGraff said.
Time is especially short because the Rosh ha-Shanah holiday begins tomorrow. And several superintendents said they were simply unable to make contingency plans to deal with such sweeping dislocation on such short notice.
 
District in Bronx
 "Somebody tells me that I have to make contingency plans when I just received a report," said Joseph Kovaly, the superintendent of District 11 in the Bronx, which includes Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester and Williamsbridge and is one of the city' most overcrowded districts. "I don't see how it can be done."
Mr. Kovaly said that in his district of 26,000 students, at least three of the 31 schools would not open and several others would have many rooms and corridors sealed off. "Where am I going to shift 2,600 students in a district that is at 130 percent of capacity right now?"
In District 1, on Manhattan's Lower East Side, William Ubinas, the superintendent, said 6 of 18 schools would not open. In District 2, in lower Manhattan and the Upper East Side, Andrew Lachman, a spokesman for Superintendent Anthony Alvarado, said 7 of 31 buildings would be unavailable. And in District 16, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, the superintendent, Mildred Jones, said at least 4 of 16 schools would not open unless she receives results from asbestos tests indicating that numerous damaged areas are free of asbestos.

HEADLINE: Shifting Burdens: Business and the Health Plan - A special report.;
Companies Big and Small Tally Effects of Clinton Health Plan

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
President Clinton's plan for reshaping the health care system would cause a vast shift in financial burdens among American corporations. Health costs would ease for companies, most of them manufacturers, that now offer generous benefits, and rise for those that do not, among them not only small neighborhood shops but also corporate giants like Wal-Mart, Sears and Wendy's.
How those burdens would be reapportioned emerges from a look at insurance costs and prospects at four companies representing the variety of corporate experiences: Ford Motor Company, an older manufacturer; Apple Computer, a young high-tech company; Lehigh Valley Racquet and Fitness Centers, a small Pennsylvania business that uses part-time instructors, and Manpower Inc., the nation's biggest supplier of temporary workers. 
 Once the President's plan is in place, "the variation in burdens among firms is going to be much less," said Paul Starr, a senior White House adviser and an architect of the plan.
 
Favorable Glances
 For Ford, the Clinton plan holds out great promise of slowing the steady rise in the company's health care expenses. At last, Ford says, it will not have to pay a disproportionate share of the nation's medical bills, in effect picking up payments to treat the indigent and the uninsured. What the company really wants, though, is to shift to the Government its huge outlay for retirees' health care, and the White House has not yet said how it would handle that issue.
Apple, another big manufacturer, also looks favorably on the Clinton plan, which would set a national standard for health insurance that would cost the company less than it now pays for the same, or better, coverage.
But Manpower and Lehigh Valley Racquet are worried. Lehigh Valley Racquet pays nothing for its part-time employees' health coverage, and Manpower pays very little for its temporary workers. Under the Clinton plan, each company would have to contribute for each of those employees. Lehigh Valley Racquet, among other companies, is strongly lobbying against any health plan that would give the Government a larger role.
 
No Plans on the Job
 The uninsured employees at Lehigh Valley Racquet and at Manpower are among the nearly 48 million workers -- nearly 40 percent of all employed Americans -- who hold jobs at companies that do not offer them health insurance, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. While some of those workers are at small companies that say they cannot afford to give benefits to anyone, the majority are part-time employees, temporary workers and contract workers at giant corporations as well as neighborhood businesses.
A great majority of these workers are in fact insured, under a spouse's or parent's policy or a personal policy. The Clinton plan would have all employers share the cost of insuring their workers and their families, no matter what other arrangements an employee might have.
At present, Ford often pays for health insurance for the family of a worker, although the worker's spouse might have a job at a Wal-Mart or a Manpower. Under the Clinton plan, Ford's obligation would be reduced, while the spouse's employer would have to help pay for the family's coverage.
 
Ford
Where Retirees Are the Issue
 To hold down rising costs, Ford is slowly drawing its workers to plans that are less expensive than the company's traditional fee-for-service coverage, in which a worker goes to a doctor of his choice and the Ford health plan pays the bill, whatever it might be. The less expensive plans, called preferred provider networks or health maintenance organizations, in effect require workers to use groups of doctors and hospitals with whom the company has negotiated set fees.
Even with the migration to networks, Ford is paying more for health care -- $5,000 on average for each active and retired worker in 1992 -- than the Clinton plan would require for its standardized coverage, which is less comprehensive than Ford's.
What's more, while the Clinton plan would require an employer to pay at least 80 percent of the insurance premiums of its workers, Ford now picks up the entire bill, using a standard negotiated with the United Auto Workers. That standard of fully paid health insurance might be revised for newly hired workers, a possibility arising this week in Ford's negotiations with the union.
When it comes to retirees, Ford has a problem. Apple Computer and many other nonunion companies founded in recent decades have no retirees yet, and no intention of giving them health insurance when they materialize. Ford, on the other hand, has 125,000 retirees, a number almost as large as the company's active work force of 145,000. And all have the same coverage as the active workers.
Nothing seems to strike Robert L. Ozment, Ford's director of corporate and employee insurance, as more important than lowering, or eliminating, the cost of retiree health care, which is currently more than $600 million a year, or 40 percent of Ford's total health cost. "Any company that is successful for many years and provides health care for its growing corps of retirees is at a competitive disadvantage," Mr. Ozment said.
And then he expressed a fervent hope: "We think that Clinton should do what other countries do: anyone unemployed or uninsured, including retirees, should get health coverage fully paid from general tax revenues."
Such an arrangement would hold not only for retirees under 65, who now are fully covered by a company-paid medical plan at Ford, but also those 65 and older who qualify for Medicare and also receive a company-sponsored supplemental policy.
 
Cost-Saving Proposals
 The Clinton plan offers to help pay insurance costs for retirees under 65 and ineligible for Medicare, covering 38,000 of Ford's retirees. How to deal with older retirees, beyond Medicare, is still being debated. The Clinton plan would add a new prescription drug benefit to Medicare, relieving Ford of a big current cost. "We would favor that, absolutely," Mr. Ozment said.
Ford is also happy with Clinton proposals to reduce the cost of health care generally. Mr. Ozment endorses provisions that would limit malpractice claims and set national standards for treating specific ailments to help eliminate excess care and overcharging. "We think Ford has done well in controlling costs," Mr. Ozment said, "but our rate of cost increase is still 8 percent a year, and that is more than double the inflation rate."
One way to cut this growth rate further, Mr. Ozment said, is to reduce the cost of hospital construction, an outlay that ends up in Ford's health bill. Mr. Ozment, for example, would like to prevent construction of a new hospital in Pontiac, Mich., which already has three hospitals and not enough patients to fill them. Nevertheless, one hospital, occupying an old building, is planning a new structure, despite the efforts of Ford and other companies to stop the project.
"The construction cost will show up as higher hospital charges to care for Ford workers, and, eventually, higher costs for our health insurance," Mr. Ozment said. If the Government could help solve this problem, he added, Ford might go along with a payroll tax to pay for the Clinton plan.
"If the Government called for, say, a 4 percent payroll tax, we would, like most companies, say that is evil," Mr. Ozment said. "But if the Government said that with a payroll tax 'we guarantee that costs will go from an 8 percent annual growth rate to a 2 percent rate,' we would say hallelujah."
 
Apple
Where Choice Is Mandated
 The big effort at Apple has been to reduce the cost of company-sponsored health insurance for its 8,000 American workers. With the cost of premiums rising 18 percent a year, the computer company announced in 1987 that instead of having only one form of insurance, its employees would be able to choose from four types of plans, each involving a different cost to the employees themselves and different levels of coverage.
"We proceeded gradually," said Sally Gottlieb, benefits manager at Apple. "We did not jack up charges overnight. By 1989, the difference between the most expensive and least expensive plans was only $300 in annual premium cost to the employee. That was not enough, so we have changed the pricing to represent different values. Now the difference is $800."
Like most companies, Apple had relied for years on a fee-for-service health plan that paid 80 percent or more of medical costs after the employee and his or her family covered an annual deductible. The company now also offers two preferred provider networks in which employees are charged only small amounts for care, once an annual deductible is covered, as long as they stay within their networks. Apple also does business with three health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, which in effect provide full medical and hospital care at a fixed annual premium per employee.
H.M.O.'s offer the best opportunity for Apple to control costs. But the company, like most of corporate America, has been reluctant to force its employees into the cheapest plan. While 19 percent of Apple workers have joined an H.M.O., 49 percent have chosen one of the preferred provider plans. Partly as a result, the increase in Apple's annual health care costs fell to 12 percent last year and 10 percent so far this year, Ms. Gottlieb said. While that represents an improvement over past years, it remains a much steeper rise than the President's plan calls for.
 
Two-Wage Households
 The Clinton plan might also help Apple lower costs. A number of Apple employees -- the company will not say how many -- have working spouses but get their entire family coverage through Apple, driving up the company's total costs.
In the formula the White House proposes for handling two-earner families, a spouse's employer would also have to pay. Each employer, in fact, would pay 80 percent of a family premium for the Administration's standard coverage, or roughly $2,300 apiece. That in effect overcharges for some families and undercharges for families with only one jobholder. But the Administration justifies this practice by arguing that to try to keep track of who works and who does not would be a bookkeeping nightmare. It assumes instead that the average American family has more than one worker.
While each employer pays an 80 percent share for a two-earner family, the family pays the remaining 20 percent, or $560, only once. For single people, the average required employer contribution would be $1,440.
Apple now pays $3,600 a year, on average, for each worker's coverage, much more than the Clinton approach would require. The Apple plan is somewhat more generous in doctor and hospital coverage than the Clinton minimum standard, and that raises the possibility that Apple could gradually adjust its health coverage to the Federal standard, assuming it survives Congress. Or the company could pay additional sums for extras, to maintain health insurance as a recruiting lure. "These options are too speculative to consider now," Ms. Gottlieb said.
 
Lehigh Valley Racquet
Where Part-Time Is the Rule
 For John F. Brinson, president of Lehigh Valley Racquet, costs would rise by what he considered an unbearable amount if Mr. Clinton's plan was adopted. He distinguished between voluntarily deciding to let his 121 part-time employees participate in the company's plan at their expense -- a step he said he would consider -- and being ordered to do so by the Government and at rates mandated by the Government.
"I would not mind if the Government said, 'All right, we think employers have to make health coverage available to their employees,' " Mr. Brinson said. "I can live with that. But they can't come in and tell me how much I have to pay for it."
Forty people work full-time at the company's fitness centers in Allentown and Bethlehem; they are the administrators, clerks and maintenance workers. For each, Mr. Brinson pays $1,200 a year toward the cost of his company's group policies, either fee for service or H.M.O. Each of the 40 pays the rest of the premium, which averages $415 a year for single coverage and $3,882 for a family.
The company's plan offers more coverage to his core staff, Mr. Brinson said, than the Clinton plan does. But at Government-mandated premiums of $2,300 for family coverage, Mr. Brinson would almost double his cost for employees with families, while adding $600 a year for those who are single.
"It would not be fair to pay more for a married person than a single person," he said. "Most companies disagree with me on that point; they think married people are better employees. I don't think that is true." Only 10 of his full-time staff members are married.
 
Government Subsidies
 Many of his full-time employees earn less than $24,000 a year, and below that level the Government, under the Clinton plan, would subsidize part of the premium expense. Such subsidies would also apply to the part-time employees, since their average pay is only $7 an hour. A part-time employee would have to earn $15 an hour to disqualify the company for the subsidy.
Without the subsidy, Mr. Brinson would find himself paying an extra 50 cents an hour to cover employees earning $7 an hour; with it, the Government would pick up half of that amount. This would help, he said, but the subsidy is also an incentive to hold down wages to qualify for the Government aid.
Mr. Brinson insisted that any additional company expense for health insurance -- subsidized or not -- could not be offset by charging his customers more. "In this weak economy, our members are very sensitive to price," he said. "I don't mind being required to make coverage available to part-timers. But they should pay the entire cost."
Mr. Brinson's first reaction to published details of the Clinton plan was to declare that he would dismiss all of his part-time employees and replace them with 40 or 50 full-time workers, even though he said that would be less efficient than the present system. But a few days later, he suggested he would keep the part-time workers.
Mr. Brinson is speculating about ways to absorb the cost. Perhaps, he suggested, he can cancel raises, which have averaged 3 percent a year. "The marketplace will figure out a way to make this as painless as possible," he said. "But I can't raise my prices."
 
Manpower
Where 'Temps' Stand to Gain
 No one would benefit more from the Clinton plan than the nation's nearly two million temporary workers, people who sign up with agencies like Manpower, which in turn rents them to work for a day or for weeks as secretaries, clerks, administrators and factory workers.
The rate covers the wage for the "temp" -- averaging $8.50 an hour -- plus a sum paid to the Government for workmen's compensation, in case the employee is injured, plus an amount to cover Manpower's costs and profit. The temporary agencies will now have to add another sum for health insurance.
"It is devastating economics," said Douglas Long, director of compensation and benefits at Norrell Services, an Atlanta-based "temp" agency. "Ultimately it will force us to raise our rates by 7 to 9 percent."
Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower's chairman, is more sanguine, saying, "We are supporting the reform effort, as we know it so far."
Like Lehigh Valley Racquet, Manpower pays all or most of the cost of the health insurance that it makes available to its 6,000 permanent employees. But the "temps" get no help, except for a small percentage of them who work 400 hours over 10 weeks. If they continue after that, Manpower will pay half the premium of a company policy.
 
Reasons for Optimism
 Mr. Fromstein bases his optimism on three points. First, he said, all the temporary-help companies faced roughly the same new costs, so their rental rates would rise by similar amounts. In addition, under the Clinton plan, some of the cost of health insurance for low-wage "temps" will be subsidized by the Government, even at profitable companies like Manpower.
Finally, Mr. Fromstein said he hoped that hoped the Administration would reduce his cost for workmen's compensation. While the Clinton plan would not take over the costs of treating workplace injuries, it would bring the treatment provided under workmen's compensation into the system of managed care.
But Mr. Fromstein is lobbying for folding all costs of medical treatment under workmen's compensation into the Federal health insurance program. "It does not make any sense to have a health care plan and not cover in it the medical portion of workmen's compensation," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Aims to Redirect School Aid to the Poor From Wealthy Districts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration proposed today to redirect Federal aid from prosperous school districts to poorer ones, which would have to raise mathematics and reading standards to qualify for the extra money. The renewed effort to rescue students considered most likely to fail by providing them with concentrated daily tutoring is a central feature of the Administration's plan to overhaul the Government's principal school program for poor children.
Tens of millions of dollars in additional education aid would be diverted to cities like New York, Los Angeles and Detroit, where poverty, crime and the breakdown of families have led to delinquency and poor study habits, putting extra burdens on local schools. 
 "When you are in deep water, you need a long rope to pull you in," said Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley as he announced the details of the Improving America's School Act of 1993, which was introduced to Congress today. That 1 in 5 of the nation's children live in poverty is "a scandal of increasing proportion," he said, adding that the Government could no longer "be shy about sticking our necks out to help these children."
The Administration plans to increase the money spent through the program, known as Chapter 1, to $7 billion for the 1995 fiscal year from $6.3 billion for 1994. In a tradeoff that is likely to upset many legislators, suburban areas and rural regions with lower concentrations of poor children would get less money.
 
Rise in New York State
 New York State would receive an increase of $74.5 million, or 12 percent, in its Chapter 1 money for 1995. In comparison, New Jersey's 1995 allocation of $126.6 million represents a 12.2 percent decrease from 1994. Connecticut would receive a 4.6 percent increase in money to $51.7 million in 1995. Puerto Rico would get a 32.2 percent increase, of $72.6 million, for a total of $297.8 million in Federal money in 1995.
In addition to giving the poor districts more money, the proposal would hold them to higher standards of progress for students in the Chapter 1 program. "We cannot continue to give children who are poor a watered-down curriculum," Mr. Reilly said. "It does us no good to continue a conspiracy of low expectations, to dumb down another generation."
Chapter 1 has long been criticized by education experts as holding students in the program to the lowest standards. At present, their progress is measured against the classroom performance of failing students who do not receive extra tutoring help. Under the Administration plan, Chapter 1 students would be compared with more prosperous students. Schools making progress would be rewarded.
To achieve the higher standards, both the amount of time for tutoring and the curriculum for Chapter 1 students would be expanded. Testing based on multiple-choice questions that encourage rote learning would be altered to encourage problem-solving, independent thinking and writing skills. The proposal would prohibit schools receiving Chapter 1 money from limiting the tutoring to teaching rudimentary skills through repetitious drills.
The proposal mixes traditional liberal prescriptions with moderate proposals intended to give states and localities more autonomy in carrying out Government programs, a theme of the Administration.
The increase in money for Chapter 1, which provides extra tutoring for 5.5 million disadvantaged students from kindergarten through high school, represents a restoration of confidence in a Federal educational initiative introduced with fanfare in the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty. During the Reagan years, the programs suffered cuts.
In the past, the schools that failed to lift the performance of poor students were frequently the ones to receive the most new money. The policy overhaul includes rewards for schools that make the most progress, but it would also streamline Federal regulations that force schools to tailor curriculums to national rather than local goals.
 
Plan Is Praised
 Several education experts voiced support for the Administration's initiative. "I think the notion of concentrating resources makes all kinds of sense," said Michael Usdan, president of the Institute for Educational Leadership, a private nonprofit policy group. "There has been a dilution of these dollars as the economic polarization has taken place."
The Administration program would also direct literacy programs to impoverished families, provide seed money to upgrade the training of teachers and provide Chapter 1 services to homeless children.
At the core of the Administration's strategy to fortify the Chapter 1 program is a politically difficult balancing act, setting up a potentially wrenching clash in Congress based on regional and class rivalries.
Sixteen states would lose money: Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin.
Some Congressional supporters expressed concern that the loss suffered by Maine -- $6.7 million from 1994 to 1995 -- could cost needed support from the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, who represents the state.
Mr. Mitchell put out a measured statement today saying, "I will weigh all recommendations, but I also will work to provide critical assistance to poor children regardless of their geographic location."
"Anything less," he added, "would short-change families in the State of Maine as well as throughout the country."
 
The Big Winners
 The biggest winning states, along with New York, are California, Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana.
Representative Dale E. Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who heads the House Subcommittee on Elementary, Secondary and Vocational Education, said, "The problem is there are many school districts that have effective programs right now that may not qualify for Chapter 1 dollars under the new formula because they don't have a concentration of poverty."
Mr. Kildee said the solution to that political problem would be to increase financing so that the more prosperous school districts did not lose out. The legislation will first be taken up by the House, but the Administration does not expect it to pass until next summer.
At present, schools are automatically eligible for Chapter 1 instruction for all their students if 75 percent of their students are poor. That figure would be lowered to 65 percent so that 12,000 schools would be added to the 8,000 that now participate in campuswide programs.
