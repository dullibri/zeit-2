HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
Black Eye Didn't Stop Crimson Star

BYLINE: By DOUG SCANCARELLA 

 BODY:
Harvard Coach Tim Murphy has seen again and again what a tough, hard-nosed running back Eion Hu is. Hu, a junior tailback, is his leading rusher this season, with four 100-yard games, a bright spot for a Crimson team with a 1-4 record.
"Whether it's the last play of the the fourth quarter or just a routine drill in practice, he's giving it 100 percent," Murphy said. "He doesn't know any other way." 
 So Murphy wasn't the least bit surprised when he heard about the first time Hu stepped onto the football field.
Hu was 7 years old at the time. While attending summer camp in the Passaic County town of Wanaque, N.J., he was mistakenly put into a game with players who were almost twice his age.
The mistake occurred because Hu was big for his age, but it didn't deter him. In the heat of the game, he caught an elbow in the right eye, which resulted in a black eye.
"We were so excited to see him go to camp and learn to play football and other American sports," said his mother, Kathy Hu, "then the first day he came home with a black eye."
It was a rude introduction to football. Hu's parents didn't know what to expect. They were born in the Sichuan Province of China. In 1949, when Kathy Hu was 6 years old and Eion's father, Ching-Yeh, was 8, their respective families fled the mainland for Taiwan.
"We don't remember too much because we were quite young," said Hu's mother. "It was very dangerous, very scary. My parents told me that the boat that left after us was bombed and that everybody died. That could have been us."
After growing up in Taiwan, the Hu's moved to the United States in 1965. Hu's father is a biology professor at William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J.
The elder Hu convinced his son not to give up after his initial injury.
"He told him that we paid for the week and that he should give it more of a chance," his mother said. "By the end of the week, he didn't want to come home."
There was never any looking back. Hu became a star halfback at DePaul High School in Wayne, N.J., where he compiled almost 2,000 yards in three seasons and was recognized as one of four National Sports Foundation Scholar Athletes of the Year. In his senior season, he led the Spartans to a state championship.
His success has continued at Harvard. Now a junior, Hu has had nine 100-yard days for the Crimson. As a sophomore, Hu was named the Ivy League rookie of the year (freshmen do not play on the varsity) as he ran for 1,123 yards and 11 touchdowns.
This season he has rushed for 100 yards in four of five games, and has 613 yards and 7 touchdowns. In a victory over Colgate, Hu had a career-high 3 touchdowns and 235 yards. It was the best single performance by any Harvard back since 1974.
The leader of the Crimson offense is the second-year starting quarterback Vin Ferrara, who played at DePaul's scholastic conference rival, Delbarton. Before coming together to form the bulk of Harvard's offensive attack, Hu and Ferrara met in high school once a year. They both collected Parochial All-State honors in their senior seasons.
Hu's biggest fans are his parents. In the few years they have been following the game, they have became ardent football fans. They attend every Harvard home game.
In the classroom Hu has a B-plus average in economics. After he graduates in 1997, he wants to "get a job in the business world for three or four years" and then return to Harvard to pursue a master's degree in business administration.
"When I first got here in the spring of 1994, I knew we had a player in Eion," said Coach Murphy, who went to Harvard after being an assistant at Cincinnati University in 1994. "He's a quick, slashing type of runner, with great field vision.
"As time went on, I realized what a great kid he was -- and I don't just mean as a football player. At a school filled with extraordinary kids, he still stands out. He's a good student and a good athlete, and he's very humble about it."
Murphy's point was proved in an early season 28-27 loss to Cornell, in which Hu fumbled. It was only his second fumble in more than 500 career carries.
Harvard hasn't had a winning season since 1987. But with two 1-point losses on a team comprising mostly of underclassmen, Hu and Murphy are optimistic.
"We're young and we have to learn to win," Hu said. "We're really a few plays away from being 5-0. If we practice like heck, we could compete for the Ivy League title. If not this year, next year."

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Budget Cutting Requires Fare Increase

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Save the Subways" (editorial, Oct. 5), on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's proposed financial plan: The M.T.A. will issue half as much fare-box debt during the next five years as it did from 1982 to 1994, not twice as much, as you suggest. Through 1994, $2.6 billion of revenue bonds were issued to pay for the authority's capital program. From 1995 to 1999, we plan to issue $1.3 billion of revenue bonds. 
 The remaining revenue bonds in the plan won't be issued until 2000 to 2003 as projects are completed.
In 1999, debt service for pre-1995 revenue bonds will be almost $200 million, while debt service for the 1995-99 revenue bonds will be $85 million. New York City Transit Authority and commuter rail increases will provide revenues of $314 million in 1999, more than enough to cover the cost of the proposed program.
The M.T.A. announced a new five-year plan when its existing plan unraveled because the Federal, city and state governments reduced mass transit subsidies to close massive budget deficits.
The State Comptroller reported this week that the state's deficit amounts to $7 billion in the next two years. The city faces a reported $3 billion deficit next year. These are the economic realities you ignore. The M.T.A. must address these realities.
Rather than wait for a government bailout unlikely to materialize, we have developed a responsible plan that includes deep budget reductions, increased productivity and increased fare and toll revenues.
The plan will push the M.T.A. to become a more self-sufficient, cost-effective operation. The budget plans announced this week, which will reduce staff by 3,800 positions, are a positive step in this direction.
The plan's $3 billion budget reductions can be achieved, not at the expense of the reliability, safety or quality of service, but by increasing productivity through outsourcing, consolidations and work-rule changes.

HEADLINE: A Mixed Trading Session Sees Technology Stocks Rise Again

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Technology stocks extended their advance yesterday but cyclical issues like Caterpillar and Alcoa fell, leaving the market indexes mixed.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index of 500 stocks rose 0.66 point to 587.44, its second consecutive record close. The Nasdaq composite index, which includes many leading technology issues, gained 9.93 points to 1,045.37, adding to Tuesday's advance of 17.31 points. 
 But the Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.42 points, to 4,777.52 after rising 14.82 points earlier in the session. Two rounds of computer-guided orders to sell stocks sliced 14.80 points from the average, according to Birinyi Associates of Greenwich, Conn.
"What we have is a very divergent market," said Don Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond.
While technology and financial stocks have led the market higher this year, investors looking at other industries are "starting to get very concerned about the economy, especially Christmas sales and falling car sales," he said.
Earnings drove many of the market movers yesterday.
Shares of the Microsoft Corporation surged after the company reported late on Tuesday that earnings climbed to 78 cents a share, up from 51 cents last year and exceeding analyst estimates of 70 cents a share. Microsoft rose 4 1/2, to 95 5/8.
Confidence in the outlook for Microsoft spilled over to other technology stocks, driving the prices of Intel, Cisco Systems, Oracle and others sharply higher.
Sun Microsystems Inc. jumped a second day after reporting surprisingly strong earnings late Monday. The maker of computer workstations rose 4 3/4 to 72 5/8 after surging 9 1/4 on Tuesday.
The Compaq Computer Corporation climbed 2 3/4 to 54 1/8. The world's biggest maker of personal computers agreed to buy the Thomas-Conrad Corporation to expand its offering of network products.
Concerns of a cyclical slowdown dragged down several blue chips. Caterpillar slid 2 5/8 to 51 1/2 after reporting disappointing earnings on Tuesday, while Alcoa fell 1 to 50 3/4 on concern about rising aluminum production.
Shares of the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, dropped 2 1/4 to 66 1/2. While its quarterly earnings climbed 15 percent, they failed to match Wall Street expectations.
Shares of First Interstate Bancorp climbed 32.3 percent after Wells Fargo & Company offered to buy the company in a deal that would create the nation's seventh largest banking company.
First Interstate shares jumped 34 1/4 to 140 1/4, while those of Wells Fargo jumped 15 3/8 to 229. Wells Fargo, of San Francisco, offered 0.625 shares for every First Interstate share, valuing the Southern California bank at $143.125 a share.
Shares in Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which owns 14 percent of Wells Fargo, climbed 150 to 29,700.
The Great Western Financial Corporation, a savings and loan based in Chatsworth, Calif., climbed 1 3/8 to 25 1/2 after it said third-quarter earnings rose to 45 cents a share from 38 cents in the period a year earlier.
H. F. Ahmanson & Company, another California savings institution, jumped 1 1/2 to 27 3/4. Smith Barney raised its ratings on Ahmanson, which is scheduled to release earnings today, and Great Western. Both were raised to "buy" from "outperform."
Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst with Smith Barney, said that whether the Wells Fargo purchase of First Interstate "goes through or not, these companies have been given a higher profile as takeover candidates, especially for anyone who wants to build a presence in California."
The advance in financial stocks was not universal. Citicorp shares slumped 3 5/8 to 69 1/8 after the New York bank was removed from the recommended list at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and Merrill Lynch said it would have a tougher time surpassing analysts' earnings forecasts.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Slip as U.S. Posts Strong Trade Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday in choppy trading after a report on the nation's trade deficit indicated new strength in the economy.
Both the cash and futures markets slipped somewhat after the Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit narrowed 21.2 percent, to $8.8 billion, in August. Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected an August deficit of $11 billion. 
 The strong figure led some market participants to raise their estimates of economic growth in the third quarter, increasing the chances that inflation could accelerate as a result and reducing the possibility that the Federal Reserve would lower short-term interest rates at its policy meeting next month.
Despite the fall in prices yesterday, traders remain optimistic. Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the market was simply consolidating the gains achieved in recent days.
"Market sentiment is still bullish," he said. "Skeptical, but over all still bullish." Bond prices are reflecting the lack of much inflationary pressures, and investors are responding by buying the longer maturities, he added.
Yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond fell 19/32 , to 10710/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.33 percent, from 6.28 percent on Tuesday.
The Treasury announced yesterday that next week's note auctions would include $17.75 billion of a new two-year issue and $11.5 billion of a five-year issue.
If the high yield on the two-year note comes in at 5.750 percent to 5.874 percent at auction on Tuesday, the Treasury will reopen an existing five-year note that has two years left to maturity, the agency said. The five-year note carries a 5.75 percent coupon and is due on the same date, Oct. 31, 1997. It is likely that the Treasury wanted to eliminate confusion by not having two securities maturing on the same date.
In when-issued trading ahead of those auctions, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.67 percent and the five-year maturity at a price to yield 5.82 percent.
The battle in Washington over the budget and debt ceiling continues to weigh on the market, bolstering the prices of shorter-maturity issues. With the number of new bills reduced and demand about the same, investors are likely to pay a premium for bills.
In the futures market, the December bond contract bounced in a narrow range, reaching 11717/32 at its high and hitting 11628/32 at its low point, before settling at 117.
Robin Mesch, a fixed-income market analyst with Thomson Research in Boston, said "long term, bonds remain a buy-the-dip market in this quarter, but we could see a pullback to as low as 116 to 11529/32 on the contract without negating the bullish structure of the market."
"Today's consolidation gives us a sense that we will get a deeper pullback," she added.
In the municipal market, prices were steady, as California sold $461 million of general obligation bonds through competitive bidding won by Merrill Lynch.
Rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's, the bonds were priced to yield a maximum 5.80 percent for issues due in 2017 through 2020.
In the corporate bond market, where issuers have rushed to market to take advantage of rates hovering at 20-month lows, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation had the largest sale yesterday.
The finance arm of the large auto maker sold $500 million of noncallable 10-year notes through Merrill Lynch at a price to yield 6.701 percent, or 72.5 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Underwriters said the notes were rated A3 by Moody's and BBB+ by S.& P.

Hopes for U.S.-China Meeting Lift Wheat to 14-Year High

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Wheat prices topped $5 a bushel yesterday for the first time in more than 14 years on hopes that China would buy more American wheat.
On other commodity markets, copper and crude oil prices fell. The Commodity Research Bureau index rose eight-tenths of a point, to 241.30. 
 Wheat prices jumped at the end of trading on the Chicago Board of Trade after Agriculture Secretary Daniel R. Glickman said that President Clinton's scheduled meeting with President Jiang Zemin next Tuesday might lead to more wheat sales.
"I think the reason China hasn't been buying recently was political," Mr. Glickman said. With a meeting set for next week, "I expect them to begin to look more favorably at the market."
In addition, Egypt bought 700,000 metric tons of wheat, and traders expect a sale to the Philippines, which could shrink inventories already expected to reach a 20-year low next spring.
"It's just a bull market, and it showed itself," said Dave Armstrong, an analyst with the Chicago Corporation.
Wheat for December delivery rose as high as $5.01 a bushel yesterday before ending 8.25 cents higher at $4.9975 a bushel. It was the first time an active contract reached $5 a bushel since Jan. 16, 1981, the Chicago Board of Trade said.
Copper prices fell to their lowest level in almost a year on concerns that a slowing economy would reduce copper consumption by manufacturers.
"The economic story is getting somewhat shaky," said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York.
December copper fell 2.75 cents, to $1.211 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange of New York, the lowest price for an active contract since Oct. 25, 1994.
Despite a drop in crude oil inventories to their lowest level since 1979, November crude oil prices slipped 7 cents, to $17.61 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Dollar Drops Then Rebounds On Japan and U.S. Trade Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled in Asian trading yesterday, but rebounded after a report showed that the United States' trade deficit narrowed more than expected in August.
The dollar's rise prompted investors to sell German marks and buy other European currencies that had fallen against the mark recently. Dollar purchases by the Japanese central bank failed to halt the yen's rise during Asian trading. 
 "The market was short on dollars and caught very much off guard by the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit," said Charles Spence, director of Treasury sales at Standard Chartered Bank.
The dollar rose against the mark even though the Bundesbank left its 14-day repurchase rate unchanged during regular weekly money market activities. It was the first time the German central bank had not lowered the rate since Aug. 16. Lower German interest rates typically make the mark less attractive.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 100.76 Japanese yen from 100.41 yen on Tuesday. It edged up to 1.4232 marks from 1.4147 and to 1.1562 Swiss francs from 1.1480.
The early selloff in Asia began with a higher-than-expected Japanese merchandise trade surplus for September -- $11.29 billion, down 5.6 percent from August's surplus of $11.96 billion. But analysts had expected an even lower figure.
The dollar fell below 100 yen, prompting the Bank of Japan and Japan's postal service, which holds huge amounts in savings, to intervene in the market. But this failed to revive the dollar, Mr. Spence of Standard Chartered said. The dollar moved up somewhat during European trading but was still weak before the Commerce Department released the trade report.
The United States trade deficit narrowed to $8.82 billion in August, the smallest imbalance this year. When the news came out, the dollar jumped nearly 1 yen and more than a German pfennig.
"I think the boost took us to the higher end of the range that we've been in for the past several days but wasn't enough to take us over that," Mr. Spence said. "Consequently, the dollar looks ready to settle in again."
Market participants expected coordinated central bank intervention, which never materialized, as the dollar climbed. Such interventions have been most common recently when the dollar was rising. "But I think at this phase the central banks are quite content with the success they've had in turning the dollar around" since it hit post-World War II lows in April, Mr. Spence said.

HEADLINE: SENIOR CLASS;
Wearing the Gray Badge of Courage

BYLINE: By ROBERT W. STOCK 

 BODY:
EVENTUALLY, old age announces itself. Eyes fail, limbs ache, skin wrinkles. But before that happens in a serious way, most of us do some announcing of our own. We line up for senior discounts at subway booths or movie theaters. We dye our hair -- or stop dyeing it. We brag about our grandchildren, admit retirement, even tell people our real age.
Little scientific research has been done on these small moments of truth, these public admissions of our years. But two dozen interviews with experts and a cross section of older people suggest that these decisions are not made lightly and without some soul-searching. 
 Though the image of older people has improved somewhat in recent years, being old still carries heavy social and economic freight. Small wonder that we avoid the label as long as possible. "Coming to grips with age and death is tough," said Harry Moody, the acting director of the Brookdale Center on Aging in New York. "Sometimes denial is a good thing."
And deny we do. Consider David Garth, the 65-year-old New York political consultant, in front of his bathroom mirror. "I have a special angle where I can see myself the way I used to be," he said. "Then you see yourself on television, and you say, 'Who is that old guy?' "
The first time Mr. Garth was offered a discount at the movies, he said, "I was outraged." He still pays full price. "It's as though I'm just not aware of the discounts," he said. "I'm blocking."
Lillian Troll, 80, is a retired psychology professor in Alameda, Calif. "When I first became eligible for a movie discount, I didn't do it," she said. "I felt embarrassed about saying I was that old. It took me about five years. Then I just got used to the idea that people realized I was older."
Depending on your state of mind and the state of your pocketbook, the incentives to declare your age can be powerful, but some admissions are more public than others. Discounted airline tickets, for example, are pretty anonymous. On the other hand, heeding the airline boarding announcement that gives seniors advance seating puts you right out there. Slipping 60 cents into the bus fare box in New York usually attracts no attention, but the Washington Metro Farecard for older people is bright orange, while the regular card is white.
John Hendricks, a professor of sociology at Oregon State University in Corvallis, views such discounts and privileges as a kind of benign ageism -- he calls it the "poor dear syndrome" because it lumps all older people within a stereotype of being frail and destitute and in need of help. "It means that younger people will see you as different from them," he said, "lesser than them, not someone they would be interested in talking to. You get a 10 percent discount, but you are also being depreciated 10 percent."
Mr. Garth puts it this way: "The worst fear people have about getting older is being dependent and out of control. One of the symbols of being dependent is taking advantage of these things. Those who do it feel they're owed something, and I understand that. But I do away with all the symbols of dependency I can."
Of course, there are some people who simply relish discounts. "I'm not a rich person," said Genevieve Burke, a 72-year-old receptionist at the University of Vermont in Burlington. "I enjoy getting a bargain anytime, whether it's at the movies or at a flea market."
Many are the ways older people hide, and reveal, their age. Driving a car is a positive sign that you are part of the mainstream, said Susan A. Eisenhandler, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut in Waterbury. And giving up driving is a major acknowledgment of old age. "Even those who do will often keep renewing their license as proof positive that they're not really old," she said.
Some older people cringe when the post office delivers a copy of Modern Maturity, the American Association of Retired Persons magazine. Others determinedly stay away from senior centers and other senior activities.
"Friends tell me about the great trip they had, with all the details," said Elise Maclay, a Westport, Conn., writer. "But when I ask who sponsored it, there's this hesitation to admit it was Elderhostel, followed by assurances of how lively the other people on the trip were. If it had been an Audubon Society or Yale alumni trip, they would have said so in a minute."
Asked to give her own age, Ms. Maclay refused, for what she said was a very practical reason. "The world thinks, and editors think, you're not au courant, you're not 'with it' anymore," she said.
At a certain point, though, many older people take a different tack on that issue. "I don't mind saying how old I am," said Kenneth Lawson, 69, a retired lab technician in North Providence, R.I. "Maybe it has something to do with people thinking I look and act much younger."
Hugh Downs, a host of "20/20" on ABC-TV, makes no bones about acknowledging that he is 74: "Suppose I said I was 55. Then people would say, 'He's not in such good shape.' Now they say, 'You can't be that old.' " In any event, Mr. Downs said, he works in an industry where one's age cannot be hidden. "Lucky for me," he added, "it's an industry where it's not politically correct to discriminate against older people."
The issue of when to 'fess up gets little attention among gerontologists, said Lynne Gershensohn Hodgson, the chairwoman of the sociology and gerontology department at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn. "Do gerontologists who have spent their whole lives trying to eradicate negative attitudes toward older people put color in their hair?" she said. "We don't talk about it."
Professor Hodgson, who is 45, told of having dinner at a gerontological conference with a group of colleagues, most of whom were considerably older. "The print on the menu was tiny, and we all were having trouble with it," she recalled. "So for the first time in public I pulled out my reading glasses. I was going to show them how I acknowledged my aging. The next thing I knew, they all pulled out their reading glasses."
But times may be changing. Dr. Gene D. Cohen, the director of the Center on Aging, Health and the Humanities at George Washington University, believes that age stereotypes are weakening. "In the past, when you were 65, you were statistically much closer to death than today," he said. "A longer, healthier life span makes older people more comfortable with their age, and that makes them less likely to deny their aging."
The fact that older people are healthier, more active and better educated is also changing attitudes among the younger generations, Dr. Cohen said, because it fudges the differences between young and old that feed stereotypes. In other words, nowadays when you announce your age and a younger person says you don't look it, the chances are it's true. You're part of a historical process that is turning old age into more of a point of pride and less of an embarrassment.

HEADLINE: Clinton Angers Friend and Foe In Tax Remark

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
President Clinton made an offhand confession on Tuesday night that he had raised taxes "too much" in his first budget in 1993, and the remark drew mockery from Congressional Republicans today. Angry Democrats accused him of repudiating a package they had stuck their necks out to pass without a single Republican vote.
Speaking at a campaign fund raiser in Houston, Mr. Clinton said: "Probably there are people in this room still mad at me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too much, too." 
 The President, who took office promising both a tax cut for the middle class and higher taxes for the wealthiest Americans, deferred the tax cut in favor of further reducing the Federal budget deficit. In the speech on Tuesday, he seemed to blame both Democrats and Republicans for forcing his hand, although he defended his decision as "the right thing to do." After the remarks caused a small furor on Capitol Hill this morning, the White House complained that they were being taken out of context.
But members of both parties in Congress, debating Republican plans for tax cuts that Mr. Clinton bitterly opposes as too deep, saw no such subtleties. The Republican National Committee faxed copies of the speech around town, and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Bill Archer of Houston, held a news conference to say that Mr. Clinton "has finally come up with at least a half truth when he says he raised taxes too much; the full truth is he shouldn't have raised taxes at all."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who helped steer Mr. Clinton's proposal through the Senate Finance Committee, was just as harsh, saying that the 1993 budget's deficit reduction had improved the economy and was something to be proud of.
"It just knocked us over when we saw that report this morning," Mr. Moynihan said. "He keeps conceding these things. He doesn't understand that he's conceding the principles." Asked why he thought the President had made the remarks, Mr. Moynihan said: "He's running for re-election, he's raising money in Houston. What he should have said was, 'Is there a man in this room who's not richer than he was two years ago?' "
Mr. Clinton's remarks were made late Tuesday night and drew little notice, but Republicans seized on them this morning after he was quoted in a news service account of the speech.
The President seldom gets in more trouble than when he tries to explain himself too much to an audience he wants to win over, and the speech on Tuesday night seemed a classic example. Clearly tired from a three-day campaign swing, he gave a rambling talk, once referring to Huey Long as "the famous populist Governor and Senator of Kentucky," before correcting himself to say Louisiana.
But as he gears up for his re-election campaign, Mr. Clinton has increasingly sought to portray himself as a lonely paladin whose good ideas are frustrated by the will of both Congressional Democrats and Republicans, and his basic argument on taxes seemed less a slip than a calculated effort to shift blame to them.
His remarks Tuesday night closely echoed comments he made to the Business Council, a group of top corporate executives, in Williamsburg, Va., last Friday, when he said that because no Republicans would support his 1993 budget, "I had to raise your taxes more and cut spending less than I wanted to, which made a lot of you furious."
In fact, in his frantic search for enough Democratic votes to win passage, Mr. Clinton dropped proposed tax increases he favored, like one on energy, and in the end, Vice President Al Gore had to break a tie in the Senate.
"Do you know what we had to do to get those 50 votes?" Senator Moynihan said, recalling the White House arm-twisting.
Speaker Newt Gingrich said the President's analysis "verges on being out of touch with reality," and added: "When you have a President of the United States who is capable of making up whatever fantasies fit his current position, I don't know how as a serious person you can do anything."
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, insisted that too much was being made of Mr. Clinton's remarks. "Nobody likes to raise taxes," Mr. McCurry said. "Everybody would like to cut taxes."
"Every one of those Republicans that voted against the President's deficit reduction package predicted that this would be ruinous for the economy," Mr. McCurry added. "Remember that? And it wasn't, and that's the point the President made last night."
But Senator William V. Roth of Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, which today began deliberating the Republicans' $245 billion tax cut package, said, "I think we can all agree that the President did indeed raise taxes too much." He noted that Mr. Clinton himself had revived his own call for tax breaks for the middle class, albeit smaller and aimed more at lower income families than the Republicans' proposals.
Gene Sperling, a White House economic adviser, suggested the Republicans were simply trying to score oratorical points.
"The Republican Congress is relying on the increased revenue flow from the 1993 tax increase to balance the budget," he said. "Without that, they would not be anywhere near balance. Even though they control both houses of Congress, they have not rolled it back. So if they oppose it, they have an easy solution."

HEADLINE: Privatization Starts Feud In Haiti

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 14

 BODY:
There are just 66,000 telephone lines in all of Haiti, and the Government-run telephone company says it does not have the money to install more. The electric company, airport and harbor, also Government-owned and in need of modernization, complain of the same lack of funds.
Selling a share of those and other state enterprises to private investors might appear to offer a promising way out for a poor, nearly bankrupt country. But a plan to do just that has split the Haitian Government into two bitterly feuding camps and driven a widening wedge between President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Haiti's foreign aid lenders, led by the United States. 
 Hinging on the outcome of the policy dispute, the most serious the Aristide Government has experienced since being returned to power by American troops a year ago, is the disbursement of nearly half of Haiti's projected $350 million budget for this fiscal year. If Mr. Aristide does not go ahead with the privatization and other reforms he previously promised, the donor nations say they are prepared to hold back much of the aid they have pledged.
"This situation has got to be cleared up by the middle of November if that money is to flow," one foreign official warned. "Without external budget support, this Government is going to have to dramatically ramp down its spending, including job creation and social programs" dear to Mr. Aristide.
The privatization dispute was central to the decision of Smarck Michel, the 58-year-old businessman whom Mr. Aristide appointed as his prime minister last year, to submit his resignation Friday. Mr. Michel has vigorously supported the privatization effort, but has been opposed by Mr. Aristide and some of his fellow Cabinet ministers.
While still in exile last year, the Aristide Government presented lender nations with a privatization plan and in February it signed an agreement with the International Finance Corporation, a branch of the World Bank, to sell off all or part of nine state enterprises, including two banks. But little progress has been made since then, and Haiti's aid donors say Mr. Aristide's unwillingness to commit himself to the program is the main reason.
"The President is not playing straight with us and that means we are on a collision course," said one irritated foreign official. "It is unacceptable for him to give aid and comfort to the international community behind closed doors and then say something completely different to his own people."
Initially, Mr. Aristide referred to privatization as an act of "economic democratization" that would strip the oligarchy of economic power and transfer it to ordinary people. But he has made no concentrated effort to explain the program and its potential benefits to the population in speeches and meetings, a procedure he normally follows when he clearly wants something done.
That ambivalence, in turn, has encouraged Mr. Aristide's supporters in grass- roots groups on the left to organize street demonstrations and paint anti-privatization graffiti everywhere. They have also vehemently attacked Mr. Michel and other proponents of the measures on the Government-owned television, accusing them of betraying the nation.
But the measures are also opposed by some of Haiti's most powerful families, who have formed a temporary alliance with the left. With several of the state companies closed down or crippled, they have been able to make huge profits by controlling imports of items such as generators, flour and cement, and in any case are not eager to face more efficient foreign competitors.
"A few big capitalists don't want it because they are used to having a monopoly," Mr. Michel said while visiting the United States last month.
Chances for further political conflict have only grown with the seating of a new Parliament. Dominated by nationalistic, left-wing members of Mr. Aristide's Lavalas movement, the National Assembly has offered no indication that it is willing to move quickly on the privatization issue in order to meet foreign-imposed conditions.
On Aug. 7, the Government opened bidding for the first two companies, a cement company and a flour mill, both of which have been shuttered since 1972 and were thus considered unlikely to cause controversy. The bids were supposed to have been opened on Oct. 2, but remain "under lock and key, sealed in a safe," as one Haitian official put it.
That does not bode well for the immensely more complicated and contentious process of privatizing the telephone company, which is profitable but notoriously inefficient, or the electric utility, which loses money and is unable to supply power to large parts of the country.

HEADLINE: How World Bank Can Help Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The meeting in Washington of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (news article, Oct. 12) did little to change their model of economic policy reform called structural adjustment. These organizations have the power of reducing government spending, restricting credit, cutting wages and promoting foreign investment in all the countries that borrow from them. This kind of reform has too often failed to benefit the poor, and has widened the gap between rich and poor. 
 In Zimbabwe, with the institution of a World Bank structural adjustment program, real per capita spending on health and education fell by nearly one-third. The majority of African governments under structural adjustment were spending less on health per capita in 1990 than in 1980, and vaccination rates in 24 African nations have fallen since 1990.
More than 1,200 members of Congress and parliaments worldwide are preparing to present a letter to the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The letter urges the institutions to promote strategies that maximize individual capacity, most especially cost-effective, community-based health care, education and access of the poor to credit for self-employment.
New York's Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato have not signed this letter. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have enormous power. Only through concerted pressure from government and citizens around the world can this power be harnessed to meet the needs of all people.
We will measure the worth of the World Bank and the I.M.F. by their success in efforts to end the poverty afflicting more than a billion people.

HEADLINE: President Hints at Budget Compromise

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
President Clinton held out the possibility today that he and Congressional Republicans could find a way to balance the Federal budget in seven years as the Republicans want but only if they gave ground on cutting programs for health, education and the environment that he wants to protect.
In the clearest statement yet of the extent, and the limits, of his willingness to compromise, Mr. Clinton said, "I think there's a way for me to meet their stated objectives, which is a balanced budget in seven years, with a family tax cut, and I think they want a capital gains tax cut." 
 But he warned the Republicans to "turn back from passing extreme measures that will never become law."
Mr. Clinton also said that when he remarked on Tuesday that he raised taxes "too much" in 1993, he did not mean to suggest that he regretted passage of the economic plan that imposed those tax increases. Republicans had mocked the comment, while Democrats, fearful that the President would compromise too readily in the current budget battle, were outraged that he seemed to be repudiating a plan many supported only reluctantly at the time.
Even as Mr. Clinton sought in an informal news conference this morning to clarify his remarks on the tax increase, he raised new questions by suggesting for the first time that he might accept the Republicans' timetable -- though not their priorities -- for balancing the budget.
Balancing the budget by 2002 has been one of the chief Republican goals, one dismissed by the White House last spring as virtually impossible if not outright dangerous for the economy. More recently, the White House had said it believed the budget could be balanced in nine years; so Mr. Clinton's willingness even to entertain doing so in seven seemed to be a significant olive branch.
Speaker Newt Gingrich praised Mr. Clinton's comments as "a big step in the right direction," but he could not resist adding a dig at the President's reputation for equivocation: "If he says that tomorrow it will be really good, and if he says it all weekend it will be terrific."
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said Mr. Clinton's latest comments "could have been a mistake, too."
In fact, when pressed on his comments about the budget timetable, Mr. Clinton seemed to soften them a bit, saying, "Well, I think we could reach it in seven years, I think we could reach it in eight years, I think we could reach it in nine years."
White House aides later said the important consideration was spending priorities, not the number of years. But they acknowledged that the only way to preserve Mr. Clinton's favored programs and balance the budget in the time the Republicans want would be to compromise on the size of any tax cuts and adopt more optimistic economic forecasts than the Republicans have so far been willing to accept.
The President has threatened to veto half a dozen of the Republicans' major proposals, including cuts in Medicare and Medicaid growth. Aides said he was trying to walk a fine line between such threats and holding out the possibility of compromise on other issues.
"He's been looking for ways to hold the door he said was open open," said one senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "He's recently become worried that the Republicans have been so frozen into a hard-line position on various points that they won't budge."
White House aides said they were increasingly concerned that the Republicans would try to force a budget showdown by refusing to raise the Federal debt ceiling when the Government's borrowing authority expires early next month and cash runs out. For the first time today they held serious discussions about whether Mr. Clinton would be able to attend a scheduled economic conference in Japan on Nov. 16 if a crisis was unresolved.
Mr. Gingrich said today that he expected to delay any action to increase borrowing authority until after the giant tax and spending bill was finished.
In his news conference, before taking the first question, the President went out of his way to backtrack from his comment at a political dinner in Texas on Tuesday that "I raised your taxes too much" in 1993.
"If I said anything which implies that I think we didn't do what we should have done, given the choices we faced at that time, I shouldn't have said that," Mr. Clinton said. "My mother once said I should never give a talk after 7 at night, especially if I'm tired. And she turned out to be right, is all I can say."
In fact, Mr. Clinton said, "I am very, very proud of what I did."
Mr. Clinton also said he envisioned committing United States troops to police a possible Bosnian peace accord for "in the range of a year," but he said he did not want to decide definitively until the precise goals of any peacekeeping mission were set.

HEADLINE: RESHAPING MEDICARE: THE IMPLICATIONS;
Past All the Talk, Some True Goals

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Beneath the surface, the debate in the House of Representatives today was not so much about the Medicare program itself as it was about partisan politics: about whether the Republican revolution will succeed and about whether Democrats can recapture the glory of the New Deal and the Great Society.
The politicians may agree on little else, but they agree on this: Next year's elections and those for years to come could turn on how the public perceives the votes this year on Medicare. 
 That explains why the speeches today were more tactical than explanatory, concerned more with resonance than with truth. Both sides tailored their arguments to fit the public's view, expressed in opinion polls, that almost nothing the Government does is so important as sustaining Medicare. They had to stretch to do so.
Republicans maintained that their only aim was to save the popular program from bankruptcy. Democrats held, as Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico said this morning, that under the Republican plan, "Medicare will end as we know it today."
But no matter how often Republicans repeated their mantra about preserving and protecting Medicare -- words carefully field-tested by their pollsters -- they cannot escape the fact that their true goal in overhauling the Medicare program is to raise money for their fiscal agenda.
And no matter how much Democrats pledged allegiance to Medicare, the creation of which was the crowning achievement of the last generation of Democratic lawmakers, they cannot escape the fact that fundamental changes are essential if the program is to survive.
Take the Republicans first.
In their Contract With America, the platform on which they won control of Congress last year, Republicans promised to cut taxes for middle- and upper-income Americans and balance the Federal budget in seven years. The contract said nothing about Medicare.
But once they were in the majority in Congress, the Republicans realized that they had to find the money somewhere to offset the lower taxes and balance the budget. With Social Security off the table, the only available pot was Medicare. Less than 12 percent of the budget now, Medicare would account for 30 percent of the lower spending in the Republican budgets over the next seven years.
This was not done for ideological reasons the way, for example, the Republicans want to cut welfare programs and turn them over to the states for administration. Nor was it done because Republicans disapprove of the existing Medicare program the way, say, they object to environmental regulations.
The decisions on Medicare were made purely and simply to raise money, not to preserve and protect anything. The Republicans seized on the report this spring by Medicare trustees that the system would go bankrupt by 2002 unless spending was reduced or more revenue raised. But that was just a convenient excuse. The trustees had made similar reports for years without Republicans expressing anxiety. And the amount of savings the Republicans seek -- $270 billion over seven years -- is many times what would be needed to avert insolvency.
This is how the $270 billion figure was arrived at: First the Republicans decided to balance the budget by 2002. Then they decided to cut taxes by $245 billion. Then they squeezed as much as they could out of all other Government programs. At that point, they were $270 billion short of the money they needed. That is how much they decided to take from Medicare.
But if the Republicans did not face up to the facts today, neither did the Democrats. Not one Democrat alluded to the incontrovertible fact that taxpayers cannot afford to sustain the Medicare system as it exists today.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that unless significant changes are made, the cost of Medicare will rise to $458 billion, or 18.6 percent of the budget, in 2005, from $178 billion, or 11.7 percent of the budget, in 1995. By the second decade of the next century, when those in the baby boom generation begin to retire, Medicare will be swallowing such a large share of the Federal pie that little will be left for anything else.
Today, about four workers pay taxes for each person covered by Medicare. The proportion will fall to 3.1 workers in 2015, to 2.5 workers in 2025 and to 2 workers for each beneficiary in 2050, according to Government estimates.
And consider this: Medical costs in the private economy have leveled off in the last couple of years as more and more workers have turned to -- or been forced into -- cost-efficient managed care systems like health maintenance organizations. Some large employers, like the State of California, have actually reduced their bill for providing medical insurance for their workers. But the cost of Medicare, virtually the last bastion of traditional fee-for-service medicine, has continued to grow by about 10 percent a year.
Rather than address this predicament, the Democrats, bereft of new ideas to counter the Republican offensive, returned to the same well they have relied on for years -- the charge that Republicans are playing fast and loose with the well-being of the elderly.
Democrats are convinced, for instance, that they wrested control of the Senate from Republicans in 1986 by hammering on the theme that Republican senators had voted to lower Social Security benefits.
In the long term, lawmakers in both parties will probably face up to truths they preferred for political reasons to avoid today. If the Republican plan becomes law and down the road insufficient funds are available for high-quality health care for the elderly, Republicans will most likely intervene to provide whatever money is needed.
If, on the other hand, the Republican Medicare plan dies on the vine because of a Presidential veto or for some other reason, it is an equally safe bet that Democrats will ultimately agree to make whatever changes are necessary to keep the program solvent.
But that's the long-range outlook. In the short term, there is one certain prospect: The vote in the House today will be a dominant issue in next year's election.

HEADLINE: Milk Industry Faces Vast Change

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: MIFFLINTOWN, Pa.

 BODY:
For most of the 23 years that Donald C. Everitt has been running a small dairy farm here, few groups have had more power on Capitol Hill than the milk lobby, and few farmers were as assured of help if things went badly.
But no commodity has fared so badly in Congress this year as milk, with the House Agriculture Committee producing a plan to abolish price supports while its Senate counterpart has slashed subsidies in half. 
 For consumers, the changes may trim a few pennies off the price of a gallon of milk. Mr. Everitt worries that the changes could mean that the Everitt family's 270 years of dairy farming may soon end. But Gary L. Anderson, who runs a dairy farm in Cecil, Wis., thinks the cuts are worth the chance to get rid of rules that guarantee higher prices for dairy farmers in Pennsylvania like Mr. Everitt than for those in his region.
The upending of the complex system that has governed milk production for decades shows that even a long-entrenched interest group like dairy farmers can lose its hold on Congress in a year of rapid change.
Part of the industry's power has come from the ubiquity of dairy farmers, who can be found in every state in the nation. But under the pressure of a budget resolution calling for billions of dollars in cuts in farm subsidies, regional differences divided the industry and undermined its influence.
Blunders also played a part: trade groups long used to dealing with a Democratic majority moved ineptly to adjust to Republican control, angering a subcommittee chairman.
And Senator Rick Santorum, the Republican representing Mr. Everitt and other Pennsylvania farmers on the Senate Agriculture Committee, found himself caught between his constituents' interests and his own pledges to reduce the budget.
Already struggling with rising costs, Mr. Everitt and his 37-year-old son, Donald Jr., now keep an extra 30 cows and rise at 4 o'clock every morning, an hour earlier than they did a decade ago, to milk the cows.
"I'm just barely getting by -- my wife works, my son and I have more cows," Mr. Everitt said as his herd ate from a nearby trough. "They say we're supposed to be better managers, but there comes a point where we can't be any better."
Farmers are known for making such complaints, lest someone notice their good fortune and take it away. But economists agree that for small family dairy farms, particularly those in the Northeast, the budget bill now moving through Congress could prove disastrous.
"An 80-cow farm is going to find it hard to be cost competitive" in the Northeast, said Andrew M. Novakovic, chairman of the agricultural economics department at Cornell University. "As a general rule, that isn't going to be enough."
The Senate plan would lower the price that farmers are guaranteed for their milk. The House plan would go further and eliminate the current labyrinth of Federal rules dictating the minimum prices that companies must pay to farmers in each of 34 regions for various grades of milk sold to consumers. Companies would instead be allowed to buy milk from whatever farmer sold it cheapest.
To be sure, Congress has done some favors for dairy farmers. The House plan would make small, fixed payments to dairy farmers to help them weather the transition to a deregulated market. But the overall effect of both plans would be less Federal spending, more competition and probably lower milk prices.
Public-policy experts and consumer groups have long called for these changes. The current system amounts to an indirect tax on milk users, they say, taking as much as $800 million in higher prices each year from milk consumers and giving that money to dairy farmers.
"Government regulations mean that consumers pay more, and taxpayers pay more, than they should," said Harry M. Snyder, an authority on dairy policy at Consumers Union.
Farmers like Mr. Anderson and his neighbors agree. "We see the Federal dairy program as a disadvantage, and if we let market forces determine who produces and at what price, we believe we'd be better off here in the Midwest," he said.
But Mr. Everitt worries about what will happen if milk price supports are eliminated and the industry is suddenly exposed to the ferocious competition of the modern American business world. "It's nice to have that safety net -- if you don't have it, the price could really drop," he said the other day on his farm here in south-central Pennsylvania.
In one sense, the milk industry's troubles began with its remarkable success in past legislative battles. It fought off some of the changes that have limited the cost of other Federal crop subsidies in recent years. So when Republicans went looking for big, expensive farm programs that could yield large budget savings, they immediately began looking at the milk program.
Recognizing the danger, milk lobbyists opened their campaign with a move that quickly backfired. They volunteered for some subsidy cuts provided that complicated new rules be introduced to share the cost among regions of the country. The House and Senate agriculture panels promptly accepted the chance to save money in their deficit reduction efforts, but rejected the new rules.
"What they did was deny us the one thing we had to have in our offer," said James C. Barr, the chief executive of the National Milk Producers Federation, the dairy farmers' lobbying group.
The milk producers also gambled that they could block the deregulation and free-market rules envisioned by Representative Steve Gunderson, the Wisconsin Republican who heads the House Agriculture dairy subcommittee, by rallying representatives from other regions against him.
But the plan backfired when Republicans proved reluctant to challenge Mr. Gunderson and when the subcommittee chairman responded with fury. "It was a cold, calculated, manipulative attempt to try to bring all the regions of the country together to roll the Midwest and keep business as usual," Mr. Gunderson said.
The move so angered him that he then pushed through the Agriculture Committee a sweeping plan for complete deregulation.
Mr. Barr said he wanted a plan that was good for the entire milk industry, not just Wisconsin dairy farmers. Ending regional differences in milk prices "will cause vast regional dislocations," he predicted.
The reshuffling of Congressional committee membership also left the dairy business at a disadvantage. No Republicans serve on the House Agriculture Committee representing Northeastern districts.
The Senate Agriculture Committee is dominated by Southerners and Midwesterners. It has one Northeastern Republican, Mr. Santorum. But the Senator, a freshman with a strong commitment to free-market principles, believes that the days of lavish farm subsidies are numbered, and he has tried to change the nation's costly sugar and peanut programs instead of protecting his state's huge dairy industry.
The dairy industry also used to shield itself from political harm with lavish campaign contributions to both parties. But it showed poor judgment in its political contributions in the last two years. A study of dairy industry contributions by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington research group, found that 9 of the top 10 House recipients of dairy industry money in 1993 and 1994 were Democrats. So were 7 of the top 10 Senate recipients.
Political action committees for milk farmers began giving more generously to Republicans in the first half of this year, but the fact remains that few Republicans owe the industry any favors.

HEADLINE: RESHAPING MEDICARE: THE OVERVIEW;
HOUSE VOTES TO CURB COSTS OF MEDICARE BY $270 BILLION; PRESIDENT PROMISES A VETO

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
House Republicans took a giant step today toward dismantling decades of Democratic social policy, passing legislation to curb Medicare spending and encourage the elderly to turn to private managed-care organizations from the traditional Government plan that has served them since 1965.
The vote was 231 to 201, as 4 Democrats joined 227 Republicans in favor of the bill, while 6 Republicans, 194 Democrats and 1 independent voted against it. 
 Speaker Newt Gingrich, appearing weary after hours of hard bargaining, closed the debate before the vote by saying: "We want to solve problems for all Americans. We want no racial division. We want no class warfare. We want no conflict between generations." He added, "We want a solution to preserve and protect Medicare."
But President Clinton renewed his threat to veto the measure, which will become part of the massive budget reconciliation bill going to the floor next week. He told a news conference that the bill amounted to a "$270 billion cut in Medicare that will eviscerate the health system for our older Americans." Addressing his remarks to House Republicans, he declared: "I will not let you destroy Medicare. I will veto this bill."
With the Senate expected to adopt a similar measure, the stage will be set for a definitive political clash over the size, shape and purpose of Federal spending, with Mr. Clinton and the Republicans each blaming the other for risking a Government shutdown or a default on bonds.
The argument on the House floor was less a debate than an exercise in serial speech making, with each side having a few carefully scripted points, made over and over again. Democrats complained about tax cuts and increases in Medicare premiums. Republicans said their bill would keep the system from going bankrupt. When representatives actually responded to each other's remarks, it was usually to offer flat contradiction or insult.
Accusing Democrats of "Medagoguery," Representative Porter J. Goss, Republican of Florida, said, "We're going to pass this bill because we want to save Medicare."
Representative Pat Williams, Democrat of Montana, said: "They are gutting Medicare. Today, Medicare; tomorrow, Social Security, programs they have always opposed and oppose today."
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the bill changed the meaning of G.O.P., from Grand Old Party to "Get Old People."
"There is only one reason this bill is required -- to finance tax cuts for the rich," said Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who waved the gavel he used to preside over the House when it passed the original Medicare legislation in April 1965.
Representative Martin R. Hoke, Republican of Ohio, said Democrats offered "nothing more than another in a long line of Band-Aid solutions." Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, the majority whip, called the Democratic alternative "a joke wrapped in fraud and shrouded by farce."
Although none of New York's 14 Republicans voted against the bill, several of its provisions alarm New York health officials. They are concerned that its spending curbs will hit urban hospitals with particular severity because many depend on a variety of Federal subsidies that the bill would reduce or eliminate.
There is particular concern in academic medical centers and hospitals that depend on large numbers of foreign-trained residents, because the bill appears to reduce reimbursements for them.
The Democrats proposed cutting only $90 billion from the program over seven years, or as much as they said was really needed if a $245 billion tax cut plan were not part of the Republican program. The Democratic proposal was defeated, 283 to 149. Many Democrats, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, opposed even those cuts. Mr. Gephardt's aides said he did not want to cut Medicare at all until the Republican tax cut proposal had been abandoned.
The Senate Finance Committee approved it today.
The Republican Medicare bill, closely similar to one the Senate is expected to adopt as part of budget reconciliation later this month, would reduce allowances in the future for inflation in Medicare expenditures for hospitals, doctors and other health care providers. According to the Congressional Budget Office, more than half of the $270 billion would come in that way.
Its most innovative section would encourage the elderly to get their health care through health maintenance organizations or other plans with a specific list of providers under the general rubric of managed care. These plans, called Medicareplus, would have to provide at least as much in benefits as the traditional fee-for-service system did.
One element would be medical savings accounts, with which individuals would make tax-free deposits to cover expenses, deductibles on insurance policies, copayments and some items that Medicare does not cover, like prescription drugs.
Though Republicans touted these innovations, the Congressional Budget Office found that only 13 percent of the bill's savings would come from encouraging the elderly to move into managed care. Another 20 percent would come from increases in the monthly premiums Medicare beneficiaries pay for doctor care.
The bill also provides that if the savings expected from the devices do not materialize, the Government must order additional curbs on reimbursements to hospitals and doctors. Democrats asserted this provision would take effect and drive doctors away from treating Medicare patients, and thus bring an end to the fee-for-service system.
Democrats contended that the Republican curbs on projected Medicare spending were really cuts. "These huge Medicare cuts are needed to pay for tax cuts for the rich," said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia. Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, asserted, "We aren't making cuts, folks, we're slowing the growth."
Not all the complaints came from Democrats. Four New Jersey Republicans defected from their party, saying the bill hit their state too hard. They were: Representatives Frank A. LoBiondo, H. James Saxton, Christopher H. Smith and Dick Zimmer.
Governor Christine Todd Whitman had urged the delegation to fight a part of the bill lowering special Medicare payments to hospitals serving large numbers of indigent patients. The Governor and the delegation also asked Mr. Gingrich to improve language on the reimbursement for international medical graduates.
Another major complaint from the Democrats was that hospitals would suffer. Representative Eva Clayton, Democrat of North Carolina, said: "Many of my hospitals will lose. Several of them may have to close."
Often, after a Republican had finished speaking, a Democrat would get up to announce an estimate of the losses to hospitals in his or her district. For example, Mr. Dingell told Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, that the Texas Medical Center would lose "half a billion dollars."
When they were not snapping at Democrats, Republicans emphasized soothing rhetoric. "Our plan is a long-term solution, a vision, hopes and dreams," Mr. Archer said.
Outside the Capitol, union members protested the Republican proposal. Democrats promised, as Mr. Gephardt told them, that even if today's vote was lost "the fight has just begun." He added, "And we will win."
On the floor, the minority whip, Representative David E. Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, renewed that argument, saying, "The debate in this country is just beginning, and it will continue around the kitchen tables of every home in America, where sons and daughters will scrimp and save to care for their parents."
But the Republicans had their supporters, too. About 100 of them watched the proceedings on a television in a meeting room two floors below the House chamber. After the vote, Mr. Gingrich, smiling broadly and waving, entered the room to sustained applause.
"This is a very, very great victory," the Speaker said. "It is a great victory for courage over fear, it is a great victory for facts over fiction, it's a great victory for being positive over a very nasty and dishonest demagogic attack ads."
 
CHRONOLOGY
What Next for Medicare Legislation:
 
YESTERDAY -- House passes its version of Medicare.
 
OCT. 26 - House is scheduled to pass the reconciliation bill - a piece of legislation that includes welfare revisions, tax cuts, farm subsidies and a Medicaid overhaul. Before the bill is voted on, the House Medicare will be incorporated.
 
BEFORE MONTH'S END -- Senate passes its version of the reconciliation bill, including its Medicare provisions.
 
LATE OCTOBER/EARLY NOVEMBER - House-Senate Conference is held to iron out differences in the two reconciliation bills.
 
SHORTLY AFTERWARD -- House passes compromise bill. Senate passes compromise bill. Bill goes to President Clinton. If President exercises veto, as he has threatened, he and Republican leaders in Congress would have to reach a compromise. Republicans don't have votes to override a veto.

HEADLINE: President's Guru Goes Public;
Back Home, Dick Morris Tells Tales From the Clubhouse

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
President Clinton's latest political guru, Dick Morris, is usually so obsessively low-profile that he might best be known as the stealth strategist.
But not last night, when he stepped far, far back to his political roots to mingle with the remnants of New York's Tammany machine. 
 From the moment Mr. Morris arrived outside Gallagher's Steak House on the West Side, a half hour late and fresh from the Washington shuttle, the flashbulbs popped, the boom mikes dangled, and he was at the center of the media maelstrom usually reserved for the candidates, not the consultants.
"Richard, wrong way, turn left," Bernie Cohen growled into a microphone. He was trying to direct Mr. Morris, the West Side's prodigal son, a Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-Clintonite, who was fighting his way through a drink-toting crowd from the McManus Midtown Democratic Association to a podium in an upstairs sanctum of the steakhouse.
"That," said Mr. Cohen, the association's general counsel, "was not intended as a commentary on your advice."
For an hour, Mr. Morris, 47, was far more revealing of himself than of his strategy to re-elect Mr. Clinton. The small man in the gray suit peremptorily ordered the cameras to the back of the room. He told "one of the all-time great romantic stories of the Western world," the tale of his 85-year-old father, Eugene, who married his high school sweetheart, Blanche, after his first wife died two years ago.
He introduced his high school debate partner, Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried. "The first campaign that I ever ran was his campaign for district leader on the West Side of Manhattan," Mr. Morris said.
"Did you win?" a voice demanded.
"Oh, against Bernie," Mr. Morris said. "I forget. He was also my first opponent."
It turns out that Mr. Secrecy likes an audience.
Mr. Morris's uncharacteristic appearance in this West Side steakhouse would baffle official Washington. But then again, Washington does not know much about the McManus. Four years ago, it hardly knew about Hope, Ark.
New York Democrats, on the other hand, have known the McMani, as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan dubbed them, across the century that the Irish clan has dominated politics in Hell's Kitchen. The legendary Tammany leader, George Washington Plunkitt, once complained: "Ceasar had his Brutus. I've got my 'The' McManus." The McManus in question was the great uncle of James R. McManus, Mr. Morris's host last night.
Mr. McManus and Mr. Morris go way back to the wars between the Reformers and the Regulars that made West Side Democratic politics like a free-fire zone in the 1960's and 70's. Most of the reformers shunned Mr. McManus, the son of Tammany, who won the district leadership in Hell's Kitchen after his father died in 1963. "I was 26 years old and people would curse me out," he recalled. "You carry your father's sins."
But not the West Side kids -- Mr. Morris among them -- the bright boys from Stuyvesant, the city's elite public high school, and Columbia University, who seized control of several reform clubs.
"They saw the weakness of the reform clubs, in the sense that they had complete democracy, you know," said Mr. McManus, a firm believer in clubhouse discipline and in delivering votes in a block. "What they did was pack the clubs and took over the clubs from within."
Across the years, Mr. Morris moved to Connecticut. His politics veered from left to right. Yet when Mr. McManus needed a draw for last night's $60-a-head club fund-raiser -- small potatoes compared to the $1,000-a-plate Presidential galas -- Mr. Morris volunteered.
"For a man who became powerful and deals with senators and Presidents and Governors to call a little district leader on the West Side and offer that, that's a friend and a wonderful person who doesn't forget 25 years ago," Mr. McManus said. "Listen, the politicians forget last week."
Mr. Morris returned the compliment last night. "Just as you never forget the first woman you were intimate with, you never forget the first person you made a political deal with," he said of Mr. McManus.
Mr. McManus is not Mr. Morris's only remaining New York tie. The consultant has already signed up to run a Democratic mayoral race for Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer in 1997, a sign that the Republicans may not prove forgiving of Mr. Morris's defection to President Clinton.
And to some dismay from the Washington political establishment, Mr. Morris has brought a handful of New Yorkers into the White House with him: the media consultant Henry Sheinkopf, a former police officer with a thick New York accent known for his ability to play hardball, and the pollsters Mark Penn and Douglas Schoen, who began as proteges of David Garth. But the two now range so broadly that Mr. Penn worked for Ross Perot in 1992 and Mr. Schoen managed the unsuccessful campaign of Milan Panic, the American businessman who ran for President of Serbia.
Everything about Mr. Morris that now makes Washington fret has been known for years in these New York precincts. His propensity to switch-hit, representing Republicans or Democrats indiscriminately, was foreshadowed in his years as a high school debate team captain during which classmates recall him debating any side of an issue with equal verve and persuasiveness.
Here too they knew, in the vernacular of the Lower East Side, that this was a man with chutzpah. Representative Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan, another West Side kid, remembers the time he read a liberal defense of the cities that Mr. Morris had written for The Village Voice and noticed that Mr. Morris was referred to at the end of the article as an economist.
"I knew Dick had a B.A. from Columbia in government," Mr. Nadler recalled in a phone interview. "I called him up and said, 'Great article" -- which it was. I was curious about one thing, 'How did you become a noted economist?" As Mr. Nadler recounts it, Mr. Morris replied, "One becomes a noted economist the way one becomes a Presidential candidate. One declares it."
Last night, no one was quibbling with Mr. Morris's credentials. "I'd like just to close by giving you a wonderful personal vignette that my wife said I should say," Mr. Morris said. "I was sitting with the President one night and we were working on some speech or other and it was getting kind of late. We were alone. And I looked at him and I said, 'You know Mr. President, ever since I was 8 years old, I dreamed of doing exactly this in exactly this way. And he looked back at me and he smiled and he said, 'So did I.' "

HEADLINE: 16 City Schools Are Taken Over By Chancellor

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
On his fourth day as Chancellor of the New York City Schools, Dr. Rudy Crew said he was taking direct control of the city's 16 most troubled schools, places where the vast majority of children cannot read at grade level and where some teachers appear preoccupied with discipline rather than with learning.
In some cases the Chancellor would break larger schools into several smaller ones, in other cases he would remove principals and in the worst situations he would replace the entire staff of a school -- its principal, teachers and aides, said his spokesman, David Begel. 
 "I will take no excuses for schools that do not, or have not, over the course of a multiple set of years, been able to make substantial gains for their children," Dr. Crew told reporters yesterday at the Board of Education's headquarters in Brooklyn at an event for student journalists. He allowed only the students to ask questions, and the actual takeover announcement was made later in the day by his spokesman.
The new Chancellor's aggressive action came after the State Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills, himself only in the job a month, issued detailed reports on the failures of the schools.
Based on inspections by state investigators made last week, the reports showed a list of problems: math-teaching techniques from the 1950's at Erasmus Hall High School in Flatbush; filthy bathrooms with no doors, soap or towels at P.S. 121 in East Harlem; classes in "near chaos" at P.S. 65 in the South Bronx, a school where a third of the teachers were substitutes or uncertified, and insensitivity by teachers at P.S. 62, also in the South Bronx, who asked their students, many of them homeless and poor, "Where did you go on vacation?"
In a news conference in Albany yesterday, Mr. Mills said he was giving New York City's Board of Education until the end of the school year to improve the schools or the state would move in to close them. "I have a legal and moral responsibility to act in the face of these facts," he said.
But his firm threat of takeovers gives Dr. Crew added muscle in intervention. All but the three high schools are run by local school boards, which have blocked intervention by previous chancellors in court actions over the years. The state, however, has the authority to close schools, by removing what is essentially their license to operate. Mr. Mills and Dr. Crew have both said they were working together on intervention plans.
Later in the day, Dr. Crew said that while each school's problems are complex and distinct, the need to take action is critical and overdue. All 16 of the schools have been on the state's list of low-performing schools since the state began tracking them in 1989.
Mr. Begel said the 16 schools -- 3 high schools, 3 junior highs and 10 elementary schools -- would immediately come under the Chancellor's control. A 17th school that Mr. Mills considered as a candidate for takeover under this round of action, James Monroe High School in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, has made enough progress that it will be given more time to improve.
Dr. Crew is arranging meetings with local community school boards and superintendents, who oversee the elementary and junior high schools, to discuss a redesign of the schools, Mr. Begel said. He also will be talking with representatives of the teachers' and principals' unions about the takeovers.
"What's important to emphasize is the collaborative nature of this effort," Mr. Begel said.
It is too soon yet to say what action each school will require, Mr. Begel said. In some of them, principals or teachers might be replaced. At others, the school may be broken up into smaller units.
Carol A. Gresser, the Board of Education president, said she was hopeful that Dr. Crew's effort would make a difference to the long-failing schools because there will be support from all levels.
"This is the state and this board and the Chancellor locking arms, and saying we have to work together," she said. "This is not an adversarial action as far as I'm concerned."
She said the effort to improve the schools began under Dr. Crew's two predecessors, Ramon C. Cortines and Joseph A. Fernandez.
But both chancellors met legal resistance from local boards.
When Mr. Cortines tried to take over Intermediate School 193 in the South Bronx, School District 12 spent more than a year fighting him in court. In August, as Mr. Cortines prepared to leave, a state judge ruled that the Chancellor had the right to bypass the local board and dismiss a principal whom the board had hired.
While the law gives the chancellor the power to intervene when there is an act of wrongdoing, it is less clear when the issue is academic failure.
Mrs. Gresser said the central Board of Education would urge Albany lawmakers to introduce legislation that would clarify those powers -- needed under the state law that decentralized the city system in 1970. A similar bill two years ago died after intense lobbying by unions opposed to giving the chancellor such powers.
The chances of such a bill passing appear better this year because the more aggressive stance is supported by Carl T. Hayden, who was elected last March as the Chancellor of the State Board of Regents, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker.
Donald Singer, the president of the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, has said he would not oppose the Chancellor's intervention as long as principals had been given enough time and resources to succeed.
The 16 schools are all on the State Education Department's list of "schools under registration review" created in 1989 under Commissioner Thomas Sobol. Schools are placed on the list based on the percentage of students who do not meet minimum competency requirements on mathematics, reading or writing tests. If the schools do not improve, the Education Commissioner can recommend that the Board of Regents, the governing body for the state's schools and colleges, revoke their registrations.
At P.S. 304 in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Marvene Jones, whose four children have gone to the school, said she has seen fingerpointing for years about whose fault it is that the children are not learning. Only 12 percent of third graders in the school read at or above grade level, according to standardized tests.
"I'm here every day," Ms. Jones said. "I see a lot of children who can't read. That's from way back, seven or eight years ago. Somebody wasn't doing their job."
At his press conference with the student journalists, Dr. Crew said the fingerpointing would end because everyone would have to take some responsibility for the schools' poor performance.
"This is not a case of one person, or two people, or a faculty of people who have done poorly," he said. "This is the case of a school system that has failed these children. And it is that system that's going to have to be given to the art of self-correction."

"Low expectations for student seem to be the norm rather than the exception. The special needs of recent immigrants and children from the neighborhood shelters do not seem to be understood or met. The community and the socio-economic class of the children were often used as the reason for the school's low scores."
 
P.S. 62
660 Fox Street

"There appeared to be a lack of sensitivity to poor and homeless students in teacher-led discussions, e.g., "Where did you go on vacation?" "What are your favorite TV programs?"
 
P.S. 63
1260 Franklin Ave.

"There is a large Hispanic population in the school, but there in no bilingual coordinator and none of the supervisory staff speaks a second language, no do they have a background in bilingual education. The district bilingual coordinator has provided little support to the bilingual program."
 
P.S. 157

"Several classrooms displayed 'codes of behavior' for their students. Security is maintained at the front door by an officer who tours the building every 30 minutes. The front entrance does not display a welcome for visitors. Safety and security for the students is consistently addressed in policies and procedures. Break-ins and theft of equipment continue to be a problem."

"The central focus of the building appears to revolve around student management and behavior (how students dress, how they line up, how they attend to their physical needs (e.g. toileting, water). It is unfortunate, even said, that P.S. 154 has not approached reading instruction with the same dedication."
 
P.S. 304
280 Hart St.

"P.S. 304 is the antithesis of the Regents' focus on 'better beginnings and more successful high school completions.'

"It is evident that leadership in the building has not had a positive impact on student performance and teacher instruction. Lessons were, for the most part, teacher centered and relied heavily on a lecture format. In many classes, students wre not actively involved in the lessons and it was evident that attention had not been directed toward planning lessons that engaged individual students' ability levels."

"There is a palatable tension between the principal and significant segments of the staff. In particular, relationships between the principal and the U.F.T. executive committee are strained. Supporters of the principal among the staff called him single-minded in his pursuit of excellence; his detractors asserted that he is close-minded and unwilling to engage in meaningful dialogue."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Fears Over Jobs Have Held Down Wage Growth

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Americans who feel that the economic recovery has not done much for their paychecks had their worries confirmed today by an unlikely official: Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Sounding more like his liberal critics than the conservative central banker that he is, Mr. Greenspan said that wage increases had slowed because so many Americans were worried about losing their jobs. 
 "That fear has doubtless played a significant role in the slowdown in the growth of labor compensation," he said in the text of a speech prepared for delivery tonight in Chicago. "Workers have, in effect, sought to preserve their jobs by accepting lesser increases in wages."
Mr. Greenspan went on to predict that workers would not stand for this much longer. "There will eventually come a point," he said, "when workers will perceive that it no longer makes sense to trade off wage progress for incremental gains in expected job security."
But Mr. Greenspan went on to tie stagnant wages firmly to his main concern at the Federal Reserve, which has been to control inflation. The risk is that workers may demand wage increases exceeding the increases in their annual output, possibly pushing up prices, he said.
And while Mr. Greenspan said that subdued wage increases had contributed to smaller price increases over the last 15 years, he stressed that a disciplined monetary policy had been largely responsible for the nation's success in bringing down inflation. The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy, and Mr. Greenspan has run the Fed since 1987, a time of mostly steady growth and falling inflation.

HEADLINE: At 50, U.N. Is Still a Stranger in New York

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
It was Christmastime in New York City. Damon Runyon had died earlier in the week. On Sunday the New York Giants would lose the National Football League championship to the Chicago Bears at the Polo Grounds. Advertisements for a soon-to-open Frank Capra movie, "It's a Wonderful Life," were appearing in newspapers.
On Dec. 12, 1946, headlines also trumpeted an 11th-hour donation by John D. Rockefeller Jr. to the city: a 17-acre tract of slum land on the East River, occupied by slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants, that would finally secure the United Nations headquarters for New York. 
 And from that moment on, the United Nations and its host city were inseparable, locked in a sometimes touching, sometimes tense embrace.
"I've always thought the U.N.'s relationship with the city was like a long, rather positive marriage," said Sir Brian Urquhart, who was a top United Nations official for more than 40 years. "There are tremendous ups and downs and the partners occasionally get tremendously fed up with each other."
On Tuesday the United Nations celebrates the 50th anniversary of the ratification of its charter. It celebrates, too, its long association with New York, a relationship that began in great hope, excitement and pride but has since been tempered by the mundane realities of politics and parking tickets.
In the minds of many New Yorkers, the United Nations today seems to be associated not so much with the city's international standing as with stalled traffic, unruly demonstrations, the threat of terrorism, diplomats who ignore their bills, ineffectual government and the occasional shoe-banging of a Khrushchev or the hoopla of a papal visit.
The semi-centennial gathering, to begin on Saturday night with a gala at the World Financial Center, underscores the ambivalent relationship. As more than 200 world leaders and their delegations descend on the city at once, it means not only financial reward and the glory of world capitalhood, but the inconvenience of heavy traffic, closed streets and heightened security.
Canvassed last week, New Yorkers expressed opinions on the United Nations with their characteristic skepticism or, in some cases, indifference.
John Robles, a musician, thought aloud as he bought a newspaper on Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights: "You know, these diplomats with the special plates who can park their cars anywhere and don't get tickets? It seems to be something like a big fraternity of political people from all over the world and they watch each other's backs."
Peter Bracey, a public health adviser from Brooklyn, said: "One big building that has a lot of foreign dinners. Just one big foreign party."
Part of the image problem, United Nations officials say, is that 80 percent of its work is in economic development in third-world countries, which is rarely reported by news organizations with the fervor of the coverage of more sensitive peacekeeping actions or the more embarrassing budgetary troubles.
 
Location, Location And Limbo
 Another problem is location.
Completed in 1952, the famous edifice -- the monolithic Secretariat (the city's first building with all-glass walls) and the free-form General Assembly building -- is remotely situated on the East River, several long blocks from the nearest subway. Designated an international territory, it isn't officially in New York, or even in the United States, so it has always been symbolically on the outskirts of town. (Inside, it lately has a more foreign feel than ever; the United Nations must be one of the last skyscrapers in the United States where people smoke in the hallways.)
And of course, there is politics. The United Nations has always been a symbol of this nation's argument with itself over the issue of engagement versus isolationism.
In 1956, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin said he would "continue the fight to get the United States out of the U.N. and the U.N. out of the United States."
In 1983, after a Soviet diplomat accused the United States of being a poor host, the American deputy chief delegate, Charles M. Lichtenstein, said that if member nations were unhappy in New York, "we will put no impediment in your way, and we will be at dockside bidding you a farewell as you set off into the sunset," a remark supported by President Ronald Reagan, who declared, "If they chose to leave, goodbye."
It was the previous year that Mayor Edward I. Koch, incensed by the United Nations' anti-Israel stance, called it a "cesspool."
"I've always believed that New York City is the international capital of the world and that the U.N. belongs here," Mr. Koch said recently. "But when the U.N. people said that they'd move, I said, 'Move.' Where else can these guys get such cheap meals in first-class restaurants?"
These days, officials of both New York and the United Nations are at pains to point out that the institution and its host city are well matched, and that their relationship has been, and remains, mutually beneficial.
"Like New York, the U.N. is an English-speaking, multiethnic environment, and there is certainly a sense that the people who work here help make New York what it is," said Shashi Taroor, special assistant to the peacekeeping undersecretary.
Samir Sanbar, assistant secretary general for public information, pointed out the prestige factor: the gathering of world leaders will be the largest ever, anywhere. "This kind of congregation, let alone the money that it brings in, cements New York City's role as the world's central place," Mr. Sanbar said.
 
As City Employer, U.N. Ranks Third
 The prevailing opinion, in fact, is that the city probably gets the better deal, a feeling that has emerged in recent years as several United Nations agencies have been wooed by other cities, including Bonn and New Rochelle, N.Y., to which Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, nearly defected in 1993.
"We needed Unicef to stay where it was for two reasons," said Barry Sullivan, the former Deputy Mayor for finance and development, who offered Unicef a lease extension through 2026, at a reduced rent on its headquarters at 3 United Nations Plaza, after which Unicef would own the building.
"One, the U.N. really anchors the East Side of midtown, and with Unicef leaving we were in danger of creating a hole in the midtown-East Side area. And second, if we kept them, over time we'd continue to have a shot at new agencies."
The United Nations' financial contributions to the city are enormous. According to a study released yesterday by the New York City Commission for the United Nations, Consular Corps and International Business, the United Nations and its related agencies, missions and consulates channeled $3.3 billion into the city in 1994, generating 16,700 jobs directly and the need for 14,300 more, and making the United Nations the city's third biggest nongovernment employer, after Nynex and Chemical Bank.
In return, the city pays for any public schooling for diplomatic corps children, although many go to private schools. About 1,700 diplomats pay no income tax; about 4,000 diplomatic employees hold sales tax exemption cards. The city also provides and pays for routine police work involving the United Nations.
Since the mid-1970's, the Federal Government has reimbursed the city for protecting visiting dignitaries. The annual stipend, now $7 million, was not used up in 1994; the New York City Commission says that if the city is permitted to roll over the surplus, the two-year total will be enough to cover the costs of protecting the Pope on his recent visit (about $4 million) and for the 50th anniversary celebration.
What really irks New Yorkers -- and is probably the United Nations' most lingering local public relations test -- is the idea that the delegates are a bunch of wealthy deadbeats, ignoring parking tickets, rent agreements and other bills for goods and services in the name of diplomatic immunity.
A longtime problem, it has grown worse lately. The State Department estimates debts to local landlords, hotels, hospitals and utilities at $6.6 million to $8.5 million, three to four times what it was five years ago. According to the New York City liaison commission, about 9 percent of the parking tickets issued in the city are to cars with diplomatic license plates; those unpaid tickets added up to nearly $10 million in 1994.
In addition to providing various services like advising diplomats in car-buying, placing their children in local schools and clearing their apartment building vestibules of the homeless, the commission began its own collection agency last February.
Livia S. Sylva, the head of the commission, said it had already settled $396,000 in outstanding debts. In addition, she said, 26 percent of the accounts it is asked to settle involve goods and services that have not been delivered to diplomats. Many delegates, she said, feel that they have all been tarred with the same brush and that there exists, among city landlords, for instance, a widespread discrimination against them.
"A lot of people see the United Nations as an airport hangar," said Jane R. Steiner, the commission's deputy chief. "They don't see its value and they should."
 
Resistance To Europe
 Fifty years ago, on Oct. 24, 1945, the United Nations charter, which was drawn up in San Francisco, was ratified by a majority of the 51 original member nations, bringing into existence what for many in the postwar world was a dream organization that would render the globe free of violent conflict. There was considerable competition among cities in Europe -- Paris, London, Geneva, The Hague -- to be the site of the headquarters, and the first General Assembly meeting took place in London in January 1946.
There was, however, resistance to putting the United Nations in Europe, at least in part because the failed League of Nations had been in Geneva. And by March, the United Nations headquarters committee approved a site in both Westchester County and Fairfield County, Conn. Temporary headquarters were set up in the gymnasium on the Bronx campus of Hunter College, and New York set about welcoming it.
Stanley Meisler, author of "The United Nations: The First Fifty Years" (Atlantic Monthly Press), was then a Bronx high school student and one of many who slept outside Hunter College to be assured of tickets for the Security Council.
Nonetheless, the United Nations got off to a rocky start. Prefiguring the stalemates of the cold war, on March 27, 1946, after a protracted dispute involving the occupation of Iran by Soviet troops, the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, walked out of the Security Council. In the aftermath, citizens in Westchester and in Greenwich, Conn., protested having the United Nations as a neighbor: it moved temporarily to Lake Success, L.I.
Finally, on Dec. 11, 1946, with the United Nations seemingly sure to land elsewhere, the Rockefeller offer saved it for New York, where, half a century later, it remains one of the city's foremost tourist attractions and yet still has not quite worked its way into the hearts of New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Prom Night for the Airlines

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The United States airline industry is looking a lot like an awkward high-school dance these days.
USAir says it is interested in hooking up with one of the two biggest carriers, United and American. United has said it likes the look of USAir, at least from a distance, while American is acting coy. And the rest of the industry is sizing up potential partners to approach if somebody makes the first move. The Justice Department, meanwhile, is chaperone to this affair, ready to break up anything untoward. 
 While trying to figure out who will link up with whom is now little more than a guessing game, industry analysts say that if two big airlines paired off, they would probably spark the most far-reaching consolidation of the industry since the 1980's wave that wiped away familiar names like National, Piedmont and Republic.
This time, though, the motivation would be different. A decade ago, airlines were driven by the belief that creating bigger route networks would automatically lead to better profits. Instead, it led to overcapacity and years of bruising losses. Now, airlines are determined not to repeat that mistake and are looking for combinations that will both let them grow and keep costs down.
United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, says it will decide whether to proceed with USAir negotiations by the end of the month. But even if it doesn't, and if American, the AMR unit, also pulls back, industry analysts say there will probably be a new round of consolidation over the next several years. They say the strong players in this mature business -- United, American and Delta Air Lines -- may decide that they need to make acquisitions to grow while weaker carriers like T.W.A. and Continental Airlines may need rescuing or go out of business in the next industry downturn.
"Ten years from now, fewer airlines are likely to control an even bigger share of the market than they do today," said Daniel M. Kasper, an industry consultant and a member of a 1993 Presidential commission on airline industry competitiveness.
To be sure, the Justice Department could block any merger that it felt would hinder competition. And airlines themselves might think twice about deals that would increase their debt load or saddle them with the challenge of merging their vast scheduling and computer networks, not to mention seniority lists of union members.
Still, USAir's dalliances with United and American raise two intriguing questions. The first affects the pocketbook of every American traveler: What will happen to fares if the industry does consolidate? And the second is of interest primarily to USAir itself, though the answer could have wide repercussions: As the highest-cost carrier in the country, will it be able to survive on its own?
The answer to the first question, many economists say, is: not much.
Government officials have always worried about the risk of a small number of carriers ruling the industry through tacit collusion. Since the industry's deregulation in 1978, their concerns have been fueled by the disappearance of 5 of the 10 biggest carriers, including Eastern and Pan Am. Airlines have also built near-monopolies at some airports. In Pittsburgh, for example, 9 of every 10 flights is on USAir.
But Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, says any fears that consolidation will lead to higher fares are overstated. He points out that fares have declined an average 33 percent, adjusted for inflation, since 1976. Even though the largest carriers now hold bigger shares of the market, effective competition has generally increased, he said.
He cited statistics from "The Evolution of the Airline Industry," a new book he has written with Steven A. Morrison, an economics professor at Northeastern University. The data show that the number of similar-sized competitors on routes of less than 500 miles fell only 2 percent between 1978 and 1993, while the number of competitors on routes of more than 2,000 miles surged by 70 percent.
Even if the industry consolidated into four or five carriers, he added, competition would remain strong on busy routes between big cities like New York and Chicago, or New York and Los Angeles. "In most markets, four carriers can lead to significant competition," he said.
Mr. Winston's research suggests that if USAir and United merged, fares in general would rise slightly at first but then drop by about 2 percent, adjusted for inflation, after five years because other carriers would move in.
History suggests that when one carrier disappears, the competitive void does not last long. Three months after Eastern went out of business, fares fell 4.5 percent on its former routes from the previous year, Mr. Winston found.
Even on routes served by only one carrier, he added, the danger of a price explosion is small. That is because other airlines could easily move their aircraft to those markets and undercut high prices, he said.
Indeed, competition throughout the industry has been so fierce that the airlines, collectively, have reported net losses in 9 of the 17 years since deregulation. Their best year in this period was 1988, when the net profit margin was 2.6 percent.
Some industry experts still fear that too much consolidation will lead to some form of collusion that will make the industry more profitable at travelers' expense.
"Many consumers would be disserved if a tightly controlled oligopoly determines the level of pricing," said Paul Stephen Dempsey, director of the transportation law program at the University of Denver. As it is, Mr. Dempsey said there were signs of industry coordination, manifested in the high fares that airlines charge on many routes where there is competition.
The Justice Department is also concerned about the antitrust implications of any corporate merger. While it declined to comment on the potential impact of a linkup involving USAir, a paper written by three of its economists in 1993 concluded that the threat of competition from a third airline would not necessarily prevent two merged airlines from increasing prices sharply, at least in the short run.
Analysts say a merger between USAir and either American or United would be a good fit. Both prospective partners have strong east-west route networks, and both have tried but failed to develop a presence in the densely populated north-south routes along the East Coast, where USAir is strong. The United and American route systems have little overlap with that of USAir, which owns coveted landing slots at National Airport in Washington and La Guardia Airport in New York.
A USAir combined with United or American, with a strengthened frequent-flier program and bigger incentives to dangle before travel agents for swinging market share their way, would be a formidable competitor. Remaining carriers would be expected to pair off quickly in defense.
Analysts see United and USAir as the most likely combination, in part because most of their employees belong to the same unions. If they join forces, the analysts say, British Airways, which holds a 24.6 percent stake in USAir and is a marketing partner, would probably cash out its position. One reason is that British Airways' chairman, Sir Colin Marshall, has said he objects to union leaders serving on corporate boards, as two of them do at UAL.
If British Air cashed out, it might form a marketing alliance with American. Northwest Airlines, Continental, T.W.A. and America West would then in all likelihood be gobbled up, leaving United, American, Delta and probably the small but influential Southwest Airlines as the remaining players, the analysts say.
These would be bold strokes, indeed. But then, airline executives are feeling emboldened these days by their better-than-expected earnings performance for the third quarter. On Wednesday, for example, USAir reported net income of $43.1 million, in contrast to a loss of $180.1 million in the corresponding period a year ago. Like the rest of the industry, USAir is benefiting from tighter capacity, cost-cutting efforts, greater demand and higher fares.
Despite all the speculation about a merger, USAir has a contingency plan to go it alone. But for a company that has lost $3 billion since 1988, that would not be easy.
While USAir is saddled with high-cost wage agreements, a more fundamental problem is that its average passenger journey is 684 miles. United's, by contrast, is about 1,450 miles. That means that other carriers are able to spread the cost of airport fees, ramp workers and gate agents over longer trips.
USAir has received no help from its unions to escape this box. It recently gave up its effort to negotiate wage concessions totaling $500 million a year. And it continues to face incursions into its markets from carriers like Southwest.
Will such competition lead to death by a thousand cuts? USAir says no. It says its long-term strategy, while plodding, will work.
It has, for example, cut $500 million in operating costs, in part through a program to better match plane types and flight schedules to demand. That has helped raise the percentage of seats it regularly fills.
It has also upgraded its computer system for pricing tickets for leisure and business travelers as well as its system for scheduling crews.
The airline is also gradually lengthening its average trip -- to 684 miles today from 505 miles in 1988, an improvement of 35 percent. And it has ordered Boeing 757's intended for long-haul service. It now has a cash cushion of $865 million.
Perhaps most important, its no-layoff agreements with labor start expiring soon. The deal with the pilots -- traditionally the pace setter -- expires in mid-1997. At that point, said Brian Harris, an analyst at S. G. Warburg, management will gain the upper hand in talks.
With all these initiatives, he said, USAir should be competitive over time with the rest of the industry. "There is no reason," he said, "that USAir has to be the laggard."

HEADLINE: THE $1.50 SUBWAY RIDE: THE REACTION;
Bracing for a Heavy Impact As Region Absorbs the Cost

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
A. Leonard Malluck knows his numerals. The number of seconds in a day rolls off his tongue (86,400). He has calculated what it costs to drive a car 20 blocks from his house in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, to the grocery story ($1.50). More important, if a car and a subway train raced from his neighborhood to midtown Manhattan, where he works as a night-shift computer support technician for the city, the car would win by about 10 minutes, until you factor in parking time.
Mr. Malluck's conclusion is that the subway, even with the 20 percent fare increase approved yesterday by the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is to him still one of the best deals around. 
 "The $1.50 will annoy me for a week or two," Mr. Malluck said yesterday morning from the downtown platform of the Cortlandt Street subway stop as he ended his workday. "But I will live with it."
Other number crunchers caution that Mr. Malluck's equations are not as simple as they sound. The fare increase, planners and economists say, will ripple through the New York regional economy in some ways unpredictable and in others just not as simple as a race between a subway and a car. And, they say, it's the less tangible, less direct costs that are probably the scariest.
"The bigger danger is that the system becomes less and less competitive," said Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a private group that studies local land use issues. His group has calculated that a 25-cent fare increase will reduce ridership by about 24 million rides on the subway over the next year.
Mr. Yaro and other transportation experts said that the first effect of the fare increase would be direct, with hundreds of millions of dollars being siphoned from the local economy and fed into the subway system in 25-cent dribs and drabs. The harshest impact is expected to be felt in the city's poorest neighborhoods, where an extra quarter can pinch.
Several hidden costs may emerge.
To the degree that poorer people will walk or find other ways to commute, the shops clustered around train stations could take their hits in the form of falling revenues.
Commuters will lose time while waiting in their cars in longer traffic jams, because more drivers will be on the roads. They will thus pay for part of the fare increase even if they have never set foot on the subway.
One of the gravest costs, experts say, could be borne by the air itself. If enough transit users drive because they find the system to have outpriced its usefulness, the target air quality standards set by the city under the Federal Clean Air Act could be threatened. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has power to withhold Federal highway money, $2 billion in New York State's case, if the agency concludes that the state has failed to enforce an effective clean air program.
"That's the E.P.A.'s gun under the table," said Jack Dean, a senior planner at the Regional Plan Association.
When the city and state calculated the costs of a $500 million project to rebuild a 3.5-mile elevated portion of the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn, for example, the analysis of environmental effects was based on a $1.25 mass transit fare.
"It's all moot now," said Brian T. Ketcham, an executive vice president at Konheim & Ketcham, a Brooklyn environmental and transportation consulting firm.
Mr. Ketcham estimated that the fare increase would result in 40,000 to 80,000 more vehicles being driven within the five boroughs of New York every 24 hours. The implications of that increase in air pollution and noise pollution, he said, will in turn eventually be felt in higher medical costs.
Some of the variables in measuring the impact of the fare increase will be also be geographic. On the Long Island Rail Road, for example, where fares are to go up by 9 percent, demand is considered inelastic, because riders are more accepting of higher prices. The alternatives on the intensely congested Long Island road system are generally worse no matter how high the ticket prices go.
Similarly, in the poorer areas of upper Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx, more transit riders are also expected to pay the higher fares without changing their behavior because many do not own cars and do not have a lot of other options when the fare rises.
New debates on old subjects are also expected to gain significance; for instance, placing tolls on the East River bridges between Manhattan and Brooklyn and Manhattan and Queens. If enough additional people start driving cars over the bridges instead of using mass transit, the traffic implications alone could favor arguments for a toll system, said Jameson W. Doig, a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University.
Other experts say that in an odd way, the fare increase should make current drivers really want higher tolls on all the city's river crossings, because higher tolls will make the subway and train system more competitive, thus keeping those mass transit riders off the roads.
"People who drive have a huge incentive to support slobs like me who ride the bus," said Jack Dean, a senior planner at the Regional Plan Association.
Several subway riders also said today that much could depend on how well the M.T.A. sold the fare increase to its customers.
"It would be nice to see a breakdown, you know, what the increase is and what it's going to, so we can hold them to that," said Rino Mermini, an investment manager at Chase Manhattan Bank who commutes from Harrison, N.J., to the Chase office in Brooklyn's Metrotech complex, using the PATH system and the New York City subway.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Toughen Stance on Illegal Aliens

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The New Jersey State Senate held its first voting session since June today to pass a package of laws that would deal more harshly with youthful offenders, deny worker's compensation payments to illegal aliens and deny state business to any company that employs illegal aliens.
With passage of the laws, which remain to be voted on in the State Assembly, the New Jersey Senate reflects the growing national mood of antagonism toward juvenile crime and illegal immigration. The juvenile justice changes were drawn up by the administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and are all but assured passage in the Assembly. The measures dealing with illegal aliens have been sharply opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and immigrants' rights groups, and face a less certain future. 
 The first of the two measures requires that employers receiving state contracts, tax abatements and the like certify that all of their employees are in the country legally. The second measure makes undocumented workers ineligible for worker's compensation and temporary disability payments for workplace injuries.
Both measures passed with only a few dissenting votes, despite the opposition of the Catholic bishops in the state, who said that the laws could be interpreted to deny illegal aliens such state services as childhood immunization and emergency medical care.
"Because of the potential danger to human life inherent in these two bills, the Catholic bishops are compelled to oppose them," the New Jersey Catholic Conference, an association of bishops, said in a statement.
But State Senator Leonard T. Connors, a Surf City Republican and the bill's chief sponsor, said his legislation was needed to protect taxpayers from the hidden costs of illegal immigration.
"America today is confronted with an invasion of illegal, undocumented aliens," Mr. Connors said. "Illegal, undocumented aliens are driving American workers to the unemployment lines."
Yet the proposal to deny worker's compensation and temporary disability benefits to illegal aliens was opposed by legislators who said that such a law might actually encourage companies to hire aliens in the hope of avoiding having to pay such benefits.
"What we are doing is creating incentives for employers to hire illegal aliens," Senator Edward T. O'Connor, a Jersey City Democrat, declared during the debate. Mr. Connors replied that such illegal hirings would occur regardless.
"Every day," Mr. Connors said, "there are people who jeopardize their freedom by sticking up banks, mugging people and robbing people. So an employer who is unscrupulous about the laws of our country would certainly cheat the laws on worker's compensation or the rules about Social Security, with or without this law."
Governor Whitman has not yet taken a position on the aliens bills, although she has generally opposed denying needy people existing benefits.
The juvenile justice changes would unify all related activities under a new Juvenile Justice Commission; they would also allow the state to compel parents to pay restitution for a wide range of offenses committed by their children, and give juvenile judges greater leeway in sentencing young offenders.
Under the new law, for example, imprisonment would be an option for juveniles considered dangerous.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Strong Growth in Sales Lifts Coca-Cola Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The Coca-Cola Company said today that earnings rose 13.3 percent in the third quarter, lifted by strong growth in the volume of beverage sales in the United States and abroad.
The company, the world's biggest soft-drink maker, said net income increased to $802 million, or 64 cents a share, from $708 million, or 55 cents a share, in the corresponding period in 1994. Revenue rose 9.7 percent, to $4.89 billion from $4.46 billion. 
 The latest earnings matched the average estimate of 64 cents a share from 20 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Shares of Coca-Cola gained $1.75, to $73.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sales volume, measured by cases sold of Coke, Sprite and other brands, rose 8 percent in the United States and 7 percent abroad. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, sells concentrate to bottlers, which then sell the cases.
Typically, sales growth is faster in international markets than in the United States, where Coke has been sold for 109 years. The company was able to stimulate domestic growth partly because of the success of Coke's contoured bottle, which was reintroduced last year in an effort to lift sales.
"New packaging can be very much a stimulus in the industry," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. "Having a new bottle will help increase sales."
Taking the third-quarter results into account, the company said it expected to meet its goal of achieving annual growth in international volume of 8 to 10 percent.
The company said the gains in domestic sales were driven by its core brands: Coca-Cola classic, Diet Coke and Sprite. Volume at the company's juice unit, however, which makes Hi-C, Minute Maid and Five-Alive brands, declined 1 percent. The company has been shifting its marketing program to support those brands.
International sales growth was led by gains in Brazil, Britain and China. Sluggish economies in Mexico, Japan and Argentina, three of Coca-Cola's largest international markets, acted as a drag on international sales.
Coca-Cola said it repurchased about nine million shares during the third quarter, bringing the total purchased this year to 25 million shares.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Two Bell Companies Report Higher Profits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Growing demand for second phone lines among residential customers contributed to solid profit increases at the Bell Atlantic Corporation and the BellSouth Corporation in the third quarter before special charges, the companies said yesterday.
BellSouth said its profit rose almost 12 percent in the three months that ended Sept. 30. Bell Atlantic's profit increased 11 percent before extraordinary gains and charges. 
 The performance of both companies met the expectations of Wall Street analysts.
BellSouth's profit of $558.5 million was a record for the Atlanta-based company. It amounted to 56 cents a share, adjusted for a recently announced 2-for-1 stock split.
A year ago, BellSouth earned $499.5 million, or 50 cents a share, in the third quarter.
Revenue was $4.43 billion, up from $4.20 billion a year ago.
BellSouth said the number of access lines it provides was up 4.7 percent from a year earlier, driven in part by strong regional economic conditions. Second lines accounted for 207,000 of the 493,000 in new residential lines for the year that ended Sept. 30. About 70 percent of BellSouth's overall wireline business is residential.
The company also reported its domestic cellular business now had 2.54 million subscribers, up 32 percent from a year ago. Its international cellular operation grew to nearly 550,000 subscribers, up 78 percent.
The company's stock was up 37.5 cents, to $74.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, earned $604.8 million, or $1.38 a share, aided by the sale of overlapping properties when its cellular business merged with that of the Nynex Corporation. The gain amounted to $203 million after taxes but was offset by $40 million in special development expenses.
A year ago, Bell Atlantic lost $1.87 billion, or $4.29 a share, after a charge for changing its accounting practices from a regulated to a competitive business.
Revenue was $3.26 billion compared with $3.46 billion, a decline associated with placing its cellular operations into the Nynex partnership.
Without the extraordinary items, Bell Atlantic would have earned $441.9 million, or $1.01, in the latest quarter and $397.5 million, or 91 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier.
The company said the number of access lines it provides was up 3.3 percent compared with the corresponding period a year ago, led by fast growth in customers ordering second lines for their homes.
The company's stock closed up $1.50, to $63.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.

To exclude these items for comparison purposes, third-quarter 1995 earnings would be $441.9 million, or $1.01 a share.

HEADLINE: 3 Drug Makers Win a Lawsuit To Extend Protection of Patents

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va., Oct. 19

 BODY:
Merck & Company, the Schering-Plough Corporation and Roche Holdings A.G. have won a lawsuit seeking extended protection of patents, against the United States Patent Office and the Food and Drug Administration.
The ruling, reached Monday by the Federal District Court here, is a victory for brand-name drug makers who fought an interpretation of a new Federal law based on the World Trade Organization rules by the F.D.A. and the Patent Office, which limited patent protection. 
 Securities analysts said the ruling could affect sales of billions of dollars of brand-name drugs that would otherwise be open sooner to sharp competition from less expensive generic versions.
Neil B. Sweig, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, said that based on current sales in the United States, the extension could result in $3 billion in sales of Zantac, the ulcer treatment made by the Glaxo Wellcome Company; $1.45 billion in sales of Mevacor, a cholesterol-lowering drug made by Merck, and $280 million in sales of Capoten, a hypertension treatment produced by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.
Mr. Sweig added that the court ruling had been anticipated by investors and was already reflected in drug companies' stock prices.
Under a Federal rule that took effect on June 8, drug makers could either have patent protection under the new W.T.O., which allows 20 years of patent protection for new prescription drugs or the previous system.
Under the old system, drug patents were protected in the United States for 17 years after they were granted, plus some of the time drugs were awaiting regulatory review by the F.D.A. In some cases, protection would last longer under the old system.
"The courts ruled that they were wrong, and you can be protected under both systems," said Steve Bercham of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
Mr. Bercham said, however, that the court had decided that a patent could never result in exclusive marketing rights for more than 14 years.
As a result of the decision, Merck's patent on its cholesterol-lowering drug Mevacor was extended to June 15, 2001, from Nov. 4, 1999.
Gary Latchow, a Merck spokesman, said the patent for the company's ulcer medication Pepcid had also been extended.

HEADLINE: Investors Push Stock Markets to New Heights

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
On the eighth anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash yesterday, investors were in a buying mood, sending popular averages into record territory once again.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 24.93 points to end at 4,802.45, edging past its record closing of 4,801.80 set on Sept. 14. 
 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks scored its third consecutive closing high, with a gain of 3.21 points at 590.65, and the Big Board composite index rose 1.10, to 315.39, beating its record close of 314.33 set Sept. 20.
"Thank God the market's nothing like it was in 1987," said Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones index plunged 508 points in the biggest one-day drop in history.
"Interest rates were at 10 percent and headed higher then, and now they're at 6 percent and falling and we have an economy that's slowly perking up," he said.
In the bond market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose three-hundredths of 1 percent, lowering its yield to 6.30 percent from 6.33 percent on Wednesday.
Mr. Metz said that some stock investors were stepping aside to wait for Friday's expirations of futures and options, a so-called double witching day. Still trading was heavy with volume of 406.6 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Declining issues led advances 1,193 to 1,102 on the Big Board.
But not every index set a record. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 1.60 point, to 1,046.97, which was below its record closing high of 1,067.40 reached on Sept. 13. And the American Stock Exchange's market- value index declined 1.07, to 534.11.
Thom Brown, a managing director at Rutherford Brown & Catherwood, said that corporate earnings were better than Wall Street expected. "Some looked bad, but some are coming in quite strong," he said.
As of Wednesday, 104 of the 191 companies in the Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks that have reported quarterly results had positive surprises, 64 had negative reports and 23 were on target, according to I/B/E/S, a firm that tracks corporate earnings.
Topping the Big Board most-active list was Nokia Oy, the Finnish telecommunications company. Its American depository receipts tumbled 8 3/8, to 60 1/2, after the company posted disappointing profits and said the outlook was uncertain for American sales for its cellular phones.
Motorola, the leading maker of cellular phones, lost 2 1/2 to close at 65 in sympathy with Nokia.
"We've got a lot of nervous holders who run to the hills at the slightest disappointments showing in a technology sector that has high expectations," Mr. Metz said.
Also, in the technology sector, Apple Computer shares declined 2 5/8 to 34 3/4 in Nasdaq trading; the computer maker said late Wednesday that its fiscal fourth-quarter net profit sank 48 percent.
Other technology stocks were firmer, with International Business Machines rising 1 7/8, to 98 1/4, Compaq Computer up 1/8, to $54.25, and the Microsoft Corporation up 1 1/8, to 96 3/4.
General Instruments was the most-active issue, losing 7 to 20, after the company said on Wednesday that it expected its income would be hurt by a slowdown in spending by cable systems.
Computer Associates climbed 3 7/8, to 48 7/8, after it posted stronger-than-expected earnings.
The Cordis Corporation soared 21 5/8 to 107 5/8 on news that Johnson & Johnson was making a surprise $1.6 billion tender offer for it.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Shares a Victory

 BODY:
It sounded very much like another of the upbeat announcements the Giuliani administration often makes when a company agrees to stay in New York in exchange for a break in taxes or rent. There was even more fanfare than usual, in fact, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that his administration had succeeded in keeping Unicef in New York for the next 31 years.
"Our success in keeping this vital agency and its many employees is indicative of our commitment to preserve and support key elements of the U.N. community," the Mayor told a news conference. 
 There was only one problem: the complex deal to keep Unicef was struck two years earlier.
Mayor David N. Dinkins, fearful of losing a prestigious international agency and its 1,500 jobs to Westchester County, had his staff work up a package of financial incentives to get Unicef to stay.
In the succeeding two years, city and agency officials worked out the language of the deal, but the terms remained identical.
Giuliani administration officials maintained that they were not trying to take credit for a deal negotiated by their predecessors. Though John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, dismissed Mr. Dinkins's deal as a press release.
"The difference is that that was an announcement and this is an accomplishment," he said.

HEADLINE: Curb on Trade With Cuba Is Tightened

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Stripped of its most controversial provision, a bill that would moderately tighten the United States embargo against Cuba was approved overwhelmingly today by the Senate. The vote was 74 to 24.
The bill would insure that a country that buys Cuban sugar and molasses does not resell either product to the United States. It also seeks to reduce aid to Russia by $200 million -- the same amount Russia reportedly pays Cuba to rent an electronic intelligence-gathering base. 
 The legislation, sponsored by the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, also orders the Administration to try to block Cuba from becoming a member of international financial institutions.
In addition, it requires the Administration to seek a worldwide embargo against Cuba at the United Nations. That bid is considered largely symbolic since the General Assembly has repeatedly sided with Cuba when the American embargo has come to a vote. No other country bars trade with Cuba.
President Fidel Castro is expected to raise the issue on Sunday when he speaks before the General Assembly during celebrations of the United Nations' 50th anniversary. The Administration announced on Wednesday that Mr. Castro would be granted a visa to travel to the United States despite Republican objections.
Final passage of the legislation today was anticlimactic. The key vote occurred on Tuesday night when Senator Helms and his allies narrowly lost a procedural vote on a provision to discourage foreign investment in Cuba, which could leave the country's economy prostrate.
Under that proposal, investors would shy away because they would not be assured of legal title to any property they acquired. Senator Helms would have achieved that by allowing American residents whose property was confiscated three decades ago to lay claim to the properties in United States courts.
The House approved a Cuba sanctions bill last month that contains the controversial provision, and Senator Helms said he hopes it survives the process of reconciling the House and Senate bills.

Underground Blues: Straphangers Pay as Suburbs Get Tax Break

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
WHEN New Yorkers look back at October 1995 and try to understand why they were hit with one of the largest transit fare increases in the city's history, they will come to one unavoidable conclusion: that New York's political hierarchy decided to join the rest of America in putting tax-cutting ahead of everything else.
"They shifted the burden," said Richard Ravitch, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "They made a fundamental decision about how to operate the economy, where the tax burden falls. It ain't necessarily what I would want, but it's part of a process of shrinking public resources. They want the burden of cost of operating the system to go from one group of taxpayers to another." 
 Two basic sources pay the costs of operating New York City's transit system: the fare box and government subsidies. Now 60 percent comes from riders, the rest from government. That split will change to 70 percent from the fare box and only 30 percent from government if the new fare increase -- really just a euphemism for a tax increase -- goes into effect next month as planned.
That does indeed amount to a political decision to shift the cost of operating the system from one group of taxpayers to another. No politician from Albany to City Hall put it that way, of course, but that's what they did, in a decision that involved every powerful leader in the state. It involved Democrats and Republicans, upstaters and downstaters:
*Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican who was elected without many New York City votes, withdrew millions of state dollars from the subways.
*Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani complained about bloat and made it easier for the Governor to bleed the system by withdrawing city money, beating the Governor to it. Then he ordered the members he appointed to the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to vote against the fare increase.
*The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, waited until just a few weeks ago before coming up with a plan to save the fare that was destined to fail.
*The M.T.A. chairman, E. Virgil Conway, instead of being New York's most adamant and outspoken subway defender, views his job as being the Governor's loyal servant, and has done his bidding.
Even more significant is something that elected officials do not mention in the same breath with the fare increase: the income tax cut that the Legislature approved last spring at Mr. Pataki's behest. Mr. Silver and his Democratic Assembly approved it along with the Republican Senate. Mr. Giuliani praised it. Few got around to noting that the tax cut came at a cost: an estimated $515 million in the current fiscal year, and an additional $1.8 billion in the next one.
These numbers are significant because $300 million a year would have saved the $1.25 fare; $100 million would have taken a dime off the quarter increase. Put another way, according to the Straphangers Campaign, the advocates for mass transit, the tax cut will save a family that earns $50,000 a year from $7 to $90. The fare increase will cost someone who commutes 50 weeks a year $125.
THAT is shortsighted, to put it mildly, said Robert R. Kiley, a former chairman of the M.T.A. and now president of the New York City Partnership. It was Mr. Kiley and Mr. Ravitch who rebuilt the system after the fiscal crisis of the 1970's robbed it of so much money that it was devastated.
So for the last 15 years, the leaders of New York cooperated, however reluctantly, to make repairs and keep the buses and subways and the rest of the transit system going. They would posture and fuss but ultimately find the money the M.T.A. needed, to prevent another collapse.
"All of this was an implicit deal, explicit, really, that we were all in this together," Mr. Kiley said. "Here in the most turbulent place in the United States, where nobody agreed with anybody on anything, it worked. Everyone made accommodations, and it was all sort of informal, if you will. That turned out to be its fatal flaw."
THE shift of power in Albany last year from a Democratic governor to Mr. Pataki, a Republican from Putnam County who ran on a pledge to cut taxes, undid that informal handshake. This year, all transit systems in the state but the city's got more state aid, and the commuter rail lines got a 9 percent fare increase, compared with 20 percent for the subways and buses.
It is not surprising that Mr. Pataki played to his constituency. But a mayor of New York City, even a Republican one, beating up on the transit system instead of leading the charge to get as much money for it as he could? An Assembly Speaker who, though critical of the fare increase (as is the Mayor), lets months go by before suggesting an alternate strategy that was destined to go nowhere in any case?
This is indeed a curious time for New York. But then again, New York is -- though some like to think otherwise -- just a part of the United States. And the country is changing.
"Everything is changing in our society," Mr. Ravitch said. "It is an inevitable consequence of where our politics are now. Banks are changing. The health care system is changing. And maybe how we pay for our transit system."

HEADLINE: Pataki Aide Criticizes Job Agencies Of Cuomo

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The election for Governor may be nearly a year past, the campaign buttons consigned to the memorabilia pile, but the Pataki and Cuomo people were at it again today, as if the sloganeering had never stopped.
The bickering began when Gov. George E. Pataki's top economic adviser, Charles A. Gargano, summoned reporters for a news conference during which he spent far more time attacking the Cuomo administration than laying out his own plans. Mr. Gargano contended that the Cuomo administration had so mismanaged several state agencies that are supposed to nurture job creation that tens of millions of dollars had been lost. 
 "The taxpayers are saddled with these bills," Mr. Gargano said. "These abuses have hindered real economic growth and made it that much harder for us to turn this state around."
Those charges brought an angry response from Mr. Gargano's predecessor, Vincent Tese, who until today had refrained from commenting on the Pataki administration. Mr. Tese said in a phone interview that Mr. Gargano was being dishonest and was distorting the Cuomo administration's record.
Mr. Tese also happens to be one of the few Cuomo administration officials still working for Mr. Pataki because he serves on the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- with Mr. Gargano. When told of Mr. Gargano's criticism, Mr. Tese said he was seriously considering resigning from the board.
"He sits back and just takes shots," Mr. Tese said of Mr. Gargano. "It's a lack of class, that is what it is."
In going after Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Tese, Mr. Gargano appeared to be setting the stage for a move by the Pataki administration to scuttle some of the agreements made by the agencies, which include the Job Development Authority, the defunct Harlem Urban Development Corporation, the Harlem International Trade Center and the Urban Development Corporation.
Mr. Gargano said that because of its lax procedures in evaluating loans, the Job Development Authority had lost $21 million in 1994 and $22 million in 1995. From 1992 through March 1995, the authority had to write off 83 loans worth more than $34 million, he said. In comparison, from 1966 to 1990, it wrote off only 57 loans.
Mr. Gargano also suggested that the Cuomo administration had used the Urban Development Corporation as a political arm, pointing out that last year, an election year, the corporation handed out nearly $100 million in financial commitments, nearly three times the amount it usually provides annually.
Mr. Gargano declined to say whether he had uncovered anything illegal in the way the agencies were run. He said he had forwarded recommendations to Mr. Pataki about how to handle the agreements made by the Cuomo administration, though he would not give specifics.
He also said that he had instituted new rules to insure that new loans made or guaranteed by the agencies were repaid. "We have put into effect strict criteria in our applicant and review process," he said.
Mr. Tese said that Mr. Gargano was using the Cuomo administration as a scapegoat.
"It's political," Mr. Tese said. "He obviously doesn't want to do some of the loans, so he wants to paint it as being something that is not prudent."
Mr. Tese said it was misleading to blame the Cuomo administration for the rise in ventures by the Urban Development Corporation last year. The vast majority of the agreements, he said, stemmed from what are known as member items -- projects pushed by members of the Legislature, both Democratic and Republican, who were seeking to curry favor with voters.
At least in 1994, Mr. Tese said, the losses at the Job Development Authority were affected by the bankruptcy of one company, Hampshire Instruments in Monroe County. The authority, which had made loan guarantees to the company, had to write off $10 million on that deal, he said. And he explained that there were so many defaults from 1992 to 1995 because of the recession.
Mr. Tese, now a director at Bear Stearns in Manhattan, said he was surprised that Mr. Gargano would criticize the Cuomo administration without acknowledging its successes, like the start of the redevelopment of 42d Street in Manhattan.
"He sat around and took all kinds of credit for 42d Street, and he didn't have one damn thing to do with 42d Street," Mr. Tese said of Mr. Gargano. "Did he ever give credit to a prior administration for 42d Street? The answer is no, so this man is living some kind of charade."

HEADLINE: Hollywood Horrors

 BODY:
Movie flops are like Tolstoy's unhappy families, each different in its own way. But a string of recent box-office calamities suggests a common thread, namely a gathering public revolt against Hollywood's addiction to risk-free formulas and to "bankable" movie stars who are asked to recreate earlier successes without improving on them. The movie industry has been doing that for years and is not the only business to go for time-tested recipes. But economic factors seem to have reinforced Hollywood's self-destructive tendencies.
The news that three hugely expensive movies ("Jade," "Strange Days" and "The Scarlet Letter") opened and flopped in one weekend is only the latest sign that all the marketing genius that money can buy cannot sell counterfeit goods or tired retreads. It is often said in Hollywood that everyone in the United States has two businesses: their own and show business. Nowadays, the motion picture industry has become such an entertaining spectator sport that its ups and downs are more interesting than the movies themselves. 
 Among the forces driving Hollywood toward the safe shore of formulaic and derivative movie-making are the inflated salaries awarded performers whose names are thought to guarantee box-office success. Equally significant, however, is the fact that the multinational corporations that increasingly own the studios almost always look for the sure thing, especially when movie budgets are soaring routinely to $50 million or more.
In that context, breathtaking cynicism rewarded by rejection is reassuring. A national referendum that might terminate the persistent recycling of Sylvester Stallone in ever more mindlessly violent vehicles is welcome indeed. Likewise, empty theaters may force Hollywood to think twice before it tarts up Hester Prynne as Demi Moore, or attempts to merchandise the stripping and lap-dancing in "Showgirls" as art and enlightenment.
Moviegoers do not wish the producers and performers ill. What they do not like is Hollywood's careless assumption that they are easy to manipulate and can be taken for granted. Sam Goldwyn once said, "You gotta take the sour with the bitter." Now the bitter audience is refusing to take it.

HEADLINE: Co-op in Free Fall: A Horror Story

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Lou-Anne Walters and her mother had barely finished arranging furniture and hanging family photos in the apartment they bought in Brooklyn six years ago when their co-op started its free fall.
First the sponsors of the conversion plan went broke, leaving the finances in a mess and renovations of apartments unfinished. Then the bank that took over from the defaulted sponsors went bankrupt two years later. 
 So when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in to take over the assets of the bank in 1992, which included many of the apartments, other owners were relieved. Not only would the agency be responsible for the unsold apartments, but it also would hold the individual mortgages of the families who had bought apartments.
"We thought at least there would be some order restored," said Ms. Walters, who lives with her mother in a spacious six-room apartment at 611 Argyle Road in Kensington, a neighborhood consisting mostly of single-family homes near Brooklyn College.
But their comfort was short-lived. Within a year, the banking agency had ended its financial support of the building by stopping the payments for maintenance on the apartments it ended up owning: a majority of the 84 units. Without that support, the individual apartment owners are losing hope that the co-op will be saved. At the same time, they are being pressed by the agency to pay off co-op loans for apartments they will probably never own outright.
In a city with no shortage of horror stories about the co-op market and a reputation as one of the biggest victims of the real estate collapse of the 1980's, the story of 611 Argyle Road stands out. The 18 remaining families who bought apartments are in a mess that includes two mortgages, two banks and a Government agency whose job it is to protect the public.
Initially, 27 apartments were sold, and nine shareholders have defaulted. The rest are occupied by tenants paying stabilized rents of $272 to $675 a month.
The co-op buyers, most of them black or Hispanic, say that when the co-op started to unravel, they were resigned to the loss of equity in their apartments along with their dreams of home ownership. But what they cannot accept is the way they have been treated by the agency.
Ms. Walters, an accountant, said the agency had given her and her fellow shareholders a no-win choice of paying off loans on apartments where they will probably soon be tenants or defaulting on the loans, ruining their credit ratings. She has chosen to take the risk of defaulting.
The F.D.I.C. is only following its legal mandate, said Gary P. Bowen, Northeast regional director of the Disposition Asset Services Division. "This is really a terrible situation," he acknowledged. "But we are supposed to realize the maximum from the sale of these assets. We are not allowed to take money and throw it at a group that happens to be having a bad time."
Ms. Walters and other buyers said they paid $55,000 to $105,000 for their apartments. While some have stopped repaying their co-op loans, all have continued to pay maintenance of $320 to $686 a month.
"These apartments were all that most of us could afford," said Ms. Walters, who with her mother paid $95,000 for the apartment in 1989. "We have suffered for years at the hands of the sponsors of the conversion, various managing agents, the bank and now the F.D.I.C. We are not asking for our money back. But at what point does someone or some entity step up and share the responsibility for this mess, which is not ours alone?"
Shareholders say they were never notified of the F.D.I.C.'s decision to pull out.
"We learned about it when we were served with the notices of the foreclosure," said one of the buyers, Patricia Gore. "The F.D.I.C. didn't even give us any warning."
The building is now in receivership, and it is likely that the bank holding the first mortgage will put it up for auction and that it will be turned back into a rental property.
After four years of being passed from one F.D.I.C. official to another, some co-op owners recently met with agency representatives face to face for the first time. But Mr. Bowen, who did not attend the meeting, held out little hope the residents would be forgiven their loans.
The mess can be traced to the sponsors of the conversion, Aaron Ziegelman and Arthur Cohen. The sponsors, who took out a second mortgage on the building, increasing the cost of maintaining it, defaulted after their costs could no longer be covered by the maintenance payments of shareholders and rents from the tenants who did not buy apartments.
After the sponsors defaulted, the First New York Bank for Business took over the unsold apartments the sponsors owned. It collapsed in 1992. Among the assets inherited by the F.D.I.C. were shares on apartments and co-op loans. The agency determined that the building was a lost cause when it discovered that rents and maintenance payments did not meet the mortgage and the cost of upkeep. The entire building fell into default when Bankers Federal Savings Bank, which held the first mortgage, foreclosed on the F.D.I.C. and the remaining shareholders.
Dozens of co-op and condominium conversion projects ran into trouble in the late 1980's. But many co-ops have been saved through refinancing worked out by banks, shareholders and agencies like the F.D.I.C.
This year, for example, the F.D.I.C. took a loss when it sold a $7.65 million mortgage it held on Celtic Park, a troubled 26-building co-op in Woodside, Queens, to the shareholders for $5.5 million.
But Mr. Bowen sees no such future for the Argyle. "Some projects are more economically viable than others," he said when asked about the distinction between the two properties. "In Queens we held the first mortgage, and the co-op was able to borrow from another lender to pay off the debt."
Ms. Walters said of the agency: "They only see the bottom line. This building did not have to continue to decline. By letting the building go into foreclosure, the F.D.I.C. kept us from helping ourselves."

Losing a March

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I stood at the corner of Third Street and Jefferson Drive on the day after the Half-Million Man March and gazed up at the flag that rippled silently outside the Capitol dome. The dome, wrapped as always in the glory of dreams not yet realized, stood gleaming against a pale blue melancholy sky.
Twenty-four hours earlier an extraordinary number of African-American men and boys had turned up in the nation's capital in search of leadership that would galvanize them, that would show them in a compelling way what they could do to improve the quality of their lives. Even more impressive than the sheer number of the participants was the extraordinary amount of good will they exhibited. 
 It was an opportunity that should have been exploited for maximum benefit. But no one knew how. The throngs were willing, but the leadership was weak.
The atmosphere for most of the day was that of a vast picnic. The warmth of comradeship was everywhere. Smiles and embraces were ubiquitous, and it would be difficult to overestimate the importance of the experience to the young boys who had traveled to Washington for the first time in the arms of, or clutching the hands of, their fathers and uncles and grandfathers.
But something was missing. The men positively thirsted for wise and compelling counsel, the leadership that in these harsh times would draw out the best in themselves.
Where, for example, was the inspirational message about the simple need and the profound value of working ever harder, ever harder, no matter how lousy or unfair it might seem, to achieve personal and collective goals that have proved so elusive for so long?
The men were told repeatedly to reconnect with their families, obviously a positive message, but they weren't given a clue as to how to better support those families. Many of the men I spoke with grew up without fathers themselves. Being responsible family men is new terrain for them.
"I want to do the right thing," said Isaac Taylor, a 24-year-old unemployed laborer from Cincinnati who has two children, a girl, 6, and a boy, 4. The children live with their mother. "I don't really know where things went wrong," Mr. Taylor said. "I could use some guidance."
Where was the serious talk, the blunt talk, about the desperate need to curb the violence that has ruined so many families and spoiled so many neighborhoods? A report released last week by the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development noted: "The firearm homicide rate for 10-to-14-year-olds more than doubled between 1985 and 1992 (from 0.8 to 1.9 per 100,000). For black males, the rate increased from 3.0 to 8.4 per 100,000 during the same period."
The marchers were open to serious talk. They were more than willing to absorb hard truths. "Stop the violence!" was a point that should have been driven home relentlessly, not sporadically. Those in the enormous crowd who were not violent, the vast majority, should nevertheless have been given the mission to go back home and bring real pressure on their peers to renounce violence.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson urged the men to take their children to school, another worthy suggestion. But that is not enough (as Mr. Jackson himself has pointed out) when, for example, the New York City Board of Education has to issue updated safety regulations to deal with students who carry guns, knives and box-cutters to school, and who use force, with or without a weapon, "against school personnel, or extreme force against students or others."
I wanted to hear the use of violence denounced repeatedly in the strongest of terms. I didn't.
I wanted to hear about the importance of good study habits, and strategies to counter the taunts of schoolmates who believe that following the rules, studying hard and achieving high grades are ways of "acting white," and therefore should be shunned.
I wanted to hear many things. The fundamentals. In the end, the inspiration came not from the podium but from the crowd itself. Many of the men said they would return home with a renewed sense of purpose. But the leadership is still desperately needed. Without it, the sense of purpose will be lost.

HEADLINE: G.M. Feels A.O.K. About Vehicle Design Management

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 19

 BODY:
It is autumn in the Motor City, the locust trees are turning gold, and the General Motors Corporation -- with a mix of grandeur, mystery and familiarity -- said today that it was continuing to reorganize its vehicle development process.
In brief, the company named the 13 V.L.E.s who will manage the V.D.P. under N.A.O. That is, it identified the people who will oversee development, knitting together G.M.'s far-flung, diffuse operations. 
 For G.M. watchers -- avid collectors of abbreviations -- the announcement was another opportunity to revel in perhaps the deepest mystery of the business world: how the biggest corporation on earth takes a notion, filters it through thousands of designers, accountants, engineers and manufacturing experts, and turns out a moveable beast of steel, glass and rubber.
Asked today if anyone understood the Vehicle Development Process, Joseph S. Phillippi, a Lehman Brothers analyst who has studied G.M. for a quarter-century, cited a past company president.
"Ed Cole," he said. "Except he's dead."
For many years, the steel, glass and rubber did not seem to fit together very well. Now, executives said today, things are coming together properly. They said G.M.'s cars and trucks will get even better as new product teams under the Vehicle Line Executives exploit changes made over more than a decade of corporate evolution. At least, that's what they seemed to be saying.
"The teams that will initiate new programs over the next couple of years will be able to execute those programs within the capability of the process as it exists at that time," explained Arvin F. Mueller, vice president and group executive for the company's North American Operations Vehicle Development and Technical Operations Group. "The process people are focused intensely on getting the process improved to improve the performance and the output."
For true believers -- the shareholders and customers who are delighted with G.M.'s recent performance -- that assurance is enough. Because of new efficiencies, G.M. made more money in the first nine months of this year than in any full year in its history. And as its vehicles improve, its market share is recovering.
But there are always some who question. "I wanted somebody to sit down and give me a flow chart," Mr. Phillippi groused.
The vehicle development process at G.M. fascinates analysts because it is the key to the company's turnaround. When G.M. dominated the market, the marketing divisions -- ranging from Cadillac to Pontiac -- created their own cars and trucks and competed with each other, because there was plenty of market share to go around.
Now the company has more than enough competitors. So it is centralizing development, having designers and engineers who used to work only for Chevrolet or Buick, say, produce distinct versions of fundamentally similar vehicles for sale through several divisions, which are shells of their former selves.
G.M. wants to exploit its enormous economies of scale while still taking advantage of its dozens of distinct brands, from the Chevrolet Camaro to the Cadillac Fleetwood.
G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president of G.M.'s North American operations (that's N.A.O.), said today that shareholders and owners are rightly indifferent to the whole subject.
"Does the customer care about this?" he asked. "No. Should they care about it? No." The process -- what he called the "plumbing" -- is management's problem.
The bottom line, he said, was that the changes would help G.M. produce cars and trucks in an average of 38 months starting in 1997, 25 percent faster than it does now.
And, because of the changes, G.M. will focus more on what customers want, finely carving the market into groups with names like "the customer-needs segments of the midsize partition." Thus, new vehicles will be better designed to meet customers' desires, G.M. said, and will fetch higher prices, bolstering earnings.
G.M. declined to quantify the savings expected from the changes. But it said the changes were not likely to cost the jobs of any of its 708,000 employees worldwide, since those whose work becomes unnecessary under the new organization can move into new slots. "We'll redeploy those people to the added capacity of the process," Mr. Mueller said. "That's it, pure and simple."
G.M. develops vehicles in what it calls a four-phase process; it actually has five phases. The process begins with a period known as "bubble up," which is Phase 0, the genesis of a new product.
But the process is evolving. "Will we never change this?" asked Mr. Wagoner. "Absolutely not. We'll modify it as necessary for the rest of our lives."

HEADLINE: Starts Fell For Housing Last Month

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The rate at which builders broke ground on homes slowed in September for a second month, the Government said today, while new unemployment claims rose last week. The data underlined the economic expansion's slow pace.
The Commerce Department said starts on new homes and apartments fell one-tenth of 1 percent in September, to an annual rate of 1.39 million units. In August, housing starts fell a revised 2.8 percent. They jumped 10.3 percent in July. 
 Despite the decline last month, analysts said builders were starting projects at a healthy pace as the fall building season began.
"That's a pretty good pace, especially for September," said David Lereah, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
During the third quarter, the average number of housing starts stood at an annual rate of 1.4 million units, seasonally adjusted, 9.4 percent higher than the second-quarter rate of 1.28 million starts.
"We're not looking for much further growth in these numbers, but it's encouraging that we seem to be sliding onto a trend of 1.4 million starts a year," said David Seiders, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders.
Lower mortgage rates have helped rejuvenate the nation's housing markets after a weak first half of the year. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said today that rates on 30-year fixed mortgages fell to an average of 7.38 percent this week, the lowest level in 20 months and well below the 9 percent rate at the start of the year.
Separately, the Labor Department said today that new claims for state unemployment benefits rose to 361,000 last week, the highest level in a month, from 356,000 a week earlier. But the four-week moving average of new jobless claims, which smooths out weekly fluctuations in the labor market data, fell last week to 348,750 claims from a revised 350,000 claims in the prior four-week average.
Today's reports fit a pattern of moderate economic growth with mild inflation. Analysts said recent economic data have probably convinced members of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee not to cut interest rates when they next meet, on Nov. 15. Applications for building permits rose 1.5 percent in September, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.39 million. They grew 1 percent in August.
Construction starts on single-family homes fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in September after rising 1.8 percent in August. But starts on apartments rose 2.6 percent, identical to the August gain.
Regionally, total starts fell 4.2 percent in the Northeast, 3.8 percent in the Midwest and 2.2 percent in the South. Only the West reported an increase, of 8.7 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Economic Data Spur Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher yesterday in response to weaker-than-expected economic reports, particularly for housing.
The market was given a lift in the afternoon by an interview with a Federal Reserve Governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, who told the Market News Service that he felt "inclined" to ease credit further, although not necessarily right away. "As inflation comes down and we get a resolution of fiscal policy, I'm inclined that way," he said. 
 The 30-year bond was up 10/32, to 107 20/32, to yield 6.30 percent, down from 6.33 percent on Wednesday.
Debt futures trended higher in a narrow range in quiet trading as the December bond contract settled at 117 10/32. It reached a high of 11714/32 , just below Wednesday's session high of 117 17/32.
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research and analysis firm, said the three economic reports yesterday -- on housing starts, new jobless claims and business activity -- were essentially consistent with the current climate of moderate growth and slow inflation. He said that September housing starts reported by the Commerce Department were essentially flat at 1.4 million annual units, consistent with solid economic growth.
Mr. McCarthy said that the housing data indicated that economic conditions in the fourth quarter would be consistent with the Fed's desire for a soft landing. "We still look for another 25 basis points later this year to keep the economy growing in 1996," he said, "but unless rates are lowered, the economy will slow in 1996."
The Labor Department unemployment-claims report for the week ended Oct. 14 showed a rise of 6,000, to 361,000; expectations had been for a drop. "But basically, the four-week moving average is at 350,000, which is still consistent with moderate growth," Mr. McCarthy said. "There was nothing new here."
And in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's survey of regional business activity, the index dipped slightly to 25.5 in September. The prices-paid component in the report surged to 30.0 from 13.6, while the new-orders component fell to 22.9 from 29.1. Analysts said that the strength in the overall index combined with the jump in the prices component would be troublesome for the market but that the decrease in new orders would offset it to some extent.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, noted that in the Philadelphia survey fewer respondents saw a decline in business activity.
"On one hand, the market is looking at whether the Fed will ease at the end of the year at this point, and on the other, it is following the budget battle in Washington," Mr. McCarthy said. "While it may appear as a sideshow, it could be an important one. If there is a real deficit reduction, then the market will rally some more."
However, the market to some extent has already priced in a deficit reduction, some traders said, so there is a potential for disappointment if it does not happen.
In when-issued trading, the two-year notes to be auctioned next week were offered at a price to yield 5.65 percent, down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from Wednesday, while the five-year notes that are also being auctioned next week were offered at a price to yield 5.80 percent, also down 2 basis points.
"The market remains bullish, and in the minds of some investors, the soft landing is here," Mr. McCarthy said. "So in this kind of environment, current interest rates could be considered high, leaving room for the Fed to ease by the end of the year." He cautioned, though, that easing would not necessarily come at next month's policy meeting since the budget situation remained uncertain.

HEADLINE: DANCE REVIEW;
Birth and Purification via Lotuses and Water

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF 

 BODY:
Water is a major image in "Nine Songs," a work of epic resonance and contemporary relevance that Lin Hwai-min has choreographed for his Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan, a modern-dance troupe that presented very different works in New York in 1979 and 1985.
Even before the curtain rose on the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night, the audience saw an orchestra pit transformed into a linear lotus pond. This liquid-filled trough, on view through the company's final performance tomorrow night at the academy's opera house (30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene) is the magical realization of Ming Cho Lee, the distinguished American stage designer who was born in Shanghai. In Brooklyn, he has not been able to use real lotus flowers as he did in Taiwan. But there is a silky shimmer to his synthetic lily pads and pink lotus blossoms, closed or open, as they float on real water and rise toward the stage above. 
 The lotus is a symbol of rebirth in Asia, and water is a symbol of purification and nature in "Nine Songs," which wends through the river of life on its own theatrically imaginative terms. From these basic images and a 2,000-year-old poem by Qu Yuang, one of China's great poets, Mr. Lin has choreographed a striking pictorial spectacle. The effect is that of a huge Chinese scroll in which movement fills in the unfurling landscape with a series of economical brushstrokes.
The two-hour piece is both poetic in its meditative beauty and occasionally exasperating in its very richness. There are times when Mr. Lin goes on too long, with little hint of the direction in which he is headed. Yet he at least knows his ultimate destination and reaches it with a satisfying sense of resolution.
What seems like an allegory about the seasons and human existence is turned finally into a protest piece. Yet it is not only that; Mr. Lin, who is also a novelist, has taken his cue from Qu Yang. The poet registered a political critique with the authorities who exiled him, by way of a poem cycle that scorned the gods for their ineffectualness. Mr. Lin refers to these gods of shamanistic times with a similar approach, moving from the universal to the specific.
By the end, the masked deities, demonlike or lyrical, who led the dance, are gone. Instead, the stage is filled with scenes referring to historical massacres of the 20th century. When a taped score by the Ju Percussion Group abstracts a machine-gun sound, the stream of images is powerful and clear. The way Taiwanese were executed under Japanese occupation (1895 to World War II) is recalled by figures marching with baskets on their heads. The fall of dancers to the ground and their striking sculptural groupings under Lin Keh-hua's dramatic lighting refers to the little-known execution of Taiwanese on Feb. 28, 1947, by the island's Chinese Nationalist Government.
No one will mistake the allusion to Tiananmen Square in 1989 in Beijing as dancers cross the stage on bicycles, and the bright headlights of an unseen tank take aim at the audience and victims onstage.
It is then that Mr. Lin ties up all the loose ends. Lee Ching-chun, as the female Shaman in red who greeted the gods in the beginning, returns to pour water mercifully on one of the victims. The rest of the 22-member company places votive candles on the floor. Mr. Lee, who has enlarged a lotus painting by the Taiwanese painter Lin Yu-san on a movable backdrop, creates a winding Milky Way of lights, suggesting candles stretching into infinity.
As a choreographer, Mr. Lin once drew mainly from Martha Graham's idiom, and Ms. Lee, as the Shaman, has all the angular percussive shape of a Graham heroine. But elsewhere Mr. Lin borrows from a mix of Asian dance styles (Balinese included), natural movement and acrobatics from Chinese opera and the martial arts.
This eclecticism, reflected in the music (from Taiwanese tribal songs to Tibetan monks' chants and Indian classical music), works better in the second half than in the first, which has overly schematic encounters among the Shaman, the ensemble and deities.
Mr. Lin hits his stride in Part 2 when Wang Chiang-mei, as a River Goddess, dressed in mourning white, curves her lyrical dance within a serene ensemble. There is a spectacular trio of men who are precise in their supporting and balancing act: Wu l-Fang, as the God of Clouds, walks on "air" by standing on one leg on the back or shoulders of either Sung Chao-chiun or Wang Chih-hao. Li Wen-long's animistic solo as the Mountain Spirit was sensitively danced. Huang Hsu-hui, in business suit, was the time traveler who passed through an eye-filling and thought-provoking spectacle.

What's in the House's Medicare Bill

BYLINE: By MONICA BORKOWSKI 

 BODY:

Premiums
 
Would increase the monthly premium from $46.10 to $87.60 in 2002. (Under current law premiums would rise to $60.80 in 2002.)
According to the Congressional Budget Office, monthly premiums would be:
 
1996 -- $53.50
1997 -- $56.90
1998 -- $59.40
1999 -- $63.80
2000 -- $72.10
2001 -- $78.90
2002 -- $87.60
 
There would be higher premiums for single people earning $75,000 or more or couples earning $125,000 or more.
 
Savings
 
$270 billion over seven years, or 14 percent of Medicare spending. $147.5 billion would come from limiting payments to providers; $55 billion would come from increases in premiums; $34.6 billion would be saved by moving beneficiaries into alternative insurance plans; $31.8 billion would come from a "fail-safe" mechanism which would automatically cut payments to doctors, hospitals and other providers if Medicare spending overshoots targets set by law; $1.3 billion would come from other provisions including anti-fraud and abuse.
 
 Spending
 
For the first time, the Government would impose annual limits on the growth of Medicare spending. From 1995 to 2002, average spending for each beneficiary would rise 40 percent, to $6,700 from $4,800. (Under current law, it would grow 67 percent, to $8,000 in 2002.)
 
Deductibles
 
Would stay the same, $100 for Medicare Part B, which pays for doctors services.
 
Choices
 
The elderly could choose coverage under the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program, or under a new MedicarePlus program. Under MedicarePlus they could select from a variety of plans. They could enroll in private health plans, including health maintenance organizations, they could enroll in a new type of plan sponsored by groups of doctors or hospitals, or they could choose a plan that combines a high-deductible health insurance policy with a medical savings account. All plans would provide at least the same benefits that are available under Medicare.

 Medical Savings Accounts
 
 Under MedicarePlus, people could combine a high-deductible/low premium health insurance policy with a medical savings account. The Federal Government would contribute a standard per-person Medicare and any excess over the policy premium would be deposited in the individual's medical savings account. The account holder could use the funds in the account to pay for medical expenses. Withdrawals for medical expenses would be non-taxable; withdrawals for personal use would be taxable.

 Malpractice
 
 Limits non-economic damages, like awards for pain and suffering, in medical liability cases to $250,000 per case. Limits punitive damages. intended to punish willfully malicious conduct, to $250,000, or three times the amount of economic damages, whichever is greater. Prohibits the award of punitive damages in a case involving a drug or medical device that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

 Antitrust
 
 Relaxes laws to make it easier for doctors and hospitals to form health networks serving Medicare beneficiaries. Doctors who collaborate in such arrangements would, in many cases, be allowed to set their prices in consultation with one another, a practice often prohibited as price-fixing under current law.

Fewer Jobs Created

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Fewer jobs have been created in New Jersey this year than last an estimated 50,000 this year, compared with 65,000 in 1994 -- but the overall employment picture in the state is encouraging, two Rutgers University professors told a group of policymakers yesterday. Downsizing in the banking and communications industries continues to be worrisome, said Prof. Joseph Seneca, the university's vice president for academic affairs, but there is continuing growth in small businesses and the lower-paying service industries.

HEADLINE: Turkey Doesn't Make War on Its Citizens;
Dirty Weapons Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "America Arms Turkey's Repression" (editorial, Oct. 17): 
 The United States Government's foreign military sales activities are more egregious than supporting Turkey's repression of the Kurds. Once, the United States Government supplied arms to Iran. When Iran and Iraq went to war, the United States supplied arms to Iraq. One wonders how many were killed during Desert Storm by Iraqi forces armed with American-supplied arms.
The argument that military exports provide domestic employment is spurious; workers displaced by market changes find jobs elsewhere. If you added up the lost jobs of the past 10 years, the unemployment rate would be at least 20 percent if no new jobs had been created by a dynamic economy.
Equally spurious is the argument that if the United States doesn't supply arms, others will. When taxpayers in other democracies tire of subsidizing their governments' arms sales, poor countries will be compelled to buy only the military equipment they can afford.
It is claimed that exports of military equipment help reduce our balance-of-payments deficit. This is true only to the extent that the United States receives payment for these exports. All Americans must bear the burden when the Government "sells" arms abroad, financed by loans and grants. It's a dirty business, and our Government should get out of it.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Gains Against the Franc, Sending the Dollar Down a Bit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most European currencies yesterday as the German mark resumed its ascent against the battered French franc.
"The mark is strong against the franc, and that's pulling the dollar down across the board," said Karl Halligan, currency trader at CIC Bank in New York. 
 The dollar was also hurt after the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, apparently referring to the mark, said that while a strong currency carried disadvantages, "in the end, a country is better off."
In New York late yesterday, the dollar edged up to 100.76 yen from 100.41 yen. But the dollar fell to 1.4232 marks from 1.4147 marks and to 1.1485 Swiss francs from 1.1562 Swiss francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5685 from $1.5731.
Despite the declines against a number of currencies, traders noted that the dollar remained within its recent trading range.
The mark gained yesterday as the French franc continued to be weakened by concerns over the nation's budget deficit and political uncertainty, particularly centering on Prime Minster Alan Juppe. His approval rating among voters has slumped even as the country struggles to cope with a wave of bombings.
France's unemployment rate, at 11.4 percent in August, is among Europe's highest, and its budget deficit is expected to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product this year.
The mark was last quoted at 3.5169 francs, up from 3.5045 francs in New York on Thursday.
Traders also were buying marks for yen, which hurt the dollar against the mark and helped it against the yen. Some mark-yen trading is executed via the dollar, meaning that traders were buying dollars for yen and selling those dollars for marks.
The yen suffers from Japan's anemic economy, which grew only six-tenths of 1 percent in the year ended June 30, and its troubled banking industry, which faces at least $400 billion in bad loans.
"Financial institutions, economic growth -- everything is weighing on the yen," said Olev Trygg, treasurer in charge of currency trading at Swedbank in New York.
The dollar will not be able to sustain significant gains until the United States makes progress in cutting the budget deficit, traders said.
"I will remain bearish on the dollar until we take care of our deficit and debt ceiling," said Ian Spence, currency trader at Rabobank Nederland in New York. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 1995, Monday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Friday about Thursday's trading in the currency markets carried day-old figures for three late New York rates. The dollar was last quoted on Thursday at 100.43 Japanese yen, down from 100.76 yen, and at 1.4078 German marks, down from 1.4232. The British pound was at $1.5756, up from $1.5685.

HEADLINE: Congressional Bills Threaten Aid for Immigrant Students

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
A little-noted provision in the Senate welfare bill could deny Federal education aid to tens of thousands of legal immigrants, more than half of whom are college students in New York and California.
The House version, though less strict, could also limit Federal grants and loans to foreign-born college students who live in this country legally. 
 Advocates for higher education said the changes would strip the rungs from a ladder that has allowed generations of immigrants to climb out of poverty.
At the City University of New York, officials say 40,000 legal immigrants, of a total 210,000 students, receive the most commonly used Federal college tuition grants that would be affected by the proposed changes. The officials said that most of the students would become ineligible under the rules being considered in the Senate.
At Rutgers University in New Jersey, nearly 3,000 immigrants could be affected.
"This is just a small provision in a big bill that will have a huge impact," said Terry W. Hartle, vice president of the American Council on Education, which represents 2,000 public and private colleges.
"Legal immigrants are individuals who have played by the rules and who we have decided to let into the country," he added. "The impact of this proposal would be to say to these individuals: 'We'll let you in, but if you want to get ahead, as other Americans do, you are on your own.' "
Though President Clinton has hinted that he could sign awelfare bill that is similar to the Senate's, a senior Administration official said this week that the Administration had deep concerns about the proposed changes to educational aid to immigrants. The bills already include many reductions on Federal assistance to legal immigrants. The President's concern was mentioned in a letter outlining his views on the welfare bills, sent on Wednesday to the leadership of each House and signed by Alice M. Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
"Eliminating student aid and loans is really counterproductive for our plan basically to assimilate immigrants into the American economic machine," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Neither the Senate nor House version would actually issue a blanket prohibition on educational assistance to legal immigrants. Rather, the provision would require that immigrants report the income of their sponsors when applying for Federal assistance programs, including education aid -- even though sponsors are not required by law or practice to provide for the cost of education.
Education officials said that could disqualify many legal immigrants who now receive financial aid, particularly the most common form of Federal assistance -- the Pell grant for needy undergraduates. The reason is rooted in the vague legal responsibility of the sponsor. Most immigrants who cannot demonstrate their financial independence, or who do not have a job that pays adequately when they enter the country, must have a sponsor.
Sponsors are usually family members, though the relation is often distant. The sponsors must prove that they have enough money to prevent an immigrant from becoming a "public charge." That means they may have enough money to prevent an immigrant from receiving Federal aid -- even though in many cases they may not be willing or financially able to spend it on the immigrant's education.
Adele Kurbanali, 21, who immigrated from Trinidad a year ago with her family, said the rules under consideration could hit her hard. A freshman who is studying nutrition at New York University, Ms. Kurbanali qualified for a Pell grant (named for Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who sponsored the legislation) even though both her parents work six days a week. Her father's brother sponsored the family, but "if he knew he had to pay money for my education, he would not have sponsored my family," she said.
"We are just trying to build ourselves up," she continued. "America is built on immigrants. I don't think they should be taking our aid away just because we're immigrants."
Dick Day, the chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, which drafted the Senate provision said the rationale for the provision is based on the idea that education aid and welfare are not fundamentally different. He noted that Congress is also seeking to bolster the legal responsibility of sponsors to immigrants.
"It is like job training or other welfare," he said. "The deal was not to bring people here that are going to have to then be trained at the public expense."
But educators contend there is a crucial distinction: that welfare simply supports a person whereas education aid -- historically open to citizens and immigrants alike -- helps spring a person into prosperity. The effect on immigrants who lost aid, educators say, would be the same as on any other student: taking longer to graduate, transferring to a less expensive school, or simply dropping out.
"There really has been the thought out there that those who can pay more should, and we'll have ways the poor, talented students can go to school," said W. Ann Reynolds, the CUNY chancellor. She has been lobbying Congress hard to scuttle the provision.
"Now we are taking away the support for that poor talented student," she continued. "We are simply knocking that poor, talented, energetic student out of college with this."
In the Senate version, when a legal immigrant applies for financial assistance, the sponsor's income would count for five years from the date the student entered the country. For new immigrants, that income would be counted until they worked and paid taxes for a minimum of 10 years -- even if the immigrant became a naturalized United States citizen in the meantime. Critics said that would create two classes of American citizens.
In the House version, immigrants who are already in the country would not be affected. For new immigrants, sponsors would have to report their income indefinitely -- or until the immigrant they are sponsoring becomes a naturalized citizen.
In either version, Congressional aides said, the income reporting would not apply to immigrants who do not have sponsors. But those people generally have significant jobs or resources of their own. So they might not qualify for Federal assistance in the first place.
A draft report from the General Accounting Office issued this month states that 390,000 legal immigrants nationwide received Pell grants in 1992-1993, representing about 10 percent of all students who received the grants. The maximum grant is $2,400 a year. But the report showed that 82 percent of those immigrants lived in seven states, led by California with 31 percent and New York with 25 percent. The other top states were Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois and Massachusetts.
In New York, there were 96,273 immigrants who received Pell grants, or 26.5 percent of the 363,698 students who received them.
In California, 120,488 legal immigrants received the grants, or 32.6 percent of the 369,078 total students who received the grants, the report said.
At the University of California in Los Angeles, 4,300 immigrants receive Pell grants, and most probably would not qualify under the proposed rules, according to Ronald W. Johnson, the school's director of financial aid.
"It is totally unfair," he said.
In Florida, 30,199 legal immigrants received Pell grants, or nearly 16 percent of the total who receive them. The office of Senator Bob Graham, a Democrat who has been outspokenly against the provisions, said that 8,000 of the 20,000 legal immigrants at Miami Dade Community College stood to lose their Federal financial aid.
"It's so much in the America's national interest to have legal immigrants go to college, to go to vocational school, to be better equipped to contribute," Mr. Graham said in an interview on Thursday. "To cut them off like this is self-defeating."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC HOSPITALS FACING DEEP CUTS IN MEDICARE BILL

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
The sweeping cuts in Medicare making their way through Congress would force major teaching and public hospitals around the nation to retrench drastically or face closure, and to slash doctor-training programs that are the backbone of medical care in many poor neighborhoods, according to health care experts.
The bitter debates over Medicare have focused on its role as the nation's health care system for the elderly. But the $178 billion program is also the largest subsidizer of medical training in the country, and helps hospitals serving poor and uninsured patients. 
 Nowhere would the effects be felt more than in New York City, where 15 percent of the nation's medical students train and where more medical care is provided to the poor than anywhere else.
If the Medicare overhaul becomes law, Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, in the South Bronx, for example, will lose financing for most of the salaries for about 63 percent of its medical residents, who provide the bulk of its patient care. New York City's 11 public hospitals will lose nearly $800 million over seven years if the bill becomes law.
In North Carolina, officials of Duke University, which has one of the nation's premier teaching hospitals, say they would lose 30 percent of the money they depend on for training doctors.
"What people need to understand is that these cuts reach beyond the Medicare population," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade organization. "There is no such thing in a hospital as a Medicare nurse or a Medicaid nurse or a Blue Cross/Blue Shield nurse. Hospitals combine different streams of revenue to pay for everything they do, and so cuts in Medicare payments affect everyone who comes through their doors."
Republicans say the entire Medicare program must sustain cuts to survive. And many experts say there is already less of a need for big hospitals as insurance companies and health maintenance organizations push for shorter hospital stays and more preventive care.
In New York, for instance, city officials contend that there are too many hospitals, many just blocks from each other. The administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wants to close or shrink some of the hospitals in the city's vast public health care system.
Some experts also say that current programs overemphasize specialty training, when primary care is the way of the future.
Though Medicare was created to provide care for the elderly, it also provides hospitals with about $150,000 each year for every new doctor they train. In addition, the program pays premiums to hospitals serving disproportionately large numbers of the poor and uninsured.
Under the House legislation, hospitals would lose $8.6 billion in subsidies for medical education and $7.1 billion for treating the indigent.
Republicans offer several reasons for the proposed changes in Medicare payments for the training of doctors. In a report on the Medicare bill this week, Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee said Medicare was paying more than its share of hospital costs for such training.
House Republicans said it was necessary to cut back payments for foreign medical graduates, which in New York City hospitals make up half of the medical residents, as part of a comprehensive effort to control Medicare costs. Moreover, they said, United States citizens should have priority over foreign medical graduates in the allocation of Medicare money.
Hospitals throughout the country are scrambling to patch the holes these provisions would bore in their budgets. "The margins are vanishing," said Dr. Ralph Snyderman, dean of the medical school at Duke.
If there is less money to hire residents, he said, full-time faculty members will have to spend more time treating patients and less time doing clinical research and training new doctors. The ability of the hospital to provide a wide range of charity care will be jeopardized, he said.
"The real danger is that the infrastructure of the nation's academic health system will fall apart," Dr. Snyderman said. "People have to remember that the cost of medicine has to include the cost of education. These cuts will have a chilling effect on that."
These combined cuts would hit hardest in New York City, a nexus of many of the nation's most prominent teaching hospitals and many of its poorest residents.
With more than two million uninsured people in New York City, the state ranks second in the nation in so-called disproportionate share payments intended to offset the expense of treating large numbers of poor patients. The House bill cuts those payments by 25 percent.
The state also ranks first in Medicare payments for doctor training, which the bill would reduce in three ways.
It would phase in a 27 percent cut in the indirect costs of training doctors, such as extra lab tests and the longer hours needed to make up for the slower pace of teaching.
The bill would eliminate subsidies for doctors training in subspecialties, a major focus of many of the city's most elite and prestigious teaching hospitals. Hospitals now receive half the cost of teaching these subspecialists, among them cardiologists, gastroenterologists and neurosurgeons. In New York City, this would affect about 1,800 of the roughly 13,000 resident slots.
The bill also seeks a vast reduction in payments for the salaries of foreign medical residents who are not United States citizens, refugees or aliens with permanent residence. About 25 percent of New York's medical residents fall into that category. Many hospitals in the city's poorest and most underserved neighborhoods are staffed largely by such doctors, who provide most of the front-line care at cheaper rates.
To compensate for some of these losses, the bill establishes a Graduate Medical Education and Teaching Hospitals Trust Fund. But the proposal does not specify how much money would be placed in the trust, where the money would come from or exactly how the fund would operate.
The plan also contains a so-called look-back provision, which means that if the Government does not meet its projected savings, it could retroactively reduce its reimbursement rates and assess hospitals.
"Personally, I am counting on a Presidential veto," said Stanley Brezenoff, president of Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, which faces slashed payments for about half of its 411 residents and interns.
New York City hospitals, like others across the country, are already struggling to keep up with discounts demanded by managed care companies and are staggering from state cuts in their Medicaid reimbursements. Some local politicians and health officials warned that coming on top of those financial threats, the Medicare cuts would cause an economic and health care crisis in the city.
They warned that with more that $12 billion in Medicare and Medicaid cuts to city institutions anticipated under the legislation over the next seven years, more than 100,000 jobs would be lost, hospitals would close in communities where there are no others, and services would be pared to such minimal levels that patient care would be imperiled.
Close to $80 billion is spent on health care in New York State each year. Medicare covers about $13 billion of those costs, with roughly $7.6 billion paid to hospitals for reimbursement and doctor training, $3.8 billion paid to doctors and $900 million paid to nursing homes and home health care programs.
"What will happen is something between meltdown and chaos," said James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, a philanthropic group. "The danger is there comes a point where patients will not be spared the impact. We're at that point."
At Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens, 38 percent of the residents would no longer qualify for full salary payments from Medicare under the House bill because they are aliens, according to the hospital's president, David P. Rosen. Hospital officials say that without that subsidy, they will not be able to employ these doctors.
But their worries about the Medicare changes do not end there. They fear that more prestigious hospitals that have also lost financing for some of their residents would lure away young doctors at Jamaica still subsidized by the Government.
"The most vulnerable safety net hospitals will be even more at risk," Mr. Rosen said.
Health officials said that 20 years of rate regulations that do not exist in many other states have left New York City's hospitals operating on the brink of insolvency.
"We may be forced to make changes without adequately thinking through the impact on communities," said Robert Gumbs, executive director of the Health Systems Agency of New York City, a not-for-profit group that tracks health planning information. "It's disastrous."

HEADLINE: U.S., One of the Founders, Is Now Biggest U.N. Debtor

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The United States, which presided over the creation of the United Nations 50 years ago, is joining the big anniversary celebration next week as its most notorious deadbeat.
The United Nations reported that, as of this month, Washington owed about $1.4 billion for regular expenses and peacekeeping. This week the United States sent the United Nations $151 million, reducing its indebtedness to $1.25 billion. 
 A United States official denied that the payment, the first toward this year's regular budget, was timed to deflect criticism of President Clinton at the celebration, but added, "We're pleased that it comes on the eve of President Clinton's visit."
The United States is not the only delinquent, but it remains by far the worst, at the cost of its credibility in pressing the United Nations to reform.
"We are growing tired of U.N.-bashing," the Canadian Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, said in Toronto last month, "and it is especially irritating when it comes from those who are not paying their bills."
Article 19 of the United Nations Charter states that a member state will forfeit its vote if "its arrears equals or exceeds what it owes in contributions for the preceding two years."
At the present rate, the United States could reach that level of indebtedness in 1997, though United Nations officials admit privately that the penalty would be hard to enforce against the organization's most powerful member.
The failure of the United States to pay its assessed share has exacerbated the dire financial straits in which the United Nations finds itself. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the regular budget ran out of cash in August, and that $125 million had to be borrowed from peacekeeping operations by deferring payments owed to troop contributors.
"If the United States paid properly 30 days after the assessments were rendered, we would not be in the state we are today," said Joseph E. Connor, the Under Secretary General for Administration and Management.
A United Nations official who has watched irritation mount over the United States's delinquency said, "clearly, the rest of the membership is fed up."
One chief delegate, Robert Fowler of Canada, recently complained, "We cannot accept that member states, some among the richest countries in the world, evade their financial obligations to this institution."
Unlike the United States Government, the United Nations cannot borrow money or finance its deficit by issuing bonds or other promissory notes.
"We have no capital, we have no reserves," Mr. Connor said. "We are totally dependent on the assessment, totally dependent that members will assess themselves properly."
Tardiness by member nations is hardly new. "Most of the countries in this organization do not pay up on time," said a diplomat from one that does, "but most of them do not aspire to a leadership role."
Of the 15 largest contributors, only Ukraine also owes money to this year's regular budget, about $16 million respectively. Russia, whose economy collapsed after the Soviet Union disintegrated, just paid $20 million to settle its regular assessment, and $61 million toward peacekeeping costs.
When the United Nations was created in 1945, the United States assumed nearly 40 percent of the new organization's expenses, based upon an assessment of countries according to their share of world income. As more nations joined, the American share declined to its current 25 percent of the regular budget. Japan and Germany assumed nearly 14 percent and 9 percent respectively as the next largest contributors. By contrast, China pays only .72 percent.
American indebtedness has burgeoned for several reasons. The United Nations fiscal year coincides with the calendar year, with payments from members due by Jan. 31. But the United States, like many other countries, paid its assessment in fairly regular installments, at least until the 1980's.
This changed with the Reagan Administration, which deprived the United Nations of nine months of payments in 1982 by pushing them into Washington's next fiscal year. American funding has since become so erratic that the director of the Financial Management Office at the United Nations, Susan Mills said, "We don't know what, if anything, we're going to get and when we're going to get it."
Disagreement over the amount owed extends to the United States' share of peacekeeping costs, which the United Nations puts at 31.2 percent. This includes a surcharge apportioned among the five permanent members of the Security Council to compensate for breaks given developing countries. The United States calculated that its peacekeeping share should be just under 30.4 percent. Then Congress cut this back to the 25 percent level used for the regular budget, starting this month.
Congress's repudiation of the surcharge caused sparks on Wednesday in the General Assembly's budget committee. During a discussion of peacekeeping costs for Haiti, the United States delegate said his country would pay only 25 percent. This set off "the diplomatic equivalent of a street brawl," as one observer described it, as other irate delegates demanded a legal ruling, which went against the United States.
The Clinton Administration wants to make fuller payment of its debt contingent upon reform of the United Nations bureaucracy. Today, Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States representative, told other delegates, "Do not let your understandable frustration over the $1 billion my Government now owes the U.N. cloud your judgment as we pursue our common goal: ensuring that the U.N. delivers programs for people, not jobs for bureaucrats."
Now prospects for even that have been reduced by a Republican-led Congress that regards the United Nations with suspicion. When the Clinton Administration asked for $445 million to pay for peacekeeping, the House and Senate committees appropriated only $425 million and $225 million respectively. The final amount is being thrashed out in conference committee.
Ms. Albright asked other delegations to bear in mind "that even though our payments are often late, we have contributed $1 billion over the last year."
She led the budget committee through the Administration's difficulties in coaxing funds from Congress to pay the United Nations. "And we must do so at a time when public spending for all purposes -- foreign and domestic -- is under extreme pressure," she said.

HEADLINE: Both Sides of the Aisle Sense Capital's Unrest

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Many Democrats in Congress are still seething over President Clinton's statement in Houston on Tuesday night that he had raised taxes "too much" in 1993.
At a private meeting of Democratic senators today to plan for next week, one after another spoke out in anger. Among the most upset were Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Jim Exon of Nebraska, according to a Senator who was there. Finally, the Senator said, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, had to cut off the disparaging talk about the President so the senators could get down to business. 
 One Democratic Senator, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, was so irate when he heard about the President's remarks in Houston that he sat down and scribbled out a scathing speech for delivery on the Senate floor in which he accused Mr. Clinton of running for re-election "on a platform of apology" and declared that the President had no "clear vision of where he believes America could and should be going."
By the time he got to the Senate chamber, Mr. Kerrey had cooled off a bit, he said today, and decided not to make such a harsh speech. But his anger reflected a pervasive view among Democrats in Congress that they are being undercut by the President.
After weeks of agonizing, Senator Kerrey cast the decisive vote in 1993 that led to a tie vote in the Senate on the President's budget, which deferred a promised tax cut in favor of reducing the budget deficit. Vice President Al Gore broke the tie, and the law was enacted.
At a news conference on Thursday, the President went out of his way to backtrack from the comment he had made at a political dinner in Houston about raising taxes too much. Mr. Clinton said that he was extremely tired when he gave the dinner speech and that in fact he was proud of his budget and believed it was responsible for the strength of the country's economy today.
But that was not enough to satisfy many Democrats in Congress who have been complaining for months about how the President seemed to be divorcing himself from them. Many were particularly angry earlier this year when Mr. Clinton proposed his own tax cuts and Medicare savings, stealing from the lawmakers, they felt, the best issues they had on which to counter the Republican offensive.
For them, the Houston speech was the last straw. "You can't imagine how seething our people are," Senator Moynihan said in an interview. "You know, we lost the Senate for good, and we did the right thing, we think. The Democratic Party may go the way of the Whigs because we did the right thing."
A congressman who had dinner this week with Thomas S. Foley, the former Democratic Speaker of the House, said that Mr. Foley was close to tears when he talked about Mr. Clinton's remarks in Houston. Mr. Foley led the battle for the Clinton budget two years ago. He was defeated last year in his Washington state race for re-election, as were many others who voted with the President in 1993. Mr. Foley could not be reached this evening at his law office or his home.
Republicans are making the most of this. The Republican National Committee announced today that the party was distributing a 15-second television commercial showing the President saying in Houston, "You think I raised your taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too much, too."
Then, an announcer says, "Republicans agree. That's why we intend to keep our word and give middle-class families a real tax cut."
In the speech he never delivered, Senator Kerrey, who ran against Mr. Clinton in the early Democratic primaries in 1992 and is now chairman of the Democrats' Senate campaign committee, wrote:
"The President of the United States is not going to be returned to office on a platform of apology. He is not going to be returned to office on a platform of blame, and he certainly is not going to be returned to office by doing both at the same time. He will be returned to office only by defending proudly where he has taken the country for the past three years and laying out a vision for where he wants to go for the next four.
"What troubles me is that after three years as President, he doesn't appear to know where he wants to lead America. He is developing some interesting theories about where we have been and where we are, but he doesn't talk consistently about where we should be going. He has a handful of programs for which he is prepared to fight, like national service and Head Start, but even they don't seem to be connected to a clear vision of where he believes America could and should be going.
"He is very clear about where he wants to go -- back to the White House for four more years. But as to the country? Well, that is much less clear."
Mr. Kerrey showed the speech to Senator Moynihan, who gave it to The New York Times. A spokesman for Mr. Kerrey said that the Senator had no objection to the publication of an article about his undelivered speech.
This morning, Mr. Kerrey gave a much tamer speech on the Senate floor in which he said he had been "furious" about the President's statement in Houston and remarked that he had written "a very harsh speech" about it. But the Senator added, "I've calmed down since then."
In today's speech he accused Mr. Clinton of a "triangulation strategy," a term politicians are using to refer to the White House's apparent strategy of creating distance between the President and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
The tactic, Mr. Kerrey declared, is "strangulating" the relationship between Democratic lawmakers and the President.

Mexican Oil Monopoly Pumps Faster These Days

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 20

 BODY:
For years, Mexican Governments have seen Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. as a cash cow, taxing the state-owned oil monopoly so onerously, and at times plundering it so voraciously, that little of its revenue was left to drill new oil wells or maintain the old ones.
As a result, production has stagnated for more than a decade. But earlier this year, President Ernesto Zedillo switched course, approving a request by executives of Pemex, as the state monopoly is known, to increase investment in oil exploration and production. 
 Six months later, the increased investment is resulting in the first significant increases in Mexican production of crude oil and natural gas since the early 1980's. Government and company officials estimate that Pemex will produce more crude oil this year than in any year since 1982, and gas production will reach its highest level since Pemex's founding in 1938.
Pemex is prospering, and its prosperity is no small matter to the United States. The Clinton Administration responded to the peso crisis early this year by arranging $20 billion in loans to Mexico that are secured with oil revenue as collateral. As a result, the better Pemex performs, the more securely the American loans are backed.
Pemex's rising petroleum output could allow Mexico to overtake Venezuela as Latin America's leading oil-producing nation, at least for a short time, making Mexico the sixth-largest producer in the world, after Saudi Arabia, the United States, Russia, Iran and China, some oil-industry experts said. Mexico does not belong to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its growing crude oil output is part of a worldwide pattern of production increases by nonmembers that is dampening OPEC's efforts to increase oil prices.
Mexico's energy minister, Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, said recently that by increasing production, Mexico hoped to make petroleum, figuratively and literally, the fuel to ignite its stalled economy. But the additional export earnings next year are likely to amount to about $1 billion if price and production trends continue, an amount that would not have a powerful influence on Mexico's $375 billion economy, industry experts said.
The surge in output has been especially strong in natural gas, and industry analysts are viewing it as a sign of a heightened Mexican commitment to the natural gas industry.
"This is a welcome sign because it will lend credibility to encourage foreign investment in Mexico's electric power industry and in natural gas pipelines," said George Baker, a consultant based in Oakland, Calif. who studies Mexico's petroleum industry.
The latest increases are a bit of a surprise, since Pemex's production has varied little for more than a decade.
"Oil production has been quite stable," Jorge E. Navarrete, the deputy energy minister, said in an interview. "This is the first important increase for both crude oil and for natural gas in more than a decade."
After Mexico discovered huge petroleum reserves during the 1970's, crude production rose steadily, peaking in 1982, when Pemex pumped an average of 2.75 million barrels a day. But the Government heavily taxes Pemex's revenue and tightly controls its budget, and after plummeting prices of crude oil devastated Mexico's economy, President Miguel de la Madrid in 1983 raised taxes even further as part of a Government-wide austerity program.
By 1993, taxes amounted to fully 94 percent of Pemex's net income, said William L. Durbin, a director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The lack of investment has resulted in more than a decade of stagnation in which Pemex's annual average daily production has fluctuated in a range of about 2.4 million to 2.6 million barrels.
Earlier this year, however, the oil monopoly's new director, Adrian Lajous, persuaded President Zedillo to increase the investment budget by more than 20 percent for the crude oil division, Pemex Exploration and Production, officials said. The injection of new funds has allowed engineers to pursue more advanced crude oil-recovery techniques, including horizontal drilling, on rigs in the Gulf of Campeche, said Rafael G. Quijano, a former Pemex executive who is now a director at the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a Washington consulting firm.
The new techniques did not increase production in the first eight months of this year. But in recent weeks, production from two offshore fields in the Gulf of Campeche surged by a total of about 150,000 barrels a day, Mr. Quijano said.
As a result of these and other rises in output elsewhere, Pemex's daily crude oil production will rise to 2.85 million barrels by December, Mr. Navarrete said.
Over the years, Mexico has exported about half its oil, and Mr. Navarrete said that was unlikely to change much.
The jump in crude oil production amounts to 6 percent, measured from December to December. Mr. Navarrete said it was unlikely that production would rise by as much as 6 percent for a year or more.
Natural gas production will, however, continue to rise more rapidly, by 15 percent or more, he said. That is not only because large quantities of gas are captured in the process of pumping crude oil, but also because Pemex has had spectacular surges in output from gas fields in the Burgos basin, along the Texas border in northeastern Mexico, as well as other increases in Tabasco state in the south, officials said.
Pemex is investing heavily in increased gas production because environmental laws will require that the country's electric-power and industrial plants meet significantly tougher air-emission standards. As a result, the state-owned power utility is converting many of its electricity-generating plants to natural gas from fuel oil, which in Mexico is highly sulfurous.
About half of the fuel burned in Mexican factories and generating plants in 1994 was high-sulfur oil, and only 32 percent was natural gas. By 2005, the Government hopes to reduce the fuel-oil proportion to 19 percent and increase the use of natural gas to 32 percent, according to energy ministry documents.

HEADLINE: On the Road, Clinton Hits Driving Pace He Prefers

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Bill Clinton has always been a man in a hurry and, 13 months before the next election, he is once again running as fast as he can.
On Monday night, he went from Dallas to San Antonio by way of Los Angeles. Today, he noodled on the future at a daylong economic conference at Ohio State University. By Saturday, he will have been in 10 cities in 7 days for an almost uninterrupted string of fund-raising events and political appearances. 
 Out on the open road, buoyed by friendly invited crowds and unbowed by lack of sleep, Mr. Clinton's feverish pace is a reminder that as 1996 approaches, this President remains what he was in 1992: a relentless, resourceful campaigner.
Take the first 72 hours of the week: a speech on foreign affairs on Sunday in Connecticut, followed by an address on race relations in Austin, Tex., on Monday morning, a noontime fund raiser in Dallas and a celebrity-studded antidrug concert in Hollywood on Monday night, then a pep rally in San Antonio and another fund raiser in Houston on Tuesday night.
Mr. Clinton's ability to run in overdrive has often proved less effective in the Oval Office than it did on the way there. Back in Washington, the Republicans control Congress, where they are busy passing bills to dismantle 30 years of Democratic policies and blocking many of Mr. Clinton's policy goals.
The President also proved this week -- with his offhand statement at the Houston dinner, quickly retracted, that he raised taxes too much in 1993 -- that as expounder-in-chief, he is capable of stubbing his own toe, especially when he is tired.
But even Republicans concede that Mr. Clinton's persistence has been paying off lately. He has already raised more than $20 million for his 1996 re-election campaign, a record for a sitting President this early in the cycle, and has scared off any sign of a Democratic challenger. The Republican field remains splintered and spluttering, and the candidate many Democrats most feared, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, has dropped out.
Mr. Clinton's sharper stance in Bosnia, adopted after months of hand-wringing in part because he realized that the Balkan war could become an electoral liability, helped produce a cease-fire and the prospect of peace talks. That development so encouraged the President that he has taken to reciting a whole new stump speech on foreign policy, a topic that once seemed to bore or bedevil him.
And he has rediscovered the power of the bully pulpit at home, putting the Republicans on the defensive with his relentless attacks on their plans to cut growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending, vowing new curbs on teen-age smoking and speaking out on sensitive issues like domestic violence and the lingering racism of blacks and whites in the aftermath of the O. J. Simpson verdict and the Million Man March on Monday in Washington. His poll ratings are hovering near 50 percent, about the highest of his presidency.
"There will be problems in this old world as long as people like you and me inhabit the planet because we're not perfect," Mr. Clinton told campaign contributors at the Dallas luncheon on Monday, referring to the nation's problems in language that could equally apply to his own. "But the issue is, are we gaining on it, are we getting closer every day to living by the values we believe in, to lifting up the potential of every person, to giving everybody the chance to be the kind of person that they ought to be?"
Still, the obstacles remain daunting. Whatever Mr. Clinton's approval ratings, his shaky standing in states like Florida or here in the Rust Belt make it extremely difficult for him to piece together an Electoral College majority in a two-way race. While the consensus view is that a third-party candidacy would help the President by splitting the anti-Clinton vote, Gen. Colin L. Powell might have the opposite effect, drawing some blacks and white liberal supporters the President must retain.
On Thursday, the House passed cuts in the growth of Medicare spending despite Mr. Clinton's vociferous objections. And the Republicans could yet prevail on their priorities for cutting the budget, forcing Mr. Clinton to look weak, by compromising on policies he does not support, or ineffective, by allowing Government gridlock to persist even though he took office vowing to end it.
Finally, the sheer pace of travel and late nights that Mr. Clinton loves to keep could lead him into sloppy mistakes and missteps graver than his oratorical flip-flop on taxes.
Aides said the President slept only a bit more than three hours on Sunday night because he was working on his speech on race relations. By Tuesday, deep pouchy blue bags had puffed out under his eyes -- even more than usual. His restoratives of choice are decaffeinated coffee and caffeine-free Diet Coke, but his real fuel is the roar of a crowd.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged the power of such approbation in his appearance on Tuesday at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. The President had opposed the closing of Kelly, and McClellan Air Force Base in California, this summer, until the chairman of the Federal base-closing commission stipulated that thousands of jobs here could be transferred to the local private sector.
As Mr. Clinton praised the work of Gen. Henry (Butch) Viccellio Jr., the Air Force official overseeing the privatization efforts, some in the crowd of base workers and residents began to applaud.
"Yes, you could clap for him," Mr. Clinton said. And, perhaps thinking of a more famous military man, he went on, "I know generals don't run for office, but they love to hear the applause."
The President's aides, exhausted from trying to keep up with him, continue to marvel at his pace.
"I've never seen anything like it," said his senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos, who is virtually the only top White House aide who traveled constantly with Mr. Clinton in the last campaign. "He'll begin a day, even with very little sleep, and just get more awake. I need three espressos and a good night's rest."
George Bush's top aides unanimously agree that the former President -- flush with popularity from the Persian Gulf war -- made a fatal error in not gearing up his re-election effort more swiftly in the fall of 1991, as concerns about the faltering economy grew and his approval ratings slipped. Mr. Clinton, a devoted student of campaign tactics, has been determined not to repeat that error, just as his 1992 campaign resolved never to let an attack go unrebutted, as Michael S. Dukakis had in 1988.
Since returning from vacation in early September, Mr. Clinton has traveled hard. He stopped in nine cities in four states in one five-day fund-raising swing last month that took him from Pennsylvania to Florida, Colorado and California, the biggest electoral prize of all. He revisited California again on Monday, for the 21st time since taking office.
Tonight, he heads to a Democratic Party fund raiser in Des Moines and the dedication of a museum of Czech and Slovak heritage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Saturday. Other fund-raising events are scheduled for Detroit, New York and Nashville next month to help meet the goal of $30 million by year's end.
As Mr. Clinton returned to Washington from California on his last jaunt, his press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, asked if he intended to keep such a killing pace throughout the coming campaign.
"No," Mr. Clinton said with a smile, nodding his head yes.

Snouts In the Slops

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
From out here in the boondocks, today's Washington seems bizarre. Did you catch the American Medical Association selling Newt Gingrich its vote on Medicare?
The A.M.A. -- that's the doctors' lobby -- came along quietly after Gingrich promised to go easy on cutting Medicare fees for doctors and grant other financial boons. 
 And so what? Nobody familiar with the A.M.A. expects anything of it but an obsession with money for doctors. But lo, behold, and how about that, sawbones fans! -- the A.M.A. is offended by suggestions that Gingrich bought it. The A.M.A., which over the years has paid gazillions to kill every attempt to rehabilitate the country's troubled health- care system -- the A.M.A. resents the suggestion that its honor is forfeit to filthy lucre.
What do lobbyists take us for out here in the sticks?
Gingrich is redistributing the wealth. It is only natural that everybody with a high-powered lobby -- even doctors, noble offspring of Hippocrates though they be -- should fight for a share of the loot.
The spectacle of these huge struggling lobbies summons up memories of "The Last Train From Madrid," of the last helicopter from the embassy roof in Saigon. When the train is leaving the station, when the helicopter is leaving the roof, it is only human for many people to behave swinishly.
Lobbies exist to behave swinishly on behalf of people too delicate to behave swinishly for themselves. Unlike the A.M.A., most lobbies are too worldly to whine when someone notices their snouts in the trough lapping up the slops.
Little news items tucked away far beyond O. J. Simpson and Bosnia tell of lobbies saving their places at the trough despite tales painting Gingrich as the demon hog-starver of Capitol Hill.
The sugar lobby has escaped a cut in its infamous sugar subsidy. The tobacco lobby still prospers even as the Government spends money to control tobacco-related diseases. The entire farm lobby is apparently untouched despite, or maybe because of, the fact that a high percentage of farm subsidies now go to giant agribusiness corporations.
It is unmanly these days to express dismay for the Republican plan to use life's losers to balance the budget, and heaven save us all from indulging in such bleeding-heart sentimentality.
From out in the sticks though, where all we know is what we read in the papers, it seems nutty that Republicans should be so zealous to put the boot into widows and orphans, the halt and the lame as it were, while excusing doctors, Tobacco World and assorted other farm corporations from putting shoulders to the wheel. Isn't this a patriotic endeavor to save the economy?
Gingrich is not the only man here who seems deep in fantasy. How about Mister President? Bill Clinton. He's a Democrat, whatever that means, besides brain-dead.
He is expected to run for re-election and, if the newspapers are right, which they frequently aren't, he may be the only Democrat who will be elected to anything next year.
Newspapers report Democrats leaving the party en masse. "Like rats from a sinking ship" is the cliche. It may be significant that present-day Washington lends itself to animal metaphor: hogs at the trough, rats fleeing the ship. Animals are the stuff of fables, and historians may look back on this age in Washington as a time of fabled absurdity.
Besides those Democrats who are simply refusing to run for re-election, there are Democrats who hate being Democrats but can't bear the thought of going off the Federal payroll. These Democrats come from the old solid Democratic South which has now become the new solid Republican South. Simple wizardry turns them into instant Republicans with safe, dry berths on an unsinking ship.
Speaking of fantasy, how would you like to see President Clinton run against the Democratic Party next year? Congressional Democrats think that's what he had in mind when, talking to a Houston money crowd, he seemed to blame Democrats for high taxes.
With the party melting away from under him, who knows? He might turn Republican himself. He runs better in the polls than any of the Republican candidates. This would clear the way for Colin Powell to run as a Democrat and return the party to life.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bond Prices Fall on Dollar's Slide and Greenspan's Remarks

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices came under fire from a number of directions yesterday, as the dollar's value slid in world currency markets and investors reacted with concern to a speech on Thursday night by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Greenspan's comments at the Economic Club of Chicago caused some investors to worry that interest rates would not be cut anytime soon. As a result, some traders sold holdings when trading opened yesterday to lock in recent gains. 
 The 30-year Treasury bond fell 24/32 , to 10628/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, reached 6.36 percent, up from 6.30 percent on Thursday. The yield was also up 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, for the week.
With little economic news to clear up the policy debate, comments from Fed officials have taken on greater importance, traders say.
On Thursday, a Fed governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, told Market News Service that he felt inclined to ease credit further, and the market promptly rallied. But it reversed direction yesterday, after weighing Mr. Greespan's remarks.
Foreign-exchange weakness and the budget battle in Washington added to concern.
Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at ASB Capital Management, a Washington firm that manages $6 billion in bonds, said the market was driven by two factors this week -- "its response to economic data and in the background its response to the international and domestic political economy."
He said recently released statistics suggested economic strengthening, giving the market a clue as to what it might expect next Friday when third-quarter gross domestic product is first estimated.
The economic figures this week included an unexpectedly large jump of four-tenths of 1 percent in business inventories for August, reported on Monday; analysts were expecting one-tenth of a percent. On Wednesday, the Government said the trade deficit for August shrank more than expected, to $8.8 billion, because of strong export growth. On Thursday, a survey of regional business activity by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed little change in October from a fairly strong level a month earlier.
Mr. Carpenter said the yield on the 30-year bond did not fall any lower than the 6.28 percent reached on Tuesday "because money market economists and bond managers saw little chance that the central bank would lower the Federal funds rate" at next month's policy meeting, "especially if that meeting occurred on the heels of what is likely to be a 2.75 percent reported growth rate for the third quarter."
Issues in the domestic and international political economy have also created background turmoil for the market.
Mr. Carpenter said the debate between the Clinton Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress on debt-ceiling legislation "is an obvious source of uncertainty."
"In the international arena," he said, "the indication that the Fed had for some time been engaged in strategizing and fashioning what may eventually amount to a bailout of the Japanese banking system has caused a lot of concern among bond holders." He said these investors "theorize that the bond market would be swamped with additional U.S. Treasury bond supplies released by Japanese banks in exchange for U.S. dollar liquidity provided by the Fed."
Next week, the market focus will be on Friday's figures on real gross domestic product and their implications for monetary policy, Mr. Carpenter said. Traders will also consider two other economic reports. On Wednesday, statistics on existing-home sales are expected to show a decline of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent for September, Mr. Carpenter said. On Thursday, the report on orders for durable goods is expected to show a drop of 1 percent to 1.5 percent, he added.
Weekly unemployment insurance claims are expected to stay in a range of 355,000 to 360,000, a level "which equates to economic malaise," Mr. Carpenter said.
In when-issued trading, the new two-year note to be auctioned on Tuesday was being offered at a price to yield 5.72 percent, and the five-year note at a price to yield 5.87 percent.

HEADLINE: A Noncandidate, Bradley Plans an Issue-Oriented Trip

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Senator Bill Bradley announced today that he planned to travel to California next week to listen to people "and try to figure out if some of my ideas about where people are, are correct."
When the New Jersey Democrat announced in August that he would not run for a fourth term in the Senate, he said he was considering an independent Presidential candidacy. Asked today if his travels were preliminary to a run for the White House, he said, "This is not about a candidacy -- at this time." He continued, "But it is about trying to reconnect the political process to people's lives." 
 Mr. Bradley, interviewed in his office here, said he had three main ideas he wanted to discuss in more than a dozen stops on Monday and Tuesday. He said he wanted a serious dialogue "that gets to the deeper level of the racial issue."
He said, "Unless we can find a way to deal with this issue, we will not be able to move the country forward."
He said Americans had to face "rising economic insecurity that makes any attempt by a politician to reach them suspect." He called corporate America "ruthless," "insensitive" and "short-sighted" as "economic forces take over and disrupt our lives."
But, he said, "these things are not going to be dealt with until we have fundamental campaign reform." He said his approach, which many scoffed at, would require a Constitutional amendment to overcome a Supreme Court decision that allowed candidates to spend as much as they want.
Mr. Bradley proposed allowing individuals to make campaign contributions of about $500 but requiring the donations to be distributed equally among all candidates, regardless of the donor's party, and "that's all the money" that could be spent. That would mean much less money would be available, he said, but if candidates could not buy "30-second spots to attack their opponent's character," the public would not lose anything important. He said candidates would find other ways to make themselves known.
He said only in-state contributions should be allowed in Senate races, and was not sure whether House contributions should be restricted to the specific Congressional district or the state.
He said the main thing wrong with the financing of the Presidential campaign was that it gave short shrift to independents.
The money mess, he said, is not a problem especially "as a corrupting element, although there is some, but it's a distracting force that people are forced to consider" and an enormous drag on politicians' time just to raise it.
Lesser solutions, like tighter controls on existing sources of money, would not work, he said, because "money in politics is like gnats in your kitchen."
"They are either all out or they will find their way in."
He acknowledged that he did not have the same sort of specific proposals to deal with the racial and economic problems he wanted to see on the table for discussion.
But he said that in the context of the O.J. Simpson's acquittal on murder charges and the Million Man March in Washington, thinking about race relations was too heavily focused on immediate issues, not on "how you create a spiritually transformed community in which reconciliation is possible."
Most politicians avoid serious discussions of race, Mr. Bradley contended, for fear of "saying the wrong thing."
As to economic problems, he said there was a serious question whether the latest technological revolution, like previous ones, would end up producing more jobs. He said there were 90 million repetitive jobs in the nation that were at risk, and millions of people "clawing to stay middle class."
A focus on these concerns, he said, was essential "to recommit the political process to people's lives." And before that could happen, he said, people had to discard the Republican idea that "government is the problem."
Only Government, he said, "can balance private power," and insure such essential reforms as making pensions truly portable from one job to another, or requiring employers to maintain health insurance for a year or two on workers they dismiss.
Asked if he might launch a Presidential campaign as a way to get greater attention for his ideas, he demurred. "I think you run for President to win," he said, "not to popularize an idea."
The point of this trip, he said, is "to go out and talk to people and see what's on their minds."
Next week's trip to San Francisco, Los Angeles and the Silicon Valley area near San Jose will include stops at churches, schools, homes and civic organizations. He said his future travel plans extended beyond California but, "they don't include Iowa or New Hampshire," the sites of the first caucus and first Presidential primary.

HEADLINE: Rich or Poor, More Russian Mothers Go It Alone

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The collapse of the Soviet state has changed everything in Russia -- except the relationship between the sexes. Expectations are low, but divorce rates remain high and the numbers of single mothers, either divorced or never married, keep growing.
Yelena Polyakovskaya, 32, has two small children, by two fathers, and never really expected either man to stay or help her financially. 
 "People tell me I'm so strong, such a heroine," she said of her struggle to hold down a demanding job as a television reporter while raising children.
"I'm not strong. It's our men who are weak. They seem to have no sense of responsibility at all."
In a trend that is as unmistakable to sociologists and social workers as it is distressing, millions of maids, factory workers and university professors alike have grown inured to raising their families without men. Instead they have come to rely on mothers, sisters and aunts in the kind of matriarchal society -- and downward spiral of poverty and limited horizons -- that in the United States has become a hallmark of the poorest urban areas.
Here, however, paternal absence and neglect is a reality shared widely by Russian women, regardless of background, aspirations or income.
"As I understand it, in the United States, single mothers are mostly teen-agers with very low education," said Marina Kiyenya, 35, a professor of Spanish who started a support group here five years ago for single mothers like herself. "Most of our single mothers have a university degree, some are very active in their professions."
She, too, detects something deeply wrong with the way men and women relate in her country. "Seventy years of Soviet rule taught men to be selfish and passive," she said. "The biggest problem I see is the total lack of responsibility of our men."
Even in Communist days, the unhappiness of Russian families was hard to hide. The divorce rate in the 1970's was 46 percent (now it is 51 percent) and alcoholism, though never officially quantified, was blamed.
Communism gave women the right, and necessity, to work as equals, but a notion of male superiority clung despite 70 years of official propaganda.
Women worked at their jobs, then did nearly all the housework and child-raising. Men did not help, and were not expected to help. They were expected to drink, and they did.
Sociologists blamed Soviet life, its regimentation, oppression and lack of individual freedom, for men's alcoholism and apathy to work and family.
Nowadays, many people blame democracy, or rather, the economic free fall many Russians find themselves in, for those same things.
"There is so much economic uncertainty and real fear," Ms. Kiyenya said. "Men feel humiliated that they cannot provide for their families, and they just walk away."
With a bitter laugh, she said her own story was typical. "When I got pregnant," she explained "my boyfriend promised to marry me, then he changed his plans and disappeared."
He lives in Moscow but never sees their 10-year-old daughter and provides no support, she added.
One thorn of Russian society is that while single mothers complain of isolation and social disapproval, men who abandon their families -- or even several families -- do not appear subject to much censure.
"Its a strange thing, but fathers who don't pay child support are not ill favored by public opinion," said Aleksandr Sinelnikov, a researcher at the State Institute of the Family.
"His friends say that it is her own fault for throwing him out. And if a mother goes to the police to try and force him to pay up, well, police officers are men, and they tend to side with the father."
Ms. Polyakovskaya lives with her 6-month-old baby, relying on friends and baby sitters to watch Aleksandr when she is at work.
The father, an unmarried journalist, has never seen his child. Her 6-year-old son, Simeon, is being raised by his grandmother and great-grandmother in Kiev. Ms. Poliakovskaya says she hopes to bring him to Moscow, but cannot even afford train fare to visit him.
She loves her job covering music and ballet, but it is ill paid. In her bare one-room apartment, she sleeps on a tiny, fold-out couch next to the baby's crib. An ironing board serves as a desk. But like many women raising children alone, she said she does not want to marry again.
"My life is difficult," she said, "but God, if I had to come home from work and clean, cook and iron for a husband who keeps telling me I am doing it wrong, it would be even worse."
Russians can be wildly romantic, but few seem to harbor much sentimentality about marriage.
Nina Vasiliyeva, 40, a single mother who is twice divorced, runs a matrimonial agency for Russian women seeking American husbands. Called Russian Romance, the agency matches American men who seek traditional wives with Russian women who want a dependable husband.
There are dozens of such agencies in Russia today, many of which use high-tech tools of the mating game, like computer match-ups, electronic mail, and videocasettes.
"American men are more polite, they don't drink as much, and they accept responsibility for their families," Ms. Vasiliyeva said of her American clients' reputation among her Russian clients, many of whom are single mothers who despair of finding a reliable husband here.
So does Ms. Vasiliyeva. She left her first husband after he became the leader of his local Communist Party organization and he began acting like a tyrant at home. She divorced the father of her son, an unemployed alcoholic, after he went to jail for drug dealing.
In addition to her matrimonial agency, which she runs out of her apartment, she works as an office manager in a French photo agency, and makes $1,300 a month, enough to raise her 5-year-old son and pay her husband's $250 monthly rent -- the price she pays to keep him at bay.
A teacher turned business executive, Ms. Vasiliyeva said says women are adapting better to Russia's new market economy than most men.
"In Soviet times, our men had it easy," she explained. "They went to work, but they didn't have to work hard, they put in two hours and spent the day smoking, drinking and playing chess, then came home and lay on the sofa. Women did everything else. We were already used to working hard. Men are having problems because nobody wants to pay you for doing nothing anymore."
Demographers at the State Institute of the Family who have studied a 1994 microcensus, estimate that 15 to 20 percent of all Russian families are run by a single parent, and that 94 percent of those parents are women, either widowed, divorced or never married.
The numbers of single mothers are not significantly higher than those in Western and Eastern Europe and are far lower than in the United States, where sociologists estimate that 27 percent of mothers are single.
What distinguishes single mothers in Russia is that they come in all ages and evenly span the social spectrum.
Some sociologists, like Mr. Sinelnikov, say single mothers are not much worse off than married ones because so many single mothers (31 percent) live with their mothers or relatives and rely on them for assistance.
At the Center for Gender Studies in Moscow, Olga Zdravomyslova dryly disagreed. "The women we surveyed don't want to live with their mothers -- its just that they have no choice," she said.
Ms. Zdravomyslova worked on a study begun in 1991 comparing single mothers in Russia to those in Eastern and Western Europe, and found that the plight of Russian women was different.
Half the single mothers in countries like Switzerland were living with boyfriends. Only 5 percent in Russia had found a new partner.
"They are not just legally single -- they are absolutely alone," she said.
The study also found that Russian fathers had far less contact with their children than those in any other country. "We found there was almost no relationship at all," she said.
Russian divorce law does not allow for joint custody. Child support payments, while required by law, are difficult to collect, and increasingly, given the nature of Russia's free-market economy, men can better hide their real income from tax collectors and ex-wives.
Ms. Kiyenya, the professor, said it was better to be a single mother than a divorcee.
"I still get a Government stipend, even though it is only $12 a month," she said. "I could never drag that out of an ex-husband."
But many single mothers in Moscow, including Ms. Polyakovskaya, the television reporter, do not have residency permits and cannot apply for welfare. Parliament is drafting a new law aimed at providing deadbeat fathers with more flexible child support payments. But few expect the Government to make a dent in so deeply rooted a social problem.
"We must help ourselves, " Ms. Kiyenya said firmly.
"If our children's fathers don't want to help us, why would the state want to do it?"

HEADLINE: Facing Charges, NATO Head Steps Down

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The NATO Secretary General, Willy Claes, resigned bitterly today, a day after his former Belgian parliamentary colleagues voted to let prosecutors charge him in a bribery scandal over defense contracts signed when he was a Belgian Cabinet minister in the late 1980's.
Angrily insisting that he was "totally innocent," Mr. Claes said in Brussels this afternoon that he was resigning for the good of the 16-nation alliance after eight months of trying to do a difficult job and defend himself at the same time. "Nobody can deny that I no longer have enough credibility to insure the leadership of the alliance," he said. "Is there another word than 'political murder?' " 
 On both sides of the Atlantic, governments agreed that Mr. Claes (pronounced klahss) had done the right thing by leaving. And they began looking for a successor to help guide the alliance through the complexities of taking on a huge peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and taking in new members from Central Europe without reviving the divisions of the cold war.
"On paper, the NATO Secretary General has no real power except to conduct meetings," one diplomat said, "but the reality is that he plays a key part in the decision making and, if he is good, he can influence things enormously."
Francois Heisbourg, a former director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said the Secretary General could "suggest compromises, float ideas, and influence the debate and direction of the alliance."
"This is very important today, because NATO still doesn't have a clue about its reason for being in the wake of the cold war," Mr. Heisbourg said.
Mr. Claes's predecessor was Manfred Worner of Germany, who died of cancer in August 1994.
Mr. Worner pushed for NATO to use air power to bolster United Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. Mr. Claes, with strong support and encouragement from the United States, shepherded the alliance into crucial decisions to lay out a blueprint for future expansion into Eastern Europe and to plan a 50,000-member peacekeeping force in Bosnia to replace the United Nations after a peace settlement is achieved.
His successor, diplomats say, will have the crucial task of helping to define a new security role for the alliance, and by implication for the United States, in what could be a highly unstable 21st-century Europe.
Most of the NATO leaders will be in New York City this weekend for ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, but they are not expected to decide on a successor that soon.
No American has held the job since the alliance was formed in 1949, since American generals and admirals have always held its top military posts. Candidates from France and Spain, which are not full members of NATO's military structure, are also unlikely to be considered.
Diplomats say that former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain could have the job in a minute, but he said today that he was not interested. "It may need some days to make sure they've got the best man or the best woman to do it," said Mr. Hurd, who only recently took a job with National Westminster Bank in London. His successor in the Foreign Office, Malcolm Rifkind, has also been mentioned as a possibility.
Defense Minister Volker Ruhe of Germany ruled himself out, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today, "No German candidate is available."
Former Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands is in the running, but Mr. Kohl vetoed him last year as head of the European Union's executive Commission because of his less-than-enthusiastic attitude toward German unification, and NATO picks its civilian leaders by consensus.
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway has been mentioned, but Norway does not belong either to the European Union or to its military arm, the Western European Union, and diplomats from other member countries say that probably rules her out.
Former Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen of Denmark, on the other hand, makes no bones about wanting the job. "The post as Secretary General is so important that I could not say no if there was a chance that I could get it," Mr. Ellemann-Jensen said in a statement.
Unlike members of Denmark's present Government, Mr. Ellemann-Jensen has not been vocally critical of France's resumption of underground nuclear testing in the Pacific, which could make him a compromise candidate acceptable to the French.
Mr. Claes was Belgium's Economic Affairs Minister in 1988 when his Dutch-speaking Socialist Party was accused of taking $1.72 million in kickbacks from the Italian aircraft manufacturer Agusta S.p.A. in exchange for agreeing to a $267-million contract to build 48 helicopters for the Belgian Army. Investigating magistrates from the Belgian High Court are also investigating charges that the French defense company Dassault paid a $2 million bribe to the party for a contract to modernize F-16 and Mirage jet fighters in 1989.
Prosecutors have indicated that they will charge Mr. Claes with corruption, fraud and forgery, because they say, he knew about the bribes but testified that he did not.
The investigations started after a former leader of the French-speaking branch of the Socialist Party was found slain in Liege in 1991. Three ministers from that party have since resigned as the scandal burgeoned, and a former chief of the air force committed suicide last March.
Mr. Claes appeared before the full Belgian Parliament on Thursday to defend himself, but members voted 97 to 52 to lift his parliamentary immunity from prosecution.
Secretary of Defense William J. Perry said today, "I believe that NATO will probably move very quickly and very effectively to restore new leadership." The post will be filled in the interim by Mr. Claes's Italian deputy, Sergio Balanzino.

HEADLINE: Farewell to a Mill That Shaped the Modern City

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa., Oct. 18

 BODY:
The George Washington Bridge came from here. So did the basic structure of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the Chase Manhattan Building, Madison Square Garden, the Metropolitan Opera House and the Time & Life Building.
All were built from steel made and shaped at the Bethlehem Steel Company's mill here on the banks of the Lehigh River. In fact, the single-piece H-shaped girder -- the building block of skyscrapers -- was first produced here in an early 20th-century financial gamble for technology that was as daring for its time as the latest silicon chip plants are today. 
 "If we go bust, we'll go bust big," Charles M. Schwab, the president of Bethlehem, remarked a few years after the turn of the century as he was raising millions of dollars for the experimental plant.
[On Friday, the last red-hot heavy-duty beam was pounded and rolled into shape. The old heavy-duty beam mill then fell silent.]
In a few weeks, the last blast furnace and related equipment will be shut down and basic steelmaking will cease in this valley for the first time since 1873.
When it does, a way of life that has long been in decline will come to an end. "My father and grandfather worked here," said Mike Martin, a supervisor at the mill. "This place has a history and a soul that the new mills do not."
It is the kind of place where a man with two levers controls a 20,000-horsepower steam engine that drives the steel through rolls weighing six to seven tons to squeeze it into shape. For all the force involved, it is a surprisingly delicate job.
"If he waits until the bar is fed in to start the rolls, he's likely to stall the engine," said Bill Wilde, the senior supervising engineer for the mill and a second-generation steelmaker. "But if he starts it too soon, its likely to be moving too fast and may break the bar."
There will be no more bars. Mr. Wilde will be moving on to a small finishing-steel operation, which will remain to shape smaller beams from steel imported from Steelton, Pa. But for most of the 1,800 workers facing shutdown, their time with Bethlehem is over.
Company officials described the closings -- which were announced nearly a year ago -- as a rational adjustment to an economy that is not building many of the tall office buildings that require the jumbo beams. "Companies today are decentralizing," said Timothy Lewis, the manager of Bethlehem's structural operations. "You don't need Sears Towers anymore."
Prodded, they will concede that the rise of efficient mini-mills, like those operated by the Nucor Corporation and the Chaparral Steel Company, has made it difficult for older companies to compete in a market where price is paramount.
The new mills rely on many fewer workers and a simpler production process than the old companies. They also do not carry the heavy health care and pension expenses that traditional steelmakers do.
"There are many companies capable of supplying this product," Curtis H. Barnette, Bethlehem's chairman, said. "We have to make our investments wisely and we decided to put our investment dollars elsewhere." He said the structural division had been unprofitable.
Until Mr. Schwab came along to take a chance on the turn-of-the-century technology with his investment dollars, H-shaped steel beams were riveted together from plates and angles, limiting their strength and the height of the buildings that could be built.
Henry Grey was an English-born inventor who developed a process for rolling wide-flange beams of uniform thickness in the late 1890's. But he was at first unable to persuade any American steel companies to adopt his technology directly.
After a mill was built in Germany and the products from it became successful, Mr. Schwab decided to get into the business. In 1907, he began building the mill. The first beam was rolled in 1908 and a new generation of skyscrapers was designed by engineers and architects who could simply specify the size of the girders they needed. They were called Bethlehem sections.
Steel companies do not rush to replace equipment that can be repaired and Mr. Grey must have been a good engineer; some of the equipment installed in the mill in 1907 was still operating this week.
The single-piece H-beams -- bigger and broader than the better known I-beam -- were a huge economic success and helped build Bethlehem into the nation's second- largest steel company, after United States Steel. Indeed, the company's symbol includes a representation of a wide-flanged beam.
The irony is not lost on the workers. "This mill built Bethlehem Steel," said Radwan Jarrouj, who prefers to be called Ed. "A lot of us are feeling betrayed as a community."
Unhappy feelings aside, the workers were producing steel flat out in the days before the closing. Word that the mill would be shutting down had produced a last-minute flurry of orders.
"They say there are no orders for big beams, but that's all we have been rolling," said Tim Betz, who operated a huge motorized saw that cut the beams to lengths specified by customers. "And we are going to produce the best products we can up until the last minute."

HEADLINE: WORD & IMAGE;
What the Poor Deserve

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL

 BODY:
THE STARK WORD FROM WASHINGTON IS that America's War on Poverty has been totally transformed. It is now a War on the Poor.
If you prefer your news in images, picture a slashed and tattered Safety Net. That was the guarantee of minimal security for the fallen that Ronald Reagan proclaimed forever secure back when he began his assault on the New Deal. 
 Who's to blame? Republican wreckers? Disarmed Democrats? A pandering President? The rich who want to be richer? A callous middle class? The poor themselves? In the view of Prof. Herbert J. Gans, a Columbia sociologist and perceptive critic of American life, almost all the nonpoor must share the blame. Despite the New Deal and what he calls the Great Society's "Skirmish on Poverty," Americans have for much of their history demonized the poor as undeserving shirkers and cheats. And after poring over the literature, journalism and scholarship about poverty, he is especially critical of wordsmiths and image makers for spreading stereotypes that stigmatize the poor and question their morality and values.
Gans deserves notice. Besides being historically informed, he is downright prescient. Little did he know when he sent his new book, "The War Against the Poor," to the printer early this year, that by the time it was published there would be in motion in Congress: 1) a major reduction in Federal appropriations for Medicaid, the medical insurance program for the poor; 2) not only a reduction in Federal assistance to poor families with dependent children but rescission of the welfare program's 60-year-old guarantee that when all else fails, their Government would be there with a modest subsistence payment, and 3) most startling of all, a significant contraction of the earned-income tax credit, a 20-year-old program of modest tax rebates to the working poor, which President Reagan called "the best antipoverty, the best profamily, the best job-creation measure to come out of Congress."
Gans demonstrates that a part of the war against the poor is always a "war of words -- or of pejorative labels -- that stereotype, stigmatize and harass the poor" as undeserving. His most recent example: "the underclass."
The term was adapted 30 years ago from the Swedish underklass and hyphenated to "under-class" by Gunnar Myrdal, Gans reports -- but only to describe an economic grouping, the underprivileged. As the hyphen was lost, he shows, the term acquired a behavioral connotation and was applied to all kinds of people: street criminals, addicts, hustlers, alcoholics, drifters, the homeless, the mentally ill, welfare recipients, school dropouts, delinquents, residents of "the projects," illegal immigrants, teen-age gang members.
Most deplorably, Gans observes, the underclass (with its hint of an underworld) is presumed to have rejected commonly accepted values. Its men are assumed to be lazy or unable to learn the importance of work; if they wanted to work, jobs would exist for them. Its women are imagined to have an unhealthy and immoral taste for early sex and for having babies as adolescents. All are presumed in need of discipline to cure their "dependence" on welfare or their antisocial activity.
"I argue instead," Gans writes, "that the causes of these behaviors, when they do occur, are in fact usually poverty-related effects; that sometimes poor people are driven by the effects of poverty to actions that violate their own morals and values . . . because poor people lack the funds, the economic security and sometimes the social supports and emotional strength to behave in mainstream ways."
Why do Americans scapegoat the poor and treat them more harshly than most advanced societies do? Here Gans can only speculate. Perhaps it helps Americans to postpone politically difficult and costly measures to enlarge the economy and create more work. The millions of jobless poor people now outnumber job vacancies by at least 6 to 1, he notes, and the "downsizing" of staffs and "outplacing" of work continues. And, he wonders: Does the scapegoating actually assist society by keeping people out of the work force?
Gans pleads with scholars to shift their research from mere analysis of the poor to the unseen social forces that "decide" that a part of the population will end up poor -- the economy's preference in workers, the behavior and biases of employers, the conditions that create and maintain inequalities.
He also implores the media to debunk the stereotypes in news and entertainment. He asks that we distinguish between harmful and merely divergent conduct. He asks that we demonstrate how much our poor forebears, too, were stereotyped. He asks that we show "why poor people cannot always act like better-off people and how much their life consists of coping with frequent crises and trying to obtain the security" that mainstream conduct requires.
IS AMERICA'S DISCOURSE REALLY SO distorted, so cruel? I have encountered poignant inquiries into the lives of the poor, though mostly on public television, in The Times and a few other major papers, but hardly enough to counteract the flood of stigmatizing street crime in films and on television. Only rarely do American artists and journalists probe the deeper questions that Gans raises: Is morality really an attribute of class? Are poor muggers less deserving than the manufacturers of defective products who buy their way out of trouble? And if a poor mother who spends her days watching television instead of taking care of her child is undeserving, isn't that equally true of the affluent one who shops all day and drags her child along? Does our economic stability require that some fraction of the population be kept in poverty?
Gans concludes his dense treatise with a program of sorts that he thinks would relieve poverty in America. He would do everything possible to increase consumer demand to create jobs and labor shortages, to encourage labor-intensive industries, public works, community development. And he would increase welfare payments and tax credits that put money into the hands of the poor, until they can qualify for the housing and other subsidies routinely available to better-off Americans.
Would these proposals sound so radical if the poor were considered deserving -- not just of subsistence but of a decent standard of life? If Gans were wrong about our war and our propaganda against the poor, would it be so shocking to come upon this explosive thought from him: "Education is still held out as the best escape route from poverty, but only if the class structure is not reproduced, so that poor children get the best schools, teachers and equivalents for the preschool preparation more affluent parents can give their children."
The best for the poor? Sounds almost un-American.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: The Other Brill Building;
Empire State Building's Unnoticed Teeny Cousin

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE Brill Building at 49th Street and Broadway was renowned for several decades as the hub of the popular-music business. But there is another Brill building, one that no one seems to notice.
The three-story building rests on an L-shaped site that wraps around the northwest corner of 41st Street and Madison Avenue, and it was probably just luck that it survived the wave of development of the 1980's. 
 The upper floors have been empty for about 10 years, but now a new tenant is moving in, providing some measure of stability for this teeny cousin to the Empire State Building.
Samuel, Max and Maurice Brill entered the clothing business in the 1880's on Cortlandt Street, and became known for evening clothes and livery for butlers and chauffeurs. In 1935 the firm expanded to a three-story building facing 41st Street and jutting out at midblock between the tall office structures at 300 and 310 Madison, at the corners of 41st and 42d Streets.
The blockfront was owned by the Carbide and Carbon Company, which had its headquarters at 310 Madison Avenue and in about 1929 had wanted to build a new skyscraper on the block, to replace 300 Madison Avenue and also the site that in 1935 became the Brill store.
They chose as architects Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, designers of the Empire State Building. In the 1920's Richmond Shreve and William Lamb had transformed the old Beaux Arts firm of Carrere & Hastings into a completely modern practice, emphasizing machine work and careful planning of the building operations. For their Empire State Building, their new partnership of Shreve, Lamb & Harmon precisely coordinated steel deliveries, construction trades and other elements to build with near-scientific precision.
This emphasis on economics endeared the architects to big business, and they gained as clients the biggest American corporations. On the Carbide and Carbon project, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon proposed a slender skyscraper, rendered with dramatic shadows and lighting, a project that never went ahead. It would have looked similar to their office building at 500 Fifth Avenue, at the northwest corner of 42d Street.
The Depression changed the outlook for new construction and in 1931 Carbide and Carbon put up the three-story structure, which the Brill brothers occupied in 1935. In it, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon reworked several elements from their Empire State design.
THE soaring, vertical stainless steel strips of the Empire State Building were laid over much larger horizontal panels. As with their earlier building, the architects gave the Brill interior lush trimmings of black onyx and chromium.
Instead of the limestone of the principal walls of the Empire State Building -- which was meant to melt softly away into the sky -- Shreve, Lamb & Harmon used black brick on the Brill building, which serves much the same purpose, letting the edges fade away into the great shadows of its neighbors, even as the stainless steel facade seems to float off of its black background.
The critic Lewis Mumford liked it, but it was otherwise ignored until the 1970's when the architects Francoise Bollack and Thomas Killian featured it in a lecture series on "everyday masterpieces."
The Brill store went out of business in the 1940's, but it was Samuel Brill who in 1931 built the office structure at the northwest corner of 49th and Broadway that would become synonymous with the music business.
IN the 1960's and 1970's an office supply store, Goldsmith Brothers, was the ground-floor tenant on Madison Avenue.
It appears that in the early 1980's a company headed by Edward A. Strasser bought the Brill building and the surrounding assemblage, paying about $15 million. (Mr. Strasser says there is litigation on the property and declines to comment.)
By that time the plot had grown to 39,300 square feet, including the Brill building, 300 Madison Avenue, 310 Madison Avenue, and 15 and 19 East 41st Street, a potential site for redevelopment, even with two tall buildings to demolish.
Richard McNealus, an architect familiar with the buildings, said he recalled a giant perspective sketch for a futuristic design for the site but no project ever went ahead.
Perhaps because they are possible candidates for demolition, none of the buildings on the site have received the makeover that many midtown buildings got in the 1980's. They generally look tired.
But even soiled the Brill building still looks fresh and crisp -- if you ignore the huge Duane Reade drugstore that has massacred the ground floor architecturally. Above, the stainless steel has only a few dents, and the black brick looks as if it might be 10 years old rather than 60.
Except for those on the second floor of the 41st Street wing, all the windows have been replaced with modern, metal ones, even simpler than the original casements. In some ways that is an improvement; if anything, the original casement windows were the most backward-looking element of the structure.
The architects Tuller McNealus are now refitting the second and third floors of the store for a photographic office. They are not changing any part of the facade, and, at least for the near term, the Brill building will remain to be either enjoyed or ignored.

HEADLINE: The View From: New London;
Where Students Learn to Succeed

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
MICHAEL AITKEN has accomplished what he thought was impossible. The 20-year-old Middlefield resident is preparing to graduate in the spring from Mitchell College, a two-year institution in New London, and plans to continue his studies toward a four-year degree. He is the only one of eight children in his family to attend college.
"I didn't think college was possible for me," said Mr. Aitken, who has dyslexia, a learning disability that makes reading difficult, and who missed five years of public school while his parents attempted to teach him at home. 
 At Mitchell, Mr. Aitken has found help with his reading problem and teachers willing to show him how to study, organize his notebooks and prepare for classes, he said.
"I learned that it isn't as hard as it looks," Mr. Aitken said. "I have more confidence than I had before."
Many students who enroll at Mitchell, a private college, have little self-esteem and are unaccustomed to success. Some, with academic records that are average or below, were overlooked by high school guidance counselors. Others failed at four-year colleges and are getting a second chance.
Classes are small, 15 to 25 students, and after two years of concentrating on their abilities and learning to be more adept at coping with life's problems, 90 percent of Mitchell's graduates go on to four-year colleges.
Mary Ellen Jukoski, who was appointed Mitchell's president last March, summed up her message to students who fear that they may not be bright enough to handle college: "Your past is your past. Forget the baggage you bring with you. You have special talents and gifts. We'll help you discover what your strengths are and how to use them."
Mitchell is emerging from several difficult years of decreasing enrollment, financial troubles and labor conflict. Ms. Jukoski assumed leadership of the college when enrollment was at its lowest level in 18 years. The number of students had dropped to 392 in September 1994, from a peak of 772 in 1967-68.
Mitchell competes for students with nearby institutions like Three Rivers Community Technical College in Norwich and the Avery Point Campus of the University of Connecticut in Groton. As the number of high school graduates has dropped, that competition has gotten tougher. The recent economic recession also threatened Mitchell's future.
Its fortunes seem to have reversed, however, with the recent announcement that total full-time enrollment this year reached 503, a 28 percent increase over last year. The current freshman class is the largest since 1989. The recovery occurred because Mitchell sent out a clearer message about its mission, said Joseph Silvestri, spokesman for the college. Mitchell began last year recruiting students from a larger geographical area, keeping closer contact with prospective students and making a greater effort to invite them to the campus.
Mitchell faces further competition from four-year schools that are accepting students they might not have admitted in the past, said Mr. Silvestri. Seventy-three percent of the 223 colleges and universities in New England had vacancies last May, said Wendy Lindsay, assistant director of regional services for the New England Board of Higher Education.
Mr. Silvestri said: "Ten or 15 years ago, students came here because they couldn't go to a four-year college. Now, Mitchell and the four-year schools are competing for the same students."
But young people who have not yet experienced achievement are Mitchell's priority. The Center for Student Academic Success, opened last January, assigns four people to each student: a resident director, who lives in the dormitory; a career adviser; an academic counselor, and a staff member who tries to make sure that students head off any problems that may cause them to quit school.
Greg Markovich, assistant to Ms. Jukoski and one of the founders of the center, said he remembered what it was like to take the long route to maturity. During his high school years, Mr. Markovich said, he was a poor student. He ran away from an unhappy home several times to live with friends. Although it was years before he graduated from college, the words of his high school coach and his Army sergeant sustained him.
"My coach was after me all the time, telling me I could do it and pushing me to study, because I couldn't play unless I studied," he said. "My Army sergeant had a lot of faith and confidence in me. He told me: 'You have good test scores. Why don't you start focusing?'
"What we are trying to do at Mitchell is create an environment of challenge and support. That's what we're about, taking students and showing them they have the ability to do it."
Mr. Markovich said his goal was to be able to know in three minutes the status of any 20 students, including their studies, career plans and personal growth. He started the Discovery Program this year, described in a newsletter to parents as a program that "works as an insurance policy for your tuition dollars." Discovery assists students who need extra support in choosing an academic major, planning a career, identifying their skills and making important decisions.
"This program will make sure nobody falls through the cracks," Mr. Markovich said.
Amy Dansicker, a freshman from Baltimore, said she was taking advantage of the the one-on-one tutoring available in all academic areas. "In high school, the teachers didn't give their time to help you," she said. "Here, they're willing to give you their time to make you successful."
Her tutor one recent afternoon was Ted Frostad, who teaches mathematics, physics and computer science. A resident of North Stonington, Mr. Frostad retired from the Navy two years ago.
"A common thread I've found among the students is a lack of fundamentals, the building blocks for the skills a college normally tries to hone," he said. "We go back and rebuild that foundation."
Success is a word Mr. Markovich uses repeatedly when describing Mitchell's approach. "Students today have problems far greater than they did in the 60's," he said. "At that time, they had a passionate desire to know they could make a difference and change society. In the 90's, they feel desperation, and their attitude is fatalistic. They need a positive attitude."
Freshmen who failed to win scholarships in high school are eligible for competitive merit scholarships based not on past performance but on the future. Awards of $1,000 to $2,000 are given to freshmen who demonstrate potential in leadership, community service, academics or who have a special talent.
"Sometimes it's the only award they've ever received," Mr. Markovich said.
Small but significant events on campus are celebrated. On Moving Up Day, which takes place on Parents' Weekend, freshmen are honored for having gone through the rituals that signify the beginning of college. They survived the first weeks of living away from home and are part of a college community. They have taken a college quiz. They have roommates.
Aaron Wilson of Stamford, in his second year at Mitchell, said he found it better to start off slowly and work his way up to a four-year school. Mr. Wilson, who has a learning disability, is studying computer science and plans to be a programmer or systems analyst.
His caution has apparently paid off. Along with the friends he has made, Mr. Wilson is proudest of the fact that he overcame his fear of speaking out and asking for help. "Just because you have a learning disability doesn't mean you're any slower or any better than anyone else," he said.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.;
23 Towns, and 1,000 Workers, Brace for a World Without Jamesway

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: ROXBURY

 BODY:
It was a week of seemingly endless bad news for the loyal customers and employees of the Jamesway store in the Ledgewood Mall here.
On Monday, the store said it would no longer accept personal checks, American Express charges, refunds, exchanges, layaways, or competitive markdowns. On Tuesday, the store announced that the weekly bingo game for the elderly would be discontinued. And on Wednesday, the parent company filed for bankruptcy for the second time in two years because of weak sales, operating losses and tight credit. 
 Now, the Jamesway Corporation, based in Secaucus, is expected to hold "going out of business" sales and decide soon whether to close its 90 stores, 23 of them in the state -- a move that would put more than 1,000 New Jerseyans out of work, including the 70 employees here.
Many employees and customers are bracing for the worst.
"Yes, I've heard about their problems," said Bridget Brennan, a Hopatcong resident who was buying a Jurassic Park Halloween outfit on Wednesday with her young son, James. "I would definitely miss it if it closed because it's very convenient and they have good brands, quality merchandise, and good prices."
Jamesway, which has been here for 17 years, is not the only discount department store around. But it is an important one in this and many other communities as a one-stop-shopping destination, a point of reference, a known quantity.
"Jamesway was a small regional discount department store, well-run, well-liked, that served its community well and had a good image," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a forecasting firm in Scotch Plains. "But the company failed to keep up with the competition, failed to keep up with the changes in consumer taste, and the unfortunate end, I think, is at hand. It's sad."
Jamesway's troubles are nothing new. Other regional discount stores have struggled in face of cutthroat price competition from other retailers, particularly bulk-sale giants like Costco and ever-expanding national chains like Wal-Mart and Target. Jamesway is the third East Coast retailer to seek bankruptcy protection in the just last few months; the Caldor Corporation filed in September, and Bradlees Inc. did it in June.
Jamesway was founded in 1960 by Herbert Fisher in Jamestown, N.Y. and at one point had 122 stores in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. The Roxbury store has been around since 1978, a staple of the local economy and an anchor for dozens of stores that have come and gone in a mall that has had its hard times. It is common around here to speak of the Ledgewood Mall as "the one with the Jamesway," to distinguish it from the Roxbury Mall down the street.
"It's like a family, especially with the customers you see all the time," said an employee who has been with the store since 1978. "Sometimes they give you gifts at Christmas because you've helped them out. Even when I shop in other places, they'll stop me and say hello."
But as Mr. Fisher fell into declining health, so did the company. In July 1993, three months after he died, the company filed for bankruptcy. It closed several stores when it emerged from bankruptcy in December 1994 with a $115 million line of credit. Then, on Oct. 12, Jamesway dismissed 200 employees, including several top executives, from its Secaucus headquarters. The next day, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in Jamesway stock; it was trading at 56 1/4 cents a share, down from a 52-week-high of $4.25.
At the Roxbury store last week, none of those numbers filtered through; the only things that mattered were the "All Sales Final" signs and the determined faces of the employees, dressed in their red top and khaki or black bottom uniforms.
Customers and neighbors reflected on what Jamesway meant to them. They recalled the weekly bingo games on Tuesdays, which would be held on the jewelry counter and draw up to 75 elderly people who receive free coffee and doughnuts (and a chance at a $5 gift certificate). But Tuesday was the last bingo game, and the last time elderly customers could receive a 10 percent discount.
They talked about the big sales and weekly circulars. But they noticed the bold-face signs declaring the store's new policy, effective Oct. 16: no rain checks, no store credits.
"Oh God, no," said Denise Bulka of Allamuchy, a regular here for eight years. "I hope they don't close. I have to come here every week -- I get my laundry detergent, my black nail polish, my stockings."
And Linda Eble, a Stanhope resident who arrived with her two children just before the store opened at 9 A.M., said:
"It's automatic: you know what you're going to get. If this store closed, it's not like it would be this or nothing else, but I would be sad."
There are other shopping options in this exurban area of Morris County, including the Caldor's down the street and the Ames store in Flanders. But with several stores already vacant in the Ledgewood Mall, Jamesway's departure would add pressure on the existing anchors, Stern's and Marshall's, to pick up the slack.
"Jamesway brought a lot of traffic into the mall, and the community must have liked them from what I understand," said David Dondona, manager of W. Kodak Jewelers, just a few shops down in the mall. "Any store that leaves the mall, that hurts."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
A Long Way From Leningrad

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
WHEN Alla Rosenfeld immigrated to the United States from Leningrad seven years ago, her friends in what was then the Soviet Union freely tossed her advice: Forget about drawing. Forget about teaching art history. In America, art history doesn't exist. Be practical. Learn bookkeeping.
"No," Ms. Rosenfeld would insist. "I will give lectures on Russian art history." 
 Among the possessions she packed, in the few suitcases she was allowed to take with her, were 200 slides of Russian art and icons she had used in at Soviet academy classes. "The customs people were laughing," she said, recalling her departure.
Since her arrival, she has not had to wait on tables or bother with double-entry ledgers. As she promised herself, she has earned her living teaching art history. And three years ago, she collided with a job so right that had it been love, it would have been the making of a Rodgers and Hammerstein song: she became the curator for Russian and Soviet art at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University.
Her hiring was one serendipity among many in the ferreting out and buying, the transporting and the displaying of the Norton and Nancy Dodge Collection of Nonconformist Art From the Soviet Union, which opens to the public today. On view is a sampling of about 300 artworks from a total of 12,000 in the Dodge Collection, all of which will be permanently housed and exhibited at the Zimmerli.
The story behind the acquisition of these renegade artworks, created from 1956 to 1986, when glasnost and perestroika meant that artists could once again paint what they wanted, is as unlikely as a James Bond movie plot. It involved the passion of Mr. Dodge, a walrus-mustached professor of economics from Maryland described by friends as resembling an unmade bed, according to John McPhee, who chronicled his story in his recent book "The Ransom of Russian Art." The art Mr. Dodge discovered in a series of trips to the Soviet Union over 30 years represents the secret work of a generation of artists all over the country.
He found it in cramped, pipe-lined attics and smuggled it out, sometimes rolled in carpets, a vast array of art of various styles and topics created in secrecy and seen, if at all, only by friends. The art was so illegal that the artists could be, and sometimes were, imprisoned for making it.
Ms. Rosenfeld and Jeffrey Wechsler, a Brooklyn native and Rutgers graduate who has worked at the Zimmerli for 20 years and is now its assistant director for curatorial affairs, organized the show. It took about two years to select and organize the huge assortment of paintings, sculptures and video art. The curators divided the forbidden art into categories: religious, abstract, hyperrealism (including paintings accurately depicting gloomy scenes), performance-art photos and Sots art, which parodies the only official art of the Soviet era, Socialist Realism, with its depictions of happy workers, war victories and noble politicians.
Ms. Rosenfeld, 35, was too young in the 1960's to know about the boiling but lidded art scene in Leningrad, since renamed St. Petersburg, then as now the most cultured and Westernized of Russian cities. Her talent was recognized early. She began taking art classes in fifth grade and went on to study graphic design at the Leningrad academy of fine arts.
At 18, she met her future husband, Alexander, a dissident engineer who was Jewish. Ms. Rosenfeld, who knew almost nothing of her own Jewish heritage, said she had experienced some nasty anti-Semitic remarks at school and on the street, although this never held her back professionally. Through her husband, she met Jews and others unhappy with Soviet life. "I read books prohibited, at night, when no one would see you," she said. "I went to a seder. No one I knew had heard of seders. It was clandestine activity. Exciting, yes. I was young."
She also saw nonconformist art. By the mid-1970's, it could be shown in rented spaces, even though it was still illegal and unthinkable to display it in an official museum or gallery. "You could freely see; you wouldn't go to prison," she said. She had her first look at Surrealism and abstract art. She came away confused, sometimes shocked: "I didn't know what they were doing."
In the Soviet Union she learned something of her country's nonconformist art, but in America, she said, she has learned far more. "My taste changed in seven years," she said. "Conceptual, video art, performance art -- all I started to appreciate here, not in Russia."
Ms. Rosenfeld said she was happy enough in Leningrad and had no thoughts of leaving. She liked teaching painting, drawing and art history in a cultured, charming Baroque city, close to her family. Her father was a writer, her brother a flutist, her mother a lawyer. Like them, she was successful in public and critical of the system in private.
"I had to lead a double life," she said. "I was interested in questions related to Judaism. But it was dangerous to go to synagogue if you were starting in a good school. Ideology was everywhere."
Her husband was having a bad time. He had applied to emigrate years earlier and was refused; as a refusenik, he had trouble finding work and was the cause of demotions for his parents, both architects. "They were almost crying," Ms. Rosenfeld said.
Finally, after perestroika, Ms. Rosenfeld and her husband were allowed to come to the United States. They settled with their son, Benjamin, now 9, in Stamford, Conn. Ms. Rosenfeld began her successful hunt for jobs in graphic design and lecturing on art history.
"I walked into a gallery, the I.B.M., interviewed, presented myself," she said, referring to the former I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art in midtown Manhattan. "Maybe I was interesting and exotic." She was hired to lecture on French Impressionism and Tibetan sacred art at the gallery.
She boned up on Impressionism and learned, literally from scratch, the esthetics and history of Tibetan art. She could read and understand spoken English fluently but could not speak well. "I didn't realize how difficult, to give a lecture in a foreign language on something I don't know," she said. She would write her lectures, have American friends read them into tape recorders and memorize the proper pronunciation of words. She worked, as well, in other galleries, in New York City and Greenwich, Conn.
So successful was she that in 1993, riding the train to interview for a job at the Zimmerli, she wasn't sure she wanted it. "I thought, not so prestigious," she said. The opening was for a curator for another Zimmerli collection of Russian art, donated some years before by George Riabov, a Russian-American Rutgers alumnus. It consists of more than 1,000 works of Russian art from the 18th to the early 20th century.
The proximity of that collection was one reason Mr. Dodge, who was storing the thousands of paintings in some of the 40 buildings in his 960-acre Maryland farm, chose to give them to the Zimmerli. He had had them there for years, and since some were starting to deteriorate, it was crucial to move them to a proper, protected, temperature-controlled space.
Ms. Rosenfeld and Mr. Wechsler have spent most of the last two years readying the nonconformist collection. Together, they selected from the voluminous pile of art, compiled the categories, had walls built to hang pieces, wrote explanatory placards. "A Russian education is strict, truly academic," Mr. Wechsler said. "You do not question the professor. You learn specific things, facts. It's not like an American education, where they teach you how to think. Alla maintained the absolute importance of the factual biographies of artists -- where they studied and so forth. I'd be the one to say, 'You have talk about the paintings.' "
Ms. Rosenfeld "has a better knowledge of American and British literature than most American college students," he added. "I'd have to tell her, 'Americans won't know this person or book or fact.' "
Ms. Rosenfeld is now living in the Chelsea section of Manhattan with her son; she and her husband have divorced. She loves the culture and bustle of Manhattan. There, she has met many more Russian artists than she did in the Soviet Union. Some are thriving, succussfully making and selling art. Others are not.
"Now they are competitive," she said. At parties, Russian artists "talk about the period of the 1960's with great nostalgia," she went on, and added: "It was a spiritual time. At gatherings, people would talk of philosophy and art and drink vodka into the night. There was nothing to compete for. Now there is jealousy, envy. Artists that were friends in the 60's are now enemies."

HEADLINE: Back on Track

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
THE NEXT time you find yourself parked at a railroad crossing, waiting for eight million pounds or so of freight containers to roll by, you could count them.
You could curse them. 
 Or, like Wayne Eastman, you might simply marvel.
Last Friday Mr. Eastman, the district superintendent at the Conrail Oak Island switching yard in Newark, stood on a bridge over Newark Bay and watched a 142-car train laden with axles for the G.M. plant in Linden, wheat flour for Nabisco's Fair Lawn bakery, a tankerful of isobutane for a Mobil refinery in Paulsboro pull into the yard.
"There it goes," he said. "A microcosm of the New Jersey economy."
The once-crippled rail freight industry is booming now, and nowhere more than in New Jersey. The triumph of intermodal shipping, in which the same container can be moved from ship to train to truck, has combined with glitches in the region's transportation system itself to make the state a rail freight capital. These days, chances are that your morning glass of orange juice, your television set, the newsprint on which these words are printed, even the car in which you sit at the rail crossing all entered the state on a pair of tracks.
When it comes to shipping freight, trucks are still king: they carried 158 million tons in and out of New Jersey in 1994. But consider these recent developments:
* From 1982 to 1994, freight shipments to and from New Jersey by rail grew more than five times as fast as shipments by truck, and totaled more than 28 million tons last year.
* At Port Elizabeth, which combined with Port Newark is the second busiest port in the country, the number of containers transferred directly between ships and trains has increased by 465 percent since 1988. In December, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plans to open a new rail terminal at Port Elizabeth that is twice the size of the existing one.
* In May, Toys "R" Us opened a new 885,000-square-foot distribution center along the Morristown and Erie tracks in Flanders, one of the biggest rail-driven economic development projects in the state since before the interstate highway system was built in the 1950's.
* Within the last three years, many of the nation's biggest trucking companies, including J. B. Hunt, Roadway and Consolidated Freightways, have started using trains for the longest legs of their cross-country hauls, boosting business at the half-dozen intermodal rail terminals in New Jersey.
To understand the rail resurgence, it is helpful to view the world from the inside of a shipping container. Imagine that you are a pair of sneakers, fresh from the factory in Korea and bound for the feet of a little boy in Paramus.
You and several thousand mates are packed into a container like those carried on the backs of tractor-trailers, and placed on a steamship headed for Los Angeles or Oakland. On arrival, your container is set down on train wheels, and you are zipped across the country to an intermodal terminal like Conrail's Croxton Yard in Jersey City. There a truck picks up your container and drives you to a warehouse, where you are sorted for the final truck ride to the Garden State Plaza.
This is intermodal transportation, which now accounts for about three-quarters of rail shipments into and out of the state. (And it can beeven more complicated than that. A container rarely rides the same train all the way across the country, and breaking a train apart at a switching yard, sorting the cars and assembling a new train takes much more time than hoisting a container from one train to another.)
A decade or two ago, when the rail freight standard was the boxcar, transferring goods from a shipping container to a boxcar and then back to a container for truck distribution was so costly and time-consuming that ships from Asia sailed through the Panama Canal to truck terminals at Port Newark. But today, in most cases, the "land bridge" moves merchandise across the country several days faster than a ship can.
Say you are a California avocado. Only a few years ago, you would have made the cross-country journey by truck. But railroad operators have increased hundreds of clearances in tunnels and under bridges, and now shippers can double-stack containers on low-riding bucket-shaped platforms. This, combined with a chronic shortage of truck drivers, has made it more economical for trucking companies to haul by train. For example, a terminal operator in North Bergen says it costs $500 to $600 to ship a 45,000-pound container from Chicago to North Jersey by train, compared to $750 to $800 by truck.
A fully loaded container train can now take the place of 200 tractor-trailers.According to the Association of American Railroads, trains are three times more fuel efficient than trucks and emit one-tenth the hydrocarbons.
Add this to the mule work that trains have always done better than trucks -- the movement of heavy loads, like sand from the mines of Cumberland County or coal to P.S.E.&G. plants in Atlantic County, and dangerous ones, like the explosive and corrosive compounds used by the refineries along the state's "chemical coast" -- and the growth of rail freight seems almost inevitable.
"It's like this," Mr. Eastman said. "We bring in Tropicana orange juice from Bradenton, Florida, on 65-car unit trains two to three times a week. They unload it and distribute it all over the Northeast. You buy it, you drink it, you digest it, it goes to the sewage treatment plant, they put the sludge on rail cars and we take it down to Texas. We do it all. The whole food chain."
 
End of the Line
There are 1,332 miles of track used for hauling freight across New Jersey. The Consolidated Rail Corporation, as Conrail is officially known, owns or uses 949 of them. The rest of the tracks belong to 10 independent short-line railroads that connect to Conrail's lines.
The largest freight carrier east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio River, Conrail was created by the Federal Government in 1976 to restore and operate 12,000 miles of track abandoned by six railroads that had gone out of business because of competition from trucks and onerous regulation. The Government sold its share of Conrail in 1987, and the Philadelphia-based company is now publicly held, with revenues of $3.7 billion in 1994.
Conrail's operations in the northern part of this state are enormous. They include intermodal terminals in Jersey City, Kearny, North Bergen, and Ports Newark and Elizabeth that have already handled more than 350,000 containers this year; five auto-loading terminals both for cars made in New Jersey and for cars shipped here for sale; two bulk-transfer terminals where, say, a candy maker can send a truck to suck corn syrup out of a tanker car; and the 30-track switching yard at Oak Island in Newark.
Several local transportation problems make North Jersey an even better place to put a rail freight terminal than it would otherwise be. One is the highway congestion on Routes 1 and 9 near the ports, which is so bad that many shippers try to use trucks as little as possible. Another is the fact that for eastbound freight headed into New York City or Long Island, the nearest place a train can cross the Hudson is in Albany. That makes New Jersey the logical end of the line for a cross-country rail shipment.
Conrail's business in North Jersey is so good, in fact, that it's becoming a problem. Truck congestion at the South Kearny Intermodal Terminal forced Conrail to open a new terminal at Port Elizabeth in September, and train traffic jams on the single-track Hudson River line and other stretches sometimes delay deliveries.
Ted Matthews, manager of ports, terminals and freight for the state Department of Transportation, notes that in some ways, Conrail is finding itself a victim of its own recovery strategy.
"Conrail has been downsizing its system over the years in response to loss in traffic," he said, "and now that people are moving back to the railroad, Conrail is finding that the slimming down they did to make themselves able to compete is now working against them."
Solving the track congestion problem is not going to be easy. Mr. Matthews said that the state's plans to lay more track in North Jersey are currently on hold. Even so, Mr. Matthews and other transportation officials and planners, citing the strides in efficiency railroads have made in the last decade, predict that the demand for freight rail service will keep growing. Mr. Matthews said he has been fielding an increasing number of calls from industries considering a move to New Jersey who "absolutely require" rail access.
And Don Lotz, the Port Authority's intermodal manager and the man overseeing the new intermodal terminal at Port Elizabeth, said that improving rail connections was essential to the port's ability to compete against others on the Eastern Seaboard.
"A Chicago importer bringing in Heineken beer has a choice," Mr. Lotz said. "If our port can't build the best mousetrap, he's going to go to Halifax or Philadelphia."
 
The View From the Cab
As seen from a freight train -- even a state-of-the-art, double-stacked container train -- the world is an old-fashioned, slightly squalid but largely charming place comprising backyards, aging factories and scrubby greenery of the sort that flourishes in gravel.
Mostly, this is because there is no rail equivalent of the interstate highway system, which allows drivers to bypass towns and cities. Trains run where they've always run, past the civilization that sprang up alongside them.
In New Jersey, the freight train passes through dozens of tiny towns whose boom times, such as they were, are long gone -- a string of settlements along the vanished Morris Canal in Warren County called Rockport, Port Colden and Port Murray; places in South Jersey called Norma and Newfield.
In bigger towns, the train typically runs along a street called Railroad Avenue, at least half of whose real estate is on the wrong side of the tracks. Last Sunday, on a run from the Oak Island yard up past the New York border at Suffern, Brian Reilly admired the view.
"You go places no one ever really sees," said Mr. Reilly, the conductor of a 44-car train hauling mostly paper, plywood and plastic. "You see the industry, the backbone."
Mr. Reilly, 26, is a second-generation railroader. His family is from Scranton, Pa., a city built on the railroad, but though he still lives there, Mr. Reilly, like his two brothers, finds that much of his work is in New Jersey. He has been on the railroad for a year.
As the train chugged through Jersey City, Mr. Reilly scanned the tracks for signs of trouble. The stretches where the train passes the public housing projects in Jersey City and Hoboken, Conrail officials say, have the highest looting rate in the whole Conrail system. Despite the presence of Conrail police officers, bands of brigands sometimes force a train to an emergency stop by disconnecting the air-brake lines, then break into the cars and throw off television sets, cases of beer, anything of value. Sometimes they don't even wait for the train to stop.
"They can unload a juice train while it's moving," Mike DiGuglielmo, a yardmaster at Oak Island, had said. "They break through a sealed door and take off half a car of juice faster than Tropicana can unload it when it's stopped in the yard."
On this day, however, there appeared to be only the usual trespassers -- an old man walking a basset hound, a guy passed out inside a car, little kids looking for mischief.
At Saddle Brook, engineer Michael Walkerwicz stopped the two-engine train to drop off nine cars of paper at the New York Susquehanna and Western yard. Mr. Reilly hopped off to light flares at an unsignaled intersection while the train backed into the siding, then went to the back to disconnect the cars.
Farther up, Mr. Reilly waved at a man and his son walking along the road by the tracks. "In Scranton, when I tell people I'm on the railroad they seem skeptical because it really did die out over there," he said. "They don't know how big it is out here."
 
 
 
Short Lines Fill In The Gaps
IF Conrail is the giant, the Microsoft of rail freight, then the short lines are the Lotuses and Wordperfects and Novells. The nine independently owned railroads, ranging in length from 2 miles to 79, operate spurs off Conrail's main tracks to serve local customers. Another railroad, the New York Susquehanna and Western, is more of a regional line, linking North Jersey to several long-haul freight lines in Buffalo and Binghamton.
Some of the short lines have been around for decades, but many of them run on some of the 429 miles of track that Conrail has abandoned over the years because it could not operate them at a profit. Conrail inherited more than 1,500 miles of track when it was formed in 1976, but found that many of its spur lines had too few customers or were too dilapidated to be worth keeping.
The smaller railroads, because they have lower overhead, do not pay union wages and can offer more personalized service, have often been able to succeed where Conrail couldn't. By and large, the arrangement suits both parties just fine.
"We're very good at moving long volumes long or short distances, but we don't do as well moving light volumes over shorter distances," said a Conrail spokesman, Robert Libkind. "We can work with a short line which has different economic structure, and because the short line gathers business, they in turn become our customer."
And gather business they do. In May, Toys "R" Us opened a huge warehouse in Flanders eight miles along the Morristown and Erie line from the Conrail connection in Roxbury Township.
"When we met with them, they told us that rail service was vital to all their distribution centers, and that they wouldn't even consider a site without rail access." said Frank Reilly, the Morris County Transportation Director, who helped bring Toys "R" Us to Flanders.
Successes like the Morristown and Erie's are being repeated all over the state. The Southern Railroad of New Jersey will soon begin hauling loads of fish from a new processing plant being built in Woodbine, Cape May County.
"One of the reasons they located there was that there was outbound rail service," said Tom Collard, the vice president. The Southern Railroad, formed three years ago, has seen its business grow from 545 cars hauled in the first nine months of 1994 to more than 1,500 this year.
Sometimes, to get a short line back in working order, local government will step in to buy or fix up the track. At Mr. Reilly's suggestion, Morris County has bought 15 miles of track, holding onto several manufacturers who would have left if they had lost their rail connection, and attracting others. "I think what a lot of people don't realize is that you don't need to have a 300-mile long railroad to improve your local economy," he said.
Because the short lines are dependent on Conrail for connections to the outside world and sometimes for equipment, the arrangement is not always a comfortable one. Several short-line executives used the word "captive" to describe their situation, and Jack Dean, a planner for the non-profit Regional Plan Association in New York, said that Conrail has been less accommodating to the short lines of late.
"Conrail is tightening up its service relationship with short lines," he said. "They're being more strict on price policies, how they can use cars."
On the other hand, the New York Susquehanna and Western has been able to thrive in head-to-head competition with the giant. N.Y.S.W., which offers westbound connections to the Norfolk Southern and other major lines in New York State, specializes in double-stacked containers and has intermodal terminals in Jersey City, North Bergen, Ridgefield and Saddle Brook.
"If a customer needs a car in the middle of the day," said the company's vice president, Robert Kurdock, "we're small and flexible enough that we can adjust our plans almost instantly."
Sometimes, however, N.Y.S.W. and Conrail team up to compete against trucking firms. "We have a unique relationship with Conrail," Mr. Kurdock said. "It takes a bit of diplomacy."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Building a Better 401(k)

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
A TRILLION dollars. Now there's a figure that commands some respect. That's the amount that those retirement plans with the yawner name -- 401(k) -- will likely claim as their own in just three or four years. Nearly 18.5 million American workers have these tax-advantaged accounts, and many millions more will doubtless soon join them. For the 401(k) has been heralded by economists, politicians and investment advisers alike as a key to a comfortable retirement in the post-pension world.
But the 401(k) idea has a flaw. No, not just the frequent lament that many eligible workers do not join the plans, or do not invest enough in them, or do not allocate their assets appropriately. This other problem centers not on the worker at all but on the company, not on an ill-informed investor but on a malformed plan.
This is a story about how some workers who were enrolled in such unsatisfactory plans -- two San Francisco architects, a newspaper editor in Philadelphia, the treasurer of a parking-lot company and a whole set of workers at a food company in upstate New York -- voiced their concerns and persuaded their companies to make the necessary changes.
Unfortunately, such reformers are rare, even if the defects that roused them are not. While companies generally follow Labor Department guidelines on the basic features of a good 401(k) plan, those minimums leave plenty of room for discretion. And, for a host of reasons, the executives who choose 401(k) plans for their companies are simply not the unerring judges that workers may assume.
For many executives, the 401(k) question often yields to more pressing issues -- like meeting the competition. And even if the 401(k) gets their attention, it may be for naught. "In many cases," said Daniel P. Wiener, publisher of the newsletter Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, the executive who does the choosing "doesn't have a clue about investing."
Even the pricing of such plans is not clear-cut. "Many companies, and even benefits consultants, feel confused on pricing because it's all over the map," said Tom Johnson, vice president for marketing for Fed Services in Pittsburgh, which manages $80 billion in 401(k) money.
And where knowledge is sketchy and prices fuzzy, social connections often become decisive. The choice of a corporate 401(k) plan, Mr. Wiener said, often hinges less on its merits than on "the relationship between the person at the company who makes the decisions and a sales agent for a mutual fund company." Selecting a plan after a round of golf hosted by such agents, he said, "is no way to design a plan."
The results, the experts say, are plans with too few choices, arbitrarily set contribution limits, hidden fees, and other traits that can at best dampen the great promise of 401(k) plans and, at worst, seriously hobble workers' efforts to prepare for retirement.
Here are the tales of those workers who have become Norma Rae's of the 401(k). They describe what weak spots they found, how they discovered the problems and what reform strategies they used -- from pushing for less costly changes on the theory the company is more receptive to them, to exploiting the investment savvy of in-house financial officers in mapping a new plan.
For the rest of the 18.5 million 401(k) investors, the lesson these workers teach is that while your 401(k) may be far from perfect, it may also be far from written in stone. Now may be a particularly good time to explore both those questions, with plan vendors engaged in a fierce competition that means dirt-cheap prices for buyers. Indeed, delay may be dangerous. The tax breaks that make the plans so attractive to workers are also attracting the attention of Congressional budget-balancers.
Yet assessing one's 401(k) plan is a long-term exercise, too. Just as today's workers must take charge of their own retirement investments, they also must scrutinize the contours of the plans. The stories below teach us to ask the critical, overarching questions: How good is my 401(k)? Are there hidden fees or costly features that serve little purpose? Do its mutual funds perform well, and are there enough of them? Asking these questions -- and pushing for change if the answers are unsatisfactory -- are critical chores for the workers who will be the pioneer retirees of the 21st century.
 
Two Puzzled Architects
 In 1993, two young architects in San Francisco, Kevin Kennedy and Steve Jackson, noticed something odd about their 401(k) investments. The plan's no-load mutual funds reported returns in the newspaper that were much better than the returns they reported to the plan.
Confused and worried, the men approached the owners of their firm, Gordon H. Chong & Associates. The owners agreed to a 401(k) review, with the firm's 50 architects electing a four-member committee to perform it.
The committee, which included Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Jackson, was soon poring over the plan documents and unraveling the complexities of the 401(k). But it didn't take long for them to discover why their existing mutual fund options did so much better in the newspaper than on their plan's papers: buried in the pricing of their 401(k) documents was a 5 percent commission on purchases of these "no load" mutual funds.
Naturally, the committee began to look elsewhere. Mr. Jackson, for example, used his personal computer to conduct a detailed performance analysis of various mutual funds over intervals ranging from three years to one month.
The committee also interviewed mutual fund companies and other vendors of 401(k) plans, and became pretty smart shoppers. "The really big guys in mutual funds offered very good service -- but you had to buy only their funds and that put us off a little bit," Mr. Kennedy said.
Given their past experience, they were acutely attuned to hard-to-detect fees. "We also felt that they had some loads, some costs, that you don't necessarily see upfront," he said about some vendors. "That made us a little leery because there were plenty of pure no-load funds out there."
The committee worked for more than a year, eventually prompting the firm's owners to retain Schwab One, which allows workers to pick from six investment options offered by several different mutual funds and other money managers. And the new plan reduced, from one year to several months, the waiting period before new employees could enroll.
 
A Borrower and a Lender Be
 Jonathan Neumann, enterprise editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, mentioned to one of his superiors in 1994 that he was planning to borrow some money. She suggested he take out a loan against his 401(k) savings. To Mr. Neumann, who had put away the maximum allowed since the plan began in 1989, the idea made great sense. He needn't worry about applying for a loan, and instead of paying interest to a bank he would be paying it to himself.
But when Mr. Neumann asked for loan forms he got a shock.
"Much to my surprise," he said, "I learned that the union employees were not allowed to borrow, but people in management could."
Mr. Neumann went right to the top, asking both the paper's publisher and the president of his union, Local 10 of the Newspaper Guild, the whys and wherefores of the rule. "Neither had any answers," he said.
So Mr. Neumann and a colleague called R. Theodore Benna, a benefits consultant in Langhorne, Pa., who is widely credited with popularizing 401(k) plans. Mr. Benna said there was no legal reason such loans could not be made to union employees, that the paperwork involved would cost less than $1,000 and that all other loan costs could be charged to borrowers.
"We went back to the publisher and the union president and they said, 'That's all it takes?' and in about two months it was done and I got my loan," Mr. Neumann said.
Such "self-lending" is a big attraction of the 401(k) and its nonprofit cousin, the 403(b). About $17 billion of these assets have been borrowed, with an average loan balance of $6,200, according to Access Research, a market research firm in Windsor, Conn. Under Federal law these loans are limited to half of account balances, up to $50,000.
 
Good Stuff Real Cheap
 Doug Bowlus was not too pleased with the performance of the money manager for his 401(k) plan at ABM Industries, a San Francisco company that runs parking lots and janitorial services across the country.
"Nobody was particularly happy with our investment manager," Mr. Bowlus, ABM's treasurer, said. "I tracked their performance and came to the conclusion that we could do better."
But Mr. Bowlus knew that he faced some constraints. "We are not a high-margin company," he said, "and so cost control and avoidance is a serious issue."
So, with some colleagues, Mr. Bowlus focused on cheap ways to make ABM's 401(k) plan better. And he succeeded, ultimately persuading his superiors to switch investment managers, to change administrators to improve 401(k) record-keeping, and to provide additional features, such as two more investment options.
"We got all of these improvements," said Mr. Bowlus, "for virtually no additional cost to the company." In fact, he said, the switch to a new administrator should lower administrative costs.
Equally important are the new plan's improvements in 401(k) communication and education. Employees can now get daily valuations from an 800 number, for instance, and each quarter they also receive reports on how each fund option did compared to all similar funds.
"We are also getting much more, and much more professional, educational materials," Mr. Bowlus said. "It will help our employees understand the difference between savings and investment and what different options can mean to their retirement income, and to better understand that investment is a long-term process and not 'What did you do for me this quarter?' "
And in securing the new plan, Mr. Bowlus used a strategy that may prove useful to others. As ABM's treasurer, he is financially knowledgeable, and he relied as well on other ABM finance specialists in his efforts.
Such specialists add needed investment acumen for 401(k) design, said Thomas Schlossberg, president of Diversified Investment Advisors. While there has recently been a big shift of 401(k) responsibility to financial executives, "About 60 percent of the time the benefits or human resources people, especially at smaller companies, decide on the 401(k) plan," he said. "Better to get the chief financial officer's people involved, too."
 
Everybody Into the Act
 At Curtice-Burns Foods in Rochester, N.Y., a battle over corporate ownership last fall had left many employees fretful about their future. To allay concerns and show its benevolence, the company decided to greatly improve the retirement plans of its 1,200 salaried workers.
But first the company, which makes Comstock pie fillings and Nalley's chips, surveyed its workers to find out their sentiments. What it learned was a surprise -- and led the company to change direction.
"We knew we needed to do something in the area of retirement," said Lois Warlick-Jarvie, vice president for human resources. "We were looking at improving the defined benefit plan, but based on what we heard from our employees we decided to work on the defined contribution plan." In other words, while the company was readying a plan to augment its pension, workers were pointing to their 401(k)'s instead.
And improve them, it did. The company increased the plan's investment options from two to four and, while there was no company match before, Curtice-Burns offered a 50 percent match, up to 3 percent of pay.
The lesson for workers is twofold: Speak up about changes you desire because your company may have no clue about your preferences. And when you do speak up, your company may well say yes.
Congress first authorized the 401(k) plan in 1980. By the year 2000 -- a mere 20 years later -- the predictions are that 25 million American workers at 350,000 companies will have invested $1.175 trillion in such plans.
That growth makes it critical for workers to realize that, in the world of the 401(k), intelligent investing means more than just mastering and following the rules of asset allocation, diversification and the like. It also means stepping back, scrutinizing the overall plan as vigorously as they scrutinize investments, and pushing for change if change is needed. For weak plans can make strong portfolios -- and a secure retirement -- impossible to achieve.

HEADLINE: At Justice, The Taming of A Whirlwind

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT was the early heady days of her tenure as the Clinton Administration's top antitrust enforcer, and Anne K. Bingaman was not about to compromise.
She was facing skeptical questioning from her boss, Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell, about her sprawling investigation into charges that the General Electric Company was rigging the prices of industrial diamonds around the world. Mr. Hubbell had received calls from Ben W. Heineman Jr., G.E.'s general counsel and a close friend to many powerful Democrats, pleading that the case be dropped, particularly since the company had persuaded the Government's leading witness, an executive-turned-informant, to sign an affidavit saying he had "no personal knowledge" of price-fixing. 
 Refusing to yield, Mrs. Bingaman announced the company's indictment with considerable fanfare. But just weeks after the case went to trial last October, Federal prosecutors were thrown out of court because their evidence was so weak.
Now, a year later, Mrs. Bingaman, a 52-year-old former law professor and antitrust litigator, said she has no regrets. "It was a tough case and sometimes you lose tough cases," she said in a recent interview in her office in the Justice Department. "I don't see it as a setback."
But many outsiders do, calling it a stinging defeat that serves as the demarcation line between Mrs. Bingaman's activist, whirlwind start as head of the department's antitrust division and a harsher new reality that has left her unbowed but increasingly on the defensive.
Before the G.E. case was thrown out, Mrs. Bingaman was on a roll, quickly reviving the division from the torpor of the Reagan and Bush years. Her lawyers were winning cases in the courts and striking agreements in a number of mergers that in earlier days would have gone unchallenged. She moved legislation briskly through Congress. And she managed to exploit the divisions within a weaker rival agency, the Federal Trade Commission, grabbing away high-profile investigations like the antimonopoly case against the giant Microsoft Corporation.
Since the G.E. case, however, the antitrust division has faced a wide range of challenges -- ideological, political and bureaucratic -- that together are starting to rein in Mrs. Bingaman and her agenda, outsiders said.
"From early on, she tried to be quite aggressive, but she has run up against the reality that there are strong limits to what she can really do," said Robert W. Crandall, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
For openers, Mrs. Bingaman is facing tough opposition on Capitol Hill from a new Republican majority that is eager to drastically cut back the division's regulatory role in telecommunications and health care. And off the Hill, she is facing a renewed rivalry from a rejuvenated F.T.C.
Meanwhile, though her division continues to have a strong enforcement record, one of its highest-profile cases -- a price-fixing investigation of agribusiness giant Archer-Daniels-Midland -- has quickly turned problematic because of recent disclosures about another executive-turned-informant who is a key Government witness. The executive, Mark E. Whitacre, has been accused by Archer-Daniels of embezzling millions of dollars. Mr. Whitacre, who attempted suicide two months ago, has offered to plead guilty to two felony counts, and according to one Government official, is "quickly being seen as the antitrust division's Mark Fuhrman."
And then there are the hard lessons of the G.E. case itself. One out of four pending grand jury investigations supervised by the division involves the conduct of American and foreign companies abroad -- and the number of such cases appears to be growing. The defeat in the G.E. case, Mrs. Bingaman said, shows how difficult it is to win when Federal prosecutors and courts cannot get their hands on critical witnesses and documents that are abroad.
But there is another lesson, detractors say. To them, the defeat demonstrates that in her zeal to elevate the profile of the antitrust division, Mrs. Bingaman occasionally overreaches.
And for that reason, they say, the case raises basic questions about just how long the division's reach should be.
If American companies have to operate in a world economy that is largely a free-for-all, do too many antitrust rules at home hamper their ability to compete? How can American regulators control the behavior of foreign companies that are shipping more and more goods to the United States? And if the mood of the country favors less government and fewer regulations -- and the trend among many industries is to consolidate -- where does that leave a regulatory agency whose traditional role has been to attack big companies as the enemy of free competition?
UNDOUBTEDLY the division is different than when Mrs. Bingaman arrived 26 months ago. For decades until Ronald Reagan became President, it played a vital role in the economy, deciding the fate of corporate mergers and acquisitions, breaking up companies it thought were too dominant and handling a wide array of bid-rigging and price-fixing cases of enormous consequence to the marketplace.
But that all began to change with the Reagan Administration's commitment to reducing the role of government in Corporate America.
The division was further threatened by changing domestic and global economic forces.
The tumultuous reconfigurations of four bulwark American industries -- health care, defense, telecommunications and computers -- left legal scholars and economists questioning the relevance of vigorous antitrust law as a pillar of open and competitive markets. Although the antitrust division scored a coup in the early 80's, forcing AT&T to break up and starting a new wave of competition in the telephone industry, its failure to accomplish anything similar with the International Business Machines Corporation was an indication of the difficulties it would soon have trying to regulate rapidly changing technology markets.
And new economic realities emerged abroad that threatened to transform the antitrust division into a vestigial organ of the legal system. The proliferation of imports of everything from automobiles to videotape machines meant that American antitrust prosecutors would no longer be able to protect domestic markets merely by policing American companies. But with few methods for getting at incriminating documents and corporate informants abroad, antitrust enforcement in the American marketplace began to sound a hollow ring.
Meanwhile, the job that Mr. Reagan began -- cutting out wide swaths of enforcement -- was continued after he left office by many of the Federal judges he had appointed. Through the last decade, the courts have issued a string of opinions sharply curtailing the ability of companies and consumers to bring their own cases to enforce antitrust laws.
AWARE of these legal and economic obstacles, Mrs. Bingaman vowed to turn on the lights when she arrived on the darkened antitrust scene. A litigator whose hero is Adlai Stevenson, she had little in the way of a public track record, and the perception that she was a plaintiff's antitrust lawyer with populist ideas gave encouragement to some consumer groups while causing some executives to worry that she would revive the enforcement zeal of the 1960's.
Those worries were justified, said William F. Baxter, the intellectual father of the Reagan Administration's antitrust policy and head of the antitrust division for three years.
As it happens, Mrs. Bingaman studied antitrust law with Mr. Baxter while she and her future husband, Jeff, now a Democratic Senator from New Mexico, were students at Stanford University's law school. Though Mr. Baxter said he remains Mrs. Bingaman's friend and speaks with her regularly, he readily criticizes his former pupil and her division.
"They started off with unrealistic ambitions and expectations and they've had a number of failures," he said in a telephone interview last week. "They set off with this crusading notion that there's lots and lots of violations and they would try to do whatever they could to throw out the rascals, and they have now found out it is not so easy to do that. The larger companies are well-counseled and don't get into the kind of trouble that the antitrust division is looking for. So, instead, they go after the little companies, hoping to score some kind of political advantage."
For her part, Mrs. Bingaman said she has tried to walk a fine line, ratcheting up the division's aggressiveness without going over the top.
"You get respect for antitrust by doing things -- but not doing stupid things," she said. "Antitrust was trashed in the mid-1980's. It has been built back, beginning with my immediate predecessor, Jim Rill. There was talk when I first got here about how I was going to return to the 60's and 70's and do all the crazy things that were done then. But my basic goal has been to build respect for the law."
Mrs. Bingaman and her troops have largely been meeting that goal, a number of antitrust scholars said.
"They have shown populist leanings tempered by a lot of good common sense," said George L. Priest, who teaches antitrust law at Yale University. "They haven't fought bigness just for the sake of bigness. They've done it for other reasons, or they've recognized that bigness is not necessarily anti-competitive."
Indeed, the biggest proposed merger now on the division's plate, the $19 billion takeover of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. by the Walt Disney Company, is widely expected to be approved.
And putting the General Electric case aside, the division has managed to avoid getting bogged down in big antitrust cases, as other administrations have, scholars agree.
"This Justice Department has been tough but pragmatic," said Steven C. Salop, an economist who teaches at the Georgetown University Law Center. "They're not on an escapade to restructure the economy. They are making fixes to encourage competition, while at the same time permitting benefits from the kinds of efficiencies that come with mergers."
Typical of such an approach was the consent decree the division wrote in AT&T's $12.6 billion acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications last year. Mrs. Bingaman gave AT&T most of what it wanted, but also took steps to preserve competition even as the communications industry consolidates. The consent decree requires AT&T to keep its cellular-telephone operations separate from its long-distance and equipment manufacturing businesses. In addition, McCaw customers were permitted to select any long-distance carrier for cellular service.
Still, Mrs. Bingaman has moved aggressively. During her first two years, the division doubled the number of cases in which it challenged, restructured or blocked proposed mergers. It brought the first case to block a vertical merger -- the acquisition of the Liberty Media Corporation by Tele-Communications Inc. -- in 11 years. That case ended in a consent decree under which Tele-Communications, the largest owner of cable television distribution systems in the nation, is prohibited from discriminating against competing programmers.
The division has also used American antitrust law to open foreign markets that had been closed to United States companies. Its biggest victory came last year against Pilkington P.L.C., the British glass maker, in a case that Justice Department officials estimate could add as much as $1.25 billion to American export sales of glass products over the next six years.
ALL of which leaves Mrs. Bingaman bristling when presented with the view of some economists that antitrust enforcement is no longer relevant in industrial policy. "That's ridiculous," she said. "If you talk to the merger and acquisitions bar, I think they will tell you a lot of deals don't get done because they don't pass antitrust muster. I would just dispute the idea that we're not relevant.
"The law has been narrowed in some areas," she concedes, acknowledging the decline of private suits by companies against competitors. "But we still have the tools to do what we need to."
The question now is whether that will be the case for much longer.
In the current debate over Medicare legislation, some senior lawmakers in the House have moved to provide new antitrust exemptions to doctors and other health care providers. And separate bills have already passed both the House and Senate that would substantially reduce the antitrust division's authority over the telephone industry, removing Mrs. Bingaman from making important decisions about how the Baby Bells can be involved in the lucrative long-distance market.
"This is an industry that is already highly regulated, by the Federal Communications Commission and the states," said Thomas J. Tauke, executive vice president for governmental affairs at the Nynex Corporation, the Baby Bell based in New York. "It doesn't need a third regulator."
The telecommunications legislation, which the White House has threatened to veto, is awaiting action by a conference committee to iron out differences.
Mrs. Bingaman is also facing a new rival in Robert Pitofsky, the aggressive new chairman of the F.T.C. Mrs. Bingaman said she and Mr. Pitofsky are longtime friends and that she supported his nomination. Still, it is now difficult to imagine Mrs. Bingaman reaching in and grabbing control of enforcement investigations like the one against Microsoft. If anything, it is Mr. Pitofsky who appears to have gained the upper hand, at least in some cases.
Earlier this month, he won a turf tussle with Mrs. Bingaman over which agency would review the proposed $7.5 billion merger between Time Warner Inc. and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. Mr. Pitofsky is also preparing a series of hearings about virtually every aspect of antitrust law, to consider what changes ought to be made.
BUT if her division is on the defensive, Mrs. Bingaman hardly sounds like someone on the run.
She declined to comment about Archer-Daniels, but she said she would bring the G.E. case again tomorrow even if she knew it would end the same way.
Far from discouraging the division, she said, the case has sent out a positive message. The number of complaints from companies about antitrust abuses is up significantly, she said, because of the perception of a reinvigorated prosecutor's shop, as well as a new leniency policy she implemented. It permits a company to avoid criminal prosecution for illegal conduct, under most circumstances, by coming in and confessing to its role.
That kind of feisty attitude was also apparent in the division's most closely watched enforcement actions, involving Microsoft. Competitors of the company have said that Mrs. Bingaman was too lenient on Microsoft when the Justice Department settled a complaint accusing it of violating provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Mrs. Bingaman had sold the agreement as a tough one that would limit the company's dominance of the software industry, a view that was scorned by others.
"She created great expectations by taking the case from the F.T.C. and beating her breast about it, but then ended up landing a minnow," said the head of the antitrust practice at a leading law firm that was not involved in the case.
Yet when Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin refused to approve the agreement and suggested that Microsoft be investigated for other possible antitrust violations, Mrs. Bingaman wagged her finger and lectured him in court, saying he was no longer a top enforcement lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission and thus it was improper for him to play the part of prosecutor.
"For antitrust lawyers, it was more exciting than most days of the O. J. Simpson trial," said one top aide. Other lawyers said that although Mrs. Bingaman was exonerated when the United States Court of Appeals here reversed Judge Sporkin's ruling, her brazen challenge to the judge was hardly appropriate.
Mrs. Bingaman offered no apologies on that front, either, insisting that criticism of the division for being too lenient had nothing to do with its later decision to commence a second investigation of Microsoft. That review led the company to drop its proposed $1.5 billion acquisition of Intuit Inc., the maker of Quicken, the personal-finance software.
Still unclear is what the division is going to do, if anything, about Microsoft's plan to include software for its new on-line service in all new personal computers that carry its Windows operating system. On-line competitors said that kind of marketing blitz amounts to an unfair advantage.
ON the run or not, Mrs. Bingaman sooner or later will be leaving the division, of course.
About her future after the Justice Department, Mrs. Bingaman said "you couldn't pay enough" for her to try the cloistered life of a Federal judge. Instead, she said she is intrigued about the possibility of becoming an executive at a company, "even though I have no qualifications to be hired by business."
But many in the antitrust bar are in no rush to see her leave.
"Most antitrust lawyers in Washington are very happy with Anne," said Robert E. Litan, a former deputy in the antitrust division who left earlier this year to take a senior position at the White House budget office. "Even though they have to litigate against her, she is making them quite rich."

HEADLINE: What Makes Trump Tick?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There's nothing wrong with a little healthy ego or selfishness ("What My Ego Wants, My Ego Gets," From the Desk Of, Sept. 17), but Donald J. Trump's ego is not healthy; the term egomaniac might more aptly apply. 
 I happen to live in the neighborhood of Manhattan where Mr. Trump wishes to satisfy his ego to the tune of 15 40-story towers, caring nothing for what effect this monster project will have on this overcrowded area's environment -- the air quality, the inadequate subway service, the traffic jams and an already overtaxed sewage system.
As for his ability to obtain backing for these developments, how has he been able to obtain zoning changes against the will of a large segment of the community where the Riverside South Project is being developed.
What is even more galling is that this project has a loan guaranteed by the Housing and Urban Development Department. These loans are supposed to be for urban renewal; the Upper West Side of Manhattan is hardly in need of renewal. Granted his loan will be from a private lender, but in case of default, HUD (ie. the taxpayers) will foot the bill.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if Mr. Trump would dedicate his overactive ego to the building of low-income housing, which is so desperately needed.

HEADLINE: VOICES: FROM THE DESK OF;
A Different Kind of Paper Chase

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GEMIGNANI; Joseph Gemignani is an editor for the Money and Business section.

 BODY:
AFTER an extended period of forced cooperation and communication, my high-school-senior son and I were feeling pretty good about his college search this time a year ago. After all, we'd figured out the difference between Cornell College (in Iowa) and Cornell University (above Cayuga's waters in upstate New York). And we'd become sophisticated enough to know that California University was a lot closer to Pittsburgh than to the Pacific Ocean.
Having digested all such information, my son was starting to make realistic choices. Admissions essays were being written, references lined up and transcripts arranged. 
 But wait! While Phase 1 of the application process was winding down, we were about to enter Phase 2: the financial aid labyrinth.
Chances are that if you're a mortgage slave like me, you're not so well off that you can afford to pay college bills out of pocket and still maintain some sense of personal solvency (a crude "means test" for the lowly middle class these days). Chances are also that while you might have managed to put away a bit of college money, other things -- like, say, replacing your furnace -- kept stopping you from putting away as much as you had wanted. In my case, even if I had listened to E. F. Hutton 10 years ago and managed to salt away $2,000 a year, I'd still be coming up real short. After applying to six colleges, my son picked a state university with a respected journalism program -- but out of state -- where tuition, room, board and other expenses will total $15,500 the first year.
In late November, armed with calculators and a fistful of lethally sharp No. 2 soft pencils with perfect erasers, we confronted the second wave of applications -- to help us manage that amount.
The United States Education Department serves up a big chunk of the nation's financial aid pie (unless the Republicans in Congress get too carried away). This year's portion is $32.5 billion, and it comes in the form of need-based grants, loans and work-study programs. Grants don't have to be repaid, although any amount used for room and board will have to be reported to the I.R.S. and will wind up increasing your adjusted gross income. Loans are available for students and parents, and must be repaid starting six months after graduation at interest rates of 8.25 to 8.98 percent or with no interest. In a work-study plan, jobs are provided through the school and the student is paid directly, or the earnings are deducted from the student's bill. (In both cases the pay is heavily subsidized by the Government.)
The key to just about all aid is a document called Fafsa (eduspeak for Free Application for Federal Student Aid), which is intended to assess how much a student and his parents can afford to pay for his education. It comes in a comic-book-size packet (the only thing comic about it) and is not available on your local guidance counselor's shelves until mid-December. The Government won't accept Fafsa if it is mailed in before Jan. 1; most schools then want the assessments, which are actually done by a Government-designated clearinghouse, in their hands by March 1. A little deadline pressure always enhances quality, I say.
The form we filled out, which the colleges use to divvy up financial aid awards, covered 16 pages, with 12 for instructions. The first time we sat down with our Fafsa, my son and I answered detailed questions for both student and parents on marital status, parental status, military status, resident alien status, education and the like. It was tough, but by this time we thought we were, too.
Then came Section F, with a barrage of inquiries about our earnings, solvency and assets. We scrambled to gather the W-2's, 1099's, tax bills and bank statements we'd need; documents that, for the most part, hadn't even been delivered by our weary mailman. After a couple of hours, we retreated. Fafsa would have to wait until I had completed our 1994 income tax returns.
So would FAF, Fafsa's cousin in the private sector. One of my son's six schools wanted this form, a product of the College Board that, unlike the free Fafsa, cost $15.50 if reported to one school and $10.50 for each additional report.
But even with Fafsa and FAF out of the way, we weren't finished. Each of those six colleges also wanted an even more detailed in-house financial aid application. Essentially, these forms are tools for parceling out the schools' own grants.
Applicants this year, however, will have something different to look forward to. The College Board is replacing FAF with a new form -- the CSF/Financial Aid Profile -- that aims to cover the same territory as FAF as well as eliminate the need for the in-house forms.
But this came too late to ease our frustration. So, feeling that anything was worth a try, we sharpened more pencils and tackled the in-house forms, too.
In the same spirit of desperation, I remember asking a financial aid officer at Southern Methodist University in Dallas whether my son might qualify for one of the school's diversity scholarships, whose aims included insuring "ethnic and cultural variety" as well as "geographic distribution." The financial aid adviser politely pointed out that while it was true that my son didn't exactly fit the profile of the traditional S.M.U. student, New Jerseyans weren't among the groups historically "targeted" for diversity grants.
BUT we did hope to gain points at Purdue University with our response to this question on its aid form: Did my son have a grandfather or great-grandfather who served in the military in World War I? Yes, we answered honestly. After all, it didn't ask in which army, or even on which side.
In the end, the Federal Government offered to lend my son about $2,500 a year with interest and to lend me and my wife the rest, also with interest. He accepted his loan, but we turned down the other. It's probably a good idea for him to have some financial stake in his education, but my wife and I didn't see ourselves still paying for his education for years after his graduation and while we were supposed to be planning retirement.
If we didn't get a sweeter deal from the Government or the colleges, it was probably because we didn't deserve one. So I should stop whining and start figuring how I'm going to finance the next seven years. After all, there's a 15-year-old in my house who'll start college the same year her brother is scheduled to graduate.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FOREST HILLS;
Cuomo Says Lessons Learned On Housing Have Been Ignored

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
For Mario M. Cuomo, mediating the housing project controversy in Forest Hills in the 1970's was a first feature performance on the public stage that he would later dominate over three terms as Governor of New York.
In an interview, Mr. Cuomo said that issues raised more than 20 years ago in Forest Hills have particular resonance now and offer a window into the nation's failure to deal with problems of race and poverty. 
 "Forest Hills describes a situation in Queens that in many ways was a metaphor for the larger situation with race," he said. "Color was the most important thing, and it shouldn't have been. Economic class should have been the most important thing."
Mr. Cuomo, who chronicled his work as a mediator in a book, "Forest Hills Diary" (Random House, 1974), said that New York City found answers in Forest Hills that have been ignored since.
"The idea of a small dose of integration that could be absorbed by the larger community had intelligence," he said. "It's just that they never did it again, anywhere else."
The problem, Mr. Cuomo said, was that most communities were highly resistant to having a mix of economic classes. To illustrate his point, he offered another Queens example.
"At the same time Forest Hills was happening, Baisley Park was happening," he said. "Baisley Park was in South Jamaica, and involved the plan for a low-income housing project in an established stable middle-class community, except that Baisley Park was all black, it was black middle class. And the Baisley Park reaction was at least as furious as the Forest Hills reaction. The point I drew from that is that there is something beyond color here, it's economic class and distinction."
Much of the contention at the Forest Hills Cooperative today involves the question of shareholder rights, with tenants wanting more control over who moves in. Mr. Cuomo predicted the danger of calling a public housing project a cooperative in his book 23 years ago. (The idea was promoted by Borough President Donald Manes to assuage opponents.)
Mr. Cuomo wrote: "One of the aspects of the cooperative that is most appealing to the community is the fact that it provides for a board of directors. . . . It is apparently being commonly assumed that such a board of directors would have the right to make the ultimate tenant selection. . . . I am convinced this is not so and could not be so legally. There is a great danger in not making this clear. . . . I've tried to, but the little publicity given my remarks has been lost."
In the interview, Mr. Cuomo focused on how the book ties into the current problems in housing policy and race relations.
"The most obvious lesson about housing, which everyone refuses to address, is that we made a colossal blunder in insisting that the poor people be stacked one on top of the other in small confined areas," he said. "You have to do everything you can to involve as many people as you can in the circle of opportunity. You can't just keep them out there and live your comfortable existence, wherever it is." D.M.H.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SHEEPSHEAD BAY;
New Language, and a New Life, for Avenue U

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
When the Rev. Paul Tseng moved the Brooklyn Chinese Christian Church from Flatbush into an old American Legion hall in Sheepshead Bay seven years ago, about 30 worshipers went to his weekly Baptist services. These days more than 200 attend.
"The community changed," Mr. Tseng said last week in his church, on East 15th Street and Gravesend Neck Road. "More Chinese came to buy houses and settle. We have the D and Q train here, which goes to Chinatown. We have stores and restaurants on Avenue U. And we have the church." 
 A growing Chinese population is slowly transforming Sheepshead Bay. Markets selling star fruits, bok choy, won ton skins and fresh fish are cropping up around Avenue U's old Italian salumerias and bagel stores. Video stores rent the latest Hong Kong thrillers. And the Ocean Palace Pavilion -- a marble-fronted, two-story, 300-seat restaurant serving seafood and Hong Kong cuisine -- opened in July to become one of the avenue's largest restaurants.
The area's Chinese population has grown from 2,706 in 1980 to about 10,000 now, according to census figures. And Frank Vardy, a senior demographer with the City Planning Department, said the actual number could be significantly higher. He said many Chinese families are moving to Sheepshead Bay from Chinatown, mirroring the migration of Italians and Jews who moved there from the Lower East Side half a century ago. "It's a pattern," he said.
Many were attracted to Sheepshead Bay by its abundance of one- and two-family houses and its proximity to Chinatown via the D train. Once the first waves came,more followed to join the growing community.
Many of the new Chinese businesses -- along with a growing number of Russian stores -- are being credited with revitalizing the commercial stretch along Avenue U, which suffered economically after the Kings Plaza Mall began drawing shoppers away.
"It's the mom-and-pop types of things that you cannot get at the mall," said John Nikas, the chairman of Community Board 15. "Now you've got specialty shops selling foods and clothes that the mall cannot match."
Brenda Tong, a real estate broker at Century 21, said the influx has helped keep the housing market steady while other neighborhoods have declined. Like many other businesses in Sheepshead Bay, Century 21 has Cyrillic, Chinese and Latin lettering on its awning.
Ms. Tong, who has lived in the area for 24 years, was pleased when stores like the V & H Supermarket opened on Avenue U and East 13th Street to sell everything from snails, live crabs, snow pea tips and oyster sauce to green tea, woks and rice cookers.
"I used to go to Chinatown once a week to go shopping," she said. "Now I go here. They have everything."
There have been tensions. In the late 1980's, a series of racist fliers charged that the Chinese were "smiling at us behind our backs and planning to take over the whole neighborhood." And there have been problems with the gangs that prey on Chinese people all over the city: two years ago the police rescued nine hostages from a Bedford Avenue house after they had been kidnapped by members of the Fuk Ching gang.
But Mr. Tseng, of the church, said that relations have improved and that officers from the 61st Precinct have been helpful. Now Mr. Tseng -- whose church comprises two buildings and a basketball court marked by a sign proclaiming "Jesus Is Lord" in English and Chinese -- is thinking about expanding. His summer day camp has grown so large that he now rents space from Public School 254, on East 18th Street.

Imagine the Internet As Electronic Casino

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS

 BODY:
THOSE searching for insights into what will be driving the post-cold war economy may have got an important, if unexpected clue last week: the Alliance Gaming Corporation announced that it was acquiring Bally Gaming International Inc. for $215 million.
Now some might regard the combination of two Las Vegas companies that essentially manufacture souped-up slot machines as something less than an economic milestone. But Craig I. Fields, a man who knows a few things about the cold war, thinks otherwise, and this merger may prove him right by making high-stakes gambling as easy as flipping on your PC -- despite a raft of policy and regulatory hurdles. 
 Mr. Fields is the vice chairman of Alliance Gaming, but he is better known as the former director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, which financed cutting-edge technologies for the Pentagon. Among the known projects Darpa helped shape was the system now called the Internet.
And that is precisely why last week's acquisition was potentially important: Mr. Fields said Alliance Gaming now hopes to transform a computer network developed to defeat the evil empire into a powerful medium for indulging America's growing weakness for wagering.
"I'm frustrated that I haven't been able to move ahead before this," Mr. Fields said. "I think this is going to be received as an entirely new form of entertainment. The prospects are not modest."
After years of fiddling with electronics as merely a way of enhancing the experience of those who visited casinos, the gambling industry has discovered both people like Mr. Fields and the way to bring casinos to the people -- and into the center of American life, the home.
 
Moral Barriers
 Perhaps equally important, it will also transform those devices into voracious collectors of information about what turns each individual gambler on, how they play, what they play and when they play. These are data that will be used to keep people coming back.
That has been a dream of a variety of visionaries and hucksters, but now some major players may make it a reality. Sega, the high-tech video game company, is entering the gambling business with sophisticated new devices, and other slot-machine companies are transforming their machines and putting them on-line. But only very recently has gambling -- once isolated by government in places like this unlikely oasis of neon and temptation -- been able to enter the mainstream through a slow but dramatic lowering of the country's moral barriers and a steady advance of technology.
"When I was looking around for what I would do next I decided to do something in the entertainment and gaming industries because they're now the greatest users of advanced technologies," Mr. Fields said. "It used to be the defense industry."
If that seems jarring, consider how gambling has grown since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The whole gambling economy, including everything from wagering on blackjack and horse racing to the money casinos spend on alcohol, slot machines and staff, is now estimated at $482 billion a year. The take in casinos alone, about $18 billion last year, is more than the amount consumers spent on movie tickets, theater and music concerts combined. Every state except Hawaii and Utah permit some form of gambling now.
And the industry is organizing as never before both to fend off assaults from the Christian right and to lay groundwork for expansion. This summer it organized its first unified trade group, the American Gaming Association, and chose as its head Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., former chairman of the Republican Party.
"When you build gaming facilities, you're not putting up a factory that's spewing out smoke," said Mr. Fahrenkopf of how the industry is pitching its economic role as clean and family-oriented. "But I'm not an advocate for the industry. My job is to make sure that whoever makes decisions at the state level has the correct facts."
How those facts are presented will be crucial as the gambling interests approach the legal hurdles to playing poker on the Internet, such as barriers against certain kinds of gaming across state lines. In addition, there is not yet a secure means of moving money on-line and, without regulation, gamblers will have to worry whether the electronic casinos are fair in their payouts.
 
Ambiaence Counts
 And there is the not unimportant question of whether gambling in your basement office will be as fun-filled as playing in a garishly lit hall, where the air is filled with smoke and the constant ding of bells, where you can catch a Paul Anka show if you like.
"I believe we have the answer to all those questions," promised Mr. Fields. "I can't talk about the details yet. But I think you'll see some real innovation."

The New Latin Scandals Challenge Democracies

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
FOR the third time in less than four years, Latin America has been riveted by the spectacle of a sitting president being subjected to a Watergate-style investigation that could lead to his impeachment. This time the spotlight is on Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of Colombia, implicated by tape recordings and the testimony of former aides as the knowing beneficiary of $6 million in campaign donations from the Cali cocaine cartel.
It is still much too early to tell whether Mr. Samper can survive the scandal, or whether, like Fernando Collor de Melo of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, he will eventually have to resign. But in any case, as the Brazilian magazine Veja put it, "a strange epidemic seems to be devastating the presidential palaces of Latin America" lately: Ecuador's Vice President resigned and fled the country this month because of a corruption investigation; Peru and Guatemala are seeking the extradition of former presidents to face criminal charges, and former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has had to take refuge in the United States amid inquiries into his tenure. 
 In the past, violence or political instability have usually accompanied such crises. But there are several remarkable and encouraging things about this new outbreak. In each case thus far, the military, having been weakened by its own recent inept rule and budget constraints, has avoided the traditional response of throwing out the civilians and taking charge itself in the name of restoring order and probity. Even more striking, the disgraced civilian leaders have not tried to suspend their constitutions or legislatures and proclaim themselves dictators. They have simply stepped down.
"This turbulence is actually welcome and should be regarded as a sign that democratic institutions across the continent are maturing," argues Candido Mendes, a Brazilian political scientist. "What we are seeing is absolute obedience to the rule of law and constitutional procedure, and civil society clearly emerges strengthened and revitalized when that happens."
 
I Rule, Therefore I Rob
 In fact, ordinary citizens, disgusted though they may be with their elected officials, have resisted the time-honored tradition of entrusting the national salvation to a caudillo, the kind of autocratic strongman exemplified by Juan Peron of Argentina. Instead, they are demanding that democratic institutions be given an opportunity to function and that their rulers be held accountable for acts of malfeasance and corruption.
That has not always been the case. Back in the 1950's the powerful governor of Sao Paulo state in Brazil, Ademar de Barros, actually campaigned under the slogan "rouba mas faz," which translates as "he steals, but he gets things done." They may not always have liked it, but Latin Americans were accustomed to slipping a small bribe to a government clerk to get some bureaucratic procedure moving, and expected elected officials to routinely skim 10 percent or so off the top of government contracts.
But the colossal amounts of money that have been injected into the region's once-closed economies over the last 15 years, both from drug trafficking and increased foreign investment, have changed the rules of the game. The stakes are much higher, putting the cost of graft out of reach of the average person -- and enabling the small elite responsible for this inflation of corruption to buy whatever it wants.
"Now if you want something done -- say you need to bribe some official to get your papers taken care of -- it can cost you $50,000," said Eduardo Gamarra, a Bolivian who is the director of the Latin America-Caribbean Center at Florida International University in Miami. "This has distorted every parameter of corruption we knew before, and people are outraged by it."
Prompted by growing popular discontent, the 30 heads of state who attended the Summit of the Americas in Miami last December promised to take tangible steps to combat the continental scourge of corruption. A follow-up meeting is scheduled next month in Uruguay, and there are many signs that a vigilant public does not intend to let this opportunity degenerate into just another empty pledge.
Around the region, for instance, investigative journalism is on the rise and chapters of Transparency International, a citizens' corruption-fighting organization, have been springing up. Several countries, including Costa Rica, Colombia and Bolivia, have also established ombudsmen or independent, nonpartisan constitutional tribunals to assume some of the duties that had been performed by Supreme Courts, which are widely seen as politicized, inefficient and crooked.
No single word either in Spanish or Portuguese corresponds exactly to the English-language notion of "accountability," so many of those involved in the movement have simply adopted the English term. In much the same fashion, tens of thousands of Brazilians marched peacefully in the streets in 1992 with banners imprinted with the English word "impeachment." More recently, middle-class Mexicans have banded together in a nonpartisan grassroots movement called "El Barzon" -- named for the leather strap that tied plows to oxen -- to protest economic policies that they say have beggared their nation while enriching a few corrupt leaders.
 
Impunity Dies Hard
 The deep yearning for honest government also helps explain the transformation of an ordinary civil servant like Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento, Colombia's chief prosecutor, into a national hero. Mr. Valdivieso, whose cousin, Luis Carlos Galan, was assassinated by the Medellin drug cartel when Mr. Galan ran for president in 1990, is the one mainly responsible for summoning Mr. Samper to testify about possible illegal acts, and for imprisoning other powerful officials, including Defense Minister Fernando Botero Zea.
"Society works out different options of its own and finds its own leaders," explained Maria Jimena Duzan, a columnist for the Bogota newspaper El Espectador and author of "Death Beat," a book about the drug cartels and their penetration of Colombian society. "That's a great change for us, to see big, important politicians in jail. For the first time, we are realizing that impunity is not the only reality we can have here."
There are, of course, still many influential pockets of resistance, as well as frequent indications Latin America's tradition of impunity is not going to die easily. In Chile, for example, Gen. Manuel Contreras, the chief of state security during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, spent years defying the court that sentenced him to prison for masterminding the 1976 murder in Washington of former Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier. He was finally jailed Saturday.
In societies in which the powerful have always been exempt from the law, simply obtaining an unfavorable verdict against a general or a president -- let alone jailing one -- is a major achievement that engenders optimism. "We are witnessing a qualitative change," Dr. Mendes said. "Now that there is a political consciousness to build on, we must continue and deepen our efforts, and I think we are capable of that."

Service With Some Bile

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
IT may be hard for many Americans to imagine under what circumstances a salesclerk might actually say to a customer, "Stop shouting, can't you see I'm eating?" But in China, it is common for clerks to abandon their post without notice, and to ignore -- or even insult -- customers who happen to come along.
One of the legacies of Communist rule has been atrocious service. For years such workers could justify their laziness by decrying attentive service as bourgeois. They could rest assured they would not be fired for performing badly. Managers, too, had few incentives to motivate their staff to do better. 
 Now market economics are taking over, and with competition emerging, things are changing, even service. But improving service one step up from bad still leaves the customer with pretty bad.
 
How Bad Is It?
 There is a surplus of pretty bad service in any number of Chinese stores, airports and hotels. But a year ago, as part of a nationwide politeness campaign, the Chinese Government began enforcing a strict policy aimed at reigning in the hostility common at the counter. Just a few months ago, it published a list of 50 phrases that are banned from use at any service counter.
"Didn't you hear me, what do have ears for?" is one such forbidden phrase. "Are you finished talking?" is another. Both hint at the animosity that often erupts at the counter.
If one measure of China's progress toward a functioning economy is a program in which store managers actually demand that their staff be courteous, another is how hard it is to change an old system when the authorities rely mostly on a campaign in newspapers.
Still, the publication of a list of 50 officially banned phrases offers a clue to understanding how bad service is, rather than a reflection of any genuine effort to improve it.
"Buy it if you can afford it, otherwise get out of here," speaks to the impatience that salesclerks are loathe to hide. "What can I do? I didn't break it," echoes the reluctance to take responsibility for a store's faulty products.
Wang Dao, deputy office director at Shanghai's Number One Department Store, one of the stores chosen to lead the campaign, said: "These phrases were chosen because they are so common. Otherwise why would we pick them?"
A ban on such phrases is unlikely to work in any comprehensive way, since the authorities who are so good at policing dissidents are not yet as strict in the service industry. The Chinese have become inured to political campaigns, too, knowing they must heed them in the short term but that enthusiasm will wane after a while.
So for now, many salesclerks are at least pretending to treat the politeness campaign earnestly.
"It's very serious," said Lin Gan, a 45-year-old salesclerk at the electronics counter in the Number One Department Store. "We're not allowed to stand around in groups of more than two. We're not allowed to fold our arms. And, of course, we have to watch what we say."
 
A Half-Hearted Effort
 One floor down, however, in the men's garment section, six salesclerks were huddled, all arms folded, chatting away while two customers tried to get help.
"Okay, okay, what do you want?" one salesclerk, Ye Ping, said finally, skating close to one of the banned phrases.
"I've been in this store 38 years," said Ms. Ye after the customer left without buying anything. Queried about her attitude, she replied, "I've worked hard all these years. I don't see why we are always asked to do better."
Mr. Wang said his store was serious about the campaign and enforcing it with fines and dismissals.
How many of his 2,000 clerks have been fired since the store began its strict policy a year ago?
"No one yet," Mr. Wang said.
How many have been fined?
"It's hard to give an exact number," he said,
Mr. Wang added hopefully: "Change is not going to come overnight. It's going to take some time."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Hey, Rude Clerks: No. 49!"
In China, store clerks were so predictably rude that the government banned 50 of their choicest phrases:
 
1) Hey! 2) Old man. 3) Hey, soldier! 4) Country bumpkin. 5) Darkie (refers to dark-skinned Chinese). 6) What does it have to do with you? 7) Who told you not to look where you're going? 8) If you don't like it, go somewhere else. 9) Ask someone else. 10) Didn't you hear me, what do you have ears for? 11) Take a taxi if you don't like the bus. 12) Get out of the way, or you'll get killed! 13) That's just the way things are! 14) I don't care who you complain to. 15) Are you finished talking? 16) If you're not buying, what are looking at? 17) Buy it if you can afford it, otherwise get out of here. 18) Are you buying or not, have you made up your mind? 19) What are you yelling about? Wait a while. 20) Don't you see I'm busy? What's the hurry? 21) Hurry up and pay. 22) I can't solve this, go complain to whomever you want. 23) I don't know. 24) I just told you, why are you asking again? 25) Don't stand in the way. 26) I have no change, wait here. 27) Why didn't you choose well when you bought it? 28) Go ask the person who sold it to you. 29) If you don't like it, talk to the manager. 30) Time is up, be quick. 31) The price is posted, can't you see it yourself? 32) No exchanges, that's the rule. 33) If you're not buying, don't ask. 34) You're asking me, who should I ask? 35) Stop shouting. Can't you see I'm eating? 36) It's not my fault. 37) We haven't opened yet, wait a while. 38) What are you doing? Be quick. 39) I'm not in charge, don't ask me so many question. 40) Didn't I tell you? How come you don't get it? 41) I have no change, go get some yourself. 42) Don't push me. 43) If you want it, speak up, if you don't, get out of the way. Next! 44) Don't talk so much, say it quickly. 45) Now you tell me. What have you been doing all this time? 46) The busier I am, the more you bother me.

HEADLINE: NO DEAL;
50 Years of Droning for Diplomacy

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
IN the annals of the United Nations, this week may be remembered as the one when they installed a traffic light. Not for vehicles or even pedestrians, but for words. At the lectern where a three-day marathon of speeches by more than 140 heads of state and government begins today to mark the United Nations' 50th birthday, there are now green, yellow and red lights to signal speakers to start, slow down and stop after five minutes.
The remarkable gab-a-thon in the General Assembly will highlight the foremost accomplishment of United Nations, though it is one that many of its critics will surely scoff at. That is talk, and lots of it. For half a century, diplomats here like to think, world-class chin music has helped deter global war. 
 In that time, United Nations speechifying has evolved into a genre all its own, marked by exquisite courtesies, lavish praise, grandstanding to televised audiences back home and coded language that conceals all manner of evil intent, and often withholds a fair amount of candor in the interests of a civility not always present in the earliest debates. Speechmaking here today is like those related arts of tedious circumlocution, legalese and bureaucratese, in that often the primary aim is hardly to be concise, frank or provocative at all. And here the stakes are arguably much higher than in the courtroom or office.
 
Greater Numbers
 Inserting a stopwatch and a five-minute rule into this process today (when Presidents Clinton, Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Fidel Castro of Cuba are scheduled to speak) will be an interesting experiment. This is the chamber where for half a century the powerful have indulged themselves for hours on the sounds of their own voices and where an African diplomat, Abdul Salim Salim of Tanzania, once danced on the desktops to celebrate an American humiliation over the expulsion of Taiwan. But theatrical or just long-winded, debate has rarely produced a historic breakthrough.
The need to put the brakes on speeches arises not because they are getting longer or more outrageous -- in fact they have shrunk substantially and been tamed since the United Nations' early years. Numbers are the cause of today's crisis. In 1945, there were 51 members nations; now there are 185. All their leaders or stand-ins, plus a score of other world figures, are on the speakers' roster over the next three days.
To Betty Teslenko, the five-minute limit may be something of a blessing. Ms. Teslenko, now 73, has been taking dictation in the Assembly since 1945, and she thinks the quality has dropped precipitously in the age of television and speechwriters.
"In the early days, the debates were really very wonderful," she said. "There was less text and more extemporaneous debate. There were real orators here."
"Abba Eban was one of the really great ones," she said of the Israeli statesman. "He and Mohammed Fawzi Bey of Egypt had some wonderful debates and witty exchanges." She also recalls the verbal dexterity of Adlai E. Stevenson, who served under President John F. Kennedy, and the acerbic Krishna Menon of Egypt, who once actually collapsed during a Security Council speech but revived himself and carried on.
Armed with her steno pad, Ms. Teslenko not only wrote down what all these people said, but also sometimes smoothed over the words to save someone embarrassment.
"We're called verbatim reporters, but that's a bit of a misnomer," she said, recalling a speaker dwelling on South Africa under apartheid. "He said that guerrillas 'go out and expose themselves in the bush every day.' That's not what he meant." When the text came out, she had neatly rendered the troublesome phrase "exposing themselves to danger."
 
The Tumult of '60
 The General Assembly's most memorable session was indisputably 1960, when a new world was being born of decolonization and revolution and emotions ran high.
"It was an extraordinary time," said William J. vanden Heuvel, then an aspiring New York politician who would later become the United States permanent representative at the United Nations. He was one of the only two envoys ever to be physically assaulted on the job here, when Trotskyites from California burst into the Security Council chamber and covered him and his Soviet counterpart, Oleg Troyanovsky, with red paint. As Mr. vanden Heuvel tells the story, Mr. Troyanovsky's reaction was, "Better red than dead."
The 1960 Assembly session is best remembered for Mr. Castro's four-hour speech and for Nikita S. Khrushchev's explosion after a Filipino delegate, Lorenzo Sumulong, suggested that a Soviet resolution on decolonization should also cover the peoples of Eastern Europe. Mr. Khrushchev turned on Mr. Sumulong, calling him "this toady of American imperialism."
The Soviet leader marched angrily up to the podium, then back to his seat, took off his shoe, waved it around his head and slapped it on the desk in front of him. In the tumult that followed, the Assembly President, Frederick Boland of Ireland, broke his gavel trying to restore order.
Today, speeches always begin with kudos to the chair: "Mr. President, I am confident that your high competence and profound experience will contribute effectively to the success of the work of the present historic session," the Foreign Minister of Iraq, Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahaf, said to Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal when debate began in September. Ditto almost every other Foreign Minister to take the stand.
Then the thanks to last year's presiding officer: "To your distinguished predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy of Cote d'Ivoire, I should like to convey our deep appreciation," began Ali Alatas, Foreign Minister of Indonesia.
Relevant generalities follow: "A 50th anniversary is a climacteric, usually joyous but not necessarily so," said Pranab Mukerjee, India's Foreign Minister. "In ancient India this is around the time in a man's life that he would be expected to withdraw into a forest."
A few pages into the speech, the meat arrives. It might be a defense of a country's policies, a don't-touch-us warning, a plan for righting the world's economic or social wrongs or a broad commitment to noble causes.
At the end, let phrases ring: "History moves on," Qian Qichen of China said. "Mankind is progressing."
Colin Keating, New Zealand's representative here, said the greatest tragedy that has befallen the General Assembly in half a century is that its once-electric, off-the-cuff give and take has been replaced by made-for-television performances. On many days, the Assembly hall is all but empty as speaker after speaker drones on to the cameras. The business of the Assembly has shifted to committees and working groups.
"Delegates don't do much listening to what anyone else says," he said. "They charge in and give a speech and then charge out again. To a large extent now, the speeches are for a domestic audience."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
When Spies Look Out For the Almighty Buck

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IMAGINE you are in the White House, drawing up a list of hot spots abroad where the nation's intelligence agencies should be nosing around. A few things to watch are obvious: Serbian troop movements, the Iraqi and North Korean nuclear programs, and China's military maneuvers off Taiwan's coast.
But does it make sense for the Central Intelligence Agency to leap on the rumors -- which flew through Wall Street and Washington last week -- that a major Japanese bank might be about to go under? If it happened, such a collapse could set off a cash crisis that could circle the globe in minutes, requiring the Federal Reserve to pump billions of dollars into the system to prevent what the Treasury Department delicately calls "a contagion effect." 
 With the Japanese Government unlikely to volunteer much information, learning the truth could require waging a surveillance campaign against Japan -- America's most important political friend in the Pacific -- with the same ferocity as is customary against a military opponent. It is a mystery whether the United States might be turning its elaborate spying equipment, some of it in Japan, on conversations between Japanese bankers and the Ministry of Finance. But many Japanese officials now believe it is likely.
And that raises a question few in the Clinton Administration or the intelligence community are willing to discuss openly: Is the economic advantage gained by such surveillance worth risking America's already rocky relationship with Japan?
Or with so many in Washington officials repeating the mantra that economic security and national security are now synonymous, is such spying to be expected?
The question of how far to go to secure American economic interests is especially sensitive in Washington these days, after revelations that the C.I.A. listened in on the conversations of Japanese negotiators during heated automobile talks last spring -- one example of what has quietly become routine practice. Japanese officials (who are among the world's premier practitioners of economic espionage) feigned shock and demanded explanations. The Administration, preparing for President Clinton's visit to Japan next month, responded that it wanted to think about its response.
There is nothing new about spying on allies: Just ask the Israelis. Nor is assessing the economies of friends and enemies a new C.I.A. task: Its analysts spent four decades tracking the Soviet Union's industrial capability and the better part of last year peeling back the layers of Mexico's financial balancing acts.
Still, the elevation of commercial interests to what Secretary of State Warren Christopher calls "the very top of our foreign policy agenda" has deepened the agency's clandestine economic intelligence-gathering.
"The question is the tradeoff," said Philip Zelikow, a former career diplomat now at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who is completing a study of the changed world of economic intelligence. "You have to ask whether this stuff is worth the candle, or could you get to the same conclusions by massaging public and 'gray area' information. And then you have to balance it against other political interests."
Mr. Zelikow and many members of the Clinton Administration say that the balancing is ad hoc at best, and usually does not happen at all. During the car talks the C.I.A. was on autopilot: It was assumed that the Japanese, in the absence of eavesdropping satellites of their own, were using every other means to scope out the American position (including taking American journalists out to endless lunches), and that the United States should use every means at its disposal to do the same. Nor was there much discussion about the merits of spying against France on the GATT talks. There should have been; when the C.I.A. blundered, France asked the station chief and his underlings to leave, and intelligence liaison was suspended.
Despite such incidents, so far nobody has worked out a system for insuring that there will be debate on the merits of an economic spying mission aimed at an ally. "We're quickly learning," one senior Administration official said this week, "that we have to think through what is appropriate and what is not."
 
An Intelligence Flood
 The issue has crept up on the Administration because in just a few years, what had been a trickle of economic intelligence about Japan, Germany, France, Britain and others has turned into a torrent. Every day the Treasury, the United States Trade Representative's Office and the Commerce Department receive raw and digested intelligence on everything from France's position on letting more Hollywood movies into the European Union to the blandishments that foreign governments offer Indonesia's ministers for a slice of its boom in power generation.
The intelligence agencies, eager to prove that their $28 billion budget is as vital to American security as it was in the days of counting Soviet missiles, are more than happy to oblige. Their problem is "adding value;" in many cases, including the Japanese banking crisis, a wealth of data is already publicly available. Now, almost by default, the agency has become the integrator of the public and the secret.
"The fact of the matter is that the intelligence agencies are the center where all this is put together -- the economic, the political and the security concerns," said Robert B. Zoellick, a former top State Department official who handled much of the economic portfolio in the Bush Administration. "And perhaps that makes sense, because they should have more detachment than the individual economic agencies would."
Some, including traditionalists in the agency, say this is no way for a superpower to spend its intelligence resources. Winning a contract in China, they argue, will never be as central to national security as keeping Pakistan and India from a nuclear war.
But more and more, policy makers are echoing the view of Jeffrey E. Garten, who just left his job as Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade to become dean of Yale's school of management. He made the case that economic interests are still subordinated to political concerns too often -- even in this White House -- out of a fear that the United States not be seen to be using its muscle for "crass mercantilism, unworthy of a great power and especially a lone superpower."
"That's the wrong way to look at it," he concluded. "If America can exercise effective commercial diplomacy, its authority and leverage will be much more substantial, not just in the economic realm, but across the board."
Such logic would lead to the conclusion that if the economic stakes are high enough, it may make perfect sense to turn the nation's satellites on Japanese bankers. The problem is how to explain it to the Japanese when it all becomes embarrassingly public, as this sort of thing inevitably does. The State Department is still working on that one, and no one expects it to have a convincing answer any time soon.

HEADLINE: Adviser Who Has President's Ear Thrived as Anti-Clinton Strategist

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
If Republicans are looking for a guide to explain how to defeat President Clinton next year, they need look no further than the President's chief political strategist, Dick Morris.
Republican politicians and campaign strategists who have worked closely with Mr. Morris in campaigns around the country recounted in interviews that only months before he emerged as a prominent player in the White House, he openly and forcefully ridiculed Mr. Clinton's personal conduct and policy stands -- and advised his clients about how to seize on the President's vulnerabilities for their own campaigns. 
 It is widely known that Mr. Morris has had a long and sometimes tense relationship with Mr. Clinton, beginning with his first campaign for governor of Arkansas in 1978, and that Mr. Morris has since divided his loyalties between Democrats and Republicans. But the extent of Mr. Morris's criticism of Mr. Clinton has never before been documented.
In a speech he proposed for a Republican candidate running last year, for example, Mr. Morris wrote that Mr. Clinton's military budget cuts "make our military a joke," that his economic stimulus package "funds Alpine slides in Puerto Rico and warming huts for swimming pools in Connecticut" and that Americans "don't want gays in the military."
Asked if the White House was troubled by Mr. Morris's past comments about Mr. Clinton, his press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said: "I can't honestly say whether that will be of concern to the President. The President prefers an environment where there is a free give-and-take, but he prefers that that occur privately."
The proposed speech was written by Mr. Morris for Jim Smith, who was Secretary of State in Florida when he ran in the Republican primary for Governor in 1994. Mr. Smith's campaign manager, Brian Ballard, said Mr. Morris had urged him to contrast his candidate's experience as a prosecutor with the ethics controversies swirling around Mr. Clinton.
"He said, 'Let's use the Bill Clinton analogy,' " recalled Mr. Ballard, a chief of staff to former Gov. Bob Martinez. "He really thought Whitewater was going to be an issue that sucked the President up. He said all the happenings of the Rose Law Firm were going to destroy Bill Clinton's Presidency. He said he knew some things going on that weren't out yet. When I heard he was working for Bill Clinton, I was shocked."
The thrust of Mr. Ballard's recollections was corroborated by 10 other people, most of whom spoke on the condition that they not be identified. They also described conversations with Mr. Morris in which he criticized Mr. Clinton, often for his personal conduct.
Mr. Morris may even have had a favorite candidate for President in 1996 -- and it was not Mr. Clinton. Several close advisers of Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts said Mr. Morris, while working on the Governor's re-election campaign in 1994, had frequently encouraged the idea that Governor Weld, a centrist Republican, run for President in 1996, stressing his background as a Federal prosecutor and contrasting it with Mr. Clinton's ethical troubles.
"Dick always felt strongly that the Governor had great Presidential potential," said Ronald Kaufman, a White House political director in the Bush Administration who is close to Mr. Weld. "In a very analytical way, he would talk about the race and the perceived problems the incumbent has based on his performance and some of the perceived problems that arose out of Whitewater." But Mr. Kaufman disputed others who said Mr. Morris had been out to do in Mr. Clinton, saying, "I would classify it as analytical versus critical."
Whatever the motive, Mr. Morris's advice to these candidates raises questions about the allegiance of the man whom Mr. Clinton has turned to for advice on how to respond to the Republicans in Congress and how to plan his re-election.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Morris insisted that he had never traded on inside information about the Clintons or made disparaging comments about their ethical behavior. And he disputed the accounts from people close to Mr. Weld that he had counseled the Governor to run for President.
"I never questioned President Clinton's ethics and never urged anyone to run against him in any election," Mr. Morris said. "On the contrary, I have specifically refused on several occasions to become involved in campaigns against Clinton because of my loyalty and respect for him."
He added, "These allegations are a collection of hearsay gossip -- largely from Republican political operatives who are trying to hurt President Clinton."
Mr. McCurry said today that Mr. Morris was a valuable adviser to the President. "The up and down relationship of Bill Clinton and Dick Morris has been well chronicled," he said. "But there is no question that Mr. Morris helps the President advance the argument the President is making to the country about his policies."
Governor Weld brushed aside suggestions that Mr. Morris had urged him to run. "I've always felt that Dick Morris was a brilliant strategist and a pro," he said, "and nothing has caused me to see fit to change my opinion."
Many current and former associates of Mr. Morris, who is 47, agreed that he was a sharp political strategist who has helped the President in recent months by pulling him toward the right on many issues. But they also said his performance had been erratic, and several asserted that he had worked for so many candidates of such different ideologies that they could not trust him. Some said they had been put off by the way Mr. Morris would talk about Mr. Clinton.
Brose McVey, who was campaign manager for the re-election drive of Senator Daniel R. Coats, Republican of Indiana, in 1992, said that he had dismissed Mr. Morris before the end of the campaign. He said Mr. Morris had often spoken disparagingly of Mr. Clinton and suggested that Mr. Morris had been trying to demonstrate that he was loyal only to Republicans.
"There seemed to be this fascination with Clinton that followed Dick wherever he want," Mr. McVey said. "There was an effort for Dick to beat up on Clinton in order to validate his conversion. He was motivated to treat Clinton like the Antichrist." He added, "Most of the chats about Clinton went to issues of his personal life."
One example of Mr. Morris's anti-Clinton counsel comes from the speech he drafted for Mr. Smith, who lost in the Republican primary for Governor of Florida last year. Mr. Morris was never formally hired by the campaign, but he proposed the speech as a sample of his strategy should he come on board.
The speech indicted the central themes of the first half of the Clinton Administration, with Mr. Morris building the oratory around the notion that neither Mr. Clinton nor Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat, would be re-elected. The tone of the speech is the opposite of the praise Mr. Morris showered on Mr. Clinton on Thursday night at the McManus Midtown Democratic Association in Manhattan, when he called the President a "genius" and said that "meeting with him is the most daunting experience you can have."
In the sample speech, Mr. Morris wrote: "These stellar forces which are helping our Republican Party grow and strengthen are, of course, President Bill Clinton and Governor Lawton Chiles. Bill, Lawton, we couldn't have done it without you!"
Continuing the Clinton-Chiles theme, Mr. Morris wrote that they would "discover that America and Florida knows that higher taxes don't close deficits, they cause them."
"They are going to discover that America and Florida knows that we shouldn't stop providing good health care just to provide universal health care," the speech continued.
"They'll learn that we don't want gays in the military," it said. "They'll learn that we don't want a state that spends a third of its education dollars outside the classroom or a nation that funds Alpine slides in Puerto Rico and warming huts for swimming pools in Connecticut and calls it a stimulus program. They'll learn that we won't accept defense cuts that make our military a joke. They'll learn American values and common sense."
He went on: "The only difference is the date of their graduation. Bill Clinton will complete his course of study when he is defeated in 1996. But Lawton Chiles is on an accelerated course. He's going to learn his lesson in November 1994!"
Asked about his proposed speech, Mr. Morris said: "When I work for a client, they tell me what they want to say and I say it for them. They're not my opinions; they're the client's opinions. That was reflective of Jim Smith's opinions, not mine. I'm not running for Governor -- he was."
But Mr. Ballard, Mr. Smith's campaign manager, said that he had rejected the speech outright because he had wanted to focus on themes relating to the rival Republicans, not to the President. "That was an unsolicited speech," Mr. Ballard said. "He wrote it on his own. Not only was it not Jim Smith's style or Jim Smith's thoughts, it was never delivered by Jim Smith."
While Mr. Morris has maintained an on-again, off-again relationship with the Clintons for years, it is unclear how much he saw or spoke with the President when he was advising Republican campaigns in 1992 and 1994. But Champ Terney, a Republican lawyer in Jackson, Miss., who is close to Mr. Morris, said that he was one of the few people who knew that Mr. Morris was advising the Clintons during the turbulent Democratic primaries in 1992 -- at the same time he was working for the 1994 re-election campaign of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi and other Republicans.
Mr. Terney said that Hillary Rodham Clinton had made the initial overture but that Mr. Morris had kept it quiet out of fear of angering his Republican clients.
"He called me one day four years ago and said, 'Champ, Hillary Clinton called me to come to Little Rock,' " Mr. Terney said, speaking of Mr. Morris. "He said, 'I've talked to Trent, and he said it's O.K. I'm going to be involved behind the scenes.' "
Mr. Terney, the son-in-law of the late Senator James O. Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat, said that at the time, Mr. Clinton had been confronted by allegations that he was a womanizer and that he had dodged the draft. "They were involved in a hot political campaign," Mr. Terney said. "They realized they had problems. And they feel secure with Dick and his political judgment."
Some Republicans say they will never forgive Mr. Morris for telling them he had forsaken Mr. Clinton and the Democrats, only to become the President's leading political adviser.
"My biggest beef is that he told us a baldfaced lie," said Allan B. Hubbard Jr., who was deputy chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle and worked with Mr. Morris in Senator Coats's campaign. "When he came to work for Coats, we had a candid conversation. He said, 'Look, I've gone both ways. I realize now that was a mistake. I will never, never work for a Democrat again.' He repeated it as forcefully as he possibly could."

HEADLINE: Shannon Hoon, the Lead Singer Of Blind Melon, Is Dead at 28

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Shannon Hoon, a singer and songwriter whose band, Blind Melon, shot to the top of the charts in 1993 with their eclectic single "No Rain," died today. He was 28.
Mr. Hoon died on his tour bus, said Sgt. Marlon DeFillo of the New Orleans police. His band members apparently could not wake him and called the authorities. 
 Sergeant DeFillo said Mr. Hoon, a native of Lafayette, Ind., died about 1:30 P.M. The bus was parked in a parking lot at the time. The sergeant said that there was no sign of trauma, and that the cause of death remained unclassified pending an autopsy.
The band, based in Los Angeles, was in New Orleans to play at Tipitina's, a music club. In Los Angeles, a security guard at Capitol Records, the band's record company, said that no one was available to comment.
After mixed reviews of the band's appearance at Woodstock '94, the group had been beset by personal problems. Mr. Hoon had been arrested for drunken and disorderly conduct in New Orleans during the recording of the band's second album, "Soup."
On stage, Mr. Hoon was wildly emotional, spinning around his microphone stand in bare feet and sometimes shedding his clothes. His high-pitched voice was described by a critic for The New York Times as "a vintage whine" that sounded like "Neil Young after a coughing fit," as he sang with desperation of the uncertainties of youth and the fears of entering adulthood.
The band, which mixed trappings of 1960's psychedelia with rural rhythms, got its name from neighbors of the group's bassist, Brad Smith. They were unemployed hippies in Mississippi who called each other "blind melons."

HEADLINE: One Campaign Over, Another to Begin?

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Va., Oct. 20

 BODY:
With two appearances in this Navy town today, Gen. Colin L. Powell completed the last lap of his book-signing tour -- 29 events in 23 locales in 20 days -- without getting writer's cramp, losing his voice or dropping any easy clues about two questions on the minds of his admirers and putative Presidential rivals: Will he run for President in 1996? And if he does, what's his raison d'etre for wanting to move into the Oval Office in 1997?
For the umpteenth time since his book tour began, General Powell said today that he intended to spend the coming weeks deciding whether to run for the Presidency or to opt for some other form of service to the nation. The General's mulling-things-over posture, however, has not deterred campaign professionals from acting as though it is a fait accompli that he will run. Some professionals have reached out to General Powell's friends and advisers, including Ken Duberstein, a White House chief of staff for Ronald Reagan, for advice on joining a Powell campaign. 
 During the weeks General Powell crisscrossed the country, interest in him and his Presidential ambitions never flagged. All of his final stops -- Atlanta on Thursday and Norfolk today -- drew long lines of book buyers. If anything, some of the major news events of recent weeks -- O. J. Simpson's acquittal on double-murder charges and the Million Man March -- have only heightened interest in the retired general's grasp of domestic issues and have led local television news reporters to ask constantly for his analysis of the nation's racial problems.
Generally throughout the book tour, General Powell espoused centrist ideas that seemed to resonate with moderate Democrats, moderate Republicans, independents and some G.O.P. conservatives.
The retired general's admirers, of course, and those shopping around for an alternative to the current cast of candidates were more than willing to explain why they felt he might be Presidential timber. The Powell loyalists and the Powell browsers who lined up early this morning at the Norfolk Navy Base's main retail exchange and later this afternoon at Prince Books and Coffee House were pleased to have the retired four-star general sign their copies of his book, "My American Journey."
"Colin Powell is a very good man," said Janice Van Houweling, an employee of the base exchange who gained a spot among the first 20 in line by camping out at 4 A.M. "I'd like to see him run for President. He has the same beliefs I do on abortion, gun control and crime." Her issues checklist does not mean that she is a classic liberal. She said she was a registered Republican -- "an open-minded" one -- who voted twice for Ronald Reagan and for George Bush in 1992.
As upbeat as one might expect Powell supporters to be, some were concerned about the impact of recent events on his potential candidacy.
"I have a little bit of a problem with the O. J. business," said Dan Westbrook of Jasper, Ga. "I wonder if that's going to take some steam" out of his political future. Mr. Westbrook's friend in line at a book signing, Dick Roy, said that because of the Simpson trial and the march, General Powell will now be "seen as a black man." If there is any negative effect on General Powell's viability as a candidate, Mr. Westbrook said he hoped that it would "blow over."
In interviews in a Detroit suburb, around Atlanta and here, this self-selected but racially and economically diverse slice of American book buyers and voters articulated similar reasons for wanting General Powell to run. His centrist views on most issues, according to these people, could make him the great moderate hope in Republican primaries -- a man who could galvanize party moderates and woo a significant slice of Republican conservatives like the Rev. Tim Mowry of Traverse City, Mich., and Mr. Westbrook.
A Vietnam veteran and the owner of a small chemical company, Mr. Westbrook said he wanted General Powell to run as a Republican. "I hope he does," he said as he stood near the front of the book-signing line inside the cavernous Sam's Club in Duluth, Ga., on Thursday morning. "Politically, I'm a pretty staunch Republican, a very hard-shell Republican." He said General Powell's moderate views did not scare him off. "He's a little more moderate on certain things," he said. "I think he's a fine outstanding man. It's hard to put into words what he exemplifies."
General Powell's performance during the Persian Gulf War, Mr. Westbrook said, restored his pride in military service. "A lot of people are trying to be everything to everybody," he said. "And Bill Clinton represents the fact that that's hard to do. Maybe there is room for a middle-of-the-road Republican."
Mr. Mowry, a conservative Lutheran minister who said he had attended every Republican Presidential inauguration since 1969, organized his day Wednesday so that he and his wife and two children would be near the head of the line at the Barnes & Noble in West Bloomfield, an affluent suburb outside Detroit.
"Colin Powell is not as conservative as I am," Mr. Mowry said. "But the fact that he is an ethical man and a moral man goes a long way with me." Mr. Mowry said he did not know whether General Powell would be trounced in Republican primaries dominated by conservative voters. "He doesn't have to come across as being extremely conservative," said Mr. Mowry. "If he runs an inclusive campaign, he'll do well. He'd be a shoe-in for vice president on anybody's ticket."
Even those who are squarely in General Powell's corner wonder about a moderate's chances of prevailing in Republican primaries. "I would prefer it if he would run as a Republican," said Roy McGinn, a Navy electronic technician stationed in Norfolk. "But I'm worried that because of some of his stands he won't win. There are too many conservative Republicans who might try to squelch him."
Staunch is not exactly the word Paula Leach would use to describe her brand of Republicanism. In recent Presidential elections, Mrs. Leach voted for Ronald Reagan twice and George Bush twice but calls herself an independent Republican, and she said she was eager to see General Powell run. "He's a very independent thinker and no one is going to push him into something he doesn't want to do," said Mrs. Leach, of Rochester Hills, Mich., who has a son in the Army. "I have more respect for Colin Powell than for other political figures."
During stops in the Midwest and the South this week, General Powell's remarks in brief "press availabilities" suggested that he had not become intoxicated by all the attention that he and his book have received. In West Bloomfield, he said that he would never confuse the popularity he enjoyed with the political ratings citizens give elected officials. And he has reminded the press at almost each stop that running for President is not his only option.
Whether it is winning the hearts and minds of a thoughtful conservative like Mr. Westbrook or attracting the attention of a disgruntled Democrat, General Powell must now figure out whether his appeal among some voters as the uncandidate can be easily converted into political support, financial contributions and votes for a declared candidate. In essence, whether he is a feel-good flash-in-the-pan celebrity with a hot book or the real thing many Americans say they want, a leader of unassailable character and judgment?
What his admirers often see first is a quintessential role model. "I think he's rational," said Kathleen Davidson, a Smyrna, Ga., resident who was first in line at the Oxford bookstore in a posh section of Atlanta on Thursday. "He embodies the American work ethic." Mrs. Davidson said she admired his life style and family as well. "He appears to be a family man," she said. "I'd prefer it if more of our politicians live it and not just preach it."
In the closing days of his book tour, General Powell has offered no public answer to the other big questions: Where would he take the nation? What's his vision? Since he is the uncandidate, his observations remain broad and sweeping. As close as he comes is the response he offered when asked whether conservatives in the Republican Party viewed him as a liberal for his pro-choice stance and his qualified support for affirmative action. "I'm really not trying to craft a message," he said during a brief news conference in West Bloomfield. "I'm trying to tell people what I feel, what I believe about the issues."
Occasionally, though, General Powell's remarks inch dangerously close to those that would be made by a man on the cusp of entering the Presidential race. Here in Norfolk today, when he was asked if a Robert Novak column about him had stung this week, he opened his response with a classic Powell sound bite and closed his answer with thoughts and phrasing that could foreshadow a run for the White House.
"I haven't gone ga-ga or run into a bunker and hidden," he said. "It's not the first time in my life people have criticized me. I understand that the political world will be one of constant pouring over everything I say, everything I do. And I will have political opponents who will attack me regularly and try to persuade people to follow their ideas. This is part of the great American dialogue; it's called democracy. I fully understand it, and I fully know what I'll be getting into if I join the political debate."

HEADLINE: THE U.N. AT 50: THE DIPLOMATS;
For Many Who Serve, No Room for Pomp

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
The diplomat's typical day begins in an apartment in Rego Park, Queens. Tesfa Seyoum, charge d'affaires for the African nation of Eritrea, then boards the G train to his modest midtown office, where his duties are multiple: debating disarmament or human rights as one of his country's representatives at the United Nations; or typing, filing and answering the phone.
"That's the routine," said Mr. Seyoum. "I am diplomat, administrator, and secretary to myself." 
 Mr. Seyoum is not paid a salary, but a "subsistence allotment" of $800 a month (Eritrea's formal representative to the United Nations, who doubles as his country's Ambassador to Washington, receives $1,200 a month). Mr. Seyoum's wife babysits for extra income; his children attend public school. And his sense of economy is such that his business cards, printed with a misspelling of his name, have all been self-corrected in pen.
The Eritrean diplomat's spartan, constrained life is far from the exception among the men and women assigned to the United Nations from around the world. Of the 185 nations with representatives at the U.N., nearly two-thirds are categorized as economically underdeveloped. For most of those nations, there are no limousines, no elaborate fetes, no casual arrogance about unpaid bills or parking regulations. They don't make for easy stereotypes.
And so in the pomp and security attending the arrival of world leaders for the United Nations' 50th anniversary, it may go largely unnoticed that many of the diplomats for the poorer countries live in Queens or Staten Island, occupying a circumscribed world of long hours, shared fax machines and monthly dramas about whether the money from back home will arrive. Their spouses usually work; their health insurance coverage, State Department officials say, is typically nonexistent. The unpretentious ordinariness of the lives of these diplomats -- offset slightly by tax breaks and a certain immunity from bill collectors -- can be measured in myriad ways.
A diplomat from Laos, unable to support his family here or pay for airfare, hasn't seen his relatives in three years. While eager to say she is living out a dream, Consuela Maria Maas, first secretary at the Honduran mission, lacks health insurance and is so busy that she's lucky to make it home to Astoria one night a week to cook a meal. The ambassador from the Republic of Georgia, short of hard currency from his beleaguered Government, said he once had to personally borrow money from a friend to pay his staff. Dornella Seth, a diplomat from Antigua who lives in Co-op City in the Bronx, said her country had staged but one reception in the last six years.
Zaire, unable to withstand the monthly financial hemorrhage caused by Manhattan office rents, decided to combine its official mission with its U.N. diplomat's residence in North Caldwell, N.J. Diplomats from the Maldives, who live doubled-up in an East Side apartment, have not moved their official car from the United Nations garage since July. The delegate from Rwanda arrived at his country's official residence in Bronxville last year only to discover that his predecessor had left and taken the bed, television and refrigerator with him.
All of this, of course, is set in contrast to, say, the French Mission. France has more than a dozen diplomats and another three dozen support workers assigned to its mission at One Dag Hammarskjold Plaza. Its United Nations representative occupies a Park Avenue duplex, and many of the lesser officials live in apartments across the city that the country owns.
Robert Moller, a counselor to the United States Mission to the United Nations, said certain financially struggling missions use a rotating cast of office workers, paying them low wages, but assuring the low-level foreign diplomats of continued legal status. And he said the problem regarding health insurance had grown so great that talks were being held with Beth Israel Medical Center about establishing what he called "a diplomatic H.M.O." The Georgian mission to the United Nations is housed in a small office on the ninth floor of the old Soviet Union compound on 67th Street. The Russians allow them to stay for free; there is one copying machine; U.N. memoranda are stacked on the floor. Most of the staff of five live in the Bronx.
"We are a poor country," said Peter Chkheidze, the Georgian Ambassador. "Most of my calls to other diplomats begin like this: help us, please."
Domingos Ferreira, head of the United Nations mission for Sao Tome e Principe, off Africa's western coast, knows how capriciously the diplomatic life here can turn. When the cocoa export business went bust, his country sent home his fellow diplomats, and he sent his wife and children back as well. Things got so bad that he moved from Hackensack, N.J., to Roosevelt Island in Manhattan, to avoid the cost of daily bridge tolls.
"I feel embarrassed sometimes -- before my landlords, before the U.S. Government," said Mr. Ferreira. "I have enough salary to survive. Rich is out of the question."
Like Mr. Ferreira, the Eritrean, Mr. Seyoum refuses to complain about his less than sumptuous diplomatic life. Eritrea endured 30 years of war before becoming an independent country in 1993. The average life expectancy in the northeast African nation is 46 years -- Mr. Seyoum will turn 47 soon -- and the average annual per capita income is $115.
"My life here requires a certain amount of commitment," said Mr. Seyoum, who noted proudly that Eritrea makes its annual payments to the United Nations in full and on time. "But I do not crave luxury."
Daily life at Rwanda's mission to the U.N. is one that combines determination and heartbreak, embarrassment but great pride, too. Manzi Bakuramutsa, the delegate, says people, assuming the worst because of his country's state of bloodshed and deprivation, ask him how he manages. He tells them his driver doubles as clerk, that he sometimes sleeps in his office, that he negotiates hard with the utility companies, and that he has taken loans from other countries.

HEADLINE: Delegates of Labor Gather, Battered but Now Buoyant

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

 BODY:
The nation's labor unions, for years mired on the margins of industry and politics and lately rent by discord, are massing in New York City this week to try to renew themselves.
Four months after an insurgency chased Lane Kirkland from the presidency of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the federation's national convention will choose as his successor either his longtime deputy, Thomas R. Donahue, or a leader of the coup, John J. Sweeney, in the first contested presidential election in the organization's 40-year history. 
 But far more than the selection of a new face to lead them was on the minds of the delegates as they began gathering this weekend for sessions that do not officially begin until tomorrow. While troubles remain, labor these days is becoming infused with a sense of renaissance, buoyed by union mergers that promise renewed strength; by a new emphasis on organizing unskilled, low-wage workers, a development reminiscent of the earliest days of the American labor movement; by plans to mount aggressive campaigns against Congressional Republicans at the polls next year, and by a movement to open the federation's top ranks to long-excluded women and minorities.
To a large extent, changes like these were probably inevitable if big labor was to survive as a force in the American economy. Even now, its officials worry of its consigning itself to "irrelevance," a term that Mr. Sweeney was the first federation leader to invoke openly.
"That's what this convention is about," he said in an interview. "Our numbers continue to decline. Our political effectiveness continues to decline."
The weeklong national convention is the first for the federation since the Republican sweep last November reduced union partisans in Congress to a small minority. Largely as a result of that sweep, the federation now sees itself as the only remaining sizable institution in a position to speak for American workers and thwart what it calls a relentless political assault on their wages, benefits and longstanding rights, including the freedom to strike or organize without fear of being discharged.
Both candidates for the presidency are Irish-American New Yorkers, groomed in the same service workers' local in the city, but they bring very different credentials to the election, scheduled for Wednesday.
Mr. Sweeney, 61, is head of a union that, during a decade of shrinking membership among unions generally, has doubled in size, to one million, by attracting the low-wage workers that many other unions have ignored. He arrives at the convention, held every two years, claiming the support of unions that account for 55 percent of the votes.
Mr. Donahue, 67, who has been president of the federation since Mr. Kirkland was sent into forced retirement this summer, is the candidate of most small unions and professes support for the entire Kirkland record, which critics say was largely characterized by sluggishness in organizing. Mr. Donahue acknowledges that he is behind in the race but says he hopes to lure more votes his way, and his supporters are looking for fights over rules to let some unions, whose delegates normally vote as unanimous blocks, split their votes.
The sense that the labor movement, which today represents only 15.5 percent of all workers, stands at the dawn of a renaissance has particularly swept many of the bigger and richer unions and is making the convention, at the New York Sheraton, the largest in the federation's history. More than 1,000 voting delegates, most of them representatives of the federation's 78 unions and their 13 million members, will not only elect the new leader but also adopt scores of goal-setting resolutions.
"Whatever the outcome," said Peter DiCicco, a top federation official, "it means change for the better. It puts us on a new track. That's what we're all encouraged by."
Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University, said: "This is an extremely important moment, not just for the labor movement but for the country. This could be a point of regeneration, depending on whether they're able to live up to their goals and platforms."
Daniel J. B. Mitchell, a labor economist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said that given the 20-year erosion of blue-collar wages and benefits, along with layoffs and the proliferation of temporary and part-time jobs, "there's a ferment out there for somebody to capture."
"Unions," he said, "have to find a way of seizing that issue."
Mr. Sweeney's Service Employees International Union is one that already has, Professor Mitchell said. "They organized 8,000 janitors around Los Angeles," he said. "You just don't see gains like that these days."
Such experts say the very contesting of the presidential election is a sign that the house of labor enters this convention on the threshold of real change after the 16-year tenure of Mr. Kirkland, whose ouster arose from a sentiment within many unions that he could not relate to the rank and file and that he gave little more than lip service to aggressive organizing. His secretary-treasurer, Mr. Donahue, may defend Mr. Kirkland's record, but is nonetheless keeping abreast of Mr. Sweeney in promising change.
Much of the change is already well under way. As in industry, a wave of mergers has swept a union movement eager to consolidate its resources, the better to take on the giant employers that labor accuses of chipping away at the middle-class standard of living the unions won long ago.
The United Steelworkers have just taken over the strike-impoverished United Rubber Workers, and the steelworkers, the United Automobile Workers and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers have announced that they will form a two-million-member colossus by the year 2000. Two old New York unions, the International Ladies' Garment Workers and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers, combined this year.
Whatever their differences, Mr. Donahue and Mr. Sweeney are also both committed to a shift in the federation's priorities. That shift entails less emphasis on saving veteran workers' jobs in shrinking industries, instead authorizing increases of as much as tenfold in spending to recruit the millions of low-wage workers in service industries whom most unions have neglected.
Both candidates also promise big increases in spending, staff and training to topple Republican incumbents in Congress in the elections next year. Mr. Donahue says he would throw 500 specially trained workers into 50 Congressional districts starting three months before the elections. In the last elections, he said, only 240 workers joined the campaign, and did so only the month before.
"We're at the point in America where the average worker has to take into consideration what these people in Congress are doing to their jobs," said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the 1.2-million-member American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "Overtime, pay, health care and workplace safety -- they're all on the table to be taken away from them."
Changes appear imminent in the look of the federation's hierarchy as well. Union ranks today are one-third female and one-fifth black, but nearly all unions -- and the federation itself -- are still led by white men who have spent years in the labor bureaucracy. Once elected president, most cling to office without challenge long past the age when most people retire, fostering an image of themselves as self-satisfied dinosaurs.
But in a resolution to be presented to this convention, Mr. Sweeney is proposing that anyone past 70 be ineligible to run for the presidency that Mr. Kirkland, now 73, had hoped to hold at least until turning 75 and that his mentor and predecessor, George Meany, held to the age of 85. The provision would limit Mr. Donahue, at 67, to two terms of two years each.
Both presidential candidates are also making room for women at the top. Mr. Donahue's running mate for secretary-treasurer, the federation's No. 2 post, is Barbara Easterling, 62, who rose from telephone operator to secretary-treasurer of the 478,000-member Communications Workers of America.
Mr. Sweeney's candidate for secretary-treasurer is a man, Richard L. Trumka, 45, president of the United Mine Workers, lawyer, former miner, passionate orator and the most obvious successor to either Mr. Donahue or Mr. Sweeney.
But running with Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Trumka, for what will become the new post of executive vice president if the convention gives its approval, is Linda Chavez-Thompson, 50, a former illegal immigrant who became vice president of the State, County and Municipal Employees.
Both presidential candidates are also promising to break open the federation's clubby, 35-member executive council, composed mostly of union presidents, to make room for more women and members of minorities and respond to resentment among smaller unions that have been without a voice on it. Mr. Donahue would admit the presidents of all the federation's 78 member unions, while Mr. Sweeney has suggested adding 8 or 10.
Along with these changes, a prominent symbol of union indulgence and target of rank-and-file ridicule will also soon perish: the weeklong retreat in which the executive council and hundreds of staff members have for years partaken each February in Bal Harbour, Fla. The executive council will still gather -- indeed, will do so more frequently -- but plans are for the meetings to be held in cities around the country, not at resorts.
The Kirkland regime had already booked a hotel in Bal Harbour for this winter's meeting. But Mr. Donahue said, "That next meeting will be the last."

HEADLINE: Some Question Match of Gingrich's Words With Actions

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Ever since Newt Gingrich ascended to power in January, he has presented a perplexing profile on the subject of race. He is the white leader of a conservative revolution whose aim is to shrink the Government's role in social welfare and return power to the states, yet he also calls for compassion and preaches the moral imperative of lifting the underclass up from poverty.
Across his 10 months as Speaker, his words have been consistent. When Mr. Gingrich, a fiercely partisan Georgia Republican, was sworn in in January, he credited the "liberal wing of the Democratic Party" for ending segregation. He went on to use that momentous occasion to remind his new flock of "the moral urgency of coming to grips with what's happening to the poorest Americans." 
 And on Monday night, after the Million Man March, he made an impassioned speech to a group of white conservatives: "I don't think any white conservative anywhere in America ought to look at Louis Farrakhan and just condemn him without asking yourself: 'Where were you when the children died? Where were you when the schools failed? Where were you when they had no hope?' "
Mr. Gingrich has stood as a protector of the destitute District of Columbia, and although he opposes quotas, he has not called for an end to affirmative action. Two portraits hang in his office in the Capitol, those of George Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Yet, Mr. Gingrich's critics see an unbridgeable gulf between his talk and his actions. Under Mr. Gingrich's leadership, the House has set about overhauling the nation's landmark social welfare programs -- Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, the earned income tax credit, to name a few -- that critics say will surely increase the hardships of those trying to escape poverty.
"There's a massive contradiction," said Ronald Walters, chairman of the political science department at Howard University. "He set a theme of racial reconciliation and harmony, and yet when you look at his support for the new crime bill and welfare reform and the devolution of power to the local level and the building of prisons, with no emphasis on rehabilitation, and the destruction of HUD and the withdrawal of resources, these are all deleterious to the life of inner-city residents."
One of the starkest displays of the gap between his words and his actions is evident in the case of the District of Columbia. Unlike President Clinton, who made a brief foray into a black neighborhood when he first moved to Washington and made no further public overtures, Mr. Gingrich appeared far more committed. Saying he wanted to make Washington an "urban jewel," the Speaker formed an unusual alliance with Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., a Democrat, and intervened when a House subcommittee proposed to curtail the district's right to self-government.
But last week Mr. Gingrich supported severe budget cuts that city officials did not expect. Mr. Barry, who was not warned or consulted, said that Mr. Gingrich had betrayed their bond of trust and that the cuts would wreak havoc on the city.
At the Million Man March, instead of being praised as the "transformational figure" he likes to present himself as, Mr. Gingrich was harshly repudiated as a force of destruction. The Rev. Jesse Jackson compared him to Bull Connor, the racist Alabama police chief, saying Mr. Gingrich's policies inspired hundreds of thousands of black men to march on Washington last week just as Mr. Connor inspired the legendary march for civil rights in 1963.
Current Republican orthodoxy is perceived as so anti-black that after O. J. Simpson was found not guilty, some pundits predicted that whites angry at the verdict would react by voting Republican and expecting drastic cuts in the social welfare programs.
Mr. Gingrich acknowledged in an interview that he had been unable to convince many blacks that his efforts were sincere. He said they had misperceptions of him, for which he blamed the elite media, white liberals with an investment in the status quo, and "irrelevant" black leaders, including Mr. Jackson and Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat and civil rights warrior, who, he said, were trapped in the "anachronistic" view that Government should transfer wealth from those who create it to those who do not have it.
He said the social programs that his critics wanted to save -- from Head Start and the earned income tax credit to welfare -- had become disasters, but then he suggested that his proposed changes were not all that drastic. It seemed a puzzling comment from a self-described revolutionary whose philosophy is built on transforming what he calls the destructive welfare state into an "opportunity society."
"We are around the edges trimming and manicuring and trying to rethink and modernize these programs, but there is not a single one of the big programs we're touching in a profound way," he said in the interview, which took place on Thursday morning before the House's vote to restructure Medicare, an undertaking that he has previously described as the keystone to the Republicans' plan to balance the budget and hence the centerpiece of the party's credibility.
"This is a long, long way from some kind of Goldwaterite libertarianism that says, 'Let's eliminate all these and let them fend for themselves,' " he said.
He also said that he had ideas about what to do -- re-establish the work ethic, have blacks and whites join in common goals -- but that he did not know how to communicate them.
"There are a lot of things wrong with our message," he said. "There are a lot of things wrong with the way we approach them as a party. If 400,000 people show up because they're dissatisfied with the current system, and we're the replacement for the current system -- had we been the party we should be, we would have found a way to have welcomed the marchers, encouraged the marchers and signed them all up. We'd have said, 'We agree with you; let's change everything.' But we literally don't think like that."
This was the closest he came in a half-hour to suggesting that his approach was part of the problem; mainly, he said his ideas were part of the solution. His basic precept: blacks have to learn to create wealth, not expect it to be transferred passively to them, and to create wealth they have to learn self-discipline.
Roger Wilkins, a long-time civil rights advocate and now a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., said Mr. Gingrich was both blaming blacks and underestimating them by suggesting that they did not have a work ethic or good values. He also said Mr. Gingrich was ignoring how racism impeded black progress.
"I gave total credence to his words," Mr. Wilkins said. "But as my Grandma used to say, 'Actions speak louder than words.' The Medicare bill will cut the resources severely of the big public hospitals where most of the black poor get their medical treatment. He can praise the end of segregation all he wants, but if he uses his power to cut these public hospitals and make black people sicker, and to cut Head Start and make black and brown and poor white kids less able to compete, I would say those conciliatory words are absolute nonsense." Mr. Wilkins said Mr. Gingrich had no intention of putting on his agenda one of the most crucial issues: jobs for black men.
Mr. Gringrich said one reason blacks had the wrong idea of him was the news media, which he said was engaged in "a continuing, unending disinformation campaign" against him. He said his remark that some children might be better off in orphanages after all else fails was "deliberately, grotesquely distorted into a cheap way to defame me and redefine me."
The second problem, he said, which posed a much bigger challenge for him, is "the old anachronistic black leadership approach," which he described as, "You owe us; we've had a bad history; send the money."
"That is absolutely hopeless," he said. "First of all, nobody will send the money. Second, even if they did, it would just fail because you would not have created the personal discipline and personal responsibility to use the money as an investment."
Mr. Gingrich saw evidence for his solution in the World Series. Black players for one team will not cheer black players on the opposite team, he said, but whites and blacks on the same team will cheer each other.
He said that if blacks and whites can engage in common goals -- improving their schools, ridding their neighborhoods of drugs -- they can help eliminate racism.

HEADLINE: THE U.N. AT 50: THE CHALLENGES;
The U.N. at 50: Facing the Task of Reinventing Itself

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Imagine an international corporation with 53,589 employees, a New York headquarters, half a dozen regional branches and scores of field offices around the world. Then add a 185-member board of directors, most of whom think the best jobs should go to candidates from their hometowns. Consider that all of this is presided over by a chief executive who is neither elected nor chosen through open competition, recruitment or even in an interview process.
This is the United Nations. 
 On Oct. 24, 1945, within months of the end of World War II, the United Nations formally came into being when its Charter took effect. There were 51 members -- pledged to create a better world, free of "the scourge of war" -- and enough optimism to go around.
This weekend, the largest gathering of world leaders in history -- more than 140 heads of state or government, at last count -- will come together here for a three-day celebration of the 50th anniversary. If the founders believed that they had put catastrophe behind them, the inheritors of their legacy are more likely to fear disaster ahead.
In three days of speeches, each address optimistically limited to five minutes, they are likely to talk about pulling the organization back from the brink of bankruptcy and reinventing it to make it a credible force in the next century.
In no corner of the world except perhaps in the United States is there a lobby for dismantling or significantly weakening the United Nations. For half a century it has served as a manager of disputes and a useful site for the venting and checkmating of East-West hostilities that might have otherwise exploded. Its far-flung empire of agencies and associations became part of daily life worldwide, battling the spread of weapons, disease and unfair labor practices, among other issues.
But there is an almost universal sense that the United Nations is overstretched and still in search of missions and without clear priorities in the post-cold-war world.
When it comes to restructuring, some countries, led by the United States, would like to see the United Nations shrink, while many poorer nations want it to grow, to open more offices, to create more jobs, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a recent interview. The developing nations are in a majority.
"The third world is for proliferation, all because of the possibilities of jobs or for prestige," he said. "Poor countries want five offices, not one, because all the nieces and daughters of the President work as secretaries."
In this anniversary year, there is no shortage of reform proposals. In at least half a dozen books and countless seminars, experts and dabblers alike have been writing and talking extensively about how to invigorate, and then pay for, a new-look United Nations.
Among the reforms most often mentioned are enlarging the Security Council, streamlining the General Assembly and its web of committees, consolidating overlapping work by specialized agencies, rethinking the moribund Economic and Social Council (which was intended to deal with human development with the same weight the Security Council dealt with strategic concerns), greater participation by nongovernmental organizations and a more efficient, less political system for selecting a Secretary General.
Undermining the work of the United Nations, moreover, is the absence of modern management practices, said Karl Theodor Paschke, a former head of the German Foreign Ministry who was brought in a year ago as an inspector general. In this environment, former diplomats or other untrained administrators are often put in charge of fractious, multicultural departments that they cannot manage.
In studies over the last year, Mr. Paschke has found that waste, inefficiency and corruption are often the symptoms, not the causes, of malaise in the organization.
There have been no career development programs and few honest employee assessments here, said John L. Washburn, a former American diplomat and an adviser in the Secretary General's office from 1988 until last year.
The key to reform is "personnel, personnel, personnel," he said. Only recently have staff assessments begun to have meaning -- and the shock has led to predictable resistance.
The rapid globalizing of economies and the perception that the world's most threatening problems no longer have national or bureaucratic boundaries should create the right atmosphere for real change in the international system. But when the speeches end, the trouble begins.
With no outside oversight -- apart from that exercised by member nations, which are almost never in unanimity -- no check-and-balance system or grass-roots voters to contend with, the United Nations organization is mostly left to its own devices in bringing about change.
The 185 member nations can hasten or slow the job as national interests dictate. Governments have their own priorities; a clutch of them can stall action endlessly.
It took weeks of negotiations this fall, for instance, to arrive at a ceremonial declaration of commitment to the United Nations' next 50 years.
Battle lines formed over issues like how to define "sustainable" development, which poor countries sometimes interpret as richer ones' telling them how to use their resources, and how far to go in embracing "self-determination," which some nations see as license for rebellion by separatists.
 
Secretary General
Trying to Improve An 'Impossible' Job
 Sir Brian Urquhart, who has spent a lifetime studying the United Nations from inside and out, has described the Secretary General's role as "the world's No. 1 fig leaf and scapegoat," an official easy to fault because his job is all but unworkable.
"If you look at all the things he -- or, we hope, she -- is supposed to do on paper, the job does look impossible," said Sir Brian, a former Under Secretary General and now Ford Foundation scholar in residence. "Just the political side is taking 24 hours a day now."
He and Erskine Childers, a writer on international policy, recommended in a recent study that four deputy secretaries general be created to share the load. The idea caught on briefly, then vanished from the agenda.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali, a scholar of international law and former Egyptian Government minister, became the sixth Secretary General at the beginning of 1992, after the cold war had ended and the future of the United Nations seemed especially bright.
Because his term expires at the end of next year, his future and that of the secretary generalship have been thrown into the wider debate about reform.
But no Security Council member has pressed for debate on the issue. Setting up a selection process formally outside the Council could weaken the Council's political power over the selection -- and over the winner.
Though there is wide agreement that the organization needs a strong leader to make its case and give its bureaucracy a human face, a powerful Secretary General would not be welcome in Washington or other influential capitals.
"There is a serious question whether the main governments want an absolutely perfect Secretary General," said Sir Brian, who is British. But there is no doubt in his mind that the selection process is a "joke."
"Harvard spent 18 months on the search for a president," he said. "For a job like the Secretary General's, which is potentially so important, the world should be the recruiting ground."
 
Security Council
Restructuring Needed but Elusive
 Nothing is talked about more -- or is less likely to happen soon -- than a restructuring of the Security Council, the strategic center of the United Nations, where decisions about peacekeeping, sanctions and other issues of international security are made.
There is agreement on what is wrong: 50 years after its creation, the Council does not reflect the world's diversity, and its five permanent members, with the exception of the United States, are no longer the dominant powers they were in 1945.
Britain and France have lost their empires and have become part of the European Union; Russia, which inherited the seat of the Soviet superpower, is less than it was only a decade ago. And China, holding the seat created originally for the anti-Communist Nationalists, now in Taiwan, uses it defensively, playing little role in international policy-making.
Other nations have become economically or militarily more important, among them the two major defeated nations of World War II, Germany and Japan.
And Italy's United Nations representative, Francesco Paolo Fulci, says, only partly in jest, that if these two "defeated nations" are given Council seats, why not Italy? The Italians have proposed other ways to reform the Council that would not add to the five permanent members.
Larger developing nations -- Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico and now South Africa -- are demanding to be heard, as are smaller countries that contribute to the United Nations' work.
The Security Council has 15 seats, with the 10 nonpermanent ones rotated among 180 countries grouped in regional networks. Smaller countries rarely get a chance; larger nations say an occasional appearance on the Council is not enough. A country like Israel, which belongs to no regional caucus, never gets an opportunity to vie for a seat.
What has stalled efforts to make the Council more reflective of a changed world is disagreement over which nations should become permanent members and how large the body should become to make more seats available to the rest.
There are also debates over whether a third category of membership should be created for larger developing nations or regional powers that would enable them to hold seats more often or to become a new kind of permanent member without a veto.
The Clinton Administration was an early supporter of permanent membership for Germany and Japan, and would consider adding a few seats to the nonpermanent ranks.
But in a letter written in August to governments around the world outlining the American position, Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate, said a limit of 20 members was "vital to maintain Council effectiveness."
Other nations have argued for 25 or more seats and want the permanent membership to be less dominated by the industrial powers, particularly the Europeans.
A committee appointed last year by the General Assembly was unable to report any conclusions in September and has now been given another year to try to find a consensus.
 
General Assembly
Spidery Network Of Vested Interests
 Mr. Boutros-Ghali was venting his frustration over the subject of United Nations reform in an interview recently. Forget the Security Council, he said; "the real change must come in the General Assembly."
The Assembly, to which all member nations belong and in which other groups like the Holy See or the Palestine Liberation Organization have observer status, was created not only as the center for international debate but also as the organ that can by majority vote amend the United Nations Charter, establish new commissions or departments and close atrophied branches.
The Assembly's committees are nests of political posturing and intrigue as they work on delicate issues from human rights to nuclear disarmament. Nongovernmental organizations focus their lobbying efforts here.
The Secretary General said that since taking office almost four years ago, he had abolished nearly a third of the higher-ranking civil service positions.
But he said member nations of the General Assembly had then created several new departments -- an Under Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs, a High Commissioner for Human Rights and an Inspector General -- that added more jobs.
"I wrote twice to the Assembly asking them to abolish the Trusteeship Council, and still it has not been abolished," he said, referring to the body that oversaw the transition of many former colonies to independent nations. Palau, which became an independent member of the United Nations last year, was its last client.
Diogo Freitas do Amaral, a law professor and former political leader from Portugal who is this year's General Assembly president, says he will try again to close down or transform the Trusteeship Council. He also wants to eliminate some committees and working groups.
"On some issues, we have sometimes five or six or seven subcommittees or groups dealing with exactly the same subjects," he said.
James Gustave Speth, administrator of the United Nations Development Program and the highest-ranking American in the system, says streamlining can be done -- though any change in the "business as usual" atmosphere, where countries can shoehorn their citizens into jobs they cannot perform, is bound to create a backlash.
In two years, Mr. Speth, the former president of the independent World Resources Institute in Washington, has introduced a 30 percent staff cut in his agency to take place over six years, plus new procedures for openness in hiring and promotion.
He has also made staff members personally accountable for losses to the agency. Auditors are working their way through his field offices.
Sir Brian, the former Under Secretary General, said numbers were not the primary problem. He said the portrayal of the United Nations as an overgrown bureaucracy is "grossly overdone."
"I don't think the organization is so much bloated," he said. "It's that you get whole areas of the Secretariat designed for one moment in history that go on into another, and it's very hard to move people out. In fact, parts of the Secretariat are grossly understaffed by national standards."
"The trouble in changing the U.N. is that there is a constituency for almost every document and every part of the Secretariat," Sir Brian said. "Reform plans have always been nibbled to death by diplomatic log-rolling and compromise."

HEADLINE: San Francisco Donnybrook Bores Voters

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20

 BODY:
With less than three weeks until Election Day, the race for Mayor in San Francisco has turned into a close, tense, verbal dogfight whose snarling, biting personal exchanges belie the city's reputation for laid-back liberalism.
But despite the sharp verbiage, the issues continue to be muddled, and polltakers report that 1 in 4 voters remains undecided -- either confused or turned off. 
 Among the seven candidates on the Nov. 7 ballot are the incumbent, Frank Jordan, a dour, no-nonsense former police chief; Willie L. Brown Jr., the glib, wily, sometimes outrageous former leader of the California State Assembly, and Roberta Achtenberg, a former Federal urban affairs official and a leader in San Francisco's large and politically powerful gay community.
When Mr. Brown jumped into the race after term limits ended his tenure in the Assembly at three decades, it was expected he would run away with the contest, given his standing as one of the nation's leading black political figures, his envious mastery of campaign techniques and fund raising and San Francisco's traditional ready acceptance of outspoken mavericks.
But that has not yet happened. Rather, the race is a dead heat between Mr. Brown and Mr. Jordan, with a second-round runoff likely because Ms. Achtenberg, who formerly served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, seems to have enough support to prevent either man from winning a majority in the first round.
"You'd think that this would be a great contest because of the city's many economic and social problems and the various backgrounds of the candidates," said Scott Shafer, a San Francisco political consultant who is not allied with any contestant this time around.
"Yet voters are just yawning at the generalities and nasty digs being handed out," he continued. "There's a lot of hot talk from the candidates but not much in the way of hot ideas or hot vision. It's a disappointment and a turnoff."
How do the candidates see it?
"It's a grind like I've never experienced," Mr. Brown said as he wearily left one late-evening community meeting and headed for another, just steps behind Mr. Jordan and Ms. Achtenberg.
"I must have been to 750 functions like this," he added. "But that's what you do in San Francisco if you're going to win. That's what people expect -- face to face."
For all its beauty, charm and laissez-faire approach to life, ethnicity and doing one's own thing, San Francisco has most of the usual problems that beset other major American cities -- red ink, red tape, crime, unemployment, potholes and struggling schools. But the candidates who would clean up all of this tend to spend more time talking about one another's personal shortcomings than about solutions.
Mr. Brown charges that Mr. Jordan is "nice, but completely incapable, a phony."
"This used to be a magical city but in recent years the magic has disappeared," he said during the community meeting, high up in the Twin Peaks section, near the city's southern edge.
Mr. Jordan calls Mr. Brown "Slick Willie" and "a political hustler" and questions whether he would take an interest in governing San Francisco or use the mayoral job as a step to something higher up the political ladder.
"I want to make the tough decisions for San Francisco and I won't worry about stepping stones to some future location," Mr. Jordan told the community gathering.
Ms. Achtenberg, a bit less acerbic, calls Mr. Brown a "failed" legislator and Mr. Jordan a "failed" Mayor.
"Everywhere I go, people want to know if we can ever make our government work, if somebody out there has the ability" she said during the community meeting. "I believe I can. Talk the truth."
The best bet seems to be that, in the end, as originally anticipated, the mayoral contest will be won by Mr. Brown, a former shoeshine boy who escaped the poverty and racial discrimination of his native Texas, became a California lawyer, Assemblyman and then, as Assembly Speaker, perhaps the most influential black state legislator in the country.
Yet because of the large undecided vote it is too early to write off the two other major contenders.
"No candidate has really caught on," said David Binder, an independent San Francisco poll taker. "There's a lot of personal attacking now but not much else, and time is running out."
Since early summer, polls have shown Mr. Brown and Mr. Jordan tied with about 25 percent of the vote each, with Ms. Achtenberg trailing at 15 percent. Another 25 percent is undecided and the obscure rest of the field shares the remaining sliver of the electorate.
If no candidate wins a majority on Nov. 7, a runoff between the top two vote getters will be held a month later.
Political experts say that if the runoff is between Mr. Brown and Mr. Jordan, Mr. Brown would be more likely to gain the Achtenberg voters and win the election.
San Francisco is one of the last great strongholds of liberalism in the country, so all of the candidates are Democrats, save one badly lagging Republican. But though the city is passionately ideological, the Mayor's race is nevertheless technically nonpartisan.
The polls indicate that while Mr. Brown shares some of the hardest core liberal vote with Ms. Achtenberg, Mr. Jordan claims most of the city's moderate voters, along with most of the tiny handful of Republicans. Much of the undecided vote is in the large and increasingly powerful Asian community.
"At this point, Achtenberg is the candidate who is most under the gun," Mr. Binder said. "Even though she has big support in the city's huge gay community, she doesn't seem to have enough overall support to make the runoff. And time is running out.
"For Jordan, the challenge is to make Brown run a poor second the first time around and hope that will provide the momentum to carry a runoff. And that's by no means out of the question since the Jordan supporters are the older, middle-class kind of voters who tend always to turn out, whereas many Brown supporters tend to be younger, poorer and less driven and motivated to vote."
Will Mr. Brown be hurt by the race factor?
"You never really know," said Mr. Shafer, the consultant. "Don't be surprised if the city goes against the bad racial winds now blowing in this country and once again goes its own contrarian way."

HEADLINE: New York Again the Most Unionized State

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
New York has reclaimed its position as the most heavily unionized state, surpassing Hawaii, with a union membership that is nearly double the level nationwide, recent census data show.
Thanks mainly to strong growth among unions for government workers, New York remains one of the few bright spots for a labor movement that has seen membership slide for two decades. 
 Union members made up 28.9 percent of the state's work force in 1994, up from 27.9 percent in 1989, giving New York the lead it last held during the 1970's and early 1980's, according to a study by two economics professors at Florida State University, Barry T. Hirsch and David A. Macpherson. During that same period, union membership nationwide dropped a full percentage point, to 15.5 percent, half what it was in the 1960's. California leads New York in sheer numbers of union members, with 2.19 million compared with New York's 2.05 million. But as a percentage of the total work force, the California figure is just 17.9 percent.
While the New York numbers are welcome news for the A.F.L.-C.I.O, which is holding its annual convention in Manhattan this week, New York's unions have not been immune to the battering that labor has taken nationwide in recent decades. With the loss of manufacturing jobs, management's greater resistance to unions and the explosion of jobs in the hard-to-organize service sector, the percentage of New York workers belonging to unions is down from 32 percent a decade ago.
One way of looking at New York's relatively strong performance is that unionism in the state has declined less than in the rest of the nation. Unionization remains strong not just in government jobs, but also in construction, retail, hospitals and manufacturing.
Labor's dynamism is showing many faces throughout the state. The Buffalo Bills cheerleaders have signed up with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The Office and Professional Employees Union has applications from close to 1,000 fashion models who want to join a union. That union is also seeking to organize 650 Blue Cross workers in Middletown, N.Y. Deputy sheriffs around the state have recently joined a union, as have more than 3,000 graduate school assistants at the State University of New York.
Labor is also far stronger in New Jersey and Connecticut than in the nation as a whole. In New Jersey, 24.9 percent of the workers were unionized in 1994, including 62 percent of government workers, while in Connecticut, 20.3 percent were unionized, including 65 percent of government workers.
In sharp contrast to the situation in New York, just 3.8 percent of workers in South Carolina belong to unions, giving the state by far the lowest rate in the nation. Other states in which union membership is below 8 percent include Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia.
Richard Hurd, a professor of labor studies at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, explained the resilience of New York's labor movement this way: "If unions are relatively extensive in a state, as is the case in New York, they tend to have bargaining power, and that creates a better image in terms of appealing to workers. If unions are strong in a state, workers want them."
The central reason that New York's union membership is so high, labor leaders and scholars say, is that the percentage of government employees in New York who are unionized -- 72.9 percent -- is easily the highest in the nation. That compares with 38.7 percent nationwide. In New York, unlike many other states, virtually all teachers and nonmanagerial municipal workers are unionized.
There are several reasons why New York's government unions, which account for just over half the state's 2 million unionized workers, have outpaced the rest of the nation. They had a head start compared with other states because in the 1960's, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller made New York the first state to pass legislation that fostered collective bargaining in government jobs. The state's government unions have built powerful war chests to organize workers. And the two major political parties -- especially the Democrats -- have long curried favor with unions, providing them with fertile ground for organizing.
Leo Troy, a Rutgers University economics professor who specializes in labor matters, said it was not surprising that New York unions enjoyed a resurgence when Mario M. Cuomo was Governor and David N. Dinkins was Mayor.
"During 12 years of Democratic rule in New York, the Democratic Party and the public sector union movement were almost indistinguishable," he said. "Democrats like Mario Cuomo encouraged the unionization of public sector employees. Not only do they not fight it, but they welcome it."
Some labor leaders fear that government-job unionism may have crested, because of the election of Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who are committed to shrinking government in fiscal hard times, and have been in the forefront of efforts to turn public services over to private companies.
"Given the cutbacks in city services and the city work force and given the cutbacks in the state, it might be hard to see public sector increases in the future," said Victor Gotbaum, the former head of New York City's main municipal employees union and now a senior researcher at City University of New York.
And even as New York's government unions have grown in the last decade, the percentage of nongovernment New York workers belonging to unions has steadily declined. In 1994, 18 percent of New York's nongovernment workers were in unions, down from 24 percent a decade earlier.
"We've lost in the private sector only because many industrial plants have closed down," said Edward Cleary, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Unlike some other states, we have not seen any mass desertion from unions because of dissatisfaction."

HEADLINE: In Frenetic First Week, Crew Charms and Cajoles

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
If there was a moment last week that captured the difference between New York City's new Schools Chancellor, Dr. Rudy Crew, and his predecessor, Ramon C. Cortines, it was at 5:10 P.M. on Friday at City Hall.
At that point, Dr. Crew and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani emerged from a 50-minute meeting, arm in arm and smiling. And memories of Mr. Cortines, who stepped down this month after nearly two years of criticism from the Mayor, seemed distant. 
 For Dr. Crew, 45, it was the capstone of a frenetic first week in which he began to sketch an outline of how he will lead the nation's largest school district.
He immediately served notice that he intended to stretch the powers of his office to the limit, seizing control of more than a dozen failing schools. He rechristened his office's bully pulpit, visiting schools to urge students to raise their expectations and then stooping to embrace them.
And he pledged to rid the Board of Education headquarters in downtown Brooklyn of the "bloat" long derided by the Mayor, saying he would return employees with teaching licenses to the classroom and find new jobs for others.
Along the way, he crisscrossed the city to ask for support at, among other places, an intermediate school on the mend in the South Bronx, a dinner with business executives on the Upper East Side, a huddle with black political leaders in Harlem and appointments with at least two borough presidents. He also took his first ginger steps onto the political tightrope that upended his predecessor, met separately with the board and the Mayor -- and, remarkably, left with both singing his praises, at least for now.
"He's off to a great start," said First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers.
At many stops, Dr. Crew made it clear that he would hold out his own story -- that of a black child raised in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., by a widowed security guard who insisted that his son extract greatness from himself -- as an inspiration to a system populated by numerous poor children not unlike himself.
"I'm here," he said in a lunchtime interview on Tuesday with reporters and editors at The New York Times, "because a lot of people made it possible for me to walk in the front door of a school, learn algebra, learn Spanish, take the courses I needed to go to Babson College, come out with a degree in economics and have the presence of mind to know how to navigate my way through the rest of graduate school and into your dining room here."
Having resigned as Superintendent of Schools in Tacoma, Wash., only two weeks ago, Dr. Crew said that people seeking the details of his agenda would have to wait. But in his travels around the city, he won early endorsements, not the least for his energy and self-assurance.
"He is quite sure of himself," said Felix G. Rohatyn, the former chairman of the city's Municipal Assistance Corporation, who joined several other business leaders at a three-hour dinner with Dr. Crew on Wednesday night. "He is very sophisticated. He has a clear understanding of the minefields and traps of the job he has taken on. And he has no illusions about it."
"This," Mr. Rohatyn added, "is no small-town guy."
But soon, a stump speech will not be enough, and Dr. Crew -- who led the 141st largest school district in the nation (Tacoma) and the 68th largest (Sacramento, Calif.) -- will be expected to deliver results in the largest of all.
"He seems to have done well with the Mayor," said Frank Macchiarola, the dean of Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School, who served as Chancellor from 1978 to 1983. "The board is in love with him. And the various constituencies seem to be receptive. But the more profound questions remain to be answered: how well-equipped is he to lead the system, and will the system in fact be led?"
From his first moment on the job last Monday, at 6:54 A.M., Dr. Crew set about trying to prove he could answer those questions. In a signal that he will be a vigilant caretaker of his own image, his press office had invited reporters and photographers to greet him. He did not leave the back seat of his blue Ford Crown Victoria until he was assured that all the television cameras were ready.
Twenty minutes later, in a stage-managed moment more evocative of a United States President than a schools chancellor, the same press corps was ushered into his office to observe -- without asking questions -- 60 seconds of his first meeting with the director of his transition office and two aides he had inherited from Mr. Cortines.
The subject was one to which Dr. Crew would return throughout his first week: the threat by the state, issued over last weekend, to shut down 17 failing city schools, where a vast majority of students can neither read nor write at their grade level.
Dr. Crew immediately set out to take over the schools himself, a strategy that his two predecessors, Mr. Cortines and Joseph A. Fernandez, had used in several isolated cases, but not without legal challenges from the local school districts they superseded.
Dr. Crew discussed his plans by telephone on Monday with Richard P. Mills, the State Commissioner of Education, and again on Tuesday, in a meeting with Mr. Mills and Carol A. Gresser, the board president. Both were receptive. On Wednesday, the board met in executive session and informally endorsed his strategy.
And on Thursday, after Dr. Crew held a news conference at which only student journalists were permitted to ask questions, the spokesman for his transition team, David Begel, announced that the Chancellor was assuming direct control of 16 of those schools.
What comes next, of course, is the hard part, as Dr. Crew tries to fashion plans to rehabilitate each school -- working with existing principals in some cases, removing them in others -- all under the watchful eye of Mr. Mills, who has threatened to close any school that does not show improvement by June.
After their conversation on Monday, Mr. Mills said, "I have confidence in Dr. Crew."
So, apparently, does virtually everyone Dr. Crew reached out to during his honeymoon week.
On Tuesday, he met with Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island to discuss, in Mr. Molinari's words, why his borough "seems to be doing better with less money than the other districts." Mr. Molinari pronounced himself impressed with the Chancellor's interest. "He was the type of person that, in a short meeting such as we had, left me with the impression that he would be in total control," he said.
On Wednesday afternoon, he met with Mr. Molinari's counterpart in the Bronx, Fernando Ferrer, who came away, he said, with a commitment from Dr. Crew to somehow restore junior varsity sports -- the victim of a recent round of budget-cutting -- to every high school in the city, perhaps using private donations. "To say he was dazzling was probably an understatement," Mr. Ferrer said.
And that night, he engaged a group of business leaders gathered at the East Side home of Robert Kiley, former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, in a discussion of the bedrock idea of his chancellorship: that every child is capable of learning. "Everyone liked him," Mr. Kiley said.
Perhaps Dr. Crew's trickiest task, however, will be satisfying the two often-squabbling masters he effectively serves: the seven-member board and the Mayor, who has expressed a willingness to make Dr. Crew his education commissioner if the State Legislature acts on his proposal to abolish the board and transfer its powers to City Hall.
On the issue of school security, for example, Dr. Crew disagrees with a precondition Mr. Giuliani had set during the chancellor search -- that the next chancellor cede control over school safety to the police. Instead, Dr. Crew agrees with his board, which advocates a greater role for the police in training and recruiting school safety officers, but wants the ultimate responsibility for security to rest with the schools themselves.
But unlike Mr. Cortines, Dr. Crew said he expected to provide the Mayor with occasional briefings on his plans. Although it was unclear who called whom, the first of those briefings occurred on Friday, with Dr. Crew and Mr. Giuliani sitting down to discuss special education, the $8 billion schools budget and the ongoing negotiations with the teachers' union, whose contract expired last Sunday.
"There are a whole host of things," Dr. Crew said afterward, "that we've obviously got as high priorities for working together over the course of the year."
Another priority for Dr. Crew in New York was visiting his 23-year-old son, also named Rudy, a production assistant for the television program "Yo! MTV Raps," who was able to spend a moment with his father on Tuesday night.
Famished and drained from a long day that had left him little time to eat, Dr. Crew arrived on his son's doorstep on 108th Street at 10 P.M. and made a beeline for the refrigerator. To his dismay, he found only a jar of mustard.
And so they spent the next half-hour laughing and catching up, with the new Schools Chancellor politely rebuffing his son's repeated attempts to get him to listen to the new album by the rap performer AZ.
"Once this whole mess dies down and people get used to him being around," the younger Mr. Crew said, "we're going to be able to hang out on weekends."

HEADLINE: China Faulted by New Trade Group

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: HARROGATE, England. Oct. 21

 BODY:
The world's four major trading powers are united in agreement that China still falls far short of meeting criteria for joining the new World Trade Organization, the United States said today.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said members of the Quadrilateral bloc grouping -- the United States, Japan, the European Union and Canada -- all shared his view that China needed to make much more effort before becoming a member of the trade organization. 
 The apparent setback to China's hopes comes at an awkward time, with a meeting Tuesday in New York between President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China.
Beijing failed to secure membership in the trade body at its founding in January, after completion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. The United States has blocked its efforts to enter as a developing economy, making it eligible on less stringent terms.
"I don't know of any major trading nation which has been impressed by China's offer so far," Mr. Kantor told reporters.

5 Best Reasons To Allow U.N. To Park Here

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
YEARS ago, at another time when its public image needed Simonizing, the United Nations ran television commercials that ended with this sobering message: Maybe it's not the United Nations that is preventing World War III. But who would want to find out?
Here we are in 1995 with the know-nothings again riding high in Washington, urging that the United States tell the foreigners off and go it alone, as though there are many Americans left who can even get dressed without putting on a shirt that was stitched somewhere like Sri Lanka. 
 New York is not that anti-foreigner. But it is hardly free of provincialism, which has taken a familiar form as the United Nations throws itself a 50th birthday party. It is a word-association game. Say "United Nations" or "diplomats" and what comes to mind? For many New Yorkers, the answer is easy: unpaid parking tickets.
A PREVAILING view is that citizens of the five boroughs have exclusive rights to any violation of parking rules in their territory. New Yorkers who put up with all manner of indignities can grow apopletic at the thought of ambassadors' not paying their parking tickets, a common assumption being that a diplomat is a fellow in an Armani suit who spends his day looking for a fire hydrant to block before heading off to Lutece for a discussion of European Union veal-import quotas.
Indeed, some foreign envoys are insufferable, condescending toward both the city and its regulations. But the stereotype is often wildly exaggerated, and it has been somewhat exploited in the runup to the United Nations anniversary, an occasion for some to drag out that old New York tabloid chestnut: diplomats as deadbeats, skipping out on good-hearted merchants by invoking immunity.
The collective local debt of these foreigners is in fact high, estimated as much as $8.5 million. For some reason, it is growing rapidly. But a closer look shows that most of the money is owed by five countries -- Uganda, Somalia, Congo, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Uganda alone accounts for at least half the total. And while no one should shrug off debts, it bears noting that all those countries can be described diplomatically as political or economic basket cases.
If you really want the biggest deadbeat in town, go to the corner of First Avenue and East 45th Street. There, you will find the United States Mission to the United Nations, representing a country that owes the world organization $1.3 billion.
Still, the United Nations has a public-relations burden, aloof and irrelevant as it seems to many New Yorkers. Recognizing the problem, city officials are accentuating the positive, cranking out figures showing that the huge diplomatic corps generates nearly 31,000 jobs and $3.3 billion in economic development.
ALL that is fine. But there are other advantages to having the United Nations around that the press releases ignore. Here are a few, unsolicited:
(1) Since the headquarters in Turtle Bay is considered international territory, a visit provides a low-cost foreign vacation.
(2) You can feel better about life's petty problems by wandering over there. You think you've got troubles? How about the freedom-yearning Tibetans on a hunger strike across from the Secretariat building? And unlike many protesters in New York, the Tibetans are nice.
(3) Thanks to the United Nations, people in Long Island City, Queens, have a more pleasant view across the East River than a sight of the slaughterhouses and slums that made up Turtle Bay 50 years ago.
(4) The United Nations gives First Avenue the most interesting lampposts in town. One is crowded with signs announcing Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, Shcharansky Freedom Walk, United Nations Plaza and Raoul Wallenberg Walk. Some people know it better as East 47th Street, and there is a sign for that, too.
(5) Some good movies have benefited from the United Nations' presence in New York, an example being Hitchcock's "North by Northwest," which includes an important murder scene at the headquarters.
One can add that unpaid tickets may be considered a small price for having an organization that reinforces this city's claim to being capital of the planet. But that would probably draw an argument from some.
Maybe they're right. Maybe it's not the United Nations that keeps New York a great city.
But who would want to find out?

HEADLINE: Economic Espionage

 BODY:
As the Central Intelligence Agency shops around for new business, it has discovered the attractions of economic intelligence. Encouraged by President Clinton, the agency is turning its spying machinery on targets like the Japanese trade ministry and the French Prime Minister's staff, looking for information that might give American trade negotiators an advantage.
With the cold war over, there is little question that economic and financial developments can threaten American interests as quickly as foreign armies. The Mexican peso crisis earlier this year was an example. But it is a good deal less clear that the C.I.A. is the right place to turn for help. 
 The C.I.A. considered the Soviet Union an economic power when it was actually an economic wreck, and there is little evidence that the agency's expertise on financial issues has improved since the cold war ended. David Sanger and Tim Weiner recently reported in The Times that Clinton Administration consumers of C.I.A. economic intelligence find much of the material unsophisticated and of limited use.
Banks, brokerage houses and other financial institutions have far more experience and expertise in tracking bond markets, currency fluctuations, inflation rates and budget deficits. The C.I.A. has not made a convincing case why it should start from almost no base to build a center for economic intelligence and analysis when the Government can hire outside experts or look to agencies like the Treasury Department that already have more knowledgeable staffs.
Clandestine efforts to gather financial secrets, especially from American allies, seem even more dubious. Friendly governments are not above spying on each other, but whatever the C.I.A. learned about Japan's bargaining strategy in trade talks on automobile issues probably was not worth the embarrassment to both Washington and Tokyo when the spying was disclosed. Over the long run, American access to Japanese markets is not likely to be improved by spying on the Japanese trade ministry.
The mismatch between cold-war-style espionage and economic matters was evident in the C.I.A.'s clumsy effort to lure an aide to the French Prime Minister into parting with secrets about his Government's position on trade talks. The gambit backfired when French intelligence officials detected the maneuver and tipped off the aide. It is not easy to see what the C.I.A. thought it could learn about French bargaining positions that were openly declared and widely publicized at the time.
The one area where traditional spycraft might prove useful is warning when foreign countries or companies are using bribery or other illegal means to obtain business contracts. The C.I.A., using intercepts of telephone and other communications, has notified the State Department when it learned of these practices. That, in turn, has given Washington a chance to protest. In at least one case, the business ended up going to an American company.
The C.I.A. itself is not the best judge of what new missions it should pursue. The desire to protect a large budget and staff has a way of distorting decisions about new ventures, particularly in an organization that devoted better than two-thirds of its work to monitoring and studying a country, the Soviet Union, that no longer exists.
William Casey had many faults as Director of Central Intelligence in the Reagan Administration. But he did know a thing or two about economics. Whenever he wanted economic intelligence, Mr. Casey often said, he would ask a businessman, not an intelligence analyst.

Anderson Isn't Waiting by the Phone

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
The telephone rings often at the Anderson home in Thousand Oaks, Calif., but the calls are from friends wanting to talk and organizations seeking an after-dinner speaker, not from prospective employers looking to fill a particular position.
"I have not talked to one single person," Sparky Anderson said, interrupting his breakfast roll and coffee. "I don't think anybody will call. I knew that when I stepped down. I never thought there would be any. I never thought I'd get a call from anyone." 
 Anderson is three weeks removed from the day he ended his 17-year tenure as manager of the Detroit Tigers. He may be three weeks removed from the day he ended his whole career as a manager.
The Baltimore Orioles, about to hire Davey Johnson as their new manager, have not called. Oakland, which could lose Tony La Russa, has not called. St. Louis, which has made La Russa an offer, has not called. Cincinnati, whose owner earlier this year said something about having him come back, has not called.
The Mets, Los Angeles, San Diego, Pittsburgh and the Chicago White Sox all rehired their managers without calling. George Steinbrenner, who has spent the past two days meeting with Buck Showalter, has not dialed the number with the 805 area code.
"I never thought there would be any unrest in New York," Anderson said, speaking of Showalter's status. "Everybody talks, but I know George. He'll sit back and watch other people. Then he usually is very generous with people. That's the way I looked at it from the start. I think this guy has done an outstanding job. If you don't get rewarded when you do outstanding jobs, what happens when you do a mediocre job? I never gave that a doubt. I told my wife that guy will be all right."
When earlier this month it appeared that Steinbrenner might jettison Showalter and end the longest uninterrupted term any manager has had in his 23-yeas ownership, there was the fleeting thought that he might be tempted to pursue Anderson, who could attract fans.
But if Steinbrenner even gave the idea a moment's thought, he hasn't thought out loud enough for it to reach newsprint. At the same time, Anderson would not campaign for anyone's job, certainly not Showalter's because, as he said, "I really like the guy."
Perhaps privately Anderson is hurt that no one has called, but he said he doesn't feel insulted. Nor, he said, does he feel the game will suffer in his absence, if he remains absent.
"Our game never suffers from the loss of anyone," he said. "As soon as guys understand that and can face that fact, that when they're gone this game will continue, we'll be in better shape. I think we have this thing among all sports people that when they leave, it don't go on. It will go on, believe me. I've always been able to keep that thing in control.
"I always knew that I was not the game, that I wasn't bigger than the game. I always knew the game was giving to me; I wasn't giving to the game. If I've done anything at all, at least I've showed some people the game can benefit from your help, but the game doesn't owe you anything; you owe it all to the game."
Just in case anyone is thinking of asking Anderson if he would be interested in a front-office job, he should save his time. "I'll never be in a front office," Anderson said.
But there is a role he could play, he added, a role played by many former players, managers and coaches.
"I would enjoy sitting in a ball park judging players," he said. "In Los Angeles, in Anaheim. Calling and saying if you want to go for him, do it. I would never sit in an office. I have to be outside. I can't be locked in. But I would love to watch games. I could watch players. I would enjoy that. I'm there to help anybody who would like me to help."
 
Fundamentals, Fundamentals
 A league championship series isn't exactly the place for teaching young players the proper way to execute plays, but Lou Piniella, the Seattle manager, found an at-bat by Dan Wilson, his catcher, to be instructive.
Wilson, who later in the same game would commit a series-clinching two-run passed ball, batted after Luis Sojo led off the third inning of a scoreless sixth game with a double. Piniella could have had Wilson sacrifice Sojo to third, but he was reluctant to give up the out and figured Wilson at least could hit a grounder to the right side that would accomplish the same goal.
But Wilson swung at the first pitch from Dennis Martinez and hit a grounder to the left side, to shortstop Omar Vizquel, forcing Sojo to remain at second.
"He was trying to go the other way," Piniella said, "but Martinez gave him a little offspeed pitch down and in, and that's the only place you can hit that pitch. You got a 40-year-old guy pitching against a 25-year-old kid. It's a huge experience difference. How do you learn? You learn from experience. You take that pitch, you just take it, and wait for something out over the plate. Or if he's going to keep giving you that pitch, you back completely off the plate, back off another half a foot or so. It's like we had a left-handed pitcher on the mound and the guy is trying to go the other way with the ball. It's hard to go the other way with a slow curveball. So you just take it and wait for something else."
 
Irony of the Astros?
 Drayton McLane Jr., owner of the Houston Astros, and William Collins, a Washington businessman, have initiated talks about the possible sale of the Astros. Collins and his partners have been like economic vultures, waiting to pounce on any troubled team that looks ripe for purchase -- the Pirates, the Mariners, the Astros.
Of course, Collins's aim in buying a team is to move it to northern Virginia, a step that other owners may not necessarily approve. If, however, Collins were to buy the Astros and gain permission to move them, it would be ironic for the city of Houston.
McLane's predecessor, John McMullen, was vilified in Houston for the way he operated the Astros. It didn't matter to his critics that when McMullen bought the team in 1979, he saved it for the city. They just wanted him out, saying that if he sold it, they would come.
But the fans haven't, and now the city faces the Astros' possible departure 16 years after McMullen came to their rescue.
 
Plugging the Holes
 While George Steinbrenner continues to talk with Buck Showalter about his status as manager and the Yankees search for someone who will take a general manager's position devoid of authority and the normal general manager's duties, other clubs are filling their vacancies.
The Detroit Tigers have settled on Randy Smith as their general manager, replacing Joe Klein; the Baltimore Orioles are zeroing in on Davey Johnson as their manager, replacing Phil Regan, and the St. Louis Cardinals are trying to lure Tony La Russa into their managerial uniform that was last worn by Mike Jorgensen.
The Orioles still have to decide on a general manager, which they are expected to do by the end of the week. The Montreal Expos, President Claude Brochu said, are taking their time finding a general manager "who fits." The San Diego Padres are interviewing candidates for their general manager vacancy. The Tigers need a manager but won't do anything until after they officially name Smith. Oakland continues to consider alternatives to La Russa should he decide to accept the Cardinals' offer.

 BODY:

PROFITS
 
The Black Ink Flows Freely
A tide of rising earnings washed over the markets but did not quite lift all boats. Allaying Wall Street's biggest fear, Microsoft reported that Windows 95 was selling very well indeed and that its earnings were up 58 percent. Intel, Sun Microsystem, Silicon Graphics and I.B.M. were also strong performers; Apple Computer was the major disappointment, down 47.6 percent. Pharmaceutical companies and brokerage houses also had strong quarters, and General Motors beat expectations. But Ford Motor took a stiff loss, its profits down 68 percent as costs rose and overseas sales slipped. The Dow, the S. & P. 500 and the Big Board composite rode the news to record highs.
 
ALARM BELLS
 
So Much for Oversight
The Federal Reserve and Daiwa Bank's management won no applause for their review of trading problems at the bank's New York branch. A former Fed official disclosed that nearly two years before Daiwa disclosed its $1.1 billion loss from unauthorized trading, the president of the New York Fed had met with Daiwa to discuss the employee, Toshihide Iguchi, and his trading practices. Clearly the followup left a lot to be desired. As Mr. Noguchi pleaded guilty in Federal court to a variety of charges, both he and prosecutors said two senior executives at Daiwa conspired to conceal the loss. Daiwa said only that it was continuing its own investigation.
 
SAFETY NET
 
Dialing for Dollars
Concerns about Japanese banking go far beyond Daiwa. The Federal Reserve put in place a system to provide Japanese financial authorities with billions of dollars in cash, almost instantly, in exchange for U.S. Treasury bonds and bills held by the Japanese. The goal is to avert a catastrophic bank collapse that would ripple around the globe. And because the Treasury would receive its own issues in exchange for the cash, the safety net appears to be risk free.
 
TAXES
 
Stumbling on the High Wire
First President Clinton told a group of business executives that he had raised taxes "too much" in his first budget, providing comfort to Republican critics and infuriating Democrats who had stood by him at the time. A day later, he backtracked and said he was "very, very proud of what I did."

TRADE
 
Progress, Setbacks
The good news about trade? The U.S. trade deficit fell sharply to $8.8 billion in August, helped by a surge in exports, especially to Western Europe. The bad news? The U.S. trade deficit with China grew 18 percent to $3.9 billion for the month -- more than three-quarters the size of the much-publicized deficit with Japan, which was essentially unchanged, at $5.1 billion.
 
BANKING
 
Deal of the Week
Hostile takeovers are rare in the world of banking, in part because of the regulatory approvals needed, but Wells Fargo plunged in with a whopping $10 billion bid for First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, a company it has long coveted. First Interstate, which holds a strong position in 14 Western states, said it was "deeply disappointed with this uninvited action," but Wall Street and investors, who bid up Wells Fargo stock, reacted with enthusiasm.
 
DISSONANCE
 
A Nod to Shareholders
Some large institutional shareholders of Archer-Daniels-Midland have been sharply critical of how cozy the company's directors are with management, all the more so after it was learned the Government was investigating the giant food processing company for possible price-fixing. At the annual shareholders meeting, the crusty chief executive, Dwayne O. Andreas, the chief executive, cut off his critics, but the board did agree to appoint a committee to recommend changes.
 
SEATS
 
Big Board, Big Seat
A seat on the New York Stock Exchange sold for $1 million -- the first time in seven digits since just before the 1987 crash and up $50,000 from the last sale in September. The price is four times the recent low, in 1990. By contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average is less than three times its post-crash low. The current price remains below the record high of $1.15 million, a month before the 1987 crash. And what does the buyer get for $1 million? One of 1,366 seats that confer the right to trade stocks on the floor of the Big Board, an activity that involves a lot of running around. Buying a seat does not provide a place to sit.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 24, 1995, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Diary column of the Money and Business section on Sunday about the $1.1 billion trading loss at the New York office of Daiwa Bank referred incompletely to accounts of discussions two years ago between the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William J. McDonough, and a top Daiwa executive. Although a former senior official of the Federal Reserve said the name of the trader responsible for the loss came up at a meeting on Oct. 4, 1993 -- with Mr. McDonough and Takeshi Ohta, then the vice chairman of Daiwa Bank Ltd. -- Mr. McDonough denied that account late last week.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FOREST HILLS;
Cuomo Says Lessons Learned On Housing Have Been Ignored

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
For Mario M. Cuomo, mediating the housing project controversy in Forest Hills in the 1970's was a first feature performance on the public stage that he would later dominate over three terms as Governor of New York.
In an interview, Mr. Cuomo said that issues raised more than 20 years ago in Forest Hills have particular resonance now and offer a window into the nation's failure to deal with problems of race and poverty. 
 "Forest Hills describes a situation in Queens that in many ways was a metaphor for the larger situation with race," he said. "Color was the most important thing, and it shouldn't have been. Economic class should have been the most important thing."
Mr. Cuomo, who chronicled his work as a mediator in a book, "Forest Hills Diary" (Random House, 1974), said that New York City found answers in Forest Hills that have been ignored since.
"The idea of a small dose of integration that could be absorbed by the larger community had intelligence," he said. "It's just that they never did it again, anywhere else."
The problem, Mr. Cuomo said, was that most communities were highly resistant to having a mix of economic classes. To illustrate his point, he offered another Queens example.
"At the same time Forest Hills was happening, Baisley Park was happening," he said. "Baisley Park was in South Jamaica, and involved the plan for a low-income housing project in an established stable middle-class community, except that Baisley Park was all black, it was black middle class. And the Baisley Park reaction was at least as furious as the Forest Hills reaction. The point I drew from that is that there is something beyond color here, it's economic class and distinction."
Much of the contention at the Forest Hills Cooperative today involves the question of shareholder rights, with tenants wanting more control over who moves in. Mr. Cuomo predicted the danger of calling a public housing project a cooperative in his book 23 years ago. (The idea was promoted by Borough President Donald Manes to assuage opponents.)
Mr. Cuomo wrote: "One of the aspects of the cooperative that is most appealing to the community is the fact that it provides for a board of directors. . . . It is apparently being commonly assumed that such a board of directors would have the right to make the ultimate tenant selection. . . . I am convinced this is not so and could not be so legally. There is a great danger in not making this clear. . . . I've tried to, but the little publicity given my remarks has been lost."
In the interview, Mr. Cuomo focused on how the book ties into the current problems in housing policy and race relations.
"The most obvious lesson about housing, which everyone refuses to address, is that we made a colossal blunder in insisting that the poor people be stacked one on top of the other in small confined areas," he said. "You have to do everything you can to involve as many people as you can in the circle of opportunity. You can't just keep them out there and live your comfortable existence, wherever it is." D.M.H.

13 Charged in Decade-Old Car-Theft Ring

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
When Ira Mandel wrecked his gray Mercedes-Benz in an accident on Long Island over Labor Day weekend two years ago, he knew just whom to call. He phoned David Prevete, a known purveyor of gleaming stolen automobiles and parts, said the Queens District Attorney, Richard A. Brown.
Mr. Prevete had an identical car stolen and fitted with the vehicle identification number from the wrecked car, allowing Mr. Mandel to drive an undamaged Mercedes 300 SE worth $53,700 and collect insurance money, officials said. 
 Investigators brought an end to Mr. Prevete's multimillion-dollar theft ring last week when they arrested him, Mr. Mandel and 11 other men, said Mr. Brown, who announced a 103-count indictment.
The ring had operated for more than a decade in Queens, Brooklyn and Nassau County, sometimes raking in $1 million a day, investigators said. The men were arrested at their homes after a 22-month inquiry.
"This indictment exposes a network of thieves, cutters, chop-shop operators and stolen-parts distributors that has plagued legitimate car owners," Mr. Brown said. "It also goes to the heart of a lucrative black market run by organized crime."
The indictment charges that Mr. Prevete, 33, of Valley Stream, L.I., and Nicholas Scalfani, 32, of Howard Beach ran the daily operation of the Prevete Brothers Company, a licensed automobile wrecking business on Roosevelt Avenue in Flushing.
The men owned and operated the Prevete-Scalfani Organization, which was at the same address and was the central headquarters and distribution center for the resale of stolen cars and parts, law enforcement officials said.
They were teamed up with Ciro Tucci, 27, of Brooklyn, investigators said. The investigators said that Mr. Tucci ran a chop shop at 303 Elton Street in Brooklyn and that he would steal cars as ordered by Mr. Prevete and Mr. Scalfani, dismantle them and deliver the parts to the Prevete Brothers. Mr. Tucci was charged under the state's Organized Crime Control Act with engaging in a corrupt enterprise.
Mr. Prevete was also charged with engaging in a corrupt enterprise and faces up to 25 years in prison. Mr. Mandel was charged with grand larceny and faces up to 15 years in prison.
Also charged were Kevin Sardo, George Omeste and Paul Famano, who the officials said were employed by Mr. Tucci to steal the cars, dismantle them and deliver the parts. They also reportedly dismantled cars that had been falsely reported as stolen to insurance companies , the officials said. They were each charged with engaging in a corrupt enterprise.
James Cadicamo of Howard Beach and Andrew Iglio of New Hyde Park, L.I., were indicted for their roles at what officials said was a chop shop on Douglass Street in Brooklyn. The men were accused of receiving orders for car thefts from Mr. Prevete and Mr. Scalfani. Both men were charged with grand larceny.
The authorities said the ring was the second largest auto theft and chop shop operation to be dismantled this year in Queens, which has the city's highest car theft rate.
In February, a man identified by the authorities as a captain in the Bonnano crime family and 12 other people were charged with running a criminal enterprise that included car thieves, dismantlers, receivers and illegal parts dealers. LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SHEEPSHEAD BAY;
New Language, and a New Life, for Avenue U

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
When the Rev. Paul Tseng moved the Brooklyn Chinese Christian Church from Flatbush into an old American Legion hall in Sheepshead Bay seven years ago, about 30 worshipers went to his weekly Baptist services. These days more than 200 attend.
"The community changed," Mr. Tseng said last week in his church, on East 15th Street and Gravesend Neck Road. "More Chinese came to buy houses and settle. We have the D and Q train here, which goes to Chinatown. We have stores and restaurants on Avenue U. And we have the church." 
 A growing Chinese population is slowly transforming Sheepshead Bay. Markets selling star fruits, bok choy, won ton skins and fresh fish are cropping up around Avenue U's old Italian salumerias and bagel stores. Video stores rent the latest Hong Kong thrillers. And the Ocean Palace Pavilion -- a marble-fronted, two-story, 300-seat restaurant serving seafood and Hong Kong cuisine -- opened in July to become one of the avenue's largest restaurants.
The area's Chinese population has grown from 2,706 in 1980 to about 10,000 now, according to census figures. And Frank Vardy, a senior demographer with the City Planning Department, said the actual number could be significantly higher. He said many Chinese families are moving to Sheepshead Bay from Chinatown, mirroring the migration of Italians and Jews who moved there from the Lower East Side half a century ago. "It's a pattern," he said.
Many were attracted to Sheepshead Bay by its abundance of one- and two-family houses and its proximity to Chinatown via the D train. Once the first waves came, more followed to join the growing community.
Many of the new Chinese businesses -- along with a growing number of Russian stores -- are being credited with revitalizing the commercial stretch along Avenue U, which suffered economically after the Kings Plaza Mall began drawing shoppers away.
"It's the mom-and-pop types of things that you cannot get at the mall," said John Nikas, the chairman of Community Board 15. "Now you've got specialty shops selling foods and clothes that the mall cannot match."
Brenda Tong, a real estate broker at Century 21, said the influx has helped keep the housing market steady while other neighborhoods have declined. Like many other businesses in Sheepshead Bay, Century 21 has Cyrillic, Chinese and Latin lettering on its awning.
Ms. Tong, who has lived in the area for 24 years, was pleased when stores like the V & H Supermarket opened on Avenue U and East 13th Street to sell everything from snails, live crabs, snow pea tips and oyster sauce to green tea, woks and rice cookers.
"I used to go to Chinatown once a week to go shopping," she said. "Now I go here. They have everything."
There have been tensions. In the late 1980's, a series of racist fliers charged that the Chinese were "smiling at us behind our backs and planning to take over the whole neighborhood." And there have been problems with the gangs that prey on Chinese people all over the city: two years ago the police rescued nine hostages from a Bedford Avenue house after they had been kidnapped by members of the Fuk Ching gang.
But Mr. Tseng, of the church, said that relations have improved and that officers from the 61st Precinct have been helpful. Now Mr. Tseng -- whose church comprises two buildings and a basketball court marked by a sign proclaiming "Jesus Is Lord" in English and Chinese -- is thinking about expanding. His summer day camp has grown so large that he now rents space from Public School 254, on East 18th Street.

THE RUSSIANS IN GERMANY
A History of the Soviet
Zone of Occupation, 1945-1949.
By Norman M. Naimark.
Illustrated. 586 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: The Belknap Press/
Harvard University Press. $35. 
 IF ever a nation deserved to be occupied by a vindictive foe, it was Germany in 1945. Yet it is impossible to read Norman M. Naimark's masterly analysis of the Soviet occupation between the end of the war and the emergence of two German states in 1949 without feeling some sympathy for the East Germans. For them the hour of defeat was only the beginning of an ordeal that lasted more than a generation. When the German Democratic Republic disintegrated in 1989 and 1990, the roots of discontent could be traced back to those four years of Russian military rule. The very fact that East Germany did collapse so easily, despite the best efforts of the Bonn Government to sustain it over the previous decade, is inexplicable unless one takes into account the grisly circumstances of its birth.
Even now, the legacy of Stalinization haunts these lands between the Elbe and the Oder: a disparate amalgam of provinces then united only in misfortune, and hence identified by the inhabitants just as "the zone." Having labored long in the archives -- German, Russian and American -- Mr. Naimark, who teaches at Stanford and is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution in California, writes densely. But the richness of his documentation is one of the strengths of his book, and one forgives him his occasional repetitions.
At the level of high politics, his story is one of mutual disillusionment: the Russians' exasperation with the Germans, who obstinately refused to show their gratitude at the ballot box, to work overtime to pay reparations, or to admire Soviet culture; and the German Communists' frustration with their masters in Moscow, who could not see that their cause was undermined by the occupiers' arbitrary violence, their evisceration of the economy and their high-handed manner. A handful of personalities emerge: the great Marshal Georgi Zhukov, the conqueror who was not above furnishing his Moscow apartments with German plunder; the formidable Col. Sergei Tiulpanov, the balding Russian propaganda chief who shocked visiting American officers by walking arm in arm with Germans; the obedient Walter Ulbricht, the future dictator of East Germany, whose unpopularity was outweighed for the Russians by his loyalty; the ruthless Erich Mielke, mastermind of the secret police, who had orders "to know everything and to report everything worth knowing"; the pliable Otto Grotewohl, who led the Social Democrats into a shotgun wedding with the Communists (as the Socialist Unity Party, or S.E.D.) and who returned from Moscow proclaiming, "Comrade Stalin is the father of the world."
While he brilliantly untangles the politics of the S.E.D. and the Soviet administration, Mr. Naimark also tells us what was happening to the population. Up to two million German women were raped in the Soviet zone or while being expelled from the eastern provinces; these rapes, often accompanied by murder, continued long after hostilities ended. Thousands of Junkers and other landowners who had survived the Soviet invasion and the seizure of their estates were rounded up and forced to live on the freezing Baltic island of Rugen, where an unknown number died. One-third of the surviving industrial plant in the zone was dismantled and taken to the Soviet Union (very little was ever reassembled), while 60 percent of the remaining production was confiscated as reparations. In October 1946, thousands of German scientists and technicians were rounded up at night and deported with their families and possessions to the Soviet Union, where they remained for at least three years.
Most chilling of all is the account of the zone's unofficial gulag, which lasted until 1950. There were 11 "special camps," and since the discovery of mass graves in 1992, their full horror has become plain: Mr. Naimark accepts a figure of 95,000 deaths out of 240,000 prisoners, mainly dissidents and "class enemies" rather than Nazi war criminals. Others disappeared into the Soviet gulag. Scarcely less grim were the East German uranium mines, to which tens of thousands of workers (including thousands of women) were conscripted every year to work in nightmarish conditions, knee-deep in radioactive slime. There are no figures for deaths, but in three months in 1948 there were 574 accidents; an average of 10 workers died in each.
There are some touching moments in this chronicle of inhumanity. When Ulbricht tried to persuade a group of farmers to expropriate the local landowner, they replied, "But we have no law for this." Ulbricht's response was characteristic: "All right, fine, if you want a law, we will make a law so that you can carry it out in a completely orderly fashion." This very German obsession with law and order, which the impatient Russians saw as mere temporizing, is a recurrent theme.
 THE most original chapter in this startlingly original book shows how the rapes committed by Soviet troops undermined the basis of the East German Government long before it existed. The ritualized humiliation of German womanhood was the retribution for Hitler's racial war of extermination. But for German women, who were not allowed to air their suffering and fear in public, it meant a lasting trauma -- divorce, illegitimacy and abortion rates all shot up, accompanied by an epidemic of venereal disease -- and alienation from the Soviet Union and East Germany. Women seem to have voted for the S.E.D. in markedly lower numbers, and it is easy to see why: Mr. Naimark recounts in detail public meetings at which women's anxieties were dismissed and the word "rape" was never mentioned; Nazi bandits in Soviet uniforms were blamed for all such attacks.
One issue Mr. Naimark raises but does not analyze in depth is the role of anti-Semitism on both sides. The ferocity of the Russian occupiers is partly explained by the fact that they had been led to believe that most victims of the Nazi death camps were Russian prisoners; the Final Solution was played down by Stalin. The ablest members of Tiulpanov's staff were Germanophone Russian Jews, but they were sent back to the Soviet Union once Stalin's "anticosmopolitanism" witch hunt began. Whether German anti-Semitism exacerbated tensions with these Russian Jews is not explored here, but S.E.D. leaders generally kept German Jews out of sight. Survivors of the Nazi camps were seen as less reliable than Soviet-trained exiles.
When East Germany fell, its opponents included many women, as well as the spiritual (and often actual) descendants of groups on the left who, 40 years before, had refused to join the S.E.D. and were sent to penal colonies. It was appropriate that a Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, precipitated the collapse; for it was one of his forerunners, Stalin, who by his brutal policies in the late 1940's helped insure that the "first socialist state on German soil" did not outlive its founding fathers.

THE NAKED HEART
The Bourgeois Experience:
Victoria to Freud. Volume 4.
By Peter Gay.
Illustrated. 463 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $29.95. 
 PETER GAY is the author of many books, but his multi volume work "The Bourgeois Experience: Victoria to Freud" is clearly meant to be his masterpiece. "The Naked Heart" is the fourth volume of the series, and it seems there is at least one more to come. The first, "Education of the Senses" (1984), was intended to revise conventional notions of the place of sex in 19th-century bourgeois culture. It was followed two years later by "The Tender Passion," which moved the inquiry from sex to love. In 1993 there followed "The Cultivation of Hatred." These are all very long books, discursive in method but carefully annotated, supplemented by huge bibliographical essays and animated by the same Freudian interest in the discontents induced by the conflict between what human beings desire and what their civilization permits.
Freud is not only Mr. Gay's terminus but his mentor; his presence is decisive without being obtrusive, a sort of ground bass to the evidence, which is drawn from a thousand sources, American, English, French and German. These books testify to an astonishing assiduity in research. Mr. Gay, the Sterling Professor of History emeritus at Yale University, likes to approach his grand theme anecdotally, and the multitude of case histories he offers constitutes much of the pleasure of reading his work -- though one may occasionally feel that his passion for storytelling is such that the flood of illustrations swamps the basic argument.
His first volume opened (after a valuable "general introduction") with the tale of Mabel Loomis Todd, "that reputable, socially ambitious wife and mother" who became the mistress of Austin Dickinson, the treasurer of Amherst College and brother of the poet Emily. Mabel Todd kept a sexually informative journal, preserved, along with many letters, in several boxes. Mr. Gay saw no reason to be economical in his account of this treasure, and, although he has rarely treated other individuals in quite such detail, he showed in his pages on Mabel Todd how he meant to continue.
In the earlier volumes Mr. Gay also discussed in his lively, thorough way such matters as Victorian sex manuals and courtship customs, but in the third he turned away from the study of love to the study of hatred, sometimes the antithesis, sometimes merely the obverse, of love. Explaining how this bourgeois society dealt with innate human aggression called for disquisitions on the dueling customs of German students, the cult of manliness, the oppression of women, the appetite for corporal and capital punishment, and much else, above all nationalism and war -- in short, all the seemingly uncontrollable aggressive forces that the bourgeois conscience had to try to contain.
Mr. Gay has always emphasized the surviving influence of Enlightenment thinking on the 19th-century bourgeoisie -- neglect of this influence he takes to be one of the reasons that the conventional representations of that class have been inadequate. In "The Naked Heart" he takes up the question of its Romantic inheritance, most visible in its changing conceptions of selfhood. This is not a new topic, but Mr. Gay treats it in his own way. He seeks and finds in abundance evidence that the bourgeoisie sought in the 19th century as never before to lay bare their hearts. And the efforts of the period to understand individual as well as general human motivation culminate, of course, in Freud.
The new starting point is, rather unexpectedly, music, which Mr. Gay regards as an important indication of a new taste for "inwardness." That the bourgeoisie inherited from the late 18th century a taste for music, and owned pianos (which became an index of class), is certainly true. It is also true that music came to be listened to with reverence and deep emotion; Mr. Gay aptly quotes Stendhal's remarks that music can provide "a deeply regressive communion with one's past." Wagner and Schumann set everybody an example by combining inspiration with craftsmanship, Mr. Gay writes, a coalition of genius and prudence held to be typical of the general cultivation of a controlled "inwardness." He does mention the phenomenon of Bayreuth hysteria, which surely entailed some loss of selfhood, but perhaps you could succumb to the ecstasies of the second act of "Tristan und Isolde" without quite forgetting yourself. I'm reminded of the French Symbolist who urged all poets to proceed to Bayreuth on their knees, but reminded them that there was an excellent train service.
 THE book really gets going when Mr. Gay begins to talk about Romantic literature and its legacy -- a new sense of selfhood -- to the Victorian bourgeoisie. Now "the Romantic egotistical sublime broadened out into a bourgeois egotistical sublime," and one consequence was a profusion of autobiographies, written "in Rousseau's shadow" but constrained by both the fear of saying too little and the fear of saying too much.
This section obviously and irresistibly invites more biographical narrative, and there follow many pages on Goethe, John Stuart Mill, Cardinal Newman and others. Edmund Gosse's "Father and Son" is an example of the sort of minor work that here gets deserved attention, and Mr. Gay offers some wise remarks on the theory and practice of autobiography. Inevitably there was also a new cult of biography, which grew increasingly candid; the change of tone is neatly illustrated by Mr. Gay's comment on three lives of Horatio Nelson, in which Lady Hamilton's part in the story is progressively revealed. The desire to tell all began to prevail over bourgeois reticence.
Tainted by fashion, history -- to the annoyance of some professional historians (critical and colorless, as Lord Acton said they should be) -- grew more biographical, more inward; and fiction, also taking part in this quest for inwardness, grew more arcane, thereby dividing the audience for fiction into connoisseurs who could understand Henry James and the mass of readers who didn't even try.
Such is Mr. Gay's breadth of learning that at times it seems impossible to believe that a single person could know so much and in such detail. He has such relish for writing that he will tell you the plot of "David Copperfield," even though he has reason to believe you already know it, and you get used to his saying things like this: "Its history is well known but deserves retelling" -- a remark that introduces an informative disquisition on the history of the British post office. However, he is right to assume that none of his readers can possibly know a tenth of what he does; he covers so much ground that this book could serve as an example, but also a warning, to aspiring cultural historians.
That they must spend much time in dusty archives Mr. Gay demonstrates by his use of unpublished personal letters and journals. They can be touching as well as appropriate to his theme. A dying 19-year-old woman of precocious learning says of her journal: "I have poured out my feelings. . . . I have written much that I would show only to a very few, and much that I would on no account submit to any human eye." "Her innermost self was nobody's business but her own," Mr. Gay comments. Except ours, of course, as we study the progress of the bourgeoisie toward inwardness. If they weren't quite bold enough to expose the naked heart, we, no longer troubled by reticence, will do it for them.
With the aid of Freud, the 19th-century conflicts between instinct and civilization are here as fully examined as anybody could wish. And we are left with the possibly erroneous conviction that whatever our own problems, they aren't such that they can prevent us from understanding those of the Victorians.

Not One Drop Of British Reserve

BYLINE: By CAROL KINO; Carol Kino has written about art for The Atlantic Monthly, Artnews and the British magazine Modern Painters.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
DAMIEN HIRST PUTS CUT-UP COWS in formaldehyde. Rachel Whiteread makes inside-out casts of furniture and rooms. Marc Quinn is best known for a self-portrait bust, cast in his own blood. Mona Hatoum has led viewers through her own intestines aided by an endoscopic camera.
The media these artists use include painting, sculpture, assemblage, photography, collage, installation, video and a few that haven't yet been named. Some of these works take the artist's own life for inspiration; others are propelled by a fashionably streetwise esthetic. In still others, lyricism or history are driving forces. And throughout there is a none-too-subtle undercurrent of anomie and sex. 
 These artists are young, mostly under 35, and live and work in London. Left to their own devices in a climate of deep recession and intense social change, they've created a scene that is putting London back on the map as an iconoclastic international art center. And starting today, work by 22 of them can be seen in " 'Brilliant!' New Art From London," at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.
Some of the pieces have appeared in shows before: Sarah Lucas's 1993 "Concrete Boots," a Doc Martens look-alike, and Sam Taylor-Wood's 1994 photograph "Slut," a self-portrait showing her neck covered with love bites. Others are fresh from the studio, like Jake and Dinos Chapman's fiberglass sculpture "Ubermensch," which perches Stephen Hawking, the wheelchair-bound physicist, on top of a rocky crag.
At first glance, the London art scene appears to be a kind of social club of artists who studied together, many at one or another of the city's 10 art schools, and who still often share studios and socialize at the same boozy, smoky openings. They operate spaces to show one another's work, appear together in group shows and sometimes work together on projects. "They have this kind of rivalry and camaraderie at the same time," said Victoria Miro, a London dealer who has four artists in "Brilliant!"
Another dealer has a somewhat different view. "This is a group of artists who have emerged in the post-Thatcher era, with a mentality of 'You can get what you want if you club together,' " said Jay Jopling, the 31-year-old London dealer whose tiny commercial gallery, White Cube, in Piccadilly, is viewed by many as the club's salon.
At second glance, the milieu is also one of savvy marketing and individual chutzpah. Mr. Hirst, Mr. Jopling's most celebrated artist, has alienated many art followers by using what some regard as a particularly trendy brand of nihilism to turn himself into an art star. Five years ago, Mr. Hirst created an unsettling life cycle in a glass box: a rotting cow's head, a pile of maggots and a bug zapper to kill the flies that hatched. For his "Natural History" series he filled more glass boxes with formaldehyde and added such things as a shark, a bisected cow and a fluffy white lamb. Though Mr. Hirst makes other sorts of assemblages, as well as paintings, his continued use of dead animals has made him a favorite of the tabloid press.
Mr. Jopling defends such tactics. "I don't call it shock value," he said. "For years, arts editors of national newspapers have lambasted contemporary art in this country. Artists have had to fight that much harder to have any attention paid to their work."
Besides, he pointed out, people tend to forget that Mr. Hirst is a team player. He first came to public notice when, as an art student in 1988, he helped curate "Freeze," a polished and successful group show held in a warehouse. And while he has gone on to a vigorous solo career, Mr. Hirst still insists on showing as part of a group, sometimes alongside freshly minted art school graduates.
Mr. Jopling, for his part, has risen to prominence as a sort of freelance ringmaster, helping artists put together temporary, often site-specific shows in the floating gallery scene that began to flourish in London during the late 1980's. The collapse of the art market in the early 1990's, which practically decimated the city's tiny gallery world, conveniently coincided with a depressed real-estate market that left plenty of atmospheric warehouses, slaughterhouses and office buildings empty.
Floating galleries took off on roughly the same schedule as acid house parties and raves, and, like them, depend as much on the experience of being there as on the actual work presented. For many, the job of extracting marketable artifacts from this scene sometimes became a work of art in itself. Two years ago, Tracey Emin, a 32-year-old Londoner, sought investors in her "creative potential," offering four letters a year as collateral.
Mr. Jopling gave Ms. Emin a show at White Cube and has been marketing her life-as-work pieces ever since. At a recent art fair, he installed her in a bed, covered by a quilt -- which promptly sold -- that Ms. Emin had made from old clothes and other mementos. In "Brilliant!" she will exhibit a tent appliqued with the names of all those with whom she has ever shared a bed.
Are these artists and dealers cynically exploiting a gullible public for their own gain? Or do they display an admirable seat-of-the-pants creativity of the sort that is desperately needed to recharge a depressed climate? In Britain, which remains comparatively socialist, that is the kind of major moral quandary provoked by Thatcher-style entrepreneurism.
If many of the marketing tactics seem to be born of Thatcherism, what appears to bind the work together thematically is a reaction against it. When British Pop Art boomed more than 30 years ago, its artists (like Richard Hamilton and David Hockney) were the product of a more cohesive society, a spirit of playful cross-class experimentation and a fascination with consumerism.
 THE CURRENT SCENE finds inspiration in the dour notion that British civilization has reached the end of its road. A lively obsession with mortality and decay can be seen across the board, starting with that famously rotting cow's head and even echoing through an older generation perhaps best illustrated by Lucian Freud's mordant and fleshly nudes.
For a recent gallery opening, Anya Gallaccio festooned the walls with Pop Art-like daisy chains and left them to decompose, a project she is repeating at the Walker. Work like Mr. Hirst's and Ms. Gallaccio's is often said to refer back to the "memento mori" tradition, bespeaking an unblinking, fundamentally healthy acceptance of death. But blink another way, and it looks like a political response to consumerism, which tends to promote itself by promising everlasting youth.
Many young artists in Britain are similarly fixated on domestic life, community and civic planning, all totems of the partly dismantled welfare state. Two years ago, in an installation called "I Love You," Rachel Evans stenciled a lace curtain on a gallery window in Vaseline and filled the air with the scent of Vicks. Abigail Lane, whose work appears at the Walker, constructs art from media like ink pads and stamps and crime photographs, the evidence of an increasingly intimidating police force.
Ms. Whiteread, probably the best known of the "Brilliant!" 22, is celebrated for her simple, elegiac casts of domestic objects like sinks, cabinets and mattresses. In 1993, she won the Turner Prize, Britain's major contemporary art award. The same year she also made a monument using as her mold the interior of an entire Victorian row house.
Yet politics, for the young British artist, offers endless ironies. While Ms. Whiteread's inside-out "House" was praised as a paean to vanishing notions of community and public housing, it reportedly sat less well with the working-class people who had to live alongside it.
Ms. Whiteread, like many of her colleagues, received a major career boost when she was discovered by Charles Saatchi. Mr. Saatchi, a founding partner of Saatchi & Saatchi, the giant advertising company that helped lever Mrs. Thatcher's Tory Party to power, has long been a major collector of contemporary British art, some of which he presents to the public in a privately run gallery.
But perhaps the most curious contradiction of all is that the British press and the public, both of which have long been renowned for their dislike of contemporary art, have recently begun to embrace it. Last month alone, three art events attracted large crowds and mostly enthusiastic reviews.
In an installation by Cornelia Parker in Hyde Park, Tilda Swinton, the star of the 1993 film "Orlando," reclined in a glass vitrine alongside other vitrines holding objects like one of Queen Victoria's stockings and the pillows from Sigmund Freud's couch.
With the support of Artangel, a charity that organizes several site-specific events a year, the director Robert Wilson mounted a work called "HG," a rabbit warren of mysterious, stunningly theatrical installations in some medieval dungeons beneath London Bridge.
And those old provocateurs, the always well-dressed performance artists Gilbert and George, displayed brightly colored photomontages depicting their naked selves and their own bodily waste. Though this show, installed in a Government-financed gallery, could have been expected to raise hackles, two weeks into its run only two written complaints had been received.
Today, with the opening of its first major museum show, an art movement apparently born of social dissent seems to be verging on public acceptance. Maybe in the end, it will turn out to cohere not around transient change but around deeply rooted tastes: the national passion for theater, the appreciation of style for style's sake and a longstanding love of nose thumbing. Or perhaps what binds it together is the simple fact that, as Gilbert told a visitor recently: "There's a kind of anarchic atmosphere underneath, in London. And that's where art is."

BYLINE: By William Glaberson 

 BODY:
YOU used to sit down with your morning newspaper and say, "Let's see what's happening in the world."
But in Miami, that is being updated: Get your morning coffee, settle back with The Miami Herald and read all about what is happening in nine subject areas. 
 Nine? In a recent memorandum to the paper's staff that has drawn bemusement in newsrooms across the country -- and has perplexed some journalists at The Herald -- the newspaper's publisher said the paper was now going to "focus its newsroom resources on nine subject areas that readers have told us are especially important and useful."
Here, then, is what might be called The Miami Herald's Top Nine list: local government, education, sports, environment, consumer news, Florida news, health and medicine, Latin America and crime.
Sorry, Mr. Perot: The Presidential race didn't make the cut. "I think the net effect of this is a lot of head scratching in the newsroom," said Tom Fiedler, The Herald's chief political writer.
The Oct. 11 memorandum, signed by the paper's publisher, David Lawrence Jr., and its president, Joe Natoli, also happened to mention that the paper, which has been cutting its staff and closing bureaus for some time, is in store for more newsroom slimming. The Herald, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., will soon have still fewer journalists as it keeps squeezing costs.
Mr. Lawrence asserted there was no relationship between the new "focusing" and the new cutbacks. He said the paper conducted "the best newspaper research project we have seen anywhere."
The research included studies by consultants of reader preferences. The decision to focus on some of those preferences, Mr. Lawrence said, was simply a response to a problem affecting many newspapers: sinking circulation.
Mr. Lawrence and the paper's executive editor, Doug Clifton, sounded offended in separate telephone conversations when asked whether the decision to focus on nine subjects might mean readers would get a less expansive view of current events. Both pointed out that the paper would still cover things that weren't listed.
Mr. Clifton acknowledged, however, that if gardening, for example, weren't on the list of nine subjects, "I guess you could say gardening would be somewhat diminished; there would be those kinds of trade-offs."
Gardening isn't on the list. But, as several journalists at The Herald noted with a touch of anxiety, in addition to national politics, other areas that didn't make the list include religion, economics, investigative reporting and, for that matter, world affairs.
Mr. Clifton said all newspapers make decisions about what to cover. He said a recent 18-month strategic planning process that included hundreds of Herald journalists had come up with coverage priorities that were similar to those identified by readers in the research.
Mr. Clifton added that the list of nine subjects would simply give editors a road map to help them make daily decisions. As an example, he said the paper would probably beef up consumer coverage and make sure such features as product-recall information could be easily found by readers.
But what if something other than a product recall happened in London, Tokyo, Denver or, say, Bosnia?
Readers of Miami's alternative newspaper, New Times, may have been given a hint of what is in store at The Herald in an article dealing with The Herald's coverage of the Bosnian war this summer. New Times published a memorandum written by Mr. Clifton to his staff in July on The Herald's computer system.
The memo, whose contents were confirmed by staff members, indicated he was not convinced that readers considered the paper's war coverage to be important and useful. By then, it is now possible to speculate, Mr. Clifton might have already been given an early tip that Bosnia had not made the Top Nine list.
"If anyone has an idea on what to do with the Bosnia story, I welcome it," Mr. Clifton wrote. "I'm embarrassed to say I long ago stopped reading this story of enormous human tragedy and significant global consequence."
Mr. Clifton argued that the fault belonged partly to journalists who had failed to answer what he said was the main question of readers: "What does this mean to ME?"
"If we can't make that clear in type and visuals," he added, "the story becomes one of faraway strangers killing other strangers in cities with unpronounceable names."
There were a few on the staff who took the reference to "visuals" as a sign that the wind was not blowing toward more in-depth journalism at The Herald.
Juan Tamayo, then the foreign editor, answered Mr. Clifton electronically. Mr. Tamayo attacked what he seemed to see as Mr. Clifton's destructive message.
Mr. Tamayo's sarcastic memo was also printed in New Times. "We want punch, pizazz," Mr. Tamayo steamed in his E-mail response. "We want that graphic that explains it all in three easy steps, that one zinger story that catches up those of us who have NOT BEEN READING some of the truly great stories we have carried over the past two years."
Outside the paper, some Herald watchers also do not like what they have seen lately. Joseph A. Angotti, a former senior vice president of news at NBC who now teaches communication at the University of Miami, said such moves as the issuing of the Herald list seemed to be driven by focus groups and reader research. He said he worried that newspaper editors were abdicating their job of deciding what was worth covering.
Reader research, Mr. Angotti said, probably would not have provoked coverage of the civil rights movement, for example. "I think one of the problems with The Herald -- and with a lot of newspapers -- is they pay too much attention to focus groups," he said.

HEADLINE: In Mississippi, Will Poor Grow Poorer With State Welfare Plan?

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., Oct. 17

 BODY:
Nine hundred miles away in the nation's capital, liberals are warning that the Republican plan to eliminate the Federal entitlement to welfare will encourage states to "race to the bottom."
Mississippi is already there. 
 It is a state where one of every three children lives in poverty, where the percentage of households without telephones or complete plumbing is twice the national average and where 22 percent of babies delivered last year were born to teen-age mothers. It is also the state with the lowest cash benefits for welfare recipients -- $120 a month for a mother with two children, less than a third of the national median. And unlike 31 states, Mississippi has no welfare program for single men and childless couples.
Now, as members of a House and Senate conference committee prepare to negotiate a final welfare bill, the question in states like Mississippi is whether newly granted autonomy will tempt them to discard their tattered safety nets altogether. Or will the states, unfettered by Federal requirements, respond by devising creative anti-poverty programs that may move recipients into the work force and out of dependency once and for all.
Those on the left argue that block grants, the lump sum social services payments to states that would replace direct Federal payments to welfare recipients, would be a dangerous tool in the hands of men like Gov. Kirk Fordice, a conservative Republican. "Fordice's position is that the only job training that welfare recipients need is a good alarm clock," said Rims Barber, executive director of the Mississippi Human Services Agenda, an advocacy group based in Jackson.
But Mr. Fordice, who faces re-election next month, responds that the notion that he cannot be trusted to care for the poor of his state is "a disgusting, elitist argument."
"I'm the Governor of a sovereign state that has the people of Mississippi a whole lot more at heart than any soul up there in the Congress of the United States," Mr. Fordice said in an interview.
And yet, Mr. Fordice also manages to confirm many of the worst fears of his opponents.
He said he would gladly accept less money from the Federal Government for social services under the block grant system so long as he is freed of Federal regulations on how to spend it. Both the House welfare bill, which was passed in March, and the Senate bill, which was passed in August, essentially would freeze Federal spending on Aid to Families with Dependent Children for the next five years.
Under the House bill, for instance, Mississippi would receive a slight increase in A.F.D.C. money for the next fiscal year, from $76 million to $79 million, according to estimates by the Department of Health and Human Services. Over the next five years, the state would receive $47 million less than it would if the current welfare system was maintained, according to Health and Human Services estimates.
Social services advocates worry that Mississippi, with the second lowest median income in the country, would have limited capacity to compensate for a loss of that kind if a recession causes the welfare rolls to balloon. And even if the state did have the capacity, they say, it might not have the inclination given that Mississippi's political leadership is largely conservative and white, while 82 percent of its welfare recipients are black.
In general, Mr. Fordice and the leaders of his Department of Human Services believe strongly that the government should use punitive measures to change the behavior of welfare recipients.
Mr. Fordice already has secured a waiver from the Clinton Administration that will go into effect on Nov. 1 to allow Mississippi to prohibit extra benefits for mothers on welfare who have additional children.
The Governor said he was convinced that mothers on welfare became pregnant precisely so that they could collect the $24 a month in extra benefits currently offered by the state. "Anybody who thinks they don't don't know what they're talking about," he said. "We can't keep subsidizing the production of additional illegitimate children."
Mr. Fordice also said he was interested in placing a time limit on the payment of welfare benefits, with two years being "the absolute outside limit."
To eliminate what some call the financial incentives that encourage some recipients to remain on welfare, Mississippi is pinning great hopes on an experimental program known as Work First. The program enables Mississippi to seize welfare and food stamp benefits from recipients and offer them as subsidies to employers who hire the recipients.
"Work First requires people to work for their benefits in a real job, not a hokey program picking up garbage along the highways," said Larry Temple, deputy administrator of the Department of Human Services.
The Work First program began in six of the state's 82 counties earlier this month under special permission from the Clinton Administration. Mr. Fordice said that a block grant system would allow him to expand the program statewide.
In a six-month training period, the state gives companies the equivalent of $3.25 an hour to employ welfare recipients, leaving the employer to contribute at least $1 an hour to bring the worker's pay up to minimum wage. Mothers with children over 3 years of age are required to participate, and the state provides vouchers for child care and transportation to and from work.
The state serves as a clearinghouse to match welfare recipients with jobs, and the recipients are required to accept any position they are offered. If they refuse to participate, they and their children are removed from the welfare rolls. After six months, the state's subsidy ends and employers are expected to hire the welfare recipients permanently. If they do not, the state seeks another job for the recipient.
"I can't blame someone who thoroughly understands the Federal system, as many welfare recipients do, and has calculated that they're much better off laying on the couch and watching TV all day than they are going out and taking a job," Mr. Fordice said. "What we're about here is making it more profitable to take the job."
Mr. Fordice seems to have women like Stella R. Thomas in mind.
The daughter of a woman who spent 21 years on welfare, Ms. Thomas is a 24-year-old single mother of three children who already has a seven-year dependency of her own. She has worked from time to time but has always had to quit because of problems finding child care.
Now she stays home in her Spartan apartment in Jackson's Christian Brotherhood housing project, watching cable television and trying to keep her children away from drug dealers and drive-by shooters.
Ms. Thomas acknowledges that some mothers on welfare would rather collect a government check than work, but said that she was not one of them. She is eager for her youngest child to turn 3 in December, she said, so she can qualify for Work First and its state-provided child care.
"My mom was on welfare so I guess I didn't know any other way and I just followed behind her," Ms. Thomas said. "But that $144 a month and $397 in stamps isn't enough when you have three kids and you cook every day. I don't want to do it all of my life."
With the Work First program just weeks old, state officials expect it to cost money in the short term but to generate significant savings as welfare recipients join the work force.
Because Mississippi's economy is relatively healthy, with unemployment hovering at about 6 percent this year, state officials are optimistic that they can find jobs for all eligible mothers. Employers like Carrie M. Shelton, who hired two Work First participants for her daycare center in Jackson earlier this month, said she had difficulty finding good workers and considered the state subsidy "a blessing."
But the task may get difficult in the poorest parts of the state, like the catfish-and-cotton country of the Mississippi Delta, where unemployment in several counties soars above 15 percent. Although the state's A.F.D.C. caseload has dropped by almost 11 percent to 50,000 families during the last two years, many Delta counties still have more than 10 percent of their population on welfare. And in those same counties, literacy rates and education levels can be remarkably low for welfare recipients, making it difficult to match many with even the most menial jobs.
Warren Yoder, the director of Operation Shoestring, a social services agency in Jackson, worries that without a federally guaranteed income for the poor, states like Mississippi will leave their most destitute citizens with little support, just as they did when emptying psychiatric institutions.
"I think we're shambling our way toward another disaster like that," he said, "but of much greater proportions."

HEADLINE: Louisiana Governor's Race Will Be a Study in Contrasts

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Oct. 22

 BODY:
In a clear reflection of the course of Southern politics, Louisiana voters on Saturday placed a conservative white Republican and a liberal black Democrat in a runoff to become the state's next governor.
Pollsters and political analysts predicted today that the racial and ideological makeup of the state should give State Senator Mike Foster, a 65-year-old Republican from the bayou town of Franklin, an easy path to victory over United States Representative Cleo Fields, a 32-year-old Democrat from Baton Rouge. If Mr. Foster wins in the Nov. 18 runoff, he would become only the second Republican governor elected in the state since Reconstruction. 
 As the South has become increasingly Republican in recent years, Louisiana has been a relative holdout. Its Governor and both United States Senators are Democrats, and its Congressional delegation became majority Republican only this year when Representative W. J. (Billy) Tauzin switched parties.
"We're a little behind the curve," Edward F. Renwick, director of the Institute of Politics at Loyola University in New Orleans, said today. "It's happening here as one of the last places because Louisiana has always been one of the most populist Democratic states. But it happened last night."
Bernie R. Pinsonat, a Baton Rouge pollster, said: "Louisiana is going to become like the rest of the South -- a lot of white Republicans. And the blacks will become the dominant force in the Democratic Party."
In campaigns elsewhere around the South this fall, Democrats have been taking pains to sound like Republicans.
In Mississippi, for instance, Ronnie Musgrove, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, is airing television commercials that describe him as "a common-sense conservative" who supports prayer in the schools, opposes gun control and favors "making able-bodied people on welfare work."
Similarly, in Kentucky, Paul Patton, the Democratic candidate for governor, is running as "a different kind of Democrat" who supports smaller government and boot camps for repeat juvenile offenders.
In Saturday's nonpartisan primary in Louisiana, voters essentially picked the two candidates at the ideological extremes of a 16-person field.
Mr. Foster, who switched from Democrat to Republican in early September, finished with 26 percent of the vote, including 34 percent of the white vote and 5 percent of the black vote, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls conducted by The Times-Picayune and WDSU-TV. Mr. Fields received 19 percent, including 60 percent of the black vote and 2 percent of the white vote. About 28 percent of Louisiana's 2.26 million registered voters are black.
Less than 10,000 votes separated Mr. Fields from State Treasurer Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat and the daughter of Moon Landrieu, the former New Orleans Mayor; she finished with 18 percent. Rounding out the field were former Gov. Buddy Roemer, a Republican, also with 18 percent; Phil Preis, a Democrat and a Baton Rouge lawyer, with 9 percent, and Lieut. Gov. Melinda Schwegmann, a Democrat, with 5 percent.
Mr. Roemer, another former Democrat, had been the front-runner through most of the campaign, but Mr. Foster gained momentum about a month ago as conservative voters began to perceive him as a legitimate alternative. As primary day approached, Mr. Roemer came under heavy assault in advertisements that reminded Louisianians of the failures of his tenure as Governor and his willingness to reposition himself on any number of issues.
Mr. Foster, the grandson of a former Governor, is a millionaire businessman with interests in land, sugar and oil. He also owns a plantation, Oaklawn, where tourists pay a $6 admission. About 80 percent of the $2.2 million Mr. Foster spent in the primary campaign came out of his own pocket.
And yet Mr. Foster succeeded during the primary campaign by casting himself as the right-wing Everyman of Louisiana politics. He made an asset out of his expansive bald head and corpulent physique, declaring in television advertisements that he was "not just another pretty face." Throughout the campaign, he quipped that he just wanted to get the election behind him in time for duck hunting season.
"Somehow I was able to attract people because I somewhat do what they do, look like a lot of them and think like a lot of them," Mr. Foster said in an interview today.
Mr. Foster also touted legislation he sponsored to make it easier for Louisianians to carry concealed weapons and gladly accepted the support of conservative Christian groups and David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who nearly won the 1991 gubernatorial race.
"Why get mad at a guy who says you're the true conservative in the race?" Mr. Foster asked today. "That doesn't make any sense."
Mr. Fields, a protege of Jesse Jackson, is a slightly built, soft-spoken and earnest young leader who has moved through a remarkable succession of political victories at an early age. The 7th of 10 children, he became a State Senator at 24, the youngest legislator in state history, and a Congressman at 30.
Unlike Mr. Foster, Mr. Fields supports abortion rights and affirmative action and has called for more state spending on education and better job training programs for welfare recipients. He said at a news conference here today that he believed those positions would appeal to voters of all races.
"A man walking down the street at 5 o'clock at night with a pink slip in his hand is not black or white," he said. "That man is unemployed and needs a job. Kids who are in classrooms and don't have proper school supplies, they're not black or white kids. They're kids who need help."
Saturday's primary came at a time of deep dissatisfaction in Louisiana with the state's corruption-plagued politics. Using wiretaps, Federal investigators have turned up evidence that a number of state legislators may have taken bribes to protect the state's nascent gambling industry. The state's oft-investigated Governor, Edwin W. Edwards, who has dominated state politics for 25 years but chose not to run for re-election, is so unpopular that Mr. Foster came under heavy suspicion last week simply for meeting with a group of Edwards allies.
Voters reacted to the scandals by defeating several prominent legislators in the primaries on Saturday and forcing several others -- including Sammy Nunez, the Senate president, and B. B. (Sixty) Rayburn, a 46-year veteran of the Legislature -- into runoffs for the first time in decades. A referendum to limit state lawmakers to three four-year terms passed with 76 percent of the vote.
Several political analysts said that the state's newfound intolerance for corruption also allowed Mr. Foster to transform his personal wealth into a political asset.
"We've seen so much cronyism, stealing and corruption," Mr. Pinsonat said, "that there's a feeling that if a person like him has money, what will he need to steal for?"

HEADLINE: Parties Shift Budget Debate to How Proposals Affect Children

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
After weeks of attacking the Republican budget in the name of the elderly, the Democrats are shifting tactics and arguing that the country's children will suffer unduly if all the spending cuts become law. Not to be outdone, the Republicans are countering that their programs would benefit the young in the long run.
But in this argument, many economists side with the Democrats. 
 Speaker Newt Gingrich gave a preview of the Republican position in a speech on Thursday night, saying a vote to curb Medicare spending would halt the rise in the national debt, saving today's children from paying unbearable taxes in the future.
But legislating for posterity by reducing the deficit and thereby reducing future taxes mostly helps children who grow up to become jobholders and taxpayers.
Many economists do say that reducing the deficit now could lead to faster economic growth and, eventually, more jobs and a higher overall standard of living for today's children. But most of these economists also say the specific spending cuts in the Republican plans would fall very heavily on poor and lower-middle-class children today, leaving them less able to hold jobs in the years ahead. These poor and lower-middle-class children are the net losers even when the effects of higher long-term growth and more jobs are included.
The Democrats will promote their children-first arguments in a campaign that is to begin with a visit by Hillary Rodham Clinton to a children's hospital in New York on Monday morning. That same day the White House will release an economic analysis of the effect of the Republican budget proposals on children. Throughout the week Cabinet officials will fan out across the country giving speeches portraying Republicans as politicians willing to steal children's school lunches and ignore their medical needs.
One Administration official said the theme will be, "You can balance the budget for children without balancing the budget on the backs of the children."
Republicans are not waiting for the Democratic assault. Mr. Gingrich has scheduled a visit on Monday to the Boys Town orphanage in Nebraska, which he praised last year as a model of private charity replacing Government in caring for the poor.
The Republicans' planned cuts affecting low-income families with children would be substantial. At a time when a quarter of the nation's children live in poverty, the Republicans propose to cut projected spending on welfare, including the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program, turning that program into block grants to state governments. House Republicans are also calling for spending freezes or cuts for programs that maintain minimum health and nutrition standards for children and provide preschool education for young children in poor families.
The White House recently calculated that the poorest fifth of American families with children would lose an average of $1,521 a year in income and $1,662 a year in health benefits under Republican plans. These are families with an average annual income of $13,325.
To present themselves as defenders of children, Republicans have emphasized their $500-a-child tax credit. "It is real," said Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. "It will help families with children and be very, very meaningful."
But the tax credit would do little to help children in low-income households. Families that have no Federal income tax liability after other exemptions and deductions would not be eligible for refunds.
For example, a family of four with both parents working and both children in child care programs would not qualify for the credit if it earned less than $24,000 in 1996. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington research group with a reputation for accurate statistics, has calculated that 23.7 million children, or 34 percent of the nation's children, live in families too poor to qualify for the credit. Another 7.1 million children, or 10 percent, would qualify only for a partial credit.
The real winners from the Republican tax and budget plans are likely to be affluent children, who receive relatively little direct Federal spending but will have to pay much of the taxes for the national debt that today's adults leave behind. According to Congressional Budget Office figures, Federal budget deficits would total $1.35 trillion more over the next decade under President Clinton's plan to balance the budget in 10 years than they would under the Republican plan to balance it over 7 years.
Braking growth in the debt will hold down net interest payments on the debt, which have already risen to 15.3 percent of the Federal budget from 8.9 percent in 1980.
"It does seem pretty clear that those who will gain over the longer term will be those who would be paying the taxes," said Alan J. Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at the University of California at Berkeley.
Economists differ sharply about whether the proposed spending cuts would foster or impede economic growth by the time today's children are adults. Clinton Administration officials make the case that the Republicans are eliminating so many educational and training programs that they will hurt future growth, and the Administration plans to distribute a list of academic articles on Monday supporting that position.
"Those programs have a very high rate of return to the society and therefore are justified against other forms of investment," said Martin N. Baily, a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.
But most economists take the view that cutting the budget deficit will in general help future economic growth and children, by leaving money to be invested productively in the private sector instead of collecting it as taxes. "There would be a net benefit over the lifetime of young people, but not necessarily to everybody," said Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "What you're looking at is a situation in which, disproportionately, children in low-income homes would be contributing to the deficit reduction effort."
While paying few of the costs of deficit reduction, affluent children would benefit at least as much as poor children from a bigger economy. To the extent that poor children are less educated or even less nourished during their formative years, they will prove less able to compete for good jobs with the children of affluent families.
Advocates for children condemn that possibility as unacceptable, and some question the view of budget experts that the economy will grow more with the Republican budget plans. "It's very anti-family, anti-young family," said James D. Weill, the general counsel of the Children's Defense Fund, a liberal group in Washington. "If you cut the deficit by trashing the programs that you need to have children that are healthy and well nourished, the offsetting effects on the economy will hurt growth and in the long run hurt efforts to control Government spending and deficits."

HEADLINE: THE U.N. AT 50;
And Now for the Next 50 Years: New Promises, Familiar Demands
Following are excerpts from remarks by heads of state and other leaders at a special session of the General Assembly yesterday marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations as compiled by the Federal Document Clearing House:

A Pledge of Support By the White House
Bill Clinton: President of the United States

 BODY:
 This week, the United Nations is 50 years old. The dreams of its founders have not been fully realized, but its promise endures.
The value of the United Nations can be seen the world over in the nourished bodies of once-starving children, in the full lives of those immunized against disease, in the eyes of students eager to learn, in the environments sustained, the refugees saved, the peace kept, and most recently, in standing up for the human rights and human possibilities of women and their children at the Beijing Conference.
The United Nations is the product of faith and knowledge -- faith that different peoples can work together for tolerance, decency, and peace. Knowledge that this faith will be forever tested by the forces of intolerance, depravity, and aggression.
Now we must summon that faith and act on that knowledge to meet the challenges of a new era. In the United States, some people ask, "Why should we bother with the U.N.? America is strong. We can go it alone."
Well, we will act if we have to alone, but my fellow Americans should not forget that our values and our interests are also served by working with the U.N.
The U.N. helps the peacemakers, the care providers, the defenders of freedom and human rights, the architects of economic prosperity, and the protectors of our planet to spread the risk, share the burden, and increase the impact of our common efforts.
Last year, I pledged that the United States would continue to contribute substantially to the U.N.'s finances. Historically, the United States has been, and today it remains, the largest contributor to the United Nations.
But I am determined that we must fully meet our obligations, and I am working with our Congress on a plan to do so. All who contribute to the U.N.'s work and care about its future must also be committed to reform, to ending bureaucratic inefficiencies and outdated priorities.
The U.N. must be able to show that the money it receives supports saving and enriching people's lives, not unneeded overhead. Reform requires breaking up bureaucratic fiefdom, eliminating obsolete agencies, and doing more with less.
The U.N. must reform to remain relevant and to play a still stronger role in the march of freedom, peace, and prosperity.
We see it around the world in the Middle East and Northern Ireland, people turning from a violent past to a future of peace. In South Africa and Haiti, long nights of fears have given way to new days of freedom.
Throughout this hemisphere, every nation except one has chosen democracy, and the goal of an integrated peaceful and democratic Europe is now within our reach for the first time. In the Balkans, the international community's determination and NATO's resolve have made prospects for peace brighter than they have been for four long years.
 
Russian Leader Is Wary Of Regional Groups
Boris N. Yeltsin: President of the Russian Federation
There is a dangerous tendency to play down the role of the United Nations, to circumvent its charter and the collective will of the Security Council.
Today the world, more than ever before, needs not only equality and tolerance, but respect for the identity of each state and an understanding of the peculiar features of its history. Each of them can and is willing to make its contribution to the development of a world community, and to find a worthy place therein. We should not allow the revival of the atmosphere of animosity and prejudice against countries and peoples.
Does the United Nations have the ability to achieve these goals?
In the opinion of Russia, it does. The United Nations can and should become the main instrument for building new international relations. It has all the necessary powers to do so. To carry out this mission, it should be provided with appropriate means, including financial resources. Russia meets and will continue to meet its obligations to the United Nations.
Certainly, the United Nations has not been able to achieve success in all areas, but the roots of its failure first and foremost lie in ourselves and the behavior of states and organizations. Russia is concerned at the situation whereby, as has recently been the case in Bosnia, the Security Council was relegated to the sidelines of events. It represents an obvious and clear-cut violation of the foundations of the world organization laid down by its founders.
It is inadmissible for a regional organization to take decisions on the mass use of force bypassing the Security Council. Russia has worked hard to bring closer peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are ready to support the operation on the implementation of a peace agreement with the participation of multi-national forces including Russian forces, but only under a clear-cut mandate of the United Nations Security Council.
Military force should never be used in those cases where diplomacy has proved unable to succeed. The effects of that would be tragic...
The main concern of Russia is to achieve stability in Europe and Asia. We are in favor of establishing a security system based on compromises rather than pressure. European security is indivisible. There is no alternative to that.
This is precisely the reason why Russia supports the idea of the earliest establishment of a new system of all European security where all European states would be represented. And this is precisely the reason why we are against NATO's eastward expansion. It will put a barrier on the way to establishing a unified Europe.
The question is an extremely acute one.Either such a system would be established for all Europe or as in the past, only for a select few. The strengthening of one bloc today means new confrontation beginning tomorrow.
 
Cuban Leader Attacks 'New Colonialism'
Fidel Castro: President of Cuba
Half a century ago the United Nations organization was born after the continuation of a monstrous war, where an average of 10,000,000 lives were lost at its peak moments. At present, 20 million men, women, and children are dying every year of hunger and incurable diseases.
Some wealthy nations have a life expectancy of up to 80 years, while others have hardly 40. So there are billions whose lives are cut off. How long shall we wait for this carnage to end?
The Cold War is over. But the arms race goes on. And nuclear and military hegemonism perpetuate themselves. How long shall we wait for the total removal of all weapons of mass extermination, for universal disarmament, and for the elimination of the use of force, arrogance, and pressure in international relations?
The obsolete veto privilege and the ill use of the Security Council by the powerful are exalting a new colonialism within the very United Nations. Latin America and Africa do not have one single permanent member on the Security Council. In Asia, India has a population of almost one billion, but it does not enjoy that responsibility.
... We lay claim to a world without hegemonism, without nuclear weapons, without interventionism, without racism, without national or religious hatred, without outrageous acts against the sovereignty of any country -- a world of respect for the independence and self- determination of peoples -- a world without universal models that totally disregard the traditions and culture of all the components of mankind.
We lay claim to a world without ruthless blockades that cause the death of men, women, and children, youths and elders, like noiseless atom bombs. We lay claim to a world of peace, justice, and dignity where everyone without exception has the right to well-being and to life.
 
South Korea Is Called A U.N. Success Story
Kim Young Sam: President, the Republic of Korea
The Republic of Korea was established in accordance with a U.N. resolution in 1948. At that time, it was one of the poorest countries in the world. Today, it is the 11th largest economy in the world and a truly democratic nation.
Our success has been a great manifestation of the ideals of the United Nations.
We are now one of the most active member nations in U.N. activities around the globe. We are already participating in the U.N. peacekeeping operations in the Western Sahara, Republic of Georgia, and Angola, and elsewhere. The Republic of Korea will also actively take part in various U.N. development and environmental projects and increase its monetary contributions...
I am convinced that the Korean peninsula will surely be unified in a democratic way in a not too distant future. I humbly and sincerely ask you all to become solid supporters for the peaceful unification of Korea.
 
Peacekeeping Is Seen Hurting Development
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga: President of Sri Lanka
The new agenda of the United Nations with its heavy emphasis on peacekeeping operations has affected adversely on the development process. As a developing country, Sri Lanka attaches great importance to the role which the United Nations can and must perform in advancing the development process.
Unless the principles of the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted in 1986 are applied positively with the full commitment of the developed and developing countries, the development process will not be sufficiently advised. We believe that the effective strengthening of the United Nations system is an essential requisite for advancing its goals. The organization has, regrettably, sometimes come to be seen by the more bilateral states as primarily serving the interests of the more powerful states. We welcome the timely initiative of the President of last year's General Assembly to strengthen and empower the United Nations system.
Such an effective empowerment requires, in our view, that, firstly, development priorities should not be sacrificed in the pursuit of political, military operations which must be set at realistic, even modest levels.
Secondly, decision-making by the United Nations in all areas must be based on full engagement of all members. The Security Council, in particular, must become more representative and more responsive to the general membership of the United Nations.
Thirdly, commitments made for multilateral action in all fields must be honored and diligently pursued. In short, the revitalizing forces must enhance the capacity of the United Nations rather than merely effect economies and scale down its scope.
 
Leader of Croatia Defends Nation's Destiny
Franjo Tudjman: President, Republic of Croatia
Destiny has allotted to small nations the role of promoters of great ideas. They are the leaders of positive changes in the evolution of humankind that turn the force of a struggle for national survival into a creative vision of tomorrow's world -- no longer a world of the large and small, the powerful and weak.
But only a world of equal nations and states committed to coexistence.
The boundaries of our freedoms are set by set by boundaries of the freedom of others. The affirmation of human dignity and the universal rights of the individual upheld by the charter of the United Nations can be achieved only through the respect for different ethnic, cultural and political identities through an efficient system of collective security and through respect for a law governed state and international law.
We have to turn negative energy into positive momentum. Reform of global relations and mechanisms must provide for greater respect for civilization's differences, for creative blending and dialogue on an equal footing.
 
Zambia Repeats Call For Broader Council
Frederick J.T. Chiluba: President of the Republic of Zambia
In a world of growing tensions and challenges the United Nations has performed well since its inception in 1945, and deserves a word of appreciation and thanks.
Some of its officers and personnel have made supreme sacrifices in the execution of their selfless tasks. Among them was the second Secretary General of the U.N., Excellency Dag Hammarskjold, who died in a plane crash on 17 September 1961 on Zambia's soil.
We must always remember all of them for their valor. Zambia is fully convinced, Mr. President, that the U.N. can do and must do even better. It's efficiency must be augmented and fortified.
Zambia, therefore, joins those countries which have called for restructuring of the U.N. to enable it to cope with increased demands and challenges. The U.N. today faces a crisis of confidence and expectations. The structures of 1945, designed and made to serve almost homogenous membership of 50 countries, which has since increased almost four fold are no longer capable to serve and service the bigger and wider globe.
Membership has increased in numbers, as well, as in regional diversity which calls for equitable, broader representation...
The Security Council, we believe can no longer be maintained like the sanctuary of the Holy of Holies with only the original members acting as high priests, deciding on issues for the rest of the world who can not be admitted.
Broader and geographical representation is the answer.
 
Norway's Leader Offers Plans for Reform
Gro Harlem Brundtland: Prime Minister of Norway
Though the U.N. today faces great difficulties, we the member states are responsible. The plowshare that worked for five decades is worn. Let us forge anew.
Today I will address five pressing issues. First, finance. Some dozen Parliaments hold this organization hostage by withholding their membership fees. How unworthy. We must all pay our fees in full and on time. We require some countries to pay more than their fair share. Other countries voluntarily pay more than their fair share. Many countries pay too little or hardly anything at all.
Second, we must reform. Change and renewal is a must for every effective organization. Reform of the Security Council is needed, where the issue of a reasonably balanced enlargement now must be addressed. The most obvious candidates being, of course, Japan and Germany, while the council's decision-making efficiency must be retained and its implementing ability greatly enhanced.
Responsibility for sustainable development for poverty, population, education, the environment is spread out. Mandates overlap. Let us draw up a schedule for implementing what we have decided in Rio, Cairo, Copenhagen and Beijing.
Third, we must coordinate our humanitarian assistance activities better allowing us to react more quickly and more effectively. Funds, people and resources often prove to be available only when human suffering has aggravated enough to dominate the evening news while other tragedies of famine, environmental degradation and underdevelopment remain unnoticed.
Fourth, we must improve our peacekeeping and conflict prevention capacity to save more lives and to save expenses...
Five, we must build the civilized world on law and contracts.
 
Japan Presses Its Call To End Nuclear Arms
Tomiichi Murayama: Prime Minister of Japan
The 50th anniversary of the United Nations is also the 50th year since the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is time that we accelerate our efforts towards the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons. I thus find it all the more deplorable that nuclear testing continues at this juncture. I strongly call for the immediate cessation to nuclear testing.
Toward this end, it is extremely important that a resolution calling for the cessation of nuclear testing be adopted and during this session of the General Assembly with the support of as many members states as possible. As a major step towards nuclear disarmament, I also believe that it is a most urgent task to complete the negotiations on a comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by next spring and to sign it by next autumn.
Mr. President, in our previous statement at the general debate, we outlined Japan's position on the reforms that are necessary if the United Nations is to be able to fulfill its mission.
Firstly, Japan having been playing a major role as the second largest contributor, earnestly calls upon all member states to face up to the financial crisis of the United Nations to honor their financial obligations and to urgently and seriously address the question of U.N. financial reform.
Secondly, it is increasingly necessary to reform the United Nations system in the economic and social fields. In proving the efficiency and reviewing the mandates of the economic and social council, and other related organs are pressing tasks. From this perspective, Japan will continue to actively participate in the discussions on an agenda for development so that it can make its distinct contribution.
Thirdly, with regard to reform of the Security Council, it is required that its functions be strengthened by enhancing it's effectiveness and it's legitimacy. This will necessitate an expansion of the Council that includes an increase in it's permanent membership and improvement in it's working methods, for example, through enhanced transparency.
 
Arafat Returns to U.N. Praising Forces of Peace
Yasir Arafat: Chairman of the P.L.O.
Mr. President, the history of the United Nations is intertwined with that of the question of Palestine. It was the United Nations which adopted the resolution on the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. Since then, the United Nations has not ceased to deal with the question of Palestine in all its ramifications and developments.
The history of the United Nations and its resolutions constitute an expression of its permanent legal, political and moral responsibility. They make the United Nations a witness to the immense suffering of our people and their sacrifices, their displacement and scattering in all parts of the world, as well as to the wars and massacres which have been inflicted upon them. ...
...Mr. President, the winds of change are blowing in our world. A new world order is emerging. It is our responsibility in the United Nations and in the international community to make it a good order for the stability, security and peace of the world with the wider participation of the states and peoples of the world.
We, therefore, support the trend towards the enlargement of the membership of the Security Council which will give it new vigor and will ensure justice and equality among all.
Mr. President, I came to you 21 years ago as a fighter for freedom, liberation and independence carrying with me the torments of my struggling people. Today, I come to you with a heart filled with love and peace now that the olive branch has adorned the peace of the brave, has adorned the peace of the brave.
 
Iranian Foreign Minister Attacks the U.S.
Ali Akbar Velayatin: Foreign Minister of Iran
Much of the ills of the international community stem from diversion of precious resources from development to arms race. Adding to an already complex problem are unilateral, economic measures ranging from protections policies and various forms of conditionalities to outright, coercive, economic measures and the United States policy of economic terrorism against independent states as well as to attempts to push aside the development agenda of the United Nations.
The efforts of the United Nations system in the area of cooperation for development, particularly those carried out by specialized agencies and programs have had the primary contribution in introducing ordinary people in the remotest parts of the world to the name, if not the ideals, of the United Nations.
The development agenda of the United Nations should not be overshadowed by other, more glamorous subjects, or undermined in the course of reform.
Indeed, the needs and aspirations of these very same people who constitute the majority of humanity must be the focus and foundation of any effort to revitalize, restructure and reform the organization whose conceptual objectives should be to render the United Nations decision making process transparent, democratic, rule-based and inclusive.
This is in total contrast with the self arrogated position of leadership of the United States which insists on misusing its position within the organization, and even at the 50th anniversary of the organization reserves for itself resort to unilateral measures against the will of the United Nations.

HEADLINE: A Better Wage Becomes a Luxury;
New Omni Hotel Employees Pursue the American Dream

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
To guests who begin checking into the newly refurbished Omni Berkshire Place in Manhattan this week, the white marble floors and recessed lighting will probably seem like the stock trappings of a luxury hotel.
To Rommel Vassell, however, they mean much more: the first gleaming rungs on the ladder of upward mobility in America. 
 "This is heaven-sent," Ms. Vassell, 36, said last week between training sessions at the hotel, on East 52d Street near Madison Avenue.
For most of the decade since she emigrated from Jamaica, Ms. Vassell has worked as a home health care attendant, making as little as $5 or $6 an hour with minimal benefits. As a housekeeper at the Omni, she makes more than $10 an hour with full medical coverage and a pension.
She is indeed among a lucky lot. Omni officials said they had about 320 job openings at the hotel, which is reopening after a year of renovations. They said they expected to receive about 5,000 inquiries and were stunned to field calls and take applications from more than 17,000 people.
That number speaks volumes about the hunger in New York City for full-time jobs with full benefits, a humane working environment, reasonable hours and a living wage. It also suggests the increasing extent to which relatively unskilled workers here and elsewhere in the country are turning to the service industry in general, and to corporate hotel chains in particular.
"The city, the state, the country have lost many, many, many manufacturing jobs, and the service industry is picking up the slack," said John Turchiano, a spokesman for the New York City Hotel Trades Council, a group of unions that represent hotel workers in various trades.
For example, in 1975, manufacturing provided about 16 percent of all jobs in New York City, while service positions represented about 23 percent, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Today, by contrast, manufacturing jobs represent less than 9 percent of all those in the city, while service jobs represent about 35 percent.
During the same period, the number of jobs in hotels and other places of lodging in the city grew to about 33,000 from about 25,000, according to the bureau. Nationally, the rise was even sharper, to nearly 1.7 million from about 898,000. One reason is an increase in foreign tourism in the United States, encouraged by a decline in the value of the dollar and by more aggressive marketing of American tourism.
What the statistics cannot capture is how coveted the best of these jobs are, how much they mean to people who desperately want better salaries and career growth in an economy that often thwarts those ambitions.
Most people who applied for jobs at the Omni, which has 396 rooms that cost about $250 a night, were not unemployed, said Chuck Wing, the hotel's director of human resources. Rather, they were stuck in jobs without benefits or much potential for raises, Mr. Wing said. What they felt they could get with the Omni Corporation, which operates 40 hotels in the United States, was possibility, security, hope.
During the two weeks in late July and early August when Omni advertised that applicants could stop by the hotel for interviews, the line of hopeful people stretched at times along Madison Avenue from 52d to 54th Street, then along 54th Street from Madison Avenue to Fifth.
Omni officials moved up the beginning of interviews from 10 A.M. to 7 A.M. Some applicants arrived as early as 4:30 A.M. to beat both the heat and the crowd.
One was Nancy Evangelista, 32, a single mother rearing three children in a five-room apartment in the Norwood section of the Bronx, and paying $900 a month in rent.
Although Ms. Evangelista has worked, variously, as a secretary, waitress, house cleaner and home health attendant, she has seldom made more than $8 an hour and never had full benefits.
At the Omni, as a front desk telephone operator, she has benefits and a wage of $10.60 an hour. If she picks up some overtime and continues to clean a few homes, she said, she may be able to inch her income toward $30,000 and save for her children's college educations.
She is working toward a sociology degree at Lehman College and would like to advance into the Omni's human resources department. "I'm going to try to go as far as I can," Ms. Evangelista said. "You know when a rose begins to open? That's how I feel."
Lawal Ahmed's new job as a bellman at the Omni, which he said may end up paying him as much as $30,000 a year in wages and tips, is not his most lucrative job. After emigrating from Ghana in 1987 at age 22, he ascended through the ranks in restaurants from dishwasher to manager, eventually making about $40,000 a year.
But he was putting in about 80 hours a week, which left him no time for his wife, his two children or his plans to get a college degree. At the Omni, he will work from 7 A.M. to 3:30 P.M., then head to classes at Bronx Community College, near his home in the Mosholu section. Maybe a college degree will pave the way toward better positions at the Omni, he said.
Ms. Vassell, Ms. Evangelista, Mr. Ahmed and other new employees at the Omni said that without a college degree or technical skills, it can be brutally difficult to find a decent job.
Their positions at the Omni, like those at many hotels in the city, are union jobs, which they said was one selling point. In any case, Ms. Vassell said, she now understands why her friends talk about jobs with hotel chains with envy and longing. The Omni allows her paid sick days and even a paid day off for her birthday -- little perks exotic to her. "I feel feel like I've made a big turn in my life, a whole 90-degree angle," she said.
Ms. Vassell, a single mother with a grown son living at home and a daughter at Florida International University, said she could envision the day she can afford the $845 a month rent for her apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn, without leasing a room to a boarder.
She just increased the allowance she sends her daughter, who is attending school on financial aid, from $80 a month to $150 every two weeks. She has an extra gift in store. One of her new benefits is a free three-day stay at an Omni hotel. There is one in Miami, near the Florida International campus, and Ms. Vassell looks forward to treating her daughter to a very special weekend.

HEADLINE: Damascus Journal;
Let Loose on the Streets, 10,000 Mice Rout Buses

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Oct. 21

 BODY:
In a city where little else moves quickly, there is a reason the 10,000 minibuses that seem to run wild on the streets have come to be known affectionately as mice.
Only four years ago people in the Syrian capital had little choice but to rely on creaking green Government buses to carry them, even though service and management were so poor that residents spoke of a transportation crisis. 
 Now that has changed. In the most visible consequence of Syria's new enthusiasm for private investment, swift Japanese minibuses have come to dominate the city's thoroughfares, and they have spread so rapidly that they have virtually driven their state-run rivals from the streets.
To be sure, the old buses live on, but mostly to shuttle Government workers from ministry to ministry. In a way unimaginable in London, Paris or New York, public transportation within this ancient capital is now entirely private.
For centuries, Syria has been a country of farmers, merchants and traders; some estimates say that as much as 60 percent of the economy is in private hands. But in a country more recently steeped in state socialism, no one here is ready to talk about full-scale privatization.
Still, if Syrians are not yet ready to entrust the country's state enterprises to the free market, what has happened on the streets of the capital has brought a surprising twist in an experiment the Government calls "parallel private development."
"The private sector just wiped the public sector out," declared Bourhan Odeh, a businessman who was among those who seized on the 1991 opening in Syrian law that set off the transformation. Until that law passed, anyone tempted to compete against the Government transportation system had to contend with the 200 percent duty that Syria imposed on imports of most vehicles, one of the barriers that have made this country's economy isolated even by the standards of the region.
The new measure, adopted after the Soviet Union's collapse, was an important shift. Among the inducements that Syria offered to private investors were a five-year tax holiday and, most significantly, a waiver on customs fees. It did not take long before the streets of this city of three million began to reflect the long-shunned world in which a $15,000 Mazda minivan could be had without paying three times that price.
Instead of waiting half an hour for a bus, people found that a minibus passed by every few minutes. At about 10 cents, the standard fare is about what a bus used to be, and riders could count on a seat.
Among those who remember the 1980's, when taxis were scarce and a shortage of foreign currency meant that buses sometimes ran short of spare parts, the change has marked the beginning of an era.
"The micros solved a huge crisis," said Fadi Murdem, 35, who sold his share in a sweets shop to buy a minibus. "Now you just pay three or four pounds and you get what you want in a hurry."
In a long-isolated city where only in the last two years have people been able to buy Western cigarettes and bananas on the open market, it is the revolution in transportation, even more than the arrival of Adidas and Benetton shops on downtown streets, that is most often described as a metaphor for welcome new ways.
"On the bus, you get hassled," said Rola Badoun, an 18-year-old student. "People push you and I hear silly phrases from men, like 'Oh, what a beauty,' and, 'Such beautiful eyes,' which does not make me comfortable. On the micro, there is no hassle at all."
So many Syrians jumped at the chance to join the cavalcade that the Government has cut off the flow of duty-free vehicles, but even that has not halted the rush to a private business, which some find lucrative enough to enter without the inducement. Minibuses now venture regularly onto the narrow streets of the city's old souk, raising talk that they may one day cause problems of traffic and air pollution as large as the one they solved.
But few Damascenes bother to defend the despised old buses, whose drivers have begun to see the light. After four years behind the wheel of a Government bus, Khdir Mahmoud, 32, tripled his monthly salary to about $250 when he decided to quit his job last year and drive a minibus.
In other parts of the Syrian economy, change is less apparent. But Mohammed Surakbi, director of the Government's investment office, says the campaign to attract private investment has brought to Syria new ventures worth as much as $7 billion that will compete against Government enterprises as part of the "parallel development."
But while the country is plainly eager for more foreign currency, diplomats and Syrian officials say that the country intends to maintain strict limits on just how far the private sector can go.
For what it calls strategic reasons, the Government still retains control over commodities like oil, cotton, wheat and barley. And when it comes to sharing the spotlight, officials close to the Government point to the sidelined buses in the capital as evidence that big Government businesses still have a long life.
"The official attitude is that if the public company is a failure, then why burden the private sector with it?" said Dr. Rateb Shallah, president of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce. "And if the company is successful, why privatize?"

HEADLINE: Today, Shoppers on Internet Get Access to Electronic Cash

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
A prominent project to create electronic cash that can be zapped over the Internet to buy goods and information is scheduled to start issuing its first real money today.
Digicash, an Amsterdam concern run by the noted cryptography expert David Chaum, said Mark Twain Bankshares of St. Louis would be the first bank to offer customers Digicash's E-Cash. 
 Amid all the hoopla about the potential for offering goods and information over the Internet, one big stumbling block has been the development of a secure and reliable system to pay for these products.
Mr. Chaum, a former University of California professor, holds some key patents on coding techniques used to make electronic money, and his software has been made available without charge over the Internet for most of the year, with 60,000 people testing it with play money.
Mark Twain, which hopes to attract customers for E-cash from around the world, was chosen as the first to offer an actual account because it is one of the few banks that accepts small deposits in the United States in a wide range of foreign currencies.
At first, only a handful of companies will accept the E-Cash, including Maryland Public Television and Pentagon CD's and Tapes, an on-line music store.
To use the system, a customer establishes an account with Mark Twain and sends an initial deposit, say $200. Then using software provided by Digicash, some of that money is electronically transferred over the Internet to the customer's computer. The current balance is displayed in a small window on the screen.
While surfing the net the customer comes across something to buy -- say the 1996 stock picks of Louis Rukeyser, which Maryland Public television intends to sell for about $3 using E-Cash. Then the customer simply pushes a button on the E-Cash software to transfer the money again over the Internet to the television network, which deposits the funds in its own bank. The customer can then read or download the stock picks.
The small amount of Internet commerce that has been done so far uses credit cards, which have the advantage of already being in the wallets of most Internet users. But credit cards have a number of disadvantages for certain types of electronic transactions. Because they offer itemized billing, for example, credit cards are too expensive for very small purchases, like news articles that might cost 10 cents each. And banks only allow established merchants with a credit record to accept credit cards.
E-Cash is intended to get around these problems. Payment is immediate, with no billing statement, so very small payments are economical. Moreover, anyone with an E-Cash account can both send and receive funds electronically, allowing virtually everyone to set up shop on the Internet.
With E-Cash, the banks do not know where the customers spend their money. Nor do the merchants know the identity of their customers, unless the customers voluntarily identify themselves.
Using a complex coding mechanism, all this information is stored in the electronic messages that represent the payments, but it can be unlocked with keys that only the customer keeps.
Using those keys, consumers can obtain from their bank the electronic equivalent of a canceled check to prove a payment was made to a particular merchant in case of a dispute. And they can get a refund for electronic money lost if say, their computer's disk drive fails.
Digicash's system has one major disadvantage compared with credit card plans: Initially, at least, it is more expensive.
As of Friday, the final fees had not been set, but it was expected to cost about $10 to establish an account and an additional $2 to $5 a month to maintain it. Those who deposit or withdraw more than a set amount -- about $100 -- will pay a 2 to 4 percent fee. Merchants expecting higher volumes will be able to set up accounts with bigger fees and lower percentages.
Other banks say they are interested but cautious.
"The market for small payments on the Internet will grow very slowly, so it hasn't been our highest priority," said Martha C. Campbell, a senior vice president of the Bank of America, who nonetheless complimented the product's design.

HEADLINE: Most Go on Line at Home, Study Finds

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
A new survey conducted at one of the Internet's most popular hangouts suggests that most people are tapping into the World Wide Web and commercial on-line services from home, not from the office or at school.
The survey of Internet users, conducted by Yahoo Inc. and Jupiter Communications Inc. for release today, concludes that computer networks are become a mass market medium much faster than many people expected. 
 Separately, a continuing survey of consumer on-line services found that Americans are still signing up for computer networks at a rapid pace, with nearly 14,000 new commercial on-line service accounts being opened each day.
According to the Information and Interactive Services Report, 9.9 million Americans subscribed to consumer on-line services as of Sept. 30, an increase of 78 percent from a year earlier. America Online, with 3.8 million subscribers, was both the largest and the fastest-growing service, according to this study.
And Silicon Valley executives were briefed last week on the preliminary findings of yet another major survey of the Internet and the World Wide Web. The release of the Commercenet/Nielsen study, believed to be the most comprehensive attempt yet to count the number of Internet users and define their habits, is expected early next week.
Unlike the other studies, the Yahoo/Jupiter study is unusual because it was conducted entirely on line, with the goal of determining the habits of visitors to Yahoo's World Wide Web directory.
Yahoo asserts that some 300,000 people visit its Web site (http:// www.yahoo.com) each day, as a first step to finding other sources of information on the Internet.
All visitors at the Yahoo site were given the opportunity to participate in the survey, conducted in August and September. According to Yahoo and Jupiter, more than 60,000 computer users answered a questionnaire in the first phase of the study, and 10,000 of those answered a more detailed second survey.
The Yahoo/Jupiter survey found that participants in the study spent an average of 20 hours a week on line. More than half of the respondents said they had cut back on the amount of time they watched television to spend more time on the Internet.
A majority of respondents said they had been on the Web less than a year, and spent at least one hour on line in their most recent session. Most said they visited the Web or other on-line services more than once a day.
While 55 percent said their primary access to the Web was at home, many of those who said their primary access was at work or school also had secondary access from the home. All together, 85 percent of the Yahoo users who answered the survey said they were able to tap into the Internet from home.
"It's a sign we're heading in the direction of critical mass for consumer marketing on the Internet," said Gene DeRose, Jupiter's president.
Only 8 percent of the respondents in the Yahoo/Jupiter survey said they gained primary access to the Web through one of the commercial on-line services, like America Online or Compuserve. Half of the respondents said they reached the Web via an Internet service provider. Forty percent said their primary Web access was at work or school.

HEADLINE: A Strategy for Lower Manhattan

 BODY:
Once the unassailable financial capital of the world, New York City finds itself in endless negotiations these days to dissuade this or that company from leaving town. A package of nearly $100 million in state and city subsidies has now been ponied up to persuade the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange not to move to Jersey City. The danger here is that more and more companies will demand special treatment. A broader, less piecemeal approach is needed to secure the city's economic future.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has rightly emphasized steps to lower the cost of doing business in the city. Lower Manhattan poses a particular problem because many financial institutions are located in antiquated buildings that require major investments to bring in the new technology needed for today's globally competitive environment. 
 To its credit, the city has begun to change zoning regulations so that new office buildings can span some of the old, narrow streets in the area. The administration is also studying creation of a special district in lower Manhattan so that it would be easier to build apartment complexes, stores and recreation areas, helping to transform an area that is traditionally dead after working hours into a place where people go or even live all hours of the day. The State Legislature recently approved a package of tax abatements designed to encourage developers to convert old buildings and put up new ones for residential and commercial use.
In the last decade, scores of individual deals with companies have been struck to keep them in the city, with hundreds of millions of dollars spent in subsidies. Some of those deals proved disappointing when companies that received benefits turned around and reduced their staffs or moved parts of their operations out of the city anyway. The Giuliani administration has improved on the process by obtaining commitments from each company to retain a fixed number of jobs or forfeit part of the subsidy. But all the deals should be scrutinized by the City Council or others to determine if they meet the strictest cost-benefit standards.
It may well be impossible to restore lower Manhattan to its former glory. Its property values are declining faster than the general rate in Manhattan, and its office vacancy rate is approaching 25 percent, a postwar high. Many buildings are half-empty. If lower Manhattan fails as a financial powerhouse, the entire region will suffer.
Instead of competing with New Jersey, Connecticut and other parts of New York State for jobs, the Mayor needs to enlist them in developing improved commuter rail access to lower Manhattan, including steps to bring the Long Island Railroad and Metro North to the area. More attention should be paid to major improvements, including a new Staten Island Ferry Terminal and a new headquarters for the New York Stock Exchange, which is getting restless because of its cramped and obsolete quarters. New York City cannot retain its pre-eminence in financial services simply by bribing companies one at a time.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
The Loyal Opposition on How to Fix America

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:

REASON TO BELIEVE
By Mario Cuomo
191 pages. Simon & Schuster. $21. 
 Seasoned by experience and not noticeably chastened by defeat, the former Governor of New York announces in "Reason to Believe" that he and liberalism are alive and that at least one of them is well. His loyal exposition of the liberal faith and his peppy attacks on the Republican Contract With America are a call to action at a time when the action all seems to be on the other side.
Writing as one who was "capsized by the Republican tide of 1994," Mario Cuomo, who can now be heard on radio when he is not delivering for his law firm, sees the current political course, or the "New Harshness," as heading "backward toward our nation's first century," when exploitation was the rule. He traces his own political faith to the reformist impulses of the early 1900's, which put restraints on corporations, and to the New Deal and the Great Society, which wove a safety net for the needy.
If that sounds like a conventional campaign biography, so be it. But this is campaign season, and Mr. Cuomo's vigor may act as a restorative for the spirits of the beaten-down liberals to whom his book is plainly addressed. The Gingrichian "plastic populism," he argues, is evading the nation's problems or offering inadequate solutions, trading instead on whipping up outrage, "distilling the bitterest juices from the people's anger, bottling them as legislation and then offering it all back as a magic elixir."
His preferred elixir is "a new sense of community," a recognition that "we're all in this together, like a family, interconnected and interdependent," instead of being tempted into "isolation, insularity and indifference to our opportunities in the wider world and our obligations to one another."
Often this short book, which could benefit from being shorter, sounds like a speech, with many points being made more than once and applause lines along the way. When he calls for progress "through integration and not disintegration, through synergism not cynicism, through inclusion not exclusion," he seems to be borrowing from the Rev. Jesse Jackson. It can be wearing on a reader. Just eliminating the tributes to Momma Cuomo, which give some passages the flavor of an Academy Award acceptance speech, would have a bracing effect.
Despite those bad habits of the career politician and a certain amount of recycling, "Reason to Believe" makes a strong, clear appeal to the national impulses that brought about such Democratic-inspired measures as welfare and affirmative action, which are now under heavy assault. While acknowledging some overreaching and underachieving, Mr. Cuomo is not ashamed to call on America to remember the C word, compassion.
He notes, in one of the book's funnier lines, that in the Reagan era of supply-side benefits for the wealthy, "the average American didn't experience any 'trickle-down' benefits; many, in fact, got trickled upon." And he warns that the Republican promise of a balanced budget along with tax cuts bodes ill for investment in the future, "things like children who can read, bridges that stand up, and new breakthroughs in energy efficiency and environmentally sound technology."
It also means, he writes, "the most draconian reductions in worthwhile services for Americans that the nation has ever seen." As a non-candidate, Mr. Cuomo is free to come out against both a balanced-budget amendment and any plan to eliminate the Federal deficit within a given number of years, lest it strangle Government investment that would stimulate the economy and help the needy. Instead, he favors a gradual slowing in the growth of the national debt. The former Governor predicts, on the basis of hard experience, that reducing the income tax will involve steep increases in sales taxes and property taxes.
He concedes that a call for attention to the nation's infrastructure is not a vote-grabber ("No one ever comes up to you starry-eyed and says, 'Oh, Governor, you really know how to structure the infra.' ") but he is persuasive about the importance of spending to keep bridges and roads in good repair. If the Republicans want to cut something, he suggests, they should cut military spending and business subsidies. When it comes to cuts in Medicare, his language is less pointed than usual as he expresses support for "modifying payments to health providers."
He presses the unresolved question about the drive toward "workfare": Where are the jobs? For workfare to work, he notes, there have to be decently paying jobs that the recipient can handle, and he does not find much concern for that detail in the Gingrichian contract. He points out that welfare reform is not, in the short term, a money-saver and doubts that the Republicans are inclined to pay the price in day care, training and job creation.
Mr. Cuomo knows that his preachments here are running against the prevailing mood. At a time of celebrated distrust of Washington, which is still being fueled by his colleagues in the talk-radio industry, he calls for a reassertion of a sense of community through government, in particular the Federal Government. The man who declined to run for President cautions against the rush to "devolution," the popular notion of returning power to states and localities.
Responding to the mantra of the less government the better, he asks, "Were we a better nation without Social Security for the elderly, without civil rights for minorities, without financial aid for college students, without rules regulating pollution?"
Toward the end of his book, he draws on his experiences in Albany to offer some recommendations for reforming welfare, improving the public schools, dealing with drugs and crime, and so forth. For all the partisan shots, the call here is for a national effort to take on intractable problems, be they street violence or television violence, in a spirit of togetherness. He would, I surmise, be enthusiastic about current calls for a bipartisan Presidential commission on race.
Granted, a commandment like "we should insist on all the government we need but only the government we need" doesn't get one very far. Yet the line between Mr. Cuomo's vision of community and the Contract With America becomes sharp enough. He is saying there is plenty that only Washington can do and should be doing to give Americans things they really need and properly expect.

HEADLINE: THE U.N. AT 50: CASTRO;
Castro Back In Fatigues, And Harlem

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

 BODY:
After a restrained day of diplomacy, clad in a dark business suit, President Fidel Castro of Cuba changed back into fatigues last night to spend the evening before an adulatory audience at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.
Standing at a podium before 1,300 admirers, Mr. Castro held forth as if he were on a balcony overlooking a plaza in Havana, drinking in the cheers and applause that greeted his nearly every remark. 
 While he had been somber and succinct at the United Nations in the morning, looking more like a well-suited executive than a scruffy revolutionary, he turned back into a firebrand in his visit uptown.
As Mr. Castro spoke, 35 years after his first trip to Harlem made headlines, most other world leaders were attending President Clinton's cocktail party at the New York Public Library. Mr. Castro was not invited; he is being excluded from nearly every social event outside the United Nations.
"This is the 35th anniversary of my first visit to this neighborhood," he said at the church. "And the incredible thing is, I am still expelled. I am still being left out of the dinners, as if nothing had changed in all these years, as if we were still in the days of the cold war."
On his first full day in the United States in 16 years, Mr. Castro picked up where he had left off so long ago, lobbying for the Cuban revolution. This time, though, he seemed particularly to relish taking his campaign to end the embargo against Cuba into enemy territory, emboldened by a shift against it by some American business leaders and members of Congress.
After leaving the Cuban Mission, where he is staying, Mr. Castro began his whirlwind day with a six-minute speech at the United Nations and then went to the studios of the Cable News Network for an interview. In the first part of the day, he traded his familiar crusade against imperialism for a more tempered, but not less controversial, call for social justice.
At the United Nations, Mr. Castro, who drew more applause than President Clinton, spoke out against wealthy nations who have neglected their poorer neighbors, and against weapons of "mass extermination."
His finger jabbing the air for emphasis, Mr. Castro spoke most vehemently against the United States embargo, eliciting rousing applause from the General Assembly and other world leaders.
"We lay claim to a world without ruthless blockades that cause the death of men, women and children, youths and elders, like noiseless atom bombs," he said. "We lay claim to a world of peace, justice and dignity where everyone, without exception, has the right to well-being and life."
Just after his speech and before lunch, Mr. Castro walked over to the leader of the country that was his onetime benefactor, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. The two embraced warmly, stepped apart, embraced again, then stood together,hands clasped in a series of grips. They spoke animatedly through an interpreter. Then Mr. Castro abruptly left the building.
Outside the United Nations, Mr. Castro's presence prompted a less effusive, if no less passsionate, response.
Turning out for one of the largest protests of the day, hundreds of Cuban-Americans chanted for his death.
One woman carried a poster bearing the pictures of Hitler, Stalin and Mr. Castro, stating "What's the difference?" On the East River, a pro-Castro flotilla and an anti-Castro flotilla moved at crosscurrents.
In Miami, watching Mr. Castro's appearance at the United Nations on television, many Cuban exiles said they were chilled by the warm reception he received.
"His duplicity was transparent," said Rafael Penalver, president of the San Carlos Institute, a Cuban cultural center in Miami. "He is the man who ruled Cuba without an election for 37 years, calling for the democratization of the United Nations."
In his interview on CNN, Mr. Castro spoke of his keen interest in Gen. Colin L. Powell's autobiography, of his belief that Jimmy Carter would not be able to mediate between the United States and Cuba, and of his refusal to extradite Robert Vesco, the fugitive financier.
But he refused to discuss the presence of his daughter, Alina Fernandez Revuelta, among the protesters outside the United Nations.
"Look, Bernie," Mr. Castro said to Bernard Shaw, who was interviewing him. "You have raised a question about a personal subject. A very delicate question. And it seems to me that I should not touch upon this subject publicly. I wouldn't be acting like a gentleman if I did."
Mr. Castro did mention the brief moment of eye contact he believes he struck with Mr. Clinton at the United Nations in the morning.
"I received an atom of President Clinton's sight when he looked at everybody and was in the crowd," he said.
Early in the evening, about 1,300 people sat shoulder to shoulder in the pews of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, waiting for Mr. Castro. A diverse crowd, including whites, blacks and Hispanic people, had spent hours on line for the ticketed event. Many said they were there to show support for Mr. Castro's efforts to derail the Helms-Burton bill in Congress, which seeks to tighten the economic embargo. Many blacks, in particular, said they admired him because they believed he had created harmony between the races in Cuba.
"I was here the last time when he came to the Theresa Hotel" in Harlem, said David Brothers, 76. "I felt I had to come again. He's a principled man and he doesn't bow down. He did a whole lot for Africans."
Asked whether he expected to see a firebrand mellowed with age, Mr. Brothers said: "He's still the revolutionary. The suit don't make the man."
Mr. Castro entered the church at about 7:45 to roars of "Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!" The crowd chanted, "Cuba, si, bloqueo, no." Mr. Castro strode to the podium, relishing the boisterous show of support, which lasted for 10 minutes.
He smiled and nodded at the politicans and leaders seated in the balcony above, among them Representative Charles Rangel, Representative Nydia M. Velasquez, Representative Jose Serrano and Angela Davis, the 1970's black radical who is now a professor of philosophy at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Ms. Davis smiled at him and gave him a fisted salute.
Mr. Castro immediately warmed to his audience, reassuring his supporters that while his clothes might have changed, he had not. To the hoots and hollers of his audience, Mr. Castro made himself the butt of his own jokes as he recounted his sartorial transformation. His new suit of clothes -- forced upon him by the diplomatic community, he said -- has made him an "honorable gentleman." But, he added, "if the last time I went to Harlem in fatigues, how can I go to Harlem in a business suit?"
He also took delight in recounting the many snubs he has received since his arrival, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's failure to include him in a Saturday night banquet. "The Mayor said I was a demon and the demon wouldn't be invited to dinner," Mr. Castro said. "I'm going hungry on my first day in New York."
Late in his speech, Mr. Castro touched on what he characterized as Cuba's bold role in the struggle against apartheid, illiteracy and poverty, again evoking cheers.
"We have shed our blood to fights against colonialism," he said.
Despite his social exclusion, Mr. Castro told admirers that more Americans supported his struggle now. And he pointed to the crowd in Harlem, who obtained tickets through churches, black groups and social advocacy groups, as proof that the real people are on his side, even if the politicians remain hostile.
"Others might change because they are not in the right," he said. "We won't because we are right. The best evidence is your presence here."

HEADLINE: Save Sterling Forest

 BODY:
Sterling Forest, a nearly pristine area straddling the New York-New Jersey border, is a privately owned preserve the size of Manhattan in an area undergoing an economic boom. The Sterling Forest Corporation, which is part of the Home Insurance Company, is sitting on a parcel of land that, if developed, could bring the company some much-needed revenue.
The forest is also a unique piece of wild country near the nation's largest urban area that conservationists and an increasing number of politicians are trying to preserve in its natural state. The key is to put together the needed funding and persuade Western members of Congress who oppose the creation of more public lands to allow the necessary legislation to pass. 
 The 18,000 acres of forest include sources of drinking water for most of northern New Jersey and provide a stretch of undeveloped land big enough to allow species like the black bear to thrive. The Appalachian Trail passes through it. The forest has already been encroached on by several corporate headquarters and is home to a 160-acre fairground. That is plenty of development. The need for open space in this area far exceeds the need for thousands of housing units and millions of square feet of commercial and industrial space. The rest of this valuable and irreplaceable area should be preserved.
A vocal coalition, including Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, Gov. George Pataki of New York and members of Congress from both parties in both states, has mobilized to try to save the forest. Governor Whitman has pledged $10 million to help acquire land in New York, and New York has a $2 billion bond issue on the ballot in next month's election, of which $800 million is to be used for land acquisition, including Sterling Forest. But assembling the whole rescue package is proving very tricky. It involves a combination of Federal and state funding, with the necessary Federal authorizing legislation, and negotiation of a deal with the Sterling Forest Corporation.
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey has attached a provision to an Alaskan land bill that would authorize $17.5 million to help acquire the forest and add it to the holdings of the Palisades Interstate Commission. The provision passed the Senate. The same bill, without the Sterling Forest provision, passed in the House, and the version with the Sterling Forest authorization is being held at the Speaker's desk. Two key Western Congressmen -- Don Young of Alaska, the chairman of the House Resources Committee, and James Hansen of Utah, the chairman of the National Parks, Forests and Lands Subcommittee -- are longtime enemies of public land ownership who are fighting to divest the Government of many of its holdings.
The Sterling Forest Corporation needs to realize that development of the land has a dubious political future. Any development plan (and there are four under consideration at the moment) would require the combined permission of three municipalities and two state governments, and would have to contend with the opposition of conservation and local citizens' groups. Even with that approval, challenges would no doubt delay any proposed development for years. The company is much more likely to see some real money if it can agree to an arrangement to allow public acquisition of the land.
The region's Republicans in the House, meanwhile, have made heroic efforts on behalf of the forest, especially Benjamin Gilman of New York and Marge Roukema of New Jersey. They need to keep pushing to get the measure through the House this week.


CORRECTION-DATE: October 26, 1995, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on Monday headlined "Save Sterling Forest" said incorrectly that a $2 billion bond issue would be decided in next month's New York State balloting. No such measure will appear.

HEADLINE: Foreign Stocks Drop, Setting the Stage for U.S. Market Losses

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market slumped yesterday, as both the dollar and bond prices dropped, making stocks relatively less attractive to investors.
Before trading opened in the United States, overseas stock markets tumbled, so analysts were well prepared for the decline in domestic equities. The DAX index of German stocks fell 2.91 percent, the CAC-40 index of French stocks fell 1.12 percent and the FT-SE index of British stocks slipped six-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond declined 18/32 , and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.39 percent from 6.36 percent on Friday. Higher bond yields are a negative for stocks, since they increase both corporate and consumer borrowing costs.
"The stock market opened lackluster and remained lackluster through the session," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president of Fahnestock & Company. "There is concern over the outcome of the battle of the budget, and last week's buyers became this week's sellers."
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 39.38 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 4,755.48 -- near its low for the day.
Among the broader averages, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.40 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to 585.06 and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.61 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,036.92.
There were almost twice as many declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange as advancing ones, with 1,537 lower and 772 higher. Big Board volume was 330.8 million shares, down from 396.7 million shares on Friday.
Retail stocks were off during the session amid concern about consumer buying during the coming holiday season. Kmart slipped 3/4, to 9 1/8, after Moody's cut the rating on its long-term debt. Sears, Roebuck and Company fell 7/8, to 35 1/8.
Paper issues were down, under pressure from a slowing economy. The Union Camp Corporation declined 7/8, to 51 1/4; the International Paper Company dropped 1, to 36 1/2, and the Weyerhaeuser Company fell 3/4, to 46.
Some airline companies were weak, as traders cited concern over fare discounts. AMR, the holding company for American Airlines, closed at 64 3/8, down 1/2; Delta Air Lines closed at 65, down 3/4, and Southwest Airlines closed at 20 3/4, down 3/8.
On the other hand, the technology sector had a pocket of stocks that finished on the upside. International Business Machines gained 3 5/8, to 99, and the Digital Equipment Corporation, which is scheduled to report its earnings today, advanced 3/4, to 52 1/2. Advanced Micro Devices, which agreed to acquire Nexgen late last Friday, increased 1 3/8, to 27 1/2, while Nexgen rose 1/2, to 21 3/4.
Both the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation advanced as Wall Street indicated its belief that fees would not be imposed on the debt and mortgage-backed securities issued by the two companies. Federal National Mortgage closed at 103 7/8, up 7/8, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage closed at 69 1/2, up 7/8.
Summit Technology climbed 1 7/8, to 42 1/2, after the company's excimer laser treatment to correct nearsightedness was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. A rival, Visx Inc., whose laser is expected to win approval by next March, was up 1 1/2, to 22 1/2.

HEADLINE: THE U.N. AT 50: AROUND TOWN;
On the Streets, Shopping Spree and Gridlock

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Her husband was tied up in meetings yesterday, so Naina Yeltsin took care of some of her own business.
"Any concerns about your skin?" the cosmetologist at Estee Lauder asked Mrs. Yeltsin. 
 "It's all right," the first lady of Russia responded.
"Is it oily or dry?"
"Normal."
"How often do you have oily blemishes?"
War and peace and everything in between were on the official United Nations agenda, but in the city outside, it was a day of shopping and dining for the world leaders' spouses, and gridlock and grumbling for New Yorkers. More than a few of the motorcades screeching through the city, holding up traffic, were carrying Very Important Purchasers, shuttling between shops and official luncheons, political fund-raisers and the evening's performance of Beethoven's Ninth at Avery Fisher Hall.
On Fifth Avenue, a small security force waited patiently outside the Salvatore Ferragamo boutique while Amelita Ramos, the wife of President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines, was shopping for shoes. As Mrs. Ramos sat in a cushy chair, a salesman settled on his haunches, showing her a parade of pumps and presumably refraining from Imelda Marcos jokes.
And at Tiffany's, Sumanee Guma-Kasem, wife of an adviser to the Prime Minister of Thailand, surveyed the jewlery. "I've been everywhere: Bergdorf's, Lord & Taylor and The Forgotten Woman," she said.
City officials estimate that the world leaders and their delegations will have spent between $28.5 million and $39.5 million in five days by the time they return to their homelands on Wednesday. Starting Saturday, the city's hotel rooms were virtually all booked, making it "a weekend unlike any other weekend in our history," said Jeanine Moss, a spokeswoman for the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau.
Broadway shows were reporting heavy diplomatic interest; "Smoky Joe's Cafe" was expecting both Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway and President Carlos S. Menem of Argentina .
And restaurants, particularly expensive ones with hot reputations, were jammed. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was initially turned down for a reservation at Nobu, the downtown Japanese restaurant, but was squeezed in last night. "Someone from Australia or Austria" called, said Demethress Gordon, the restaurant's reservation manger. "They said, 'The President wants to come here,' and we are trying to get him in."
Some visitors actually ventured out of Manhattan. Ortwin Windmuller, the general manager of Peter Luger's Steak House in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, seated the president of El Salvador over the weekend. "And we had a few here today for lunch, from Brazil or something," Mr. Windmuller said.
Tim Zagat, publisher of the Zagat restaurant guides and chairman of NY 95, a partnership devoted to increasing tourism, compared the United Nations event to the 1992 Democratic Party convention at Madison Square Garden, generally thought to be a watershed event for New York tourism in the 1990's.
"But anybody who thinks this is about how much business we do in these four days just doesn't get it," Mr. Zagat said. "It's the image that New York gets to present around the world -- that it's pretty, that it's nice, that it's hospitable, that it's clean, that it's safe."
The city was playing the constant host. At noon yesterday, Donna Hanover Giuliani threw a luncheon for 400 spouses of world leaders inside the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The guests sat at 50 tables in the reconstructed Egyptian temple. Waiting on each of their chairs was a gift of a star-shaped crystal ornament from Baccarat.
As the spouses dined on grilled salmon fillet and roasted breast of chicken, Mrs. Giuliani, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barbara Walters delivered remarks.The recurring if unofficial theme of celebrating womanhood resounded in a room whose profound imbalance by sex was proof positive that, globally at least, women are hardly on an equal footing with men.
"I feel duty-bound to point out that there are some male spouses in the room," Mrs. Clinton said. In truth, though, there were fewer than a half dozen men among the guests.
Making note of the spouses' contributions to the state of world affairs, Mrs. Clinton said, "Thank you for what each of you do every day." And then, in a sort of winking reference to the difficulty of living with powerful men, she said, "Thank you for what each of you puts up with every day."
There was plenty of unplanned time for the spouses and stores from Tiffany's to F.A.O. Schwarz reported a stream of foreign customers.
Linda Buckley, the public relations manager for Tiffany's, said, "There are people who are coming in today by appointment or just stopping in." But like spokesmen at other stores, Ms. Buckley refused to reveal the names of customers.
Mrs. Yeltsin's visit to the Estee Lauder was not a shopping trip but rather a visit to the company's headquarters in the General Motors building, meant to recognize her work in breast cancer awareness and also to highlight the company's operations in Russia, where a second store in Moscow is set to open next week. Mrs. Yeltsin was greeted lavishly by the Lauder family as here motorcade pulled up yesterday morning.
But whatever hospitality Mrs. Yeltsin and the other guests were feeling, more than a few New Yorkers said they had enough of the traffic tumult caused by the diplomatic invasion, coming just two weeks after the visit of Pope John Paul II.
Carol Cooper, who lives on the Upper East Side, stopped a police officer on the Fifth Avenue sidewalk yesterday as another motorcade went by. "If they're so security conscious why do they announce where they're going with 18 cars, with horns and sirens and clearing streets?" she asked. "It's crazy."
The officer, Robert Giannetta, gently told her he really did not know.
"I think they're all on an ego trip," Mrs. Cooper said.
"Ma'am," the officer said, "you won't have to worry about it for another fifty years."

HEADLINE: Michigan Puts Poor to Work But Gains Appear Precarious

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich.

 BODY:
An axiom of the welfare debate holds that the way out of poverty is a job, and no state has put more of its poor into jobs than Michigan.
Three years after the Governor, John Engler, began recasting the welfare system in his conservative Republican vision, his program is being cited as a model by Congressional Republicans, who are putting the final touches on legislation that would upend Federal antipoverty policy. Governor Engler and his social services director, Gerald H. Miller, were influential lobbyists to Congress in shaping the legislation, which would slash up to $100 billion of Federal aid for the poor and give states block grants to run welfare programs of their own design. 
 Here in Michigan, nearly 30 percent of welfare clients earn a paycheck, more than three times the national average. Today's welfare caseload of 190,000 is the lowest in 21 years. The State Department of Social Services says it is spending $100 million less for welfare than it would if so many people did not have jobs.
State officials proudly say that the program, besides saving money, helps keep families together. Built on carrots and increasingly punitive sticks, the revisions allow more working fathers to live with their families without disqualifying the household from welfare.
But if Michigan gleams as an example of what a state can accomplish without Federal regulation, it also offers cautionary lessons. For all its innovation, the state's welfare system has made only limited and precarious gains, say economists and sociologists and officials from other states who have come here by the dozens to study the system.
Moreover, Michigan has come up against the same economic reality that confronts the nation's work force. For more than 20 years, as inflation has nibbled away at wages, employers have not made up the loss. So a working wage today is often not a living wage, and the idea of a job as an antidote to welfare is no longer assured.
"It has certainly worked," Alan Werner of Abt Associates, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass., said of the Michigan welfare program. "It doesn't look like clients are suffering. It doesn't look like poor people are getting poorer."
Mr. Werner, whose firm was hired by the State of Michigan to monitor the program, said it had "increased employment and earnings and reduced welfare dependence -- but only by a few percentage points."
"The scale of change is quite small," he added.
Both the House and the Senate versions of the welfare bill, whose differences are to be reconciled by a conference committee that is to meet today, require that states have 50 percent of their welfare recipients working by the year 2000.
In his original effort to get people off welfare through working, Governor Engler, who was elected in 1990, at first encouraged schooling and training that could lead to well-paid, durable jobs. But the state welfare bill, in part because of job-training costs, remained stubbornly high -- about $7 billion a year.
Last year Mr. Engler ordered most welfare recipients to look for work immediately, and now 55,000 people are working, double the number before he took over. The trouble is that most of the jobs available pay so little that they cannot lift a family out of poverty and to the point where it no longer needs state aid.
In this way, experts say, Michigan's welfare-to-work system shows signs of hooking the working poor to the dole, much as the Federal welfare system is accused of hooking generations of the nonworking poor to the dole.
Even these gains are fragile, analysts add, because they come on the wings of Michigan's soaring economy, the nation's most volatile. Over the last two decades the state's unemployment rate has seesawed from less than 5 percent now to more than 15 percent.
A recession could flood the welfare rolls, said Stephen Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York in Albany. "You can see they're not going to have enough money," Mr. Gold said. "They will say, 'Well, we can't raise taxes, so we will have to cut spending more.' They're sowing the seeds of further cuts in social spending."
State officials say Congress, too, threatens their success through a provision in the welfare bill, supported by President Clinton, that would set a cap of perhaps five years on how long states can use their block grants to support a welfare family. The measure would rob the Michigan program of what state officials say is a crucial feature: its assurance that welfare clients can collect benefit checks indefinitely until they make a living wage.
"No awful caps!" said Mr. Miller, the social services director. "The issue is getting people to work and getting people out of poverty."
Sandra K. Danziger, an associate professor of social work at the University of Michigan and an authority on the state's welfare system, said, "A lot of people do seem to be combining work and welfare, and that is really in stark contrast to the rest of the states." She praised the program's accountability and added, "The program for families is very constructive."
But she criticized the Governor for financing the family welfare program, along with a general tax cut, by shutting down a general assistance program for 83,000 indigent single men and women. Since ending the program four years ago, she said, shelters for the homeless have been flooded with new clients.
"He changed the rules," she said of Mr. Engler. And changing the rules last year to compel welfare clients to take low-wage jobs, she added, "is short-sighted."
 
The Program
Some Incentives And Exemptions
In October 1992, when the Governor began revamping the state's welfare system, he told the poor that welfare was not a right. But pull an oar to help yourself, he said, and the state will pull the other.
He introduced a voluntary "social contract," an innovation in welfare policy under which clients would give the community 20 hours a week. They could take paying jobs or do volunteer work, or enroll in school, job training or drug treatment programs. He assured everyone free health care under Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor, and subsidies for child care.
With waivers in the Federal welfare regulations, he added special incentives for workers. They could keep $200 of their monthly earnings without any reduction of their check for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the principal Federal welfare program.
At that point their welfare benefits would start to decline, but they could still keep 20 percent of their earnings above the $200. By the time a typical family of three was earning about $775 a month, it would be weaned from its welfare check but it could keep Medicaid for the children and some food stamps for another year.
The arrangement still leaves no one particularly well off. The $775 in monthly income, or $9,300 a year, comes to 77 percent of the income a family of three needs to break through the poverty threshhold for three of $12,112. Without working, the typical nonworking family would be receiving about $800 less a year.
Michigan waived other Federal rules to help families. A 100-hour limit on the hours parents could work each month was removed. Welfare experts blame the restriction for chasing fathers from the home and contributing to the proliferation of impoverished families headed by women.
The changes help bond couples like Tonja Kimmel, 21, and Eric Boylan, also 21. They reported here recently to the Ingham County office of the State Department of Social Services so that Mr. Boylan, the father of their 19-month-old son, could be added to Ms. Kimmel's case.
Under the previous system, the state would have docked Ms. Kimmel's welfare payment by some of Mr. Boylan's earnings when they moved in together. Now they can keep much of what Mr. Boylan earns in addition to their $489 monthly check through Aid to Dependent Children. But their prospects for earning enough to escape welfare are dim. Both are high school dropouts and are unemployed.
"It don't bother me to work," Ms. Kimmel said. "I can't find any. Unless you have a good education, it's hard to find a good job."
 
The Push to Work
Emphasis on Jobs, Not Education
Job training might help Ms. Kimmel and Mr. Boylen, but that's pretty much out these days.
A year ago, Mr. Engler started a "work first" program to steer welfare applicants to the job market. Only a few clients -- primarily women with infants at home or people under 24 who have not completed high school -- are deferred.
The social contract, with the new emphasis on finding paid work, became mandatory. Most training is confined to learning how to get a job. Clients are assigned to "job clubs," classes at nonprofit private agencies, on contract with the state, to learn how to handle job interviews, write resumes and comb the help-wanted ads.
Many find work within a month, said Janet L. Strope, director of the Ingham County social services office. She added that the college and skill training that the state used to encourage was too costly and rarely led to good jobs.
But many people balked at taking low-wage jobs, so in April the state introduced sanctions. "If they don't cooperate, if they don't show up for job clubs, if they don't follow up on job leads, if they don't have a cause," Ms. Strope said, "they lose 25 percent of their grant and sometimes 25 percent of their food stamps."
That shoe falls within two or three months after a client applies for welfare. A year later "they lose the whole grant," Ms. Strope said.
So far, of its caseload of 5,300, her office has docked the 25 percent from 350 cases. Ms. Strope said she believed many could absorb the cut because they were earning unreported wages in the cash economy.
But she wonders about the bigger penalties that will not be leveled until next summer. "When we sanction people 100 percent," she asked, "what happens to their children?"
 
The Cutting Edge
Many Problems; Little Enthusiasm
The Cristo Rey Community Center is one of six nonprofit organizations that the Ingham County social services office has hired to help put welfare families on their feet and send them to work.
Along with the health center, there is a Head Start school, a food pantry, an elementary and middle school for children with behavioral problems and classrooms where clients learn to look for jobs.
It is hard to find much enthusiasm for the Engler welfare program among the clients or the staff members here, who say the emphasis on immediate work is stingy and shortsighted.
Robin Ripley, 32, was in the health center with her sneezing 2-year-old daughter, Emily, who gets Medicaid. Ms. Ripley and her husband, David, 37, collect about $100 a month in food stamps.
Ms. Ripley said they first ended up on welfare when she had a high-risk pregnancy and spent three months in the hospital. "I had the baby but in seven days he died," she said. "I lost the A.D.C. two weeks later."
They requalified for welfare when she became pregnant with Christopher, who is now 4, and got off again two months ago when Ms. Ripley took a full-time, $5.20-an-hour job with a telephone answering service, working from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M.
The Ripleys are among thousands of Michigan residents who have worked their way off welfare, but they feel neither rich nor heroic. Their income still leaves them about 20 percent below the $15,520 poverty line for a family of four.
Ms. Ripley said she needs more training to do better. "They would rather have me working at Burger King than get an education and have enough skill to support my family," she said. "What's the point of that?"
Many other people who stream through Cristo Rey do not easily fit Michigan's welfare-to-work program. Indeed, most of them -- the 70 percent who have not gone to work -- do not fit.
Three generations of one family straggle into the health center for a well-baby checkup. "We walk here," said Louise Creller, who is 44, wan and spaghetti-thin. "Takes us about an hour." She and Mary Person, 15, looking adult and purposeful, have brought a stroller with a 2-month-old baby. Two little boys, 2 and 4, accompany them.
The baby is Ms. Person's. Ms. Person is one of Ms. Creller's five children, who range in age from 10 to 21, and lives with her mother. The boys are the sons of Ms. Creller's oldest child, a daughter getting settled in Detroit where she recently found a job stuffing inserts in newspapers.
Ms. Creller, whose husband is "somewhere down South," said she collects about $800 a month in food stamps and Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and her rent is $500 a month.
Deferred from the Governor's work requirement, she has become, instead, a one-woman alternative to his welfare-to-work program.
By not working, she helps steer another generation from welfare to work. "I baby-sit him until 3:30," she said of the baby, until Mary, a tenth grader, comes home. Until the older daughter can take on the boys, she said, "I baby-sit them all day."

HEADLINE: THE U.N. AT 50: GENERAL ASSEMBLY;
Money on Their Minds, Leaders Tell U.N. to Trim Down

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Beset by economic uncertainties at home and preoccupied by the shadow of bankruptcy looming over the United Nations, world leaders speaking here today could not avoid the subject of money.
The financial predicament has added urgency to calls for reform of the United Nations and may make it easier for the United States and other industrial nations to curtail their support sharply and possibly to force the United Nations to close about half a dozen agencies. This would be the most extensive shrinking and restructuring of the organization in its half-century of existence. 
 Today Prime Minister John Major of Britain used the toughest language heard so far in calling for a smaller, more efficient organization.
"Is the U.N. spread too wide?" he asked. "I believe it is."
"Is too much time and energy spent on ritual verbal battles, brilliantly interpreted into six languages and printed on the world's highest paper mountain?" he said. "Of course it is."
Officials traveling with Mr. Major say that he has a number of United Nations agencies in mind for reduction or elimination. The list is the same one from which the Clinton Administration is working as it tries to negotiate with Congress over a reform plan.
Until the Administration can make some concessions to Congress on foreign spending issues, money to pay more than $1.2 billion in overdue American assessments to the United Nations will not be forthcoming. Today both Britain and France joined a host of other nations in publicly deploring deadbeats.
American officials acknowledge that the agencies now under the most severe scrutiny are the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, which the Administration says has been made redundant by other agencies, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, whose functions may be overtaken by the new World Trade Organization.
In addition, United States officials say, a plan to rejoin Unesco, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, from which the United States withdrew in 1984, has all but been abandoned for the foreseeable future, and there are serious doubts about continued support for the Food and Agricultural Organization and the International Labor Organization.
The agencies and organizations have also been criticized by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and by other Republican leaders. The Clinton Administration appears ready to sacrifice American membership or support for the agencies if doing so will unlock money, votes on treaties and the confirmation of diplomats, all of which are being held up by the Republicans.
Today Mr. Major and President Jacques Chirac of France -- each saying his country had contributed the largest number of peacekeeping troops to the United Nations -- both spoke more concretely about reforming the United Nations than President Clinton did in his speech to more than 140 world leaders on Sunday.
Mr. Chirac proposed the appointment of a new Under Secretary General to oversee all development work and to be the "strong-arm executor" coordinating various agencies.
Fears that development assistance may fall off played a part in the drafting of a strong set of speeches from African leaders -- delivered by chance on the same day.
Presidents Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Brig. Gen. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea, and Foreign Minister Destin Tsaty-Boungou of the Republic of the Congo were among those who asked that the world not turn away from poor nations, especially in Africa, which is falling further and further behind other developing regions in standards of living. Several African leaders blamed the heritage of colonialism for continuing poverty and social stress.
President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, saying with some passion that "we feel the hunger in the midst of plenty," added that for his continent, "the next 50 years will be even more crucial than the past 50 years."
He added, "We cannot help being struck by the fact that the international community is willing to spend $5 million a day on U.N. peacekeeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and we would not begrudge those noble people such international solidarity.
"But when we have asked for a sum that represents 10 to 15 days of that bill to help those of us in Africa making every possible effort to assist ourselves with our meager resources, there is deafening silence."
Behind the scenes today, more than 70 private meetings took place between leaders in dozens of instant conference rooms created by temporarily partitioning areas of the first and second floors of the United Nations headquarters. More conversations took place at lunches or over coffee in the basement Viennese coffee shop.
Although they do not get the attention of a Clinton-Yeltsin summit, the large number of usually unpublicized, off-camera meetings between other leaders is evidence of the extensive use of the United Nations as a one-stop diplomatic hub. Visiting leaders not only met each other but also lobbied heads of United Nations agencies.
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt, on his way to meet King Hussein of Jordan after sessions with the Prime Minister of Morocco and the President of Azerbaijan, said that he had been trying to activate some Islamic opinion on Bosnia as he went from meeting to meeting within the building.
"That saves time and effort," he said. "You don't even have to cross the street."

HEADLINE: Labor's Love Not Lost

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

 BODY:
Whatever anger organized labor has sometimes felt toward the White House was indiscernible last night, when President Clinton spoke for 45 minutes to 1,020 friendly delegates of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., whose four-day convention began yesterday in midtown Manhattan.
American labor unions were once furious with the President over his endorsement of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, and many promised to campaign against anyone in Congress, Democrat or Republican, who voted for it. 
 Yet yesterday, as the President reached the dais at the Sheraton New York Hotel, the delegates chanted "Four more years!" and "We want Bill!"
"Whose side is Bill Clinton on?" asked Thomas R. Donahue, the federation president, introducing him. "Make no mistake about it. He's on your side."
And the President responded, "Whatever you do, I intend to be with you every step of the way."
The President ran down the list of policies and programs under attack in Congress and important to labor: occupational safety, Medicare, Medicaid, college scholarships, and the earned-income tax credit, which allows low-wage workers to keep more of their earnings.
One of labor unions' biggest issues is the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage, and the President emphatically reiterated his support for an increase.
"It is high time we raised the minimum wage," Mr. Clinton said to a standing ovation. Citing Republican arguments against an increase of 50 or 75 cents, he said, "There is no evidence that a modest increase in the minimum wage will cause unemployment."
He also repeated other promises, like tax deductions for education after high school and fighting trading partners, like Japan, whom he accuses of thwarting imports of American goods. His only reference to Nafta was an allusion to occasional disagreements over trade.

HEADLINE: Polaroid Picks An Outsider As New Chief

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 23

 BODY:
The Polaroid Corporation, under pressure to increase its share price and develop new products to spur sales, named the Black & Decker Corporation's No. 2 executive, Gary T. DiCamillo, chairman and chief executive.
Mr. DiCamillo, the first outsider ever to head Polaroid, is a marketer who increased profits and sales during his nine years at Black & Decker. 
 That is the kind of experience Polaroid, a maker of instant cameras and imaging products, wants.
"This is a guy with good marketing experience, who has been able to improve profitability," said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Mr. DiCamillo, 44, is scheduled to take the helm on Dec. 1, ending a search begun in March to replace Polaroid chairman and chief executive I. Mac Allister Booth, 63, who will retire.
Wall Street was apparently disappointed that Polaroid did not appoint a more proven cost-cutter. Polaroid shares fell $1.125 to close at $40.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. DiCamillo gave few hints about what he planned for Polaroid, whose woes began when consumer enthusiasm for instant photography waned. At the same time, its forays into new technologies such as medical imaging did not pan out.
"I've got to get into the company, and do more homework," Mr. DiCamillo said. He said he would focus both on the instant-photography consumer business and its new arenas of digital and medical imaging, which use computers to manipulate images.
The company's photographic business "clearly can grow through global expansion," he said, noting Polaroid's efforts for the last few years to increase sales by getting its products into emerging economies such as Russia.
Mr. Rosenzweig of Salomon agreed that Mr. DiCamillo must "boost consumer demand" for instant cameras and film in major United States and European markets, while investing in emerging businesses.
At Black & Decker, Mr. DiCamillo lifted sales and profits at the power tools business he headed. He said that "some cuts and refocusing" had been necessary. The $1.8 billion power tools business accounted for about one-third of the company sales of $5.2 billion in 1994.
"He's a good, basic block-and-tackle operating guy," said Susan Gallagher, a Natwest Securities Corporation analyst who follows Black & Decker.

HEADLINE: Proffitt's to Buy Younkers in Retail Merger

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Proffitt's Inc. said yesterday that it would buy Younkers Inc. in a stock swap valued at $253 million, succeeding where Carson Pirie Scott & Company failed in a yearlong hostile takeover bid.
The deal would create one of the nation's largest regional department-store retailers, with combined revenue of $1.3 billion and 107 stores in 16 states in the Midwest and South. 
 "The big guys already went through consolidation," said Peter Schaeffer, an analyst with Dillon Read & Company. "It has to happen for the regional department-store chains."
While the deal appears to thwart Carson Pirie Scott's $170 million bid for control of Younkers, a lawsuit is still pending in the takeover battle.
Carson Pirie Scott, which has an 11.7 percent stake in Younkers, declined to comment on the proposed merger and said that it had not determined what action, if any, it would take.
Investors, however, appeared to like the deal, sending the shares of Younkers up $3.1875, to $22.25. But the stock of Proffitt's fell $5.125, to $23.375. The shares of Carson Pirie Scott rose 12.5 cents, to $19.50.
Under the agreement, Younkers shareholders would get 0.98 share of Proffitt's common stock for each Younkers share. Proffitt's would issue about 8.8 million shares in the transaction, or about $253 million of stock, based on Friday's closing price of $28.75.
There would be unspecified one-time charges related to the merger and restructuring of operations, the companies said. The boards of both companies have approved the deal.
Through the merger, the companies would create a retailer slightly larger than their Midwest rival, Carson Pirie Scott, which is based in Milwaukee. Carson Pirie Scott has 51 stores and had revenue last year of $1.16 billion.
"This makes sense," said Philip Abbenhaus, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Company. "There is no overlap of markets, and there are clearly opportunities for economies of scale."
Proffitt's, based in Alcoa, Tenn., had revenue last year of $698 million. It operates two divisions. The Proffitt's division has 26 stores, in Tennessee, Virginia, Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina. The McRae's division has 28 stores, in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana. The stores sell fashion apparel, shoes, accessories, cosmetics and decorative home furnishings.
Younkers, with revenue of $605 million, has 53 stores, in Iowa, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota and South Dakota. The stores sell clothes for men, women and children, as well as cosmetics and fragrances.
Younkers would operate as a separate division of Proffitt's, maintaining its headquarters in Des Moines.
Younkers has been battling the hostile takeover attempt by Carson Pirie Scott since October 1994. Younkers rebuffed Carson Pirie Scott's $19-a-share offer as inadequate, saying it was not for sale at such a low price. Carson Pirie Scott offered to raise its offer by $1, but Younkers said it was not interested.

HEADLINE: CNN Rejects an Ad

 BODY:
Cable News Network and its owner, Turner Broadcasting, support the House and Senate telecommunications bills. AT&T opposes the bills. AT&T, along with other long-distance telephone companies, wanted to voice its opposition by paying CNN to run commercials. CNN said no, in part because the ads posed a "conflict of interest."
That will not cause grievous harm to the public. After all, Turner Broadcasting is only one of many media companies -- including newspapers, radio stations, television stations and phone companies -- that service communities and can carry advocacy messages. Yet the incident exposes a large danger to the free flow of information that is posed by the very telecommunications bills that AT&T's ads were designed to defeat. 
 The House and Senate bills, which might go to conference this week, could make it possible in a given area for the same corporation to control the major newspaper, television stations, radio stations and cable company. If that happens, a decision to quash an ad or a news story would effectively quash the public's right to know.
CNN was under no legal compulsion to carry AT&T's ad. Nor is it compelled to run advocacy ads at all. The television networks do not. In the past, CNN has even run ads opposed to telecommunications legislation that it supported.
Turner Broadcasting changed its mind this time, it says, because AT&T's ads were "misleading" as well as contrary to Turner's corporate interest. CNN executives also said that the pending takeover of Turner by Time Warner -- which owns a huge cable company -- changed the situation, although a conflict of interest would exist even without a merger.
The telecommunications bills would rely on the antitrust laws to protect the public from undue concentration of media companies. But the antitrust laws are insufficient protection. They are designed to prevent undue economic power -- the threat that consumers will be charged high prices -- rather than to prevent an ominous narrowing of information and opinion.
The law should not tell CNN which commercials to run. But the law should make sure that consumers have enough sources of information that they need not care what decisions CNN makes.

HEADLINE: The Spirit of Hyde Park

 BODY:
The White House picked Hyde Park as the site of yesterday's meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton because the Roosevelt homestead is a symbol of the wartime alliance between Moscow and Washington. The more relevant symbolism of the Hudson River estate might have been Franklin Roosevelt's acute instinct for balancing politics and diplomacy. It is a commodity that will be much needed in the months ahead as Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin try to guide the volatile relationship between their countries through the heat of Presidential elections in both the United States and Russia.
The domestic political pressures already bearing down on both men were evident at Hyde Park, where much of the discussion dealt with Russia's role in a Bosnian peacekeeping force that would follow a Balkan peace agreement. The two leaders reported they made some progress, and Mr. Yeltsin said Russian troops would participate. 
 But despite a giddy news conference, where Mr. Yeltsin's admonishment of the press left Mr. Clinton oddly convulsed by laughter, they resolved none of the hard questions about Russian involvement. Mr. Yeltsin, eager to show that Russian prerogatives cannot be ignored, has refused to contribute troops if the peacekeeping force is under NATO command. Mr. Clinton has rejected Mr. Yeltsin's proposal of United Nations control.
The spirit of Hyde Park suggests a compromise that can satisfy the two Presidents' political concerns without undermining their principles. Russia must be represented in any peacekeeping mission lest the force appear tilted against the Bosnian Serbs and their allies in Belgrade. Without Serbian cooperation there can be no peace in Bosnia.
But Russia does not have to be an equal participant with the United States, Britain, France and other countries. The value of a Russian role can be preserved if Russian troops play a support role and do not take part in combat operations that might be required to keep the peace. That way NATO command can be maintained, which is essential to avoiding the blurred lines of authority that crippled U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia.
The Bosnian mission should not be freighted with the highly charged issue of NATO expansion. Some Clinton aides mistakenly see Russian participation in Bosnia as a first step toward enlarging the alliance, and some of Mr. Yeltsin's advisers just as mistakenly see a Russian role there as capitulation to NATO. Peacekeeping in Bosnia is not a test case for NATO expansion. It is still far from clear that expansion of a cold-war military alliance is necessary to consolidate democracy and market economics in central Europe today.
For Washington to push expansion now, and make it integral to the Bosnian case, seems not only gratuitous but self-defeating. The surest way for Washington to encourage nationalism and rearmament in Moscow is to push NATO expansion as Russia turns toward parliamentary elections in December and presidential balloting next June.
Franklin Roosevelt held the World War II Allies together with shrewd leadership and a subtle sense for the mix of politics and foreign policy. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin should follow his example.

Large Layoffs Are Planned At Daimler Aerospace Unit

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Announcing one of Germany's biggest layoff programs of the year, the giant aerospace unit of the Daimler-Benz group said today that by 1998 it would cut almost 9,000 jobs, or more than 15 percent of its work force, and would close or sell as many as five plants.
The planned cuts are a stark example of German industry's struggle to remain competitive in the face of soaring labor costs and a rising German mark that drives up export prices, which reduces the country's international competitiveness. 
 Daimler-Benz Aerospace A.G., also known as Dasa, was particularly hard hit because in addition to competing in an industry priced principally in dollars, it has also faced a worldwide recession in the aerospace business.
"This is the only way in which this industry can operate efficiently in the private sector in Germany," Manfred Bischoff, the chief executive of Dasa, said in a statement today.
In the last year, Germany has seen a flight of industrial jobs, as manufacturers have sought to locate plants in regions with lower costs. Dasa's sister company, Mercedes-Benz, has announced a series of new plant openings overseas.
Dasa is Europe's largest aerospace concern, with a 37.9 percent stake in Airbus industries; a 51 percent holding in Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker, and a one-third stake in the Eurofighter consortium. It also operates Eurocopter Deutschland.
Dasa said it was restructuring operations so that under an exchange rate of 1.35 marks to the dollar, the company would still be profitable. This was regarded as a grim sign by analysts, who noted that companies are increasingly resigned to accepting that in the long term, the dollar will not move much higher than its current levels. The dollar settled at 1.3882 German marks today in New York.
In the summer, traders hoped that with strong backing by the seven leading industrial countries, the dollar would climb back to exchange levels seen in early 1994, of 1.55 to 1.60 German marks.
The job losses mean that by 1998, Dasa will have a work force of some 40,000, less than half its peak of 87,000 in 1993. Even so, the cuts fell far short of analyst expectations and raised concerns that the German Government might be forced to subsidize jobs or that the company might not be restructuring aggressively enough.
Earlier in the year, the company let it be known that under its restructuring plan, it was considering eliminating as many as 15,000 jobs. It now has almost 57,000 employees.
"Our analysis is that if you compare Dasa to some of its competitors, such as British Aerospace, one might have thought that the number of people to be cut would be much higher than 15,000," said Stephen Reitmann, European autos analyst for UBS Global Research in London.
Glen Liddy, German equities analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London, added that "the German Government may want to do this to limit the number of job losses."
Dasa's losses have been enormous, dragging the parent group into the red. Daimler-Benz earned almost $750 million in 1994, according to American generally accepted accounting practices, but the strength of the German mark threw the group into a net loss for the first six months of this year of $1.13 billion, including an operating loss at Dasa of $1.15 billion.
Mr. Reitman predicted that the company would post a loss for the full year of $1.95 billion.
The planned cuts will be felt most deeply at the company's aircraft group, which is to lose 8,046 jobs; 800 jobs will be lost at other divisions.
The restructuring also involves plans to sell three sites in western Germany. In addition, two plants Dasa took over in eastern Germany after the fall of Communism may be sold.
Yet, even if these cuts fix some of Dasa's problems, there are still more troubles ahead that make success far from certain, analysts said. Its Fokker subsidiary, the unit that builds commuter aircraft, is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and is negotiating with the Dutch Government for a bailout that could exceed $2 billion. Any reductions of workers at Fokker would be in addition to the job losses announced today.

4 Big Brokers In Japan Lift Profits From Lows of '94

 BODY:
Japan's four biggest securities firms, rebounding from their worst year ever, reported sharp improvements in earnings for the first half of the fiscal year yesterday, aided by a rally on the Japanese bond market.
Officials at the four companies said they expected profit to continue to rise, but analysts said the projections were too optimistic. They said the brokerage industry, especially smaller companies, would continue to grapple with high costs and an uncertain revenue outlook. 
 The three largest brokerage houses -- Nomura Securities Company, Nikko Securities Company and the Daiwa Securities Company (which is not related to the Daiwa Bank Ltd.) -- posted gains in pretax profit as great as 995 percent for the half-year ending on Sept. 30. The fourth-largest broker, the Yamaichi Securities Company, swung to a pretax profit in the half from a loss in the corresponding period a year ago.
Reflecting the contrasting performances of the big and small securities houses, however, 9 of the 10 second-tier firms reported losses for the first half, although some of the losses were smaller than expected.
All the results reflected business conducted by the parent companies only. The companies will post consolidated results, reflecting business carried out by all the operations in each business group, later.
The results were in contrast to those for the fiscal year that ended on March 31, when Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi each recorded their largest pretax losses ever. Nomura was profitable, although its earnings fell sharply.
Over all, the 20 brokerage houses listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange reported combined losses of more than 254 billion yen, or $2.5 billion, for the fiscal year, making the year the industry's worst in more than three decades.
Since then, however, Japanese bond prices have rallied, lifting the profit the firms make from trading bonds for their own accounts and the commissions they receive on bond trades for their customers.
Bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices, fell to their lowest levels after the Japanese central bank cut its discount rate to one-half of 1 percent, also a record low, on Sept. 8. A rally in the United States Treasury bond market also aided the Japanese brokers.
With interest rates about as low as they can go, however, analysts said they did not expect the firms to continue to receive such a big boost from the bond market. "These bond profits are unsustainably high," said Elizabeth Daniels, a banking and financial-industry analyst at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd., as quoted by Dow Jones news service.
Commissions from trading Japanese stocks remained weak in the first half. Average daily volume on the Tokyo exchange's first section fell nearly 10 percent from the similar period a year before. Volume was weakest in the first three months of the half; toward the end of the period, daily turnover improved as the dollar's rise against the yen led to a rally in stock prices. Volume has slowed since then.
Nomura said pretax profit rose to 32.16 billion yen, or $322 million, in the half, up 43 percent from 22.50 billion yen a year earlier. Net income gained 61 percent, to 16.37 billion yen from 10.19 billion yen, and revenue rose 4.8 percent, to 200.07 billion yen from 190.93 billion yen.
Daiwa's pretax profit jumped to 27.53 billion yen from 7.28 billion yen, while net income soared to 20.20 billion yen from 3.23 billion yen. Revenue increased 15 percent, to 143.94 billion yen from 124.92 billion yen.
At Nikko, pretax profit was 25.53 billion yen, more than 10 times the 2.33 billion yen profit in the 1994 period. Net income rose to 18.86 billion yen from 1.97 billion yen. Revenue increased 19 percent, to 139.04 billion yen from 116.78 billion yen.
Yamaichi swung to a pretax profit of 5.21 billion yen from a loss of 8.72 billion yen a year ago. It reported net income of 2.35 billion yen, in contrast to a net loss of 6.59 billion yen in the 1994 period. Revenue rose 10 percent, to 110.76 billion yen from 100.36 billion yen.

HEADLINE: Italy's Political Turmoil Hurts European Stocks and the Dollar

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
Political uncertainties in Italy infected financial markets across Europe today, sending the dollar sharply lower and driving down stock and bond prices.
Investors, jittery about the economic outlook in Italy if the current Government fails to survive a vote of confidence in Parliament this week, sold Italian lire and purchased German marks. The mark, a traditional safe haven for European investors, then strengthened against other currencies, including the dollar. 
 Canadian markets were also shaken by political forces today. Stock and bond prices plummeted after a poll showed Quebec separatists gaining an upper hand in a referendum next week. [Page D6.] United States stock prices also fell after the declines in Europe. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 39.38 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 4,755.48. [Page D16.]
The rise in the mark raised fears in Germany that exporters, already hit hard by the strong currency in recent months, would see their profits come under more intense pressure. A strong mark makes German goods more expensive abroad. German stock prices fell sharply, with the DAX index of 30 shares ending the day down 63.07 points, or 2.9 percent, at 2,107.42.
Similar patterns were seen in other European markets. In Paris, the CAC-40 index fell 19.58 points, to 1,721.14. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares fell 19.9 points, to 3,531.5.
In Milan, Italian equities suffered from the nation's continuing political problems, with the Mibtel index hitting a new low of 8,878 during the day before closing at 8,912, down 1.82 percent. The lira slid to 1,160 to the mark from 1,145 on Friday.
Analysts said the dollar, rather than suffering from any new fundamental problem, simply became caught in the European crossfire and was driven down as traders bought marks and sold lire, French francs and other European currencies. Some of those transactions also involve the dollar; a trader, for example, may sell lire for dollars and then sell the dollars to buy marks.
The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen in European trading. The dollar was at 99.60 yen late in the day, down from 100.18 on Friday.
Late in the day, the dollar was trading at 1.3821 marks, down from 1.3975 on Friday. The dollar traded as low as 1.3816 marks during the day, its lowest level in nearly three months.
Later in New York, the dollar recovered a bit, trading at 99.96 yen and 1.3882 marks. But the dollar was still down from Friday's levels in New York, when it was trading at 100.35 yen and 1.3977 marks.
The rocky performance of the markets today came against a background of political and economic problems across Europe.
The Italian Government of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini appeared likely to lose a vote of confidence in the lower house of Parliament on Thursday. If the Government falls, its budget proposals would probably be doomed.
At the same time, the French Government is struggling with the value of the franc while trying to address a stubborn unemployment problem. And doubts are growing in many countries about the ability of the European Union to meet its goal of a single currency by the end of the decade.
"The key thing today is the shift from the French issues that had been dominating the market to what's going on in Italy," said Michael Pratten, senior bond and currency analyst at Paine Webber in London.
In that atmosphere, the mark has proved even more attractive than usual. The trend was strengthened last week by higher-than-expected money supply figures for September that cast some doubt on the ability of the Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany, to cut interest rates anytime soon.
"Political uncertainties have added to European stresses and those in Italy are foremost," said Kermit L. Schoenholz, an economist at Salomon Brothers in London.
The currency markets were also unsettled by reports in France that prosecutors had been asked to investigate whether President Jacques Chirac had used his influence while Mayor of Paris to insure that he could keep living in an apartment he rented from a city-subsidized real estate company. The French currency plunged briefly after the report and then recovered somewhat.

HEADLINE: Slain Girl Implicated in Family Deaths in Harlem

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

 BODY:
When a mother and her two children were found shot to death in their Harlem apartment early Friday, the crime seemed to be the horrifying work of cold-blooded robbers. When the police said yesterday that they had arrested two suspects, the horror was compounded.
Detectives said that one of the children, a teen-age girl, was actually an accomplice who let the killers into the apartment at 631 West 152d and then became a victim. The police said that she was bitterly angry at her domineering father and that she had hired the men to kill him. 
 Charged with murder, robbery and weapons possession were Lamar Sanchez, 18, of 3675 Broadway, and Jose Rodriguez, 24, of 3692 Broadway. Investigators said Mr. Sanchez was a former boyfriend of the girl, Arelis Batista, a senior at Mother Cabrini High School in Washington Heights, who had chafed under the discipline of her father, William Batista.
Investigators recovered more than $22,000 stolen from the victims' apartment and seized a .22-caliber, silencer-equipped rifle used in the execution-style slayings, said Charles Reuther, the New York Police Chief of Detectives.
The suspects were picked up early yesterday, one at his home and the other on a street, the authorities said. They said the rifle had been found in Riverside Park near 152d Street. The police declined to be specific on where the money had been recovered.
The announcement by the police, made even as mourners were gathering at St. Catherine of Genoa Roman Catholic Church on 153d Street near Amsterdam Avenue to honor the dead, seemed to numb those who thought they knew what had appeared to be a close-knit, religious family.
When William Batista arrived home early Saturday from his night-shift custodial job at a midtown hotel to find his wife, Marian; his son, William Jr., and his daughter dead, all signs pointed to robbery. The motive seemed obvious: someone knew that Mr. Batista, a 40-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, distrusted American banks so much that he kept more than $20,000 in the family apartment near Riverside Drive.
But the investigation soon led to Mr. Sanchez, and then to Mr. Rodriguez -- in part, the police said, because Arelis Batista had disappeared for three days last February and then returned home to tell her father of being kidnapped and sexually assaulted.
Chief Reuther said the police determined in February that the young woman's story was untrue and that she had gone to the police only under orders from her father. As the police were dissecting her story last winter, Mr. Sanchez's name surfaced, though Chief Reuther declined yesterday to say exactly how.
Chief Reuther said investigators believe that Ms. Batista let Mr. Sanchez into the apartment through her bedroom window about 1:30 A.M. on Friday, and that he let in Mr. Rodriguez through the front door. The original plan was for the two men, both unemployed, to wait for Mr. Batista to come home from his night job and then kill him, Mr. Reuther said.
Instead, the chief said, the two men decided to kill the people already in the apartment, and then they apparently fled around 5 A.M. with roughly $25,000 and a handgun, both found in a closet. Chief Reuther said investigators believe Mr. Sanchez first shot Arelis Batista with the rifle, then gave it to Mr. Rodriguez, who killed Mrs. Batista, 41, and her 15-year-old son as they slept.
Chief Reuther said Mr. Sanchez had no prior record and that Mr. Rodriguez had been arrested once before, for burglary and possession of a weapon. The disposition of those charges was not known yesterday.
The suspects were picked up by Detective Elpidio DeLeon of the 30th Precinct, Chief Reuther said.
The chief said Ms. Batista had longstanding grievances with her father, whom he described as "a strong parent with a very tight rein on his family." Jacqueline Gill, a 20-year-old cousin of Arelis Batista, said Mr. Batista did not want his daughter to date until she was 19 and that he even disapproved of makeup for teen-age girls.
But Ms. Gill said she could not believe that her cousin had plotted to kill her father. "It was just a normal strict-parent kind of relationship," Ms. Gill said. "That's why he sent her to an all-girls Catholic school."
After the slayings, the Rev. Robert Ritchie of St. Catherine of Genoa Church said that Mr. Batista's strong control was a reflection of his deep, religion-based love and his determination to shield his family from the everyday dangers of a rough neighborhood.
Last night, Father Ritchie said the suspects had sent flower arrangements -- one in the form of a heart, the other a mixed basket -- to the wake. It was not clear whether the flowers were sent as a macabre joke or contrition or both, but detectives took them away yesterday before about 150 mourners gathered at the church.
Later, Father Ritchie gathered with immediate relatives for a private prayer service. Late last night, the bodies were transported to Kennedy International Airport. Father Ritchie, Mr. Batista and other relatives were to accompany them to the Dominican Republic today for burial.
Residents of the neighborhood said Mr. Rodriguez was known as a troublemaker. "He carried a knife, a screwdriver, anything," said Carlos Romero, who said he had known the suspect for a long time. "You're not going to hear anything nice about him."

Czechs Get $140 Million From Stratton Venture

 BODY:
Michael D. Dingman, who won a reputation for building industrial conglomerates in the United States, has invested $140 million in Czech industrial companies and plans to install new managers to increase competitiveness. 
 With a new venture-capital company called Stratton Investments, Mr. Dingman will look for additional Czech investments as well as opportunities in Russia and other former Eastern bloc nations, said Daniel Arbess, who runs Stratton. So far, Stratton has invested in seven Czech companies, Mr. Arbess said. He declined to name them, adding that details would be disclosed after Stratton representatives met with the companies' managements. (Bloomberg Business News)

HEADLINE: Lottery for the Arts: Over the Rainbow Or Under a Cloud?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Imagine a world in which Government support for the arts added not a penny to the deficit, one in which profits from a wildly popular form of entertainment produced a torrent of cash for dance, theater and music. No, it's not some culture vulture's idea of what lies beyond the pearly gates. It's Britain today, where 5 percent of the revenue from the new national lottery -- roughly $10 million a week -- is dedicated to fine arts.
Could a lottery do for the United States what it is doing for hundreds of British arts organizations ranging from the Sydenham School of Dance ($450) to the Covent Garden Opera House ($75 million)? Getting from here to there would take a remarkable job of political salesmanship in a country where 36 states, dozens of Indian tribes and Donald Trump are already scrapping over the last morsels from legal gambling. 
 But with the National Endowment for the Arts slated to lose 40 percent of its appropriation next year and the squeeze already showing in cuts that will halve the endowment's personnel by the end of the 1995, the idea is beginning to stir interest. "It's one of a handful of ideas we're mulling to take arts funding out of budget politics," explained a Clinton Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Special tax incentives for private donations to the arts have been discussed, as has the notion of allowing arts groups to issue bonds whose interest would be exempt from Federal taxation. But both are potential revenue-losers, with little support in Congress. Another idea, initially raised by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, is to auction off extended copyright privileges. But powerful interests, notably the film studios, are on the verge of persuading Congress to extend the current copyright protection of life-plus-50 years to match the new European Community standard, life-plus-70 years. And they have no wish to share the windfall with arts groups.
That leaves the lottery, which at least on first look would appear to be a gold mine.
Britain has long countenanced legal gambling but kept it low key. So last fall, when the country's Conservative leaders finally blessed a weekly televised lottery with the odds of winning set at 1 in 14 million, it hit a gusher of untapped demand. "The Government was shocked by how popular the lottery was," said William Eadington, director of the University of Nevada's Institute for the Study of Gambling.
Half the proceeds go back to bettors tax free as lump-sum prizes. A bit less than a quarter goes to the private corporation called Camelot, which manages the monopoly and the retail vendors that sell the 1 tickets. The rest is divided among five funds dedicated to organized charity, promotion of sports, preservation of historic sites, celebration of the millennium and, of course, subsidies to arts groups.
Since the lottery is doing better than expected, so are the arts. Government spending, which was already $300 million a year, generous by comparison with the United States, may reach double that this year. And while the arts world, or some of it, is apparently embarrassed about the source, it is not about to turn down the riches. John Mortimer, the novelist and creator of "Rumpole," called the lottery "the final, typical nail in the coffin of this horrible regime," then retracted when he was reminded that, as chairman of the Royal Court Theater, he had applied for a lottery grant.
If Congress chose to emulate Britain, says Petert would no doubt draw billions of dollars in revenue. "The big prizes would be irresistible," he argues.
A national lottery could probably operate with lower costs than existing state lotteries. The latest technology would permit direct sale by telephone, bypassing small stores that now punch out state lottery tickets. "If L. L. Bean can sell hiking boots by phone, you can sell lottery tickets by phone," said Charles Clotfelter, an economist at Duke University.
But the mechanics would be the least of the worries of those seeking to operate a high-stakes national lottery in the name of high culture. One big problem is that states have grown increasingly dependent on lottery revenue and rightly fear they would be cannibalized. Last year, the 36 states with lotteries raised 3.2 percent of their total revenues from "painless" lottery wagering. Massachusetts and the District of Columbia both topped $100 in profit per resident. South Dakota, which prides itself on low taxes and ubiquitous gambling opportunities, raised 11 percent of all state revenue from the lottery. "There would be bitter opposition from the states," Mr. Eadington, the Nevada researcher, concluded.
Then, too, there is the issue of principled opposition. While most states have succumbed to the lure of legal gambling, conspicuous holdouts include Utah and most of the rural South. Add to that opposition from those secular humanists who see lotteries as both an unfair tax on the poor and an incitement to compulsive gambling.
Even if fans of a national lottery overwhelm their opponents, supporters of the arts would still have to scramble for a share of the booty. In 1949, the last time a national lottery was seriously proposed, the proceeds were supposed to be dedicated to veterans benefits. This time, a dozen causes from AIDS research to the homeless would doubtless compete.
In Britain, the Arts Council's decision to pour millions of pounds of lottery proceeds into the Royal Opera House drew scathing commentary from politicians and press. "This is a strange country," Jeremy Isaacs, the director of the Opera House, told The Guardian. "People don't understand that it's by a kind of miracle that the curtain goes up here every night."
Americans may not be as primed for class warfare as the British, but they are surely even readier to do battle over icons of cultural identity such as religion, the flag and four-letter words. Hence disposition of the profits from a Government-run monopoly would draw scrutiny from conservative lawmakers like Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, even though the money never showed up in the Federal budget.
Britain's experience suggests another reason for caution. While the arts have been a clear financial winner in the lotteries, directors of the brand-name charities are still holding their breaths. They worry that the millions guaranteed from the lottery will undermine private giving. By the same token, it would not take a very large decline in private philanthropy to offset the gains to the arts from a national lottery in America. After all, any conceivable amount funneled from some future lottery would be small compared to the gifts from foundations, corporations and individuals that now support the arts.
All this suggests that a national lottery for the arts would be a hard sell, even to champions of the Federal support for the arts, like Representative Sidney R. Yates, Democrat of Illinois. "I'm intrigued," Mr. Yates allowed, "but I'm opposed."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 4, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article on Oct. 24 about a proposed arts lottery in the United States misstated the fee received by the company that manages the British one. The company, Camelot, splits 25 percent of the proceeds with the Government; it does not receive slightly less than 25 percent.

HEADLINE: Labor Adopts a Symbol: The Sun (a Rising One)

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Wherever delegates to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention go around their midtown Manhattan hotel this week, they are surrounded by the bright yellow rays of the rising sun, emblazoned on T-shirts, silk-screened onto placards and printed on campaign literature.
The rays have been adopted as the campaign symbol of John J. Sweeney, the president of the Service Employees International Union, who promises to rejuvenate the labor movement if he wins the presidency of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations in balloting today. 
 To many of the 1,020 delegates, the rays have become the embodiment of their outlook for the movement itself, a signal that the federation appears to be waking from a long slumber during which it hardly raised a finger as unions were bulldozed by management and whipsawed by economic change.
"There is a sense of change in the air," Ray M. Figueroa, president of the Southern Arizona Central Labor Council, said during a recess at the convention, the first in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s history that has ever featured a contested presidential election. "It's history in the making."
Regardless of whether Mr. Sweeney or his opponent, Thomas R. Donahue, the federation's interim president, wins the election, their hard-fought campaign has injected some new energy and focus into the languishing movement. Mr. Sweeney has vowed to shake up the 13-million-member federation and turn it into an aggressive vehicle for organizing, and Mr. Donahue, notwithstanding his 16 years as the federation's No. 2 official, vows to do likewise.
"Now we're expecting new movement in the labor movement," said Ken Moss, a 6-foot-5-inch union official from Minnesota with shoulder-length blond hair. It was lunchtime, and he was standing outside the Sheraton New York Hotel, the site of the convention, along with dozens of other delegates, basking in unusually warm autumn weather.
Many union members fear that unless the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new head makes good on promises to build a more aggressive federation, the sun's rays will come to symbolize not a rising sun but a setting one. But this time around, union officials insist, the lofty oratory about recharging the movement will not prove empty. They promise to follow up with action, acknowledging that the debate between the Sweeney and Donahue camps has provided some healthy self-criticism.
Mary Lyons, a delegate from Oregon representing the United Food and Commercial Workers, has no illusions that labor's task will be easy. "We're going to have the same big problems as before," she said. "We still have to deal with American corporations and American politicians who aren't taking care of working people."
Sitting in the convention hall yesterday waiting for a Donahue-Sweeney debate to begin, Ms. Lyons was wearing a white shirt with Mr. Donahue's name in big letters. The shirt appeared lonely: it was engulfed in a sea of hundreds of red T-shirts proclaiming support for Mr. Sweeney.
Given all his years in the labor federation, Mr. Donahue is supposed to have plenty of expertise in organizing. But it has been clear this week that the Sweeney forces out-organized him hands down. In addition to their catchy red T-shirts, saying "A New Voice for American Workers," the Sweeney backers carried hundreds of orange campaign placards and wore orange windbreakers with the word "Change" on the back.
Adrift in a sea of Sweeney red, Ms. Lyons and other pro-Donahue delegates appeared all but beaten, although Mr. Donahue's campaign aides insisted that he could still pull a rabbit out of his hat to win.
From the jeers on the convention floor and the arguments in the hall, there was no denying that the presidential campaign had driven a wedge, at least for the time being, into any notion of labor solidarity.
Assuming their traditional role as eternal optimists, many union leaders said they were confident that once the election was over, solidarity would reign once more.
"Things are extremely tense right now," said Edward J. Tynes, who represented the Southwest Georgia Labor Council and wore a "Boot Newt" button. "But once we get outside of this convention hall, solidarity will be there."
Not everyone was so sure. Having invested so much energy and resources into one candidate or the other, many national union leaders accustomed to getting their way will no doubt be fuming come Wednesday.
"There are going to be some deep wounds on the national level," Ms. Lyons said. "There's going to have to be a lot of healing."

Sweeney's campaign for A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, have now become the embodiment of many labor delegates' outlook for the movement itself. Mr. Sweeney is expected to topple Thomas R. Donahue in an election today. (Associated Press)

HEADLINE: CONGRESS TO OPEN BUDGET BILL VOTES FOR 1996 SPENDING

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Starting Wednesday, Congress will begin voting on the huge budget bills that will give Republicans the chance to prove they mean their promises to change the way Government works -- most of all by balancing the Federal budget by the year 2002.
Until this week, action on the budget has consisted of high-sounding resolutions, the defeat of a constitutional amendment requiring balance and energetic but inconclusive efforts to reduce the level of spending in the annual bills that finance Government agencies. Only 3 of those 13 measures have made their way to the White House. 
 But the big budget reconciliation bills -- 1,949 pages in the Senate version and 1,754 in the House -- promise a balanced budget with curbs on spending for programs available to all those entitled and thus hard to control, like Medicare, Medicaid, student loans and farm programs. The total package is sweetened by a $245 billion tax cut.
Speaker Newt Gingrich said the measure would put the nation "back on the right moral track."
"In peacetime," he continued, "you shouldn't borrow your children's money," adding in a brief interview that the legislation was "an important trust-building step" because the Republicans had promised the public a balanced budget, "and we're going to give it to them."
Mr. Gingrich said the budget votes would also establish that "Washington has to live within its means, set priorities and actually manage its resources." Moreover, he said, there would be a "balanced budget dividend" from the lower interest rates that would result, for individuals, in savings of as much as $37,000 in mortgage interest on a typical house or $700 on a new car loan.
But before debate and votes can begin on Wednesday in the Senate and on Thursday in the House, those huge bills remain subject to last-minute tinkering on everything from Medicaid formulas to milk subsidies.
Those efforts were intended to solidify Republican majorities. Republicans can afford to lose no more than 3 of their 53 senators and 16 of their 233 Representatives for the final votes, which are planned for Thursday in the House and Friday in the Senate.
But there was also a tentative air about this week's votes. Once passed, these bills will amount to a Republican statement. Nothing voted on this week can become law without agreement from the Clinton Administration, which has regularly issued veto threats. Ultimately some sort of negotiation must take place.
Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, focused on that goal today when he said that a Democratic amendment to preserve Medicaid, the health program for the poor, the disabled and the elderly in nursing homes, would be defeated this week, but "The principal contribution of this will be in Round 2 -- after the veto."
Instead of turning the Federal-state program over to the states as a block grant and curbing spending by $182 million over seven years, as the Republican bills would do, the Democratic plan would merely slow its rate of growth by about $60 billion.
There was also a familiar note in the promise to balance the budget -- something that has not been accomplished since 1969. Congress has tried before, but Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Senate Budget Committee, heatedly told reporters that this year's budget reconciliation bills were different because they took on the entitlement programs with their intense political constituencies.
"In this reconciliation bill, the major entitlements are changed by law," he said. Referring to a 1985 Congressional effort to curb spending and get on a path to a balanced budget, he said: "Gramm-Rudman was a process. This is actually a law."
The Medicare plan, voted on separately by the House last week, is included in this bill. So are the House and Senate versions of the welfare bill, on which a House-Senate conference began today. Reublicans would rather pass the welfare bill on its own, but it is included in the filibuster-proof reconciliation bill as insurance.
Democrats do not dream of defeating either the House or Senate versions of the bill. But the Senate amendments can either influence a final settlement, or at least, form the basis for television advertisements with which to accuse particular Republicans who vote against the amendments of hard-heartedness. The Democrats also offered general denunciations today. On all sides, they complained about reductions in the Earned Income Tax Credit, a benefit for the working poor.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said the Republican bill was suitable for the Halloween season. "The wealthy get treated to huge tax cuts they don't even need," he said, "while middle-class families get tricked out of hundreds of dollars they desperately need to survive."
Senator Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate minority leader, ridiculed the title of the bill, saying "The term 'reconciliation' is bit of a misnomer this year because the only differences being reconciled are between the far-right and the farther-right." He complained that Democrats had been "locked out" of the effort to draft a bill.
When the House considers the bill on Thursday, the only amendment likely to be in order will be a substitute proposed by a group of 22 conservative and moderate Democrats who style themselves "the Coalition."
They would also reach a balanced budget, but their plan includes no tax cut, reduces the growth of Medicare by $170 billion over seven years instead of by $270 billion, shaves $84 billiion instead of $182 billion from Medicaid and reduces the Consumer Price Index by half a percentage point in order to slow the growth of cost of living allowances.
Their symbolic proposal will not command solid Democratic support. Mr. Gephardt said today he would vote against it.
If the Senate meets its schedule and passes the bill by the weekend, it is still likely to take at least two weeks for a House-Senate conference to reach a deal between Republicans in the two houses. That would leave final passage, a veto by President Clinton and any negotiations that follow all to be accomplished by mid-November, when legislation authorizing the current national debt level expires.
The only talk of negotiations today came when Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said at a news conference that he and Mr. Gingrich hoped that Mr. Clinton would follow through on last week's statement that balancing the budget in seven years was now acceptable to him and send them a proposal.
In New York, Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said, "I think the President would prefer that the majority leader and the Speaker get to work on the budget, rather than hold constant press conferences."

HEADLINE: Stocks Stage a Comeback, With the Dow Rising 28.18 Points

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Major stock averages rose yesterday for the first time in three days, with large-capitalization and transportation issues sharing the spotlight.
"It was primarily a fairly impressive performance by the blue chips," said Ricky Harrington, senior vice president at Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. "First there was a bond market rally, and then stocks followed." 
 Bonds climbed after comments by Alan S. Blinder, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, indicated that the Fed might cut interest rates soon. The 30-year Treasury bond jumped almost a full percentage point, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.32 percent from 6.39 percent on Monday.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.18 points, to 4,783.66, erasing more than half of Monday's fall. In addition, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 1.50 points, to 586.56, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 2.32 points, to 1,039.24.
The Dow Jones transportation index soared 45.99 points, to 1,949.08. The 2.4 percent gain was its largest one-day spurt since the middle of July. A surge in the third-quarter profits of UAL, the parent company for United Airlines, led the way, and the stock gained 4 1/4, to 175.
But in contrast to the recent pattern where better-than-expected earnings reports have generally affected the issuing company, but not its sector, the euphoria over UAL spilled over to other transportation stocks.
The recently merged Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the nation's largest railway, surged 5 7/8, to 82 3/4, after it announced that its revenue growth would exceed the growth in the economy. Other railroads also gained. CSX rose 1 3/4, to 83 1/2; Norfolk Southern increased 2 1/4, to 77 7/8, and Union Pacific advanced 5/8, to 66 1/4.
Airborne Freight reported a profit dip, but its earnings were still stronger than analysts had expected and the stock surged 2 1/8, to 26 1/4.
Declines narrowly topped advances on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,165 to 1,110. Volume on the Big Board spurted to 415.5 million shares from 330.8 million shares Monday.
"It is unusual that there were more declining stocks than advancing stocks on a day when bonds were so strong," Mr. Harrington said. "This shows the continuing divergence between the averages and the market breadth."
Bargain-hunters were selective yesterday in picking their stocks and chose many of the issues in the Dow. The biggest contributors to the gain in the index were Procter & Gamble, up 2 7/8, to 88 3/4; Aluminum Company of America, up 2, to 50 3/8, and Eastman Kodak, up 2, to 63 7/8.
Others included Caterpillar, up 1 1/2, to 54 3/8; International Paper, up 5/8, to 37 1/8, and Boeing, up3/8 to 66 7/8.
Drug shares also turned higher after Pfizer said that it expected new drugs to help its earnings growth through the year 2000. Pfizer closed at 60 7/8, up 1 3/8; Merck closed at 60 3/8, up 7/8; and Schering-Plough closed at 54 3/4, up 1 3/8.
In yesterday's choppy market environment, however, bank stocks, which had been moving up on merger activity and speculation, were subjected to profit-taking. Chase Manhattan fell 2 3/8, to 58 3/8; Chemical Banking dropped 2 3/8, to 57; BankAmerica declined 1 3/8, to 62 3/4, and Nationsbank slipped 1 3/8, to 69 3/8.
Some technology stocks, a group that had long been a market leader, were weak. I.B.M., which announced after the close plans to sell $750 million of bonds, closed at 98, down 1. Texas Instruments closed at 70 1/8, down 1 1/8, and Micron Technology closed at 71 1/4, down 2 3/8.
Also finishing on the downside were some tobacco stocks, after RJR Nabisco told analysts in a conference call that its earnings for the 1995 fourth quarter and 1996 were expected to be below estimates. RJR declined 2 5/8, to 29 1/4, and American Brands dropped 1/8, to 41 1/4.

A Wistful Little Land Savors World Stage

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Just outside the fanfare that surrounded the United Nations with a womb of security on Sunday, the Foreign Minister from the tiny nation of Bhutan sat unnoticed at a booth in a coffee shop at 48th Street and First Avenue. He had a cup of Lipton tea and no armed guard.
Dawa Tsering, the Foreign Minister and the official representative of the world's last remaining Himalayan Buddhist kingdom, said he had not been able to meditate much during the weekend. Because King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, Precious Ruler of the Dragon People, had not made the trip to the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, the 60-year-old official had taken part in all the ceremonies and receptions and handshake lines. 
 Now, Mr. Tsering was silently refining his speech to the United Nations General Assembly. That he was 171st in a line of 178 national representatives scheduled to speak late yesterday evening didn't embarrass him. That the anniversary would be essentially over and the United Nations all but empty did not trouble him. For Bhutan, the world stage was fine anytime.
"The big nations of the world could do without the United Nations," Mr. Tsering said. "But without the United Nations, Bhutan would have no voice. Bhutan today exists on the razor's edge. Our culture is at risk. We could disappear. The speech is serious."
When it was Mr. Tsering's turn to address the General Assembly last night, he followed leaders from other small, developing nations and actually spoke before a surprisingly large crowd. He called for the broadening of the Security Council to represent more than just the "privileged few." For Mr. Tsering, his speech was the final act in the dramatic experience of an obscure country caught up in the spectacle of sober geopolitics and smiling photo ops amid suffocating security and state dinners. Certainly, Mr. Tsering cut his own distinctive figure in the mix of egos and agendas and armored motorcades.
Often dressed in his country's traditional clothing -- a kimono-like knee-length wrap called a kho -- Mr. Tsering moved through the three days modestly and without concern about security or traffic. He spent his nights at a colleague's apartment on 34th Street, often walked to the United Nations, and chose to ride courtesy buses through Manhattan when attending the functions hosted by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani or President Clinton. Sometimes, he opted for a dark suit, including when he made his speech last night, and with his eyeglasses and moustache he could easily have been mistaken for a professor from Columbia who had wandered downtown.
"Sometimes people gawk at my traditional clothes," said Mr. Tsering. "We don't like to be made a spectacle of."
Inside the institutional politics of the United Nations, Bhutan has gained notice and rank. Ugyen Tshering, Bhutan's representative to the United Nations, is chairman of the General Assembly's committee for human rights and social programs.
More importantly, programs financed by the United Nations's health, education and economic branches have been vital to the country of 600,000 that is pinched between China and India. In Bhutan, where tantric Tibetan Buddhism is the official religion, the King is attempting the delicate trick of transforming a medieval monarchy into a more democratic government without disrupting tradition or creating chaos. As part of that, the country has become a laboratory for experts helping build a money economy from scratch.
And so in a country once sealed from the rest of the world, one that 30 years ago didn't have roads or schools or currency, Mr. Tsering said the United Nations is the reason 90 percent of the children are immunized, and thousands of students have gone abroad. He said the United Nations could be critical in assisting Bhutan with the growing problem of illegal immigration and ethnic unrest among the Nepalese population in the country's south.
"Cultures throughout the world are being watered down," said Mr. Tsering. "Without our identity, we cease to exist."
For the international media and many of the world's political bigshots, Bhutan existed this weekend as a name on a list. That didn't trouble Mr. Tsering. Mr. Tsering, who was educated by Jesuit missionaries in India, attended the dinner at the World Financial Center on Saturday night, meeting the President of the Maldives and the Vice President of Uruguay.
"I found out Uruguay had three million people and 10 million cows," Mr. Tsering said after dashing across Fifth Avenue in his kho late Saturday night. "It was very educational."
It wasn't painless, though.
"Speeches are the price we pay for events like this," he said. "In that sense, there are no free dinners."
Mr. Tsering made it safely to the group photo of world leaders taken Sunday, tucked in the second to last row, but dead center. Later that day, he held several private meetings with leaders from South Korea and other Asian nations. He said he found President Clinton's speech "ordinary," but Fidel Castro's "passionate."
"Castro is a real folk hero, maybe the last one left," he said.
Sunday night, Mr. Tsering waited for hours at the Carlyle Hotel before his bus set off for Mr. Clinton's cocktail party at the New York Public Library.
"I got to the moment when I shook hands with the President and the First Lady, and I suppose I was supposed to just move on," said Mr. Tsering. "But I figured -- why not? -- to try and engage them in conversation. It had been a long wait. I asked the First Lady if she had seen the Bhutanese fabric exhibit that had been at the Smithsonian Institution. She said she hadn't. That was it."
The Foreign Minister never did find much time for meditating. He did stop by to see the Tibetan hunger strikers at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza. He took in Nelson Mandela's address. And always, he was thinking of his speech, rewriting it in his head.
"The ability to revise is one of the benefits of going so close to last," said Mr. Tsering.
Later, he smiled about it all.
"Look, we don't have global issues, and we don't lose sight of our position in the world," he said. "But we don't feel left out, either. For Bhutan, the United Nations is alot more than window dressing. There was an air of history about these days."

Clinton Has Dinner And Cars Go Missing

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
This wasn't exactly LAX being shut down for the Presidential coif aboard Air Force One, but some residents of the Upper West Side awoke yesterday morning to feel the aftereffects of President Clinton's dinner on Monday night.
To make the area around Cafe des Artistes safe for the First Eater, cars were towed from legal parking spaces on 67th Street near Central Park West and parked elsewhere in the neighborhood. The street was heavily secured before the President's arrival, and residents who wanted to go home had to show identification containing their address or be escorted to their apartments by police officers. Shortly before the President arrived, a city street sweeper cleaned 67th Street. 
 When residents found that their cars were gone yesterday morning, they were directed to a police barricade near Central Park where they were directed to their cars.
Mike Tarr, a Secret Service spokesman, said yesterday that his agency had asked the police to move "several" cars "to facilitate the arrival of the Presidential motorcade," adding that if it caused any inconvenience, "we certainly apologize."
Neither the police nor transportation officials could say how many cars were towed, but a resident of the block said the tow trucks were working for hours.
Oh yes, the dinner. Mr. Clinton dined with nine other people, including Susan Thomases, a family friend; Bruce Lindsay, the deputy White House counsel, and Harold Ickes, the deputy White House chief of staff. Mr. Clinton had dined at the restaurant when he visited New York as Governor of Arkansas, but he had never eaten there as President, according to the restaurant's owner, George Lang.
The President order grilled quail served on a bed of caramelized apples macerated in Calvados. He was seen using pumpernickel bread to sop up the juice. (Who could blame him?)
But Mr. Clinton was out yesterday morning running it off in Central Park. Regular joggers there found him and his security detail running around the Reservoir and joined in. Mary Fortuna, an East Side resident, was about to begin her morning run when "all of a sudden I saw Bill Clinton running by me, and a man said, 'Come on, you want to run with the President?' "
Mr. Clinton, it seems, was such a fast runner that Ms. Fortuna could not keep up with him.
 
 
Hunger Striker Hospitalized
 On Oct. 14, six Tibetans began a hunger strike across from the United Nations, vowing to refrain from eating until the international bodies recognized that Tibet is occupied by China and took steps to return Tibet to control by the Dalai Lama. They said that if they died, other Tibetans were ready to take their places.
Late yesterday afternoon, one of the strikers was taken to Bellevue Hospital after doctors determined that she was seriously ill and unable to decide for herself whether she needed treatment, said Heidi Melz, a program director with the Office of Tibet, which represents the Dalai Lama in the Americas. The striker was identified only as Yiga, 35, a Minneapolis woman.
The protesters have been lying on futons in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, at 47th Street and First Avenue, wearing wool caps and covered with blankets. Yesterday, other Tibetans were chanting slogans like "Free Tibet" and "China Out Of Tibet" behind the strikers, and monks prayed over them.
Ms. Melz said there had been no response to the hunger strike by United Nations officials or world leaders attending the General Assembly session.
 
 
Castro-Watching
 For those stargazers who get their kicks by spotting big-time political leaders, President Fidel Castro of Cuba has been a hot item this week.
But the Fatigued One had his own bout of celebrity fever Monday night, when he went to Jimmy's Bronx Cafe to speak to some Puerto Rican business leaders, many of whom favor lifting the economic embargo against Cuba. When Mr. Castro arrived at the banquet room, he was seated at a side table out of the view of the audience. At the next table he spotted Willie Colon, the internationally known salsa musician who lives in Westchester County.
"Willie!" Mr. Castro said with the fervor of a fan at a rock concert, and broke into a wide smile. The two embraced in a bear hug.
Mr. Castro continued making his rounds yesterday. He was given a lunch by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the Daily News publisher, who said he had made several trips to Cuba in the last year and had held almost 50 hours of conversations with the Cuban President. The lunch, at Mr. Zuckerman's Fifth Avenue apartment, was attended by other media notables like Mike Wallace, Peter Jennings, William Safire and Barbara Walters.
Answering questions through a translator, Mr. Castro said that he was not afraid of facing an opponent in an election, but that such elections were not part of his country's political system. He described Cuba as "an Athenian democracy but without plebeians and without slaves."
He said he considered President Jimmy Carter "a courageous" man, though he said he was not having the same experience with Mr. Clinton. But he added: "I look at Clinton with respect, and I tell you that sincerely. He seems to be a good person."
He said his greatest accomplishment was "survival" in the face of "the greatest power in the world." He described Cuba's relationship with the United States in David-and-Goliath terms -- except, he said, "we do not have a slingshot."
He held out little hope of improved relations. He said that given the demands being made by the United States, "we have no steps to take except to give up." He said he wondered why the United States could not have ties with Cuba when it has relations with Vietnam and China.
At one point in the lunch, Mr. Castro, who is known for his long speeches, was being questioned by John McLaughlin, the rapid-fire talk show host. "You're a journalist," Mr. Castro scolded. "But you don't let me speak."

Fees for guests who check out of their rooms early may become standard for the hotel industry.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
CORPORATE travel departments are not going to like it, but Westin and Hyatt hotels have decided to charge guests who check out one or more days ahead of schedule.
Hyatt's policy, with a $50 fee limit, is expected to be in effect by the end of the year at all 103 of its hotels in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, a Hyatt spokeswoman said, and is already in effect at some properties, including those in Denver; Kansas City, Mo.; Milwaukee; Minneapolis; New Orleans, and Orlando, Fla., as well as the Grand Hyatt Washington. 
 Beginning Jan. 1, Westin will impose a $50 fee at about 40 of the 80 properties that bear its name and that it manages. It has been experimenting with various fees at hotels in Boston; Orlando; Houston; Hilton Head, S.C., and Mission Hills, Calif. Until the end of the year, its Peachtree Plaza hotel in Atlanta and Cypress Creek hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., will continue to charge a full day's rate for an early departure.
Hilton Hotels, ITT Sheraton, the Carlson Corporation's Radisson, and Marriott said they had no plans to charge for early departures.
"Market conditions are improving," said Don Welsh, vice president of sales and marketing for Westin, "and we're prepared to say there's a two-way relationship between the hotel and its guests."
Other hoteliers agree that with occupancy running at record levels in New York, Phoenix and elsewhere, guests who check out before the agreed-upon date of departure make it difficult if not impossible to sell their room. (While every hotel has some walkup traffic, most rooms are booked days in advance.)
Mr. Welsh and other hoteliers liken early departures to airline no-shows. And a hotelier, whose company does not charge a checkout fee, predicted that if early departure fees succeeded they would become the industry standard.
Meanwhile, business and leisure travelers alike may wonder whether the economic health of the hotel industry isn't improving partly at their expense. Rates are beginning to inch up. And whereas many hotels have for months imposed fees for failure to cancel guaranteed reservations at least 72 hours before arrival, they are now starting to cancel nonguaranteed reservations unless guests check in by 4 P.M., instead of the usual 6 P.M. deadline.
 
Frequent-Flier Update
Sabena and El Al Israel are the latest two airlines to join the American Express frequent-flier program, together with Hertz, Budget and National rental cars. At the same time, the program -- which awards one "point" or mile for every dollar charged to American Express and Optima cards -- added 16 shopping and 9 food partners. These include Nordic Track, Waldenbooks and Saks Fifth Avenue, along with K-Paul's Louisiana Mail Order and Windsor Vineyards. To reflect the broadened focus, American Express has changed the program's name from Membership Miles to Membership Rewards.
Still, frequent-flier miles remain the heart of the American Express program, whose other airlines partners are Delta, USAir, Continental, Southwest, Austrian, Aeromexico and Mexicana.
While a free round trip between the United States and Brussels on Sabena requires 80,000 "points," and between the United States and Tel Aviv on El Al requires 98,000, spokeswomen for both carriers said the real advantage of their affiliation with American Express was not necessarily to accumulate enough points to earn a free round-trip ticket. More likely, they say, it is to enable Membership Rewards travelers to transfer their points into Sabena's and El Al's own frequent-flier programs to earn upgrades or to get the remaining miles necessary to qualify for a free flight.
Moreover, Sabena, which is also a member of the Delta and USAir awards programs, said it expected that some people would buy tickets to fly between the United States and Brussels, and then, for example, use the 16,000 Membership Rewards points necessary to fly between Brussels and London or Paris.
For El Al, there is another dimension. "We have no other partners in our frequent-flier program," said Sheryl Stein of El Al, "so this represents an important expansion for our passengers and our airline."
 
Food for Thought
Flying over Chincoteague, Va., last Thursday evening, the pilot of Continental Airlines flight 693 from Newark to Orlando, Fla., not only pointed out the island to passengers but expounded at some length on the annual wild horse auction for which the island is famed. He ended by recommending "Misty of Chincoteague," the 1947 novel by Marguerite Henry, "even though it's a children's book."
At the conclusion of the travelogue-cum-book-review, a middle-aged passenger in economy class looked up from his Forbes magazine and -- in apparent reference to the snack served on what in times past would have been a dinner flight -- said to his seat mate, "Airlines no longer feed you, but at least on this flight you get food for thought."

HEADLINE: Governments Bypassing Banks to Pool Money in Fund

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
Francie M. Heller was a school administrator in Ossining, N.Y., in the mid-1980's when she realized that school districts like hers might be better off pooling their spare cash with other districts rather than following the traditional paths of buying securities on their own or relying on local banks.
But rather than trying to promote the idea from within her school district, Ms. Heller decided to peddle her proposal to Wall Street on her own. In 1987, she landed at Bear Stearns, which sold her new business four years later to MBIA Inc., the municipal bond insurance company in Armonk, N.Y. 
 "A lot of people thought I was nuts to give up the security of the school district job," she said, "but I just knew that I couldn't get this idea off the ground working within the school system."
Today, Ms. Heller manages $1.2 billion for 371 local government entities in New York, from tiny fire departments to large counties. And her business at MBIA is thriving to such an extent that bankers, who are accustomed to handling nearly all the $10 billion to $15 billion that local governments in New York hold at any one time in short-term investments, are pushing for new state laws that would eliminate competition from people like Ms. Heller.
Her idea was to create a new kind of mutual fund for local governments, using state rules that allow these government units to form a cooperative for making investments, in much the same way as they cooperate in buying everything from school supplies to insurance.
Like millions of individuals and businesses who now keep $746 billion in money market funds rather than in bank accounts or other investments, many local governments and school districts are finding that this mutual-fund approach suits their needs. The government clients of MBIA have earned a higher interest rate than on bank deposits -- a difference of $25 million last year, MBIA said. And they avoided nearly $13 million in transaction fees, according to the MBIA Investor Service Corporation, which runs the fund. MBIA charges an annual fee of four-tenths of a percentage point, but still managed to offer a rate of more than 6 percent in recent months, compared with barely more than 2 percent available from most banks on interest-bearing checking accounts.
"I have a responsibility to our taxpayers to earn as much as I can on our investments, and most of the time the fund pays more than the banks," said Kenneth F. Smith, assistant superintendent in the Briarcliff Manor Free School District. Frances G. Wills, superintendent at Briarcliff, noted that without the $230,000 of interest earned last year from the investment pool, the district's local property tax bills would have been 2 percent higher.
In the wake of the debacle in Orange County, Calif., where $1.7 billion was lost by an investment fund run by county officials, local governments have taken a second look at how they handle their temporary investments. But MBIA invests in short-term securities -- either Treasuries or others backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal Government.
Local bankers acknowledge that Ms. Heller, like other money market managers, pays a higher interest rate than banks, but they point out that banks provide a host of financial services not available elsewhere.
"Local governments have some horrendous problems on the budget side, so they need to look at every source of revenue," said Charles V. Wait, chief executive at the Adirondack Trust Company in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. "But they need to remember that when they move their deposits somewhere else, I have that much less money available to lend on a new car or a mortgage."
Indeed, Mr. Wait, like many other bankers in New York, is supporting legislation proposed by State Senator William J. Larkin Jr., a Republican from New Windsor, to curb competitors like MBIA. Hearings are scheduled today in Newburgh for both sides to air their views.
Beyond their complaint that banks no longer have as much money to lend locally, bankers argue that funds like MBIA's enjoy an unfair advantage. They are allowed to pool investments in Government securities, while banks are at a disadvantage because they are required to back each local government deposit with specific securities worth 100 percent or more of the deposit.
"It is a case where a very mature industry, banking, is being bypassed through an investment vehicle that is not what the law contemplated," said Michael Smith, executive director of the New York State Bankers Association. Mr. Smith said the bankers had tried to level the playing field by asking lawmakers to allow them to pool their securities used as backing for local government deposits. But failing that, they are now seeking to curb the MBIA fund by not allowing pooling of its investments.
Some banking companies, however, have found a way to join MBIA rather than trying to beat it. Fleet Financial Group of Providence, R.I., has started to offer its own investment fund -- apart from the deposits its banks handle -- in Maine, Connecticut and Rhode Island, and it plans to expand into New York.
"We sympathize with the bankers' complaints about unfair competition," said John B. Robinson, a managing director at Fleet, "but realistically it will be difficult to change things because local governments like the MBIA product and the extra interest they are earning with it."

HEADLINE: Outline of the Republican Proposals on the Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

 BODY:
The mammoth budget bills before the Senate and the House of Representatives this week follow the same themes, although they differ somewhat on the margins. These are the main elements:
TAXES Taxes would be reduced by $245 billion over seven years. Most families would get a tax cut of $500 a child. The tax rate on capital gains would be lowered, eligibility for individual retirement accounts would be expanded, the marriage tax penalty would be lessened and a tax credit would be allowed to offset some adoption expenses. The Senate would allow a tax credit for part of the interest on student loans. The House would abolish the alternative minimum tax. 
 MEDICARE Spending for the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled would be $270 billion less over the next seven years than it would be without the changes. Payments to hospitals and doctors would be reduced, monthly premiums would be raised and inducements offered to encourage beneficiaries to move from the Government program into private insurance coverage.
MEDICAID To save $182 billion over seven years, the measures would give the states a reduced sum of money annually for health coverage for the poor and allow each state to decide what benefits to offer. Federal standards for nursing homes would be eliminated. The Senate and House use different formulas to decide how the money would be allotted among the states. The Senate, but not the House, would require states to cover pregnant women, children 12 and under and poor disabled people.
WELFARE The 60-year-old Federal commitment to provide subsistence payments to poor children and their parents would be ended. The program of Aid to Families With Dependent Children would be turned over to the states along with a reduced appropriation. Each state would decide how much the benefits would be and who would get them. Most recipients would be required to work within two years of going on welfare, and families would generally become ineligible for welfare after five years. Child care programs would also be administered by the states. Food stamps would continue as a Federal program, but benefits would be reduced. The House would deny funds to unwed teen-age mothers and children born to welfare recipients. The Senate would allow the states to withhold benefits from those people.
EARNED-INCOME TAX CREDIT Eligibility for this program, which lowers the taxes of low-income workers and in some cases gives them cash benefits, would be tightened, and benefits would be reduced. The cuts in the Senate bill are much deeper than those in the House.
STUDENT LOANS The interest subsidy students can get for the first six months after graduation would be abolished. The interest rate on loans to parents would be raised. The House would abolish and the Senate would limit direct loans by the Government. The Senate would require schools to pay a fee for each student with a Federally guaranteed loans.
ENVIRONMENT The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska would be opened to oil exploration, and mining would be expanded on Federal lands. The House would raise the fee ranchers pay for grazing on Federal land. The Senate would increase the entrance fees at national parks.
AGRICULTURE The House bill would overhaul the basic farm programs that have been in existence since the Depression, and replace them with large, slowly declining cash payments regardless of what farmers grow. The Senate bill would retain the basic structure of the Federal programs but would reduce to 70 percent from 85 percent the amount of a farm's acreage on which subsidies would be paid.
MISCELLANEOUS A fee would be imposed on savings and loan institutions to shore up the fund that insures their deposits. The House, but not the Senate, would abolish Federally chartered savings institutions by 1998. Various Federal assets like oil from the strategic petroleum reserve would be sold to raise money. Modest reductions would be made in veterans' benefits. The House, but not the Senate, would abolish the Commerce Department. The House, but not the Senate, would also fold the Agency for International Development, the United States Information Agency and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State Department. Federal employees would have to contribute more toward their pensions. DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

HEADLINE: U.N. Warns Against Delay in Cutting Carbon Dioxide Emissions

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
Delaying action to rein in emissions of heat-trapping atmospheric gases like carbon dioxide could increase the rate and magnitude of future climatic changes and make the world more vulnerable to costly and possibly irreversible damages, a United Nations scientific panel says in a new report.
Some economists have argued that the only cost-effective way to reduce emissions is to put the reduction off as long as possible, while others insist that doing so would merely push the burden onto future generations. 
 The new report, made public yesterday in Washington by a working group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says that while future technological advances might lower the cost of emissions reduction if action is delayed, deeper emissions cuts would be required in the end. Moreover, the scientists say that a delay in action could boost the damage from climate change and increase the cost of adapting to it.
And they say that if existing technologies for cutting fossil-fuel energy use are aggressively exploited through strong governmental policies, substantial emissions reductions can be achieved without big changes in life styles.
The report comes at a time when 142 countries that are parties to the 1992 climate treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro are negotiating reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. The industrialized countries of the world have already pledged, as a first step, to cap the emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The report also comes as Republicans in Congress are seeking to reduce by as much as 40 percent the funds for the Clinton Administration's program to reach the 1990 cap.
The role of the intergovernmental panel, which consists of about 2,500 experts around the world, is to advise the treaty parties. An economics working group reported in Montreal 11 days ago that earlier action to cut emissions might relieve the burden on future generations by giving them more flexibility. The new report, from another working group, says that loss of this flexibility would force deeper emission cuts later on.
An average increase in global temperature of 1.5 to 6.3 degrees by the year 2100, predicted by a third working group, would cause a sea level rise of 6 to 37 inches by then and more in the following centuries, according to the report issued yesterday. Many low-lying coastal areas around the world could be inundated, the scientists say. An average rise of about 39 inches, they say, could place 70 million people at risk.
The panel also said climate change could produce, among other things, these consequences:
*Bring an increase in heat waves, floods, droughts, fires and pest outbreaks in some regions.
*Lead to the disappearance of entire forest types.
*Make desert climates more extreme.
*Cause a rise in the number of heat-related deaths and illnesses.
*Increase the range of vector-borne infectious diseases like malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever and viral encephalitis.
The report says that if existing technology were applied strictly, energy savings of about 25 percent could be achieved in homes, businesses and industrial plants during the next 30 years, and that greenhouse-gas reductions could be even larger.
It said energy use by motor vehicles could be cut by about a third during the same period by using efficient drive trains, light-weight materials and low-air-resistance design. Further reductions could come if vehicles were made smaller.

HEADLINE: Matsushita's Profits Climb For Half-Year

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Oct. 24

 BODY:
The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company said today that its half-year profits rose because of aggressive cost-cutting and despite a small decline in sales.
The company's chief financial officer, Motoi Matsuda, said lower manufacturing costs and better management efficiency helped the company shrug off fierce competition and appreciation of the yen, which shaved some 16 billion yen, or about $160 million, from the value of overseas sales. 
 "Business is starting to look slightly better, but the overall environment remains tough," Mr. Matsuda said at the company's headquarters here today.
Matsushita manufactures electronic equipment under such brands as National, Panasonic and Technics.
The company said its current profits rose 10 percent, to 41.22 billion yen ($412 million) in the half-year that ended on Sept. 30 from 37.41 billion a year earlier.
Current profit is a pretax profit that includes gains and losses made on investments and other nonoperating activities. But sales fell to 2.16 trillion yen, or about $21.6 billion, from 2.20 trillion.
Matsushita said sales were strong in Asia, where economic growth remained brisk, and relatively weak in Europe, the United States and Japan, where growth was sluggish or faltering.
Sales in Japan rose 2 percent, to 1.42 trillion yen ($14.2 billion), helped by marketing of new products and strengthened sales organizations, Matsushita said. But exports dropped 9 percent, to 739.4 billion yen ($7.39 billion).
Video equipment sales fell 17 percent and audio equipment sales dropped 8 percent, largely because of lower exports and a shift in consumer demand to lower-priced models, despite higher sales of wide-screen televisions, Mr. Matsuda said.
Electronic component sales surged 11 percent, while sales of communications and industrial equipment stayed steady overall. Sales of mobile communications equipment, including mobile telephones, rose strongly in Japan, he said.
Sales of home appliances rose in Japan because of the introduction of new models.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Renewed Hope for Rate Cut Sends Bond Prices Higher

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Yields on Treasury securities tumbled yesterday, with the market getting plenty of mileage out of renewed hopes for an interest-rate cut in the near future, thanks to comments by Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The only problem with that positive news for the market was that it played havoc by blowing out short positions usually set up ahead of a government auction, disrupting normal dealer positioning. 
 Mr. Blinder's comments, reported yesterday morning by the Market News Service, indicated that a soft economic landing was likely without further cuts in short-term interest rates. Still, Mr. Blinder said, real rates are too high for the long run, so the Fed should begin to lower them, but not necessarily "imminently." He said he favored a "sizable" rate cut, depending on the outcome of Federal budget talks.
Mr. Blinder indicated that these were his opinions, not necessarily those of the Fed, but he said he had support from others. Analysts said the remarks gave the market a strong lift.
By late in the day, the 30-year Treasury bond was up 31/32, to a price of 107 13/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, was 6.32 percent, down from 6.39 percent on Monday.
As trading opened, the index of retail chain-store sales compiled by Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. and Schroder Wertheim & Company showed a hefty 1 percent increase for the week ended Oct. 21. Many economists saw the gain as a catch-up after poor sales reports in the previous three weeks, and they said seasonal considerations, like cooler weather and the approach of Halloween, had bolstered sales. But they noted that the index was up an impressive 5.2 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier.
The strong retail report, indicating a robust economy, erased the market's modest overnight gains. But traders managed to remain focused on buying on price declines.
In futures trading, the December bond contract did not even reach the Monday low of 116 5/32 before buyers stepped in yesterday morning. Yesterday's low was 116 6/32, with the high at 117 12/32 and the close at 117 8/32.
"If you're selling in this market, keep it conservative," said Robin Mesch, a fixed-income analyst for Thomson Research of Boston. "We view a break to the 115 20/32 price level as an important area to buy, and over all we view breaks as buying opportunities."
By afternoon, the Johnson Redbook retail chain-store sales index helped lift the market even higher. The index declined 1.9 percent for the first three weeks of October.
Yesterday's $17.75 billion auction of two-year notes went better than expected. "The aggressive bid on the two-year note suggests that investors see a good chance of a near-term rate cut," said James Hale, fixed-income analyst at MMS International, San Francisco. The high yield at auction was 5.705 percent, the lowest since June 27, 1995, when it was 5.690 percent.
"We'll have to give Mr. Blinder some credit for the auction's success," Mr. Hale said. "His comments more than compensated for the disruption of the normal auction setup where dealers start discounting the price of securities ahead of the auction to make those securities that much more attractive at auction."
Mr. Hale said the market was also watching the Federal budget talks, "with bonds not likely to get below 6.25 percent until an accord is reached." Today, the Government will report data on existing home sales for September, with analysts expecting a decline. "Our own forecasts call for a decline of 5 percent," Mr. Hale said. "But these are volatile numbers anyway, and it is not unusual to see large fluctuations."
Mr. Hale said investors who tried to set up short positions for today's five-year note auction might have a difficult time, especially after so many were chased out of the market early yesterday.
Joel Marver, chief technical analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the budget negotiations were backing up the market in the sense that participants love talk of a balanced budget. "It doesn't matter that prior stirring for a balanced budget has always resulted in disappointment," he said. "This is the type of market condition where investors have done well by holding positions."
The following are results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High yield . . . 5.705%
Low yield . . . 5.670%
Median yield . . . 5.690%

HEADLINE: Has This War Been Won?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Remember WIN buttons?
Those relics of the mid-1970's, with their "Whip Inflation Now" slogan avidly promoted by President Gerald R. Ford, are collector items today, reminders of a misty past that apparently shows no signs of returning. Indeed, the United States has just gone through five consecutive years of the lowest level of consumer price inflation since the economy's golden run in the mid-1960's. 
 But if inflation -- now at less than 3 percent a year -- is down, it may not yet be time to count it out. A hot debate has erupted between those who contend that the economy has changed so fundamentally that inflation is no longer a serious threat and those who worry that efforts to stimulate the economy beyond its natural capacity could again stir the beast from its slumber.
On one side are politicians of both the right and left, much of the labor movement and a growing number of business leaders. They argue that the Federal Reserve, because of an outdated fear of inflation, has suppressed growth by keeping interest rates too high and credit too tight.
"There's no sign of pricing pressure anywhere," John Welch, the chief executive of the General Electric Company, said at a meeting of the Business Council in Williamsburg, Va., earlier this month. "This economy can grow more than 2 or 2 1/2 percent," he asserted, "and we ought to let it do it."
But Mr. Welch's optimism is not shared by many on Wall Street and much of the economics establishment. While economists are intrigued by fragmentary evidence that fierce competition and corporate revampings have caged both price and wage increases, they remain skeptical whether the underlying forces have been tamed.
"It's much too early to declare victory," argued Robert Gordon, a leading economist at Northwestern University. "The relationship between unemployment and inflation has held for two decades and is one of the best-documented linkages."
What worries many experts is that inflation has stayed unexpectedly low so far in the 1990's only because of special factors that are unlikely to be repeated. If the economy continues to advance and the jobless rate creeps lower, they say, it is only a matter of time before prices begin to rise at an accelerating pace.
Those thoughts were echoed by the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, at a speech last week to the Economic Club of Chicago. "We have to be careful not to lull ourselves into the presumption that somehow the institutional structure of the American economy and its increasing globalization is permanently suppressing inflation," he said.
Mr. Greenspan added that workers, still insecure in their jobs after years of layoffs and corporate downsizing, have not pressed for higher wages out of fear of losing their jobs. But there will eventually come a point, Mr. Greenspan said, "when workers will perceive that it no longer makes sense to trade off wage progress for incremental gains in expected job security."
So who's right? No one can say for sure, but the next year or so is likely to test the economy's sensitivity to inflation. For all its vows of vigilance, the Fed is under political pressure to push interest rates lower even though unemployment, at 5.5 percent, is already less than the level of roughly 6 percent that has tended to lead to higher prices in the past.
That will be particularly true if the White House and Congress manage to agree on a plan to eliminate the budget deficit over the next several years. Squeezing from one side is President Clinton, who wants a strong economy to aid his re-election bid. From the other, Congressional Republicans need more rapid growth to generate the tax revenues to meet their budget goals.
Nobody on either side of the debate is predicting a return to the double-digit inflation rates of the 1970's. In the oil shocks of that decade, Washington was inclined to avoid recessions at all cost, accommodating higher energy prices by sharply expanding the money supply.
But that same path was not pursued after the spike in oil prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Indeed, the Fed accepted a recession as the cost of emphasizing the point that price stability was Job One. "Alan Greenspan deserves a lot of credit for reining in inflationary expectations," George Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said.
Still, that does not mean that prices won't start to creep up again. Most economists believe joblessness and inflation rates are closely linked. A variety of factors -- from the level of the minimum wage and the strength of the safety net for the jobless to the mobility of the work force -- determine a core non-inflationary rate of unemployment.
When unemployment is driven below this "natural" rate, bidding for scarce skills tends to push wages up faster than productivity is advancing. That, in turn, eventually pushes up the price of a range of goods and services. By contrast, when unemployment rises above the rate, the cost of labor tends to fall, bringing inflation down with it.
Since the late 1970's, estimates of the natural unemployment rate, which has always been hard to pin down, have bunched around 6 percent. But unemployment of less than 6 percent has peacefully coexisted with low inflation since late 1993, leading some people to speculate that the natural rate has fallen to 5.5 percent or even lower.
There is no shortage of plausible reasons why this might be true. The least controversial is tied to demographics. John Taylor, an economist at Stanford University who advised President George Bush, points out that young, inexperienced workers always represent a disproportionate percentage of the unemployed. Thus, the aging of baby boomers should have lowered the number of unproductive, hard-to-employ individuals at the margins of the work force.
Then there is corporate restructuring. While its actual impact on job tenure is still being debated, the sense that jobs are easier to lose than to find is strong. More companies are prepared to replace striking workers and more seem willing to move production elsewhere to escape high wages. The key issue in the current strike at the Boeing Company, for example, is how much freedom the aircraft maker should have to subcontract the building of certain components to China.
The openness of the American economy to imports has also reduced the bargaining power of the once-omnipotent unions in the auto, steel, rubber and construction-equipment industries. "Both labor and product markets are far more competitive," Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, said.
Perhaps most striking, Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University, argued, is that "recessions have become more democratic."
In the 1991-92 slump, college-educated workers proved to be highly vulnerable to layoffs, if still not as much as their blue-collar counterparts. An unprecedented 43 percent of the white-collar workers who lost jobs in that period eventually had to settle for lower pay, according to the Labor Department. That's a good reason why skilled workers, whose scarcity spurred wage increases in past booms, might now be reluctant to demand higher pay.
But there are holes in what at first glance seems an air-tight case for concluding that wage-driven inflation is yesterday's problem. Professor Gordon at Northwestern notes that the failure of total labor compensation to keep pace with productivity as the economy strengthened in the early 1990's can be largely attributed to the taming of health insurance and workers' compensation premiums paid by employers. Looking only at wages rather than total labor costs, he says, there is no convincing proof that workers have been frightened into docility.
Mr. Gordon called the good news on health and workers' compensation premiums "a favorable supply shock -- the opposite of, say, an increase in the price of oil." But even if health care inflation does not rebound to the high rates of the 1980's, there is no reason to believe this will translate into a permanent reduction in the natural rate of unemployment. Once workers get the point that employers are pocketing the savings on health care, they can be expected to demand part of the windfall.
The other reason for caution in predicting the demise of inflation is the inherent difficulty of assaying trends in a $7 trillion economy.
According to Benjamin Friedman, another Harvard economist, the best research from the 1980's suggests that operating the economy at a full percentage point of unemployment less than the natural rate for a full year adds just half a percentage point to inflation.
Thus, running at 5.5 percent unemployment even if the natural rate was still closer to 6 percent would add only a quarter percentage point a year to the inflation rate. That is too little to distinguish from blips in the prices of fuel, food, housing and autos -- at least not yet.
But if unemployment falls a little further, analysts will be in a better position to determine if the natural rate has really taken a permanent nosedive. And some -- even those who are skeptical of the claim that inflation is nothing to worry about any more -- would love to find out, in hopes that the economy can offer more opportunities to the unemployed and underemployed. "I'd like to slip into the 5 to 5 1/2 percent unemployment range," Mr. Gordon said, "and see what happens."

But it took Paul Volcker, President Carter's cigar-smoking choice for Fed chairman (George Tames/The New York Times), to halt the runaway inflation that was brought on by two 1970's oil shocks with high interest rates and a deep recession. Now some think inflation is so thoroughly beaten that the economy can grow faster with stable prices. (pg. D1)
 
Chart/Graphs: "Rethinking Causes and Effects"
 Two prerequisites for past bouts of inflation -- low unemployment and high capacity utilization -- have now been present in the economy for nearly a year without sending prices shooting upward.
 
JOBS AND PRICES
 Many economists believe that unemployment cannot fall below a certain rate without igniting inflation. In the past, inflation tended to accelerate when the jobless rate fell to less than 6 percent. But that has not occurred in the past year. Graph tracks the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation from 1963 through 1995.
 
CAPACITY AND PRICES
 When the economy grows quickly, demand can outrun manufacturers' ability to increase production, pressing prices to rise. Recent moderate growth seems not to have triggered this effect yet, even though factories are running flat out. Graph tracking the rate of inflation from 1963 through 1995 highlights periods when factories were running at more than 80 percent of capacity. (Source: Datastream) (pg. D4)
 
Graph tracks the inflation rate and the five-year average rate from 1963 through 1995. The five years from October 1994 to September 1995 had a lower average inflation rate than any five-year period since the late 1960's. (Source: Datastream) (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: Applause for Castro? Why?

BYLINE: By Robert G. Torricelli; Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat, is a member of the House of Representatives from New Jersey.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It is hard to know what is more disturbing the thought of business leaders like David Rockefeller sitting down to a lunch with Fidel Castro or the sight of hundreds of people at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem cheering the fatigue-wearing Cuban revolutionary.
These meetings this week were more than incongruous. They undermine our Government's efforts to restore freedom to the Cuban people. 
Of all things, a civil rights leader, Representative Charles Rangel, who once led the fight for economic sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa, put himself on the church dais with a dictator who has jailed more political dissidents than any other leader in this hemisphere.
Fidel Castro has consistently prevented Amnesty International from entering Cuba to investigate human rights abuses, has silenced independent journalists and has expelled political opponents.
If American business, perhaps the most practical and competitive in the world, is not deterred by politics, then it should consider the high risks of dealing with Cuba. Investor Magazine ranks only North Korea as a less attractive country in which to invest, and Cuba has only a small quantity of foreign currency reserves. In a galling move, Mr. Castro is selling off confiscated property owned by American citizens and corporations to raise hard currency to buy a little more time for his regime.
The Harlem rally and the lunch meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations attended by the business leaders may send mixed messages, but United States policy could not be clearer. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is aimed at trying to bring about political freedom. It authorizes telephone and other means of communication with Cuba in order to promote the exchange of ideas. It denies Mr. Castro the opportunity to support his security forces by earning hard currency through trade with the United States. It challenges him to begin democratization and offers calibrated American responses.
The power to end the embargo lies in Fidel Castro's hands. He can exercise it by simply permitting free expression and holding free elections. His Government's fall is inevitable. When the prisons are opened and the political prisoners' horror stories are more fully told, I wonder if those who cheered Fidel Castro and sat down with him will be proud of themselves.

Million Man Stall

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
"I met Jesse, strangely enough, through Ross Perot," said Felix Rohatyn this week, recalling the "Six Degrees of Separation" coincidence that led him into an unexpected alliance with Jesse Jackson.
Mr. Rohatyn, the investment banker who masterminded New York City's fiscal comeback in the mid-1970's, was on the phone with Mr. Perot, talking about building schools. Mr. Jackson, who was in Mr. Perot's office, conveyed his desire to meet with Mr. Rohatyn about the crisis in America's cities. Next thing you know Mr. Jackson and Mr. Rohatyn had joined forces on a plan called "Rebuild America," to raise $500 billion for investment in generating jobs and repairing the infrastructure in the nation's rotting urban core. 
 That was in 1992. In 1995, one week after the Million Man March and counting, the rebuilding of urban America not only remains a dream deferred but a dream hardly talked about by politicians of either party. Speaking with both Mr. Jackson and Mr. Rohatyn in separate interviews since the march, I was struck once again by how much of official Washington's post-march babble is, by contrast, beside the point.
The two men go their own ways and, unsurprisingly, part company on one crucial matter in the march's aftermath. Mr. Rohatyn -- like many others, myself among them -- was "very disappointed" by Mr. Jackson's decision "to put himself squarely on the side of separatism" by appearing on the podium with Louis Farrakhan. "If Jesse really wanted to do something symbolic, he should have stood with the black marchers and said nothing," Mr. Rohatyn added. "The marchers, with great unity and dignity, reminded the country we have a problem. That was the message, not what was happening on the podium."
Mr. Jackson's lukewarm rationale for Mr. Farrakhan -- as a potentially positive force for voter registration and black-Jewish dialogue -- remains unpersuasive. But his definition of the marchers' message parallels Mr. Rohatyn's and can hardly be dismissed. As Mr. Jackson speaks of the need for devising a "bipartisan national urban policy" that goes beyond either the current welfare debate or the Farrakhan slogans of self-help, so Mr. Rohatyn elaborates that the cancer of race begins in the cities, with black despair and white flight: "If we don't deal with it in the cities, we can't deal with it at all. Clinton, Gingrich and Dole must stand up and say we're going to jointly deal with urban problems, in ways that meet the objectives of white communities and taxpayers as well as of minorities who are dying in cities with no school system worthy of the name, no jobs, no medical care and no hope of entering the 21st century."
None of this will be easy, of course, or cheap. When Mr. Rohatyn had to negotiate the New York City bailout, he told the various factions: "There are no alternatives that involve pleasure and pain, there are only alternatives that involve pain and agony. The ideal is to avoid agony. You can't avoid pain."
Today's politicians do not like to talk in public about policy alternatives that involve pain. And so no one in political office offers any scheme to rebuild America, whether a variation of Mr. Rohatyn's dormant idea or something new. Bill Clinton delivers a fine speech on racism the morning of the march -- without venturing concrete policy prescriptions. Republicans conveniently embrace the spirituality of the march as its principal message -- as if the marchers' pride and dignity will rebuild America all by themselves. Well-meaning Congressmen of both parties, white and black, call for a new Kerner Commission to redefine the problem -- an idea rightly dismissed by Mr. Jackson as well as by Mr. Rohatyn ("We don't need a new commission to study whether we have a racial problem -- we know we have a race problem.").
All the while, our cities continue on an apocalyptic spiral that Mr. Rohatyn sees as "close to irreversible." As the likes of Mr. Farrakhan, Benjamin Chavis and their white extremist counterparts scheme to exploit the crisis, we wait and wait for some leader in Washington who might regard the Million Man March as an urgent cue to action, however painful, rather than as merely a cost-free political opportunity to pat the marchers on the head.

HEADLINE: U.S. Doesn't Really Want Iraqi Leader to Go

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Iraqi Sanctions: No End in Sight" (editorial, Oct. 19): For the past four years your editorial page has challenged the legality, morality and wisdom of the United States' interpretation of the United Nations embargo on Iraq. It is dismaying to see you abandon your position although little in the situation has changed. 
 Under Resolution 687, the United Nations Security Council pledges to end the embargo once Iraq respects its neighbors' borders and eliminates its weapons of mass destruction. The Bush and Clinton Administrations, however, have repeatedly made it clear that we intend to maintain the embargo as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.
It has been an open secret that we hope to use the embargo to bring about a coup in Iraq. Yet policy makers also have serious worries about the possible result. If Mr. Hussein, a blustering nationalist, is replaced by an Islamic fundamentalist, it would be a dubious triumph. If Iraq fragments into Yugoslav-style civil war, it might provoke Iranian invasion on one side and destabilize our ally Turkey on another.
Privately, American policy makers prefer the status quo, which justifies the deployment of American troops and, by shutting Iraq out of the oil market, maintains high revenues the Saudis and Kuwaitis need to pay for American arms purchases.
The only coup we really want is "Saddamism without Saddam" -- an equally authoritarian leader who would be our ally. The United States was euphoric when Mr. Hussein's son-in-law Gen. Kamel Hassan defected to Jordan on Aug. 8. But his long participation in the corrupt and brutal Baghdad regime discredited him among true dissidents and civilian populations in Iraq and the Arab world.
Meanwhile, with no end in sight of either Mr. Hussein or the embargo, the people of Iraq are the victim. Witnesses such as the Harvard Medical School team and Unicef report hospitals without anesthetic, malnourished children and people succumbing to normally curable disease. The United States disclaims responsibility because we have offered to let Iraq sell limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicine.
But we knew that the humiliation in such offers would bring rejection from Mr. Hussein who, like not a few world leaders, derives his power from machismo. The offers were designed to wash our hands of responsibility, not to feed Iraqis.
A new policy by President Clinton -- a commitment to end the embargo when Iraq destroys its weapons -- would show humanity and courage rather than simulations of toughness.

HEADLINE: BOXING

BYLINE: By King's Accuser Testifies That He Created Fake ExpensesBy RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The key witness in the wire-fraud case against Don King testified yesterday that the promoter directed him to create $350,000 in training expenses to justify an insurance claim for a Julio Cesar Chavez-Harold Brazier fight that was canceled.
Chavez owed King, his longtime promoter, $736,000, and King allegedly wanted to recover a portion of it by attributing $350,000 of it to training expenses, said Joseph Maffia, the former controller of Don King Productions. 
 King is charged with altering Chavez's contract to include a rider that would allow him to collect $350,000 in nonrefundable training expenses from the boxer. Last week, Chavez testified that he had never seen the contract that King filed in his successful insurance claim to Lloyd's of London.
Maffia said that during telephone conversations King escalated the amount he wanted to claim to Lloyd's. "He said, 'Put down $150,000, $200,000, $250,000,' I don't remember the exact figure," he said.
The final figure, Maffia testified, was $350,000.
"He instructed me to deem a portion of the $736,000 check for training expenses," Maffia said. King had written the check, an advance against Chavez's $2 million purse to fight Brazier, in March 1991.
But there were not enough expenses to justify the $350,000, Maffia said. The accountant, who spoke in a quiet monotone, said he could find only $130,000 to $150,000 in claimable expenses. King, he said, told him to pad the expenses.
"He suggested I look at the Mirage Hotel for Spanish production costs, and Spanish advertising done through Western Media, Gladys Rosa's bill" and legal bills, Maffia said. Rosa, a King employee, is Chavez's translator.
Maffia's cooperation with the United States Attorney, which began in May 1992, is crucial to the case against King. During direct examination by Paul Gardephe, an assistant United States Attorney, Maffia was almost unflappable.
Before King's legal team could impugn Maffia as an angry former employee, Gardephe's questioning opened the door to that issue.
Maffia said that after being forced to resign in September 1991, King disputed his unemployment insurance claim, sought to have his license as a certified public accountant revoked and sued him to repay an outstanding loan.
Maffia said he called King in May 1992 and vowed revenge against him. "Have you said you hate Don King and want to hurt him?" Gardephe asked.
"Yes," Maffia said.
"Do you feel the same way now?" Gardephe asked.
"No," Maffia said. "I dislike him."
The exchange brought chuckles from King.
Under cross-examination, Peter Fleming Jr., King's lawyer, focused on whether Maffia asked King or other co-workers for a copy of Chavez's contract and why he did not secure one when Gagliardi Brothers, King's retail insurance broker, asked for it. "Did you advise Gagliardi that you were unable to find a copy of the contract?" Fleming asked.
"No," Maffia said.
"They asked for it," Fleming said.
"Yes," Maffia replied.
Months after Maffia's resignation, Richard Hummers, King's vice president of finance, filed the insurance claim.
Maffia was often vague about details of his cooperation with the Government. He admitted to telling his lawyer that he felt the United States Attorney's office was "threatening" him in September 1993.
"You were worried that having cooperated, you'd be indicted," Fleming said. Maffia said he was concerned at the slow pace of the case, whether it would actually go to trial. "I wanted to go on with my life," he said.
"Do you remember saying you'd rather go to jail for a year?" Fleming asked.
"Yes, I do," Maffia said quietly, without elaboration.

The forgotten child in treating pain is the child.

SERIES: First of two columns on pain
in children.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody 

 BODY:
CHILDREN'S aspirin has been on the market for decades, joined more recently by children's acetaminophen. Both are mild pain relievers, although mainly used to reduce fevers. But when it comes to quelling severe pain, the kind, for example, associated with sampling bone marrow, setting a broken arm or sewing up a bad cut, children have long been therapeutic orphans.
Drug companies feel that the pediatric market does not offer enough economic incentive to warrant the costly testing and approval process required to license pain medication in a form suitable for small children. Most potent painkillers are administered by injections that are themselves painful and frightening for children. 
 And when doctors want to reduce anxiety in children undergoing painful medical procedures, they are often forced to reformulate into an oral preparation a drug called Versed that is marketed only in an intravenous form.
The drug companies' reluctance to develop pediatric analgesics has been tacitly supported by doctors who have long harbored many myths about pain in children, including the notions that they do not feel pain as much as adults, that they do not remember their pain and that they might become drug addicts if given narcotics. Such beliefs account for the longstanding failure of doctors to use painkillers when circumcising newborn boys.
Too often, instead of being given pharmacological or other forms of relief, frightened children about to undergo painful procedures are simply restrained physically, a practice pain specialists call barbaric.
Intensity of Pain
Infants may be unable to verbalize pain and small children may be afraid to, but there is no longer any doubt that children suffer as much as adults, and it is clear from their response to repeated procedures that they remember the pains of the past all too well.
In fact, as noted by Dr. Lynda J. Means, an anesthesiologist at James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, "infants may actually have a heightened response to pain because inhibitory mechanisms, while present, have not fully matured."
Dr. Kathleen M. Foley, chief of the pain service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said pain in children might be worse than pain in adults because children are often unable to understand that "the pain may be short-lived, that relief is possible or that the pain associated with treatment or diagnostic procedures can have long-term benefits." Dr. Foley added, "Some children, especially those with chronic disease, become desperately afraid of needles and those who wield them."
Furthermore, anxiety and unrelieved pain can complicate recovery, prolong hospitalization and even increase the risk of dying from a medical procedure, said Dr. Myron Yaster, a pediatric anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
The nervous system circuitry for feeling pain is present in fetuses from 30 weeks of gestation onward. There are several ways to measure the pain of children too young to describe accurately how they feel. Pain profiles have been developed for infants based on such physical symptoms as breathing and heart rate, skin color and facial expression. Babies as young as 18 months can express pain and tell where they hurt.
For preschoolers there are facial scales, like the "Oucher" Scale, that allow them to point to a picture that best describes how much they hurt. Other scales use poker chips or colors that help young children indicate the intensity of pain.
 
New Techniques
Last year a small company, the Anesta Corporation in Salt Lake City, won approval for the first potent analgesic specifically designed for and tested in children. The drug, fentanyl, an opiate, acts fast but is short-lived, making it an ideal medication for providing relief during painful medical procedures. It has the added virtue of being absorbable through the mucous membranes in the mouth and so could be formulated in a "lollipop" that makes it easy and painless and not frightening to administer. This form also enables doctors to remove the remaining drug from the child's mouth when a sufficient dose has been absorbed.
But Fentanyl Oralet, as the analgesic lollipop is called, has yet to be used for most of the procedures for which it is intended. That is not because it is unsafe or ineffective, but because some outspoken doctors have raised concerns about possible subsequent drug abuse by patients who receive it, as well as objections to the link it establishes between candy and opiates and its potential for abuse as a street drug.
Dr. Yaster maintains that these are empty arguments that simply deprive children of the kind of comfort readily provided to adults undergoing painful medical procedures. In an editorial in the journal Pediatrics earlier this year, he pointed out, for example, that "most orally administered medications are made palatable for children so that they can be better tolerated -- 'a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.' " He also noted that addiction and drug abuse do not result from "the judicious use of analgesics" and that the frightening situations under which children would be given the opiate lollipop "are not the type of life experiences that children will want to voluntarily repeat."
There is another new medication to reduce the pain and resulting fear of needle injections and other external procedures for adults as well as for children. It is topical anesthetic called EMLA Cream, manufactured by Astra Pharmaceutical Products Inc. of Westborough, Mass. It combines two local anesthetics, lidocaine and prilocaine, and rather than being injected, it is first smeared on the skin; the area is then covered for one to two hours until the drug is absorbed. It temporarily deadens nerve endings, providing pain relief for several hours after the cream is removed. It has been shown to reduce pain significantly in children undergoing insertion of an intravenous line, a spinal tap or aspiration of bone marrow. It may also help to diminish the distress associated with immunizations and circumcision.
For children 6 and older who are experiencing chronic or prolonged pain, there is now also the option of using patient-controlled analgesia. Patients give themselves medication by triggering a microprocessor-controlled infusion pump that is designed to prevent overdosages. This technique allows drug doses to be individualized, prevents anxiety-inducing delays in relieving pain and gives children a sense of involvement in and control over their own care.
Experts in pediatric pain urge parents to be aggressive in assuring that their children do not suffer unnecessary pain during medical treatment. They say that children's complaints of pain should always be taken seriously and treated with the same respect and care that an adult would receive.

HEADLINE: Prospective Labor Leaders Set to Turn to Confrontation

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

 BODY:
Frustrated by declining wages and an erosion of political power, the nation's labor movement is expected to turn today to a new corps of leaders who say they are willing to adopt the tactics of civil disobedience and confrontation, largely abandoned in the 1960's.
In recent decades, even as union membership has shrunk along with inflation-adjusted pay, labor's leadership has tended to rely on politics and negotiation to carry the case of workers. 
 But today more than 1,000 delegates of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, gathered in New York for their weeklong national convention, are set to elect as president John J. Sweeney, who shut down the bridges to Washington last summer in a campaign to organize janitors. Given the way Mr. Sweeney's forces have held together on a number of resolution votes this week, his victory in the election, over Thomas R. Donahue, the federation's longtime No. 2 official and now its interim president, seemed assured yesterday, with a majority of at least 55 percent.
There are abundant indications that Mr. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union, and his allies are prepared to follow through on their promises of greater militancy.
A Sweeney-prepared convention resolution calling for the training of 1,000 organizers a year, five times the current number, says, "We must first organize despite the law if we are ever to organize with the law."
In a convention talk to his supporters, Richard L. Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers and the Sweeney slate's candidate for secretary-treasurer, shouted: "Something historic's about to happen! You are about to see corporate America's worst nightmare come true!"
Linda Chavez-Thompson, a vice president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, who is the slate's candidate for executive vice president, told a news conference, "I like to get arrested." And she recently was, while demonstrating on behalf of hotel workers in San Francisco.
The willingness to take a page from labor's legacy of the early 20th century, when warriors like Samuel Gompers helped lift workers into the middle class, reflects a seething frustration with a Congress that labor officials see as indifferent to their members' concerns and with a declining influence of unions generally.
Whether the new approach can change the fortunes of organized labor is a wide-open question. Unions retreated from their earlier strategy of confrontation after a number of them had acquired an image of arrogance, corruption and even violence that the federation's departing leadership celebrates having largely erased. But unions are so small now, with only 15.5 percent of the work force -- half the level of the 1950's -- that mighty corporations can routinely block their organizing drives and chip away at wages with little fear of strikes.
In any case, the voices of caution are fewer and fewer among the union leaders gathered in New York. Just let one more company discharge a worker for trying to bring a union into his plant, warned Richard Bensinger, head of the federation's worker-organizing institute, which is about to be showered with a fivefold increase in funds, to $20 million a year.
"We're going to react against that corporation in a 100-fold, magnified way," Mr. Bensinger said. "We should sit down. Agree to spend a day in jail on behalf of the first worker who is fired. We have to send a message that this is a social movement. We're a moral force in society. It seems to me we should do what is morally right."
One firebrand organizer, Ron Carey, president of the 1.3-million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said civil disobedience required a "very thoughtful decision," but another teamster leader, John P. Morris of Philadelphia, is cranked up to press all the limits of the law. "We're going to take the ports," Mr. Morris said. "That's the whole Philadelphia waterfront."
Indeed, the Sweeney side seems unequivocally committed to a form of activism that the departing regime condemns. "I believe in blocking bridges" on behalf of working families, Mr. Sweeney said in a convention debate with Mr. Donahue yesterday.
Mr. Donahue, recalling labor's long effort to clean its image, takes a dim view. "We have to worry less about blocking bridges and worry more about building bridges," he said in a speech to the convention. "We must enlist the support of the members of the public, not inconvenience as many of them as possible."
But Gary Hubbard, a spokesman for one Sweeney ally, George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, noted "a willingness now" to resort to civil disobedience.
"Becker's prepared and willing to do that," Mr. Hubbard said. "It's something we haven't practiced since the civil rights struggles of the 60's."
Joel Ochoa Perez, a machinists' union organizer from Southern California, said: "This is the first time I see organizing put right at the top of the agenda. For the first time, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is not just talking about organizing but about ways to organize."
These new attitudes have permeated a convention, held every two years, that is very different from those of recent decades. Few delegates are wearing the usual lapel buttons ranting at enemies like corporations that break strikes or Republicans in Congress who stop the labor agenda. Instead, the delegates are turning inward, searching the federation itself for the causes of the unions' failure to grow and win political battles.
They complain of a creaking labor bureaucracy that runs on a budget of $70 million a year. From their headquarters one block from the United States Chamber of Commerce and just across Lafayette Park from the White House, federation leaders have frequently taken on the demeanor of the Cabinet officers, lawmakers and lobbyists with whom they spend most of their time -- all, in terms of labor's agenda in recent years, for naught.
Periodic polls showed that only small minorities of rank-and-file workers in cities beyond Washington could even name Lane Kirkland, the president for 16 years, who this summer dropped out of a run for re-election in the face of an insurgency led by the presidents of two of the biggest unions: Mr. Sweeney, of the Service Employees, and Gerald W. McEntee of the State, County and Municipal Employees.
A leading advocate of the shift toward civil disobedience is the 44-year-old Mr. Bensinger, the federation's top organizing official, who is a close associate of Mr. Sweeney.
"Look at the Christian Coalition," Mr. Bensinger said. "They have $25 million. We have $11 billion" -- the total of all union revenues, mostly from dues. "The Christian Coalition mobilizes around people's anger. They channel anger downward, toward welfare mothers. We can channel anger upwards, toward rich corporations."

HEADLINE: THE U.N. AT 50: CLINTON AND JIANG;
CHINA'S PRESIDENT AND CLINTON MEET TO REPAIR FENCES

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
Meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations anniversary celebration, President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China made their best effort yesterday to repair a relationship that has been seriously strained by disagreements over Taiwan and human rights.
No concrete agreements emerged from the two-hour session at Lincoln Center, and there was no public display of unity comparable to Mr. Clinton's joint appearance on Monday with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia at Franklin D. Roosevelt's Hudson Valley estate. 
 But White House officials expressed confidence that the momentum developed at the intense session yesterday would allow the two nations to move forward with further discussions in a range of areas of concern, from arms control to trade relations.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House Press Secretary, said Mr. Clinton described his encounter with Mr. Jiang as a "very good, very positive meeting and the best of three meetings he has held to date" with the Chinese leader.
"He's confident that we have begun a process that will lead to a series of dialogues that will help improve the opportunity for comprehensive engagement with China," Mr. McCurry said.
Chen Jian, the spokesman for President Jiang's delegation, told reporters at a separate briefing that the meeting had been "candid, friendly, positive and useful."
"It will be useful for the improvement and growth of the bilateral relationship," Mr. Chen said.
Clinton Administration officials said the two leaders covered a range of issues including Taiwan, human rights, China's desire to join the World Trade Organization and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The officials said Mr. Clinton emphasized that while the two major powers were bound to have their differences, they can manage them better through honest dialogue.
"Neither side would claim that there aren't serious differences remaining," Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said after the meeting. "There are serious differences."
But he said the relationship had "resumed momentum."
The Administration had hoped to capitalize on Russia's agreement on Monday to halt all nuclear testing in 1996 as a way to persuade China to do the same. But the Administration received only a promise to pursue the issue further. Though China has agreed to pursue a comprehensive test ban in 1996, it is the last of the five major nuclear powers not to sign on to the idea of zero testing.
Mr. Clinton raised the issue of human rights with China, bringing up specific cases as well as the issue of Tibet, which has been under Chinese control since 1950. But at a briefing after the meeting, Mr. Lord refused to identify the specific human rights victims discussed. That was in marked contrast to Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Jiang in Seattle in 1993 where the public announcement of names helped get dissidents freed.
Mr. Clinton deflected questions about human rights issues and Taiwan from reporters who quizzed him and Mr. Jiang at a picture-taking session before their meeting.
"The important thing is that we're going to have this meeting," he said. "These are two great countries that have a real interest in maintaining a constructive dialogue with each other and wherever possible a partnership, and we need to go to work on it.'
Mr. Chen sidestepped a question about whether President Clinton had raised individual human rights cases with President Jiang.
"It is true that both countries have different views" on human rights, Mr. Chen said. "We can have dialogue on it instead of confrontation."
As expected, the Chinese brought up the issue of Taiwan, and Mr. Chen described it as "the most major and sensitive issue affecting the relationship." But American officials said they were gratified that it did not dominate the agenda as it did in the aftermath of the United States' decision to allow the Taiwanese President, Lee Teng-hui, to make a private visit to the United States this spring.
Despite the Administration's insistence that the visit did not constitute a break with Washington's longstanding "one China" policy, Beijing recalled its Ambassador in protest.
Mr. Clinton's aides said that at the meeting today the President reaffirmed that the United States recognized only one China, but that the United States would not promise to ban any visits by Taiwan officials. He said such visits would remain "unofficial, private and rare."
Ever since Mr. Clinton took office the relationship with Beijing has been one of the most difficult to keep on track. With the end of the cold war and the breakup of the Soviet Union, China and the United States no longer have the same pragmatic need to use each other as counterweights against the former adversary. China's leaders have been unsettled by a struggle over who will be the successor to the 91-year-old Deng Xiaoping. And the personal relationship between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang has been cool, Administration officials acknowledge.
The United States has also been concerned about China's arrest and trial of Harry Wu, an American human rights advocate who was jailed in China and convicted of stealing state secrets.
Since then both countries have moved back from the brink. Beijing released Mr. Wu; Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Beijing for a United Nations women's conference, and China announced in late September that it would suspend a contract to sell two nuclear power reactors to Iran.
Still, a successful meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang yesterday was not assured.
At the last moment, the Chinese demanded that the meeting site be changed because the planned venue, the New York Public Library, was featuring an exhibit that included a handbill from the 1989 student democracy movement, which was crushed in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The exhibit also contains footage of the Chinese military suppression of the demonstrations, in which hundreds were killed.
And just hours before the two world leaders sat down together, Mr. Jiang used his speech at the United Nations celebrations to charge that "certain big powers, often under the cover of freedom, democracy and human rights, set out to encroach upon the sovereignty of other countries, interfere in their internal affairs and undermine their national unity and ethnic harmony."
Mr. Jiang also repeated Beijing's longstanding position that Taiwan remains an "inalienable part of China's territory."
Nonetheless, both the American and Chinese officials were eager yesterday to bring relations back to the point where the two nations could have normal diplomatic exchanges.
Other issues that came up yesterday included joint law enforcement efforts, narcotics enforcement and trade relations. China's admission to the World Trade Organization is one of Beijing's major diplomatic objectives. And Mr. Lord said the President stressed that China needed to make more progress in the area of intellectual rights protection as a step toward its goal.
Mr. Chen said that the two leaders would meet again at the summit conference of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Group in Osaka, Japan, next month. "The Osaka meeting will build on this meeting and move the process forward," he said.

HEADLINE: Crowning the Comeback King

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
Though there are still four years to go in the 90's, business and government leaders in New York honored Donald J. Trump yesterday for pulling off what they called "the comeback of the decade."
Mr. Trump, the developer who came to epitomize opulent wealth during the 80's before tumbling into deep financial trouble, has managed to erase much of his debt and is moving ahead with major projects at a time other developers are idling. 
 Judging from the attention showered on him yesterday at the Union League Club, some of New York's civic and business leaders are quite captivated by Mr. Trump, despite the financial uncertainties that still surround some of his properties.
But the operative word at the luncheon was comeback, though Mr. Trump might dispute that he ever went far away. William D. Fugazy, the limousine magnate and chairman of the Forum Club, the group of business and civic leaders that sponsored the luncheon, presented Mr. Trump with a boomerang encased in glass. "You throw it and it always comes back," he said as he handed it over.
In a flattering speech, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey called Mr. Trump "the comeback kid." Charles A. Gargano, who as chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation is himself considered one of the new powers of the state, joked about a Perot-Trump presidential ticket. "He would be the most loved Vice President since Spiro T. Agnew," he said. Mr. Gargano, who heads the state's economic development efforts, added, "Thank you for your tax dollars."
After the collapse of the real estate market of the 1980's, Mr. Trump's company was left holding some $8.8 billion in debt, causing his personal net worth to drop to a low of about $1 billion in the red by 1991.
But since then, his fortunes have changed. He continues to pursue the trademark trophy-style projects he is known for, such as a hotel and condominium project on the southwest corner of Central Park that is expected to open by late 1996.
Indeed, about an hour before the luncheon, Mr. Trump and representatives from a Hong Kong development firm huddled over drawings and models for their planned Riverside South development, a 17-building project at the site of the old Pennsylvania Railroad yard on the West Side.
In addition to his real estate ventures, revenues are strong throughout the casino business, where Mr. Trump is one of the most noteworthy operators, owning three gaming establishments in Atlantic City. "The market is quite vibrant," said N. Bruce Turner, a gaming analyst at Solomon Brothers. "It has lifted Donald Trump's vibrancy. Has he come back along with the market? No question."
To be sure, for all his latest achievements, Mr. Trump is still somewhat at the mercy of the various lenders who granted him concessions on his debt. Also, he has recently proposed another refinancing of his Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, which has never lived up to the huge profits that he predicted.
But at Tuesday's luncheon, with his family by his side, Mr. Trump was in full form, gracefully taking in all the praise, like a preacher gathering up Sunday's collections.
For the guests, who included Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, and the developers Lewis Rudin and Peter Kalikow, he recalled how in 1991, the world was far different.
Outside the room, he proclaimed with no shortness of his characteristic hyperbole, "I'm the biggest in real estate in New York, and I'm the biggest in the gaming industry."

Without a 'Class Card,' This One Will Have to Do

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
DENNIS M. WALCOTT is uncomfortable with "race card," the Age of O. J. expression that is almost as popular, and overworked, as "mother of all" was during the Persian Gulf war.
There is an unpleasant ring to it. So it is understandable that Mr. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, does not like hearing it applied to his attempt to undo the 25-cent increase in subway and bus fares that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted for last week. "We get too locked into these terms," he said. 
 Now, Mr. Walcott stands justifiably accused of being a thoughtful man. But, his protestations notwithstanding, a race card is exactly what is being played -- right from the top of the deck -- in a Federal civil rights lawsuit that the Urban League and the Straphangers Campaign, a subway advocacy group, have brought against the M.T.A. and New York State.
THEY are saying that the latest fare increases are discriminatory in their impact, that they favor overwhelmingly white suburban commuters over city subway riders, most of them black, Hispanic or Asian, and that this imbalance puts the M.T.A. in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
No one is arguing that the M.T.A.'s intent was racist, Mr. Walcott says. But that's irrelevant. When black city people are slapped with a painful 20 percent fare rise while white suburbanites are let off with a more tolerable 9 percent, the "disparate impact" violates the law, he argues, the same as if E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A. chairman, were Bull Connor in a pinstripe suit.
Those are dynamite charges, and not surprisingly state officials are tugging at their shirt collars. Who relishes seeing race surface yet again? Even some of those people who would love to drive a stake through the heart of the $1.50 fare are squeamish about doing so on the basis of race. A common tendency is to wave off the Urban League suit as the legal equivalent of a Hail Mary pass, doomed to failure when a Federal judge in Manhattan takes it up next week.
Mario M. Cuomo, lawyer and former Governor, wishes that this case had stayed in the lawyers' briefcases. "The fare increase doesn't make economic sense," Mr. Cuomo said. "Your best arguments are fiscal, political and economic arguments, not your judicial arguments."
This is no nuisance suit, though, and anything can happen. Last year, a claim of "disparate impact" based on race persuaded a Federal court in Los Angeles to block a fare rise on city buses. In June, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that the same issue could be legitimately raised to bolster charges of state budgetary discrimination against New York City schools.
And it does not take much imagination to see that a victory in the suit against the M.T.A. could lead to one racial-bias claim after another as Federal, state and city Republicans whack away not only at mass transit and schools but also at hospitals and social programs. One can almost hear the politicians' collective gulp.
It is not yet a deep gulp, however. The M.T.A. reaction is, Piffle! "If this suit prevails, then we might as well do away with elections," a spokesman, John Cunningham, said. "There's a new Republican administration, and it seems clear that they're going to take care of the people who voted for the Governor. That's the way it's been run since at least Andrew Jackson."
That is certainly the way it's being run by Gov. George E. Pataki, who wastes no love on the boroughs that did not vote for him and whose budget cuts are widening a city-suburban chasm that was already bad enough.
"IT'S really insidious," said Robert Paaswell, who has documented the imbalance as director of the University Transportation Research Center at City College. His figures show that each passenger on Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road receives a government subsidy of $4.70. The figure for the city's subway and bus riders is 80 cents. Looked at another way, the average city rider will now be forced to pay for 69 percent of the total cost of his trip, while the suburban commuter pays only 44 percent.
Ah, but does that make the system racist?
Not necessarily, Mr. Walcott acknowledges. But the result, he says, is devastating all the same. It hits poor people hardest, and in this city, they generally belong to minority groups protected by the 1964 act. It would be nice if there were a way to deal head-on with the real issue: class distinctions. But there isn't. In effect, this lawsuit enters through the back door.
Besides, a lawyer for Mr. Walcott insists, if anyone played the "class card" first, it was Mr. Pataki when he slashed mass transit aid. "We're not playing the race card," said the lawyer, Eric Schneiderman, of the Kirkpatrick & Lockhart firm. "We're simply saying, 'Judge, you can't run two transit systems, separate and unequal.' "

HEADLINE: A Jamaican Way Station in the Bronx;
Community of Striving Immigrants Fosters Middle-Class Values

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER 

 BODY:
There is the odd hole-in-the-wall serving up fiery jerk chicken, or a greengrocer with 10 kinds of exotic yams on his shelves. Cricket matches can be glimpsed in Van Cortlandt Park on summer afternoons. But it is difficult to identify overt signs of West Indian culture among the neatly kept, modest brick houses of Williamsbridge and Wakefield.
Yet these northeastern Bronx neighborhoods are home to one of the largest concentrations of Jamaicans in the city, with Crown Heights and East Flatbush, Brooklyn. And they are the literal descendants of the close-knit, sociable and striving community of Jamaican immigrants in the Bronx that nurtured retired Gen. Colin L. Powell and launched him on his career. 
 Forty years after the Powells hit the numbers and left for Queens, the Bronx's role in the ascent of Jamaican immigrants is strikingly similar to what it was when the general was a child. For while Brooklyn remains the great magnet for the bulk of Jamaican immigrants, the Bronx is the more distinct way station on their road to middle-class solidity.
In Williamsbridge and Wakefield, more than 70 percent of all immigrants are from the island, more than 14,000 Jamaicans in all, according to an analysis of census data for The New York Times by Dr. Andrew Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College. And Jamaicans there are wealthier, better educated, more likely to own homes, and have more stable families than those in Brooklyn.
Precisely why this is so is unclear, but several experts pointed to the housing pattern in the neighborhoods at the northern edge of the city: street after street of plain but solid single-family brick houses, attractive to strivers looking to own rather than rent.
"The Bronx plays the same role for Jamaicans as it once did for Jews," said Philip Kasinitz, an expert on Caribbean immigration at Hunter College. "It's basically stable, middle-class neighborhoods."
The Bronx Jamaican community today is a recognizable echo of the world fondly evoked in Mr. Powell's autobiography -- a world of curried goat, calypso music and strong families. Ethnic pride is distinct but discrete, flourishing in tight family circles, behind the closed doors of these blocks of well-kept dwellings.
Before Arnold Anderson, a 71-year-old former mathematics teacher, left Jamaica 30 years ago, "we were poor," he said simply. Today, all seven of his children have college degrees, and all are homeowners. Several sat around their parents' cluttered living room recently, discussing why they had made good.
Karlene Anderson, 39, an X-ray technician with a degree in sociology from Lehman College, pointed to her mother, Kathleen, a retired nurse. "Mother was the doorkeep, the gatekeeper," she said. We weren't free to go out and date other kids." Her parents made sacrifices.
"Everything we earned went into their education," Mrs. Anderson said.
The children discussed a less palpable reason for their success: their sense of Jamaicanness.
"You're Jamaican," Karlene Anderson said. "You're not going to take stuff sitting down.
Her sister, Christine Anderson Lewis, 33, said, "The longer I'm here, the more I realize how important it is to hang to who I am."
Joyce James, a Jamaican who directs the Susan E. Wagner Child Care Center in the Bronx, said of the neighborhood: "It's very cohesive. They've been here for a while. They're not necessarily comfortable flaunting the fact that they're Jamaicans."
It is a working community: among groups in the Bronx, employment rates are higher for Jamaicans than for Dominicans, Koreans and white people born in the United States. Posses, the feared Jamaican drug gangs that made headlines in the 1980's, were a Brooklyn phenomenon.
To be sure, this is a different Bronx than the one of General Powell's youth: Jamaicans, like others, fled up the borough as the South Bronx crumbled in the late 1950's, a precipitate exodus during which, General Powell wrote, he remembers hearing people ask each other, "When you getting out?"
Shifting neighborhoods in the borough was a way of holding on to the achievements of the two initial waves of migration from Jamaica, in the first decades of the century, and from the late 1930's to 1965: houses, solid jobs, mostly in service industries, and strong family ties.
Mr. Kasinitz noted that while, in Mr. Powell's era and before, immigrants from the island tended not to be from the poorest classes, in the third great wave of Jamaican migration, which began in 1965 and continues today, "everybody now leaves Jamaica." And yet today, Jamaicans within the Bronx itself show the same unmistakable signs of upward mobility as did many in Mr. Powell's youth, particularly compared to other leading immigrant groups there.
They have lower poverty rates than Asians, Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans in the borough, far greater concentrations of households in upper-income categories, and a higher percentage of people reporting a 40- to 45-hour work week than any other group, including American-born whites, according to an analysis of Bronx census data by Prof. William Bosworth of Lehman College.
"The Bronx became the first suburb for West Indians," said Karl Rodney, publisher of The New York Carib News, speaking from personal experience. Mr. Rodney, himself of Jamaican origin, bought his first house in the United States in Williamsbridge, before moving to Westchester in 1969, a common migration of the last several decades.
Mr. Powell wrote in his autobiography of a "degree of clannishness among West Indians, Jamaicans included." This remains a distinctive feature of the quiet Jamaican presence in the Bronx today. Typical is the Wembley Athletic Club, described by many as one of the few expressions of Jamaican associational life in the borough.
The explanation for this paucity is characteristic: "There is some, but because they work so hard, they don't want to sacrifice the time to do these things," said Jackie Nkrumah, who owns Jackie's West Indian Bakery on East 233d Street, and works the evening shift herself to ensure the freshness of the coconut gizzardas, or sweet cakes.
On a Friday night, the Wembley A.C., as members call it, rocks with nothing louder than a lively game of dominoes.
Many of the members have been in America for decades -- the club president is a retired I.B.M. account manager, and friends gathered around included a skilled electrician, an insurance agent, a manager in the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, and a retired Transit Authority supervisor. They are thoroughly integrated into American economic life.
Yet this plain, two-story brick building, tucked away on a quiet corner in Wakefield, remains their chosen spot: the members are all West Indian, and mostly Jamaican.
The sense of ethnic identification is strong. Equally strong is the conviction that ethnicity played a vital role in what the men regarded as lives of reasonable success. General Powell's upward trajectory is no mystery to them.
"We're all proud of him as Jamaicans," said John Lyn, the president of the Wembley Club, who came to the Bronx in the days when Mr. Powell's family still lived on Kelly Street in Mott Haven. "That pride, that unwillingness to back down, is probably what got him where he is. If his parents were parents like the ones we had, they would not forgive him if he denied his manhood. In Jamaica, if you allow yourself to lose your dignity ----"
"You'll be thrashed," cut in Leslie Stephenson, an insurance broker who immigrated 28 years ago. "We, as best as we could, kept our Jamaican ways," Mr. Stephenson said.

HEADLINE: Fearing Bankruptcy, 2 SUNY Hospitals Are Seeking to Go Private

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The State University of New York is seeking permission to set up private, nonprofit corporations to run two of its three teaching hospitals, where for decades students who would not otherwise have been able to afford a medical education have trained as physicians and nurses.
The hospitals, in Brooklyn and Syracuse, have fallen behind in the race to enroll patients in managed-care organizations, largely because they are hamstrung by state regulations that make it difficult to enter contracts with doctors' groups or other hospitals. They complain that they cannot reinvest budget surpluses, but rather must return the money to the state. And they complain of red tape that delays the purchase of up-to-date medical equipment, like the latest mammography machine. 
 Both hospitals say that without legislation to give them more flexibility, they will face bankruptcy within the next three years.
"If we do not have this legislation, we would be facing some very serious questions in three years, the most important of which would be whether or not we could afford to continue to operate University Hospital," said Stephen Villano, the vice president for university affairs at the SUNY Health Science Center in Brooklyn.
If the SUNY hospitals were to fail, the economic impact in their communities could be grave. But if they succeed in gaining more flexibility, they will be new, large entrants in the managed health-care field, providing new competition for other hospitals in their areas and new options for patients.
The move by SUNY officials follows similar efforts by public universities across the country. Since the early 1980's, a dozen university systems from Florida to Wisconsin have transformed their hospitals into nonprofit corporations, hospital authorities or separate state agencies or turned them over to private companies to manage them.
At SUNY, such a transformation needs legislative approval -- far from certain, since the chairman of the Assembly's Higher Education Committee, among others, opposes it at this point, saying neither he nor constituents who would be affected by the change were consulted before the SUNY trustees approved a proposal last week to seek the change.
Hospital officials say a bill giving them more flexibility while keeping them part of SUNY will help, but only wholesale changes -- which they say are impossible if the hospitals remain state entities -- will keep them afloat.
Unlike New York City, which wants to sell some of its public hospitals to other hospitals or medical schools, SUNY officials want to create individual nonprofit corporations to run each hospital. These corporations would be led primarily by the existing administration.
While the change might appear a technicality -- not nearly as dramatic as the sale of a hospital -- SUNY officials say the impact would be dramatic. The nonprofit hospitals could then join existing managed-care companies, and physicians, no longer state employees, could create their own cooperative managed-care services, as well as remain staff members of the hospital. The hospital officials say the added freedom would permit them to negotiate directly with unions, bypass cumbersome purchasing requirements and make capital improvements more quickly, saving money and making them more competitive.
SUNY contends that allowing the private corporations to run the hospitals will help the state save money in a time of budget stress. The state now spends $74 million a year to subsidize the fringe benefits for the SUNY hospitals' employees, whose salaries are paid from patient revenues. SUNY officials expect to see a budget cut of $130 million to $150 million this year and project continuing financial strain in the future.
Even though they would lose the fringe-benefits subsidy, hospital officials say the greater freedom to compete in the managed-health-care market would more than make up the gap.
Under the resolution, the university hospitals in Brooklyn and Syracuse, commonly called Downstate and Upstate, would be run by nonprofit corporations, separate from the SUNY bureaucracy. The rest of the health science centers in those two locations, with their medical schools, nursing schools and graduate centers, would remain SUNY campuses. The hospitals would still be affiliated with the schools, training students and sharing resources for research. And existing medical school affiliations with other hospitals, like Downstate's agreement to send physicians in training and their supervisors to Kings County Medical Center, would remain intact.
"There are lots of models for academic programs being conducted in clinical settings other than university-owned hospitals," said Thomas A. Bartlett, Chancellor of SUNY. "More and more around the country, academic health centers are releasing their hospitals. Their hospitals are becoming independent entities. And that seems to work."
The SUNY system's hospital on the campus of the State University at Stony Brook is not seeking a separation from the university system, although officials say they also need more freedom to cooperate with other hospitals and with managed-care companies.
Dr. Nancy H. Nielsen, a Buffalo-area physician who is the SUNY trustee who proposed the resolution at the trustees' meeting last week, said she had not been sure that privatization was the answer until she saw the numbers showing how serious the hospitals' conditions were.
"It's not that we don't have good managers," Dr. Nielsen said. "It's just that they can't manage because the rules don't allow them to."
"You have three choices," she said. "Either you can increase state subsidies to keep the hospitals afloat, or they will close. Or we can try to change the rules and make them into something viable."
Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan, chairman of the Assembly's Higher Education Committee, said he has serious reservations about turning the hospitals into private corporations. He said that he had not been consulted and that he considered the board's resolution "frivolous" because the board had not discussed its plans with local officials, students or union leaders.
"We're not about to roll over dead and allow them to kill the State University, either in medical education or in any other branch of the university system," he said.
The president of the Health Science Center in Syracuse, Dr. Gregory L. Eastwood, said he had tried to assure his faculty members that the hospital, Upstate, and the professional schools would continue training students and sharing resources.
But William E. Scheuerman, the president of the United University Professions, the union that represents 7,000 physicians, technicians and nurses working in the SUNY hospitals, said that his members were still concerned.
"To whom is the group that runs the hospital accountable?" Mr. Scheuerman asked. "What happens to existing obligations that don't make money, like care for children and the indigent?"
"This could be another attempt to downsize the university and keep the public out of the public university," he said. "This time, it's not in the classroom, it's in the hospital, which the public uses."
In most states, the legislation turning hospitals over to private hands has specified that they must remain allied with the medical schools and continue to treat poor patients in the community. And in most cases, the medical schools have benefited because the hospitals' economic position has improved, according to Robert Dickler, the senior vice president for health care affairs at the American Association of Medical Colleges.
"The experience at all the hospitals that have separated is that it has helped strengthen the academic program because the hospital has been stronger," Mr. Dickler said. "In some ways, the mission has remained unchanged while the legal structure has changed."
The SUNY trustees voted for a two-step measure. First, the Legislature would consider a bill in its next session, beginning in January, to free all three SUNY hospitals from some of the constraints they now operate under. Then, SUNY would seek to remove the Brooklyn and Syracuse hospitals from SUNY control. The first measure, sought by SUNY since 1993, is expected to pass both houses by the end of January, according to State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, Republican of Suffolk, the Senate higher-education committee chairman.
To sweeten any flexibility deal this time around, the three hospitals have agreed that if the bill passes, they will give back some of the state subsidy -- $24 million next year.
Mr. LaValle said he opposes the privatization of the Stony Brook hospital, which is just outside his district. He said he wants to see whether Stony Brook can form a health care network with other hospitals on Long Island and still remain part of SUNY.
Dr. Michael Maffetone, the director and chief executive officer of the hospital at Stony Brook, said that right now he believes he can join a regional network if the flexibility legislation is passed. Stony Brook does not face the same competition as the other two hospitals because it is the most advanced trauma center in Suffolk County.
"We don't have the urgency that they feel right now," Dr. Maffetone said of Syracuse and Brooklyn. "But the environment can change very quickly, and we may need to reexamine that at some future time."

HEADLINE: Book Notes

BYLINE: By Mary B. W. Tabor 

 BODY:

From George Sand
When George Sand submitted "Horace" to her French publisher in 1841, he returned it, demanding that she tone it down. Set in Paris during the 1832 student rebellion, "Horace" offered vivid portraits of bohemian students, political rebels, a jaded aristocracy and a fallen woman who lives happily ever after: sure fodder for scandal, argued Francois Buloz, the editor of the journal Revue des Deux Mondes.
Outraged by his proposed changes, Sand rebuked Buloz in a letter dated Sept. 15, 1841. "Your ideas and your instincts have no business in my prose," she wrote. "Please leave my brain and my ink alone." To tone down her portraits was "to remove the marrow from the bone," she continued. "And I'm not so rich in talent that I can make do without the truth." 
 She took her novel elsewhere, and "Horace" was eventually published in serial form in the Revue Independante, and later as a book. But unlike most of Sand's other works, "Horace" was never published in English.
"At that time, it just didn't fit into the world view of the English-speaking world," said Zack Rogow, an award-winning translator. But now, "Horace" may have a better chance. This month, Mercury House, based in San Francisco, published what appears to be the first English edition of "Horace," which has been translated by Mr. Rogow. The book, a paperback, has a list price of $15.95.
It has already drawn support from reviewers and scholars.
" 'Horace' is one of George Sand's most interesting novels, politically speaking," said Prof. Lucienne Frappier-Mazur, a professor of French literature at the University of Pennsylvania who has read "Horace" in French. "It has a lot to do with the dignity of the woman and her freedom of choice and the fact that she becomes economically self-sufficient."
Sand had struggled to support herself through her writing, Professor Frappier-Mazur noted. Sand was known for her love affair with Chopin and her penchant for wearing men's clothes and smoking cigars. When she left her husband in the 1830's, she lost much of her inherited wealth. Like Marthe, the heroine in "Horace," Sand needed financial independence to support her two children.
 
Agent for John Grisham
 Ever since the death of John Grisham's literary agent, Jay Garon, two months ago, publishing circles have buzzed with speculation about who would emerge to take Mr. Garon's lucrative management job.
Though Mr. Grisham is under a multi-book contract at Doubleday and Dell, whoever becomes his literary agent could reap hefty commissions from potential future works and ancillary deals. These days, fingers have been pointing at David Gernert, Mr. Grisham's editor at Doubleday.
A report last week in Variety, the industry's trade paper, named Mr. Gernert as a possible heir to the Grisham representation. And yesterday morning, Mr. Gernert flew with Mr. Grisham, who pilots his own plane, to watch the filming of "A Time to Kill," on location in Mississippi, and to discuss his next book, "The Runaway Jury," which Doubleday is to publish in the spring.
Executives at Bantam Doubleday Dell said Mr. Gernert had laughed off questions about the reports.
 
Men, a March, a Book
 The men marched in Washington, and now Crown Books is running to publish a commemorative book of photographs from the Million Man March for Christmas. The book, "Million Man March," a collection of more than 125 images taken by 20 photographers, is to be put together by Deborah Willis, the curator of exhibitions for the Smithsonian Institution's national African-American museum project.
The text is to be written by Michael Cottman, a journalist and a host for "Flashpoint" on PBS.

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: Jonathan Kozol;
Listening to the South Bronx

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
MY friends tell me: 'You look worn out, Jonathan. I'm worried about you,' " said Jonathan Kozol, perched on a battered counter stool, its cover worn to the wood, at B&V pizza and doughnuts in the South Bronx.
"They take me to fancy restaurants in midtown Manhattan, but I lose my appetite. It just seems strange. I'd rather be here. My digestion is better. I mean this $2.35 tuna sandwich tastes good to me, and I don't have to think which fork to use." 
 For almost three decades, Mr. Kozol has been plumbing the depths of poor inner-city neighborhoods and the children who live there, first as an idealistic young teacher in the Roxbury section of Boston, then as a celebrated advocate for the poor and forgotten, now as what even he takes to be something of a relic of an earlier age of urban optimism.
His labors have won him widespread acclaim and awards, as well as some degree of skepticism from critics who contend that he walks a fine line between crusading reporting about the urban poor and pious moralizing that is short on solutions.
Like or dislike his books, it is hard not to see the descending arc of urban policy and the worsening plight of the inner-city poor in Mr. Kozol's evolution, from the crusading optimism of his first book, "Death at an Early Age," to the angry pessimism and tentative, weary spirituality of his most recent work, "Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children and the Conscience of a Nation" (Crown Books, 1995), a depiction of Mott Haven in the South Bronx.
"I wrote the first book, and I thought people would say: 'Separate and unequal schools in the City of Boston? I didn't know that. Let's go out and fix it,' " he said at the B&V, a small eatery at St. Ann's Avenue and East 138th Street.
"I thought then the problem was lack of knowledge," he continued. "Now I think it's lack of will. Now, I don't expect what I write to change things. I think I write now simply as a witness. This is how it is. This is what we have done. This is what we have permitted."
Mr. Kozol's odyssey began in 1964, when he returned to Boston after graduating from Harvard University, studying at Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar and spending four years as an aspiring writer in Paris.
Amid the excitement of the civil-rights era, he began teaching black children in Roxbury, first in a summer freedom school, then as a fourth-grade substitute teacher. He was dismissed for teaching unauthorized texts, specifically the poetry of Langston Hughes.
His journal from the 1964-65 school year was turned into "Death at an Early Age," which won a National Book Award and is often ranked with books like Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring," Ralph Nader's "Unsafe at Any Speed" and Michael Harrington's "Other America" as an influential work that both reflected and shaped the conscience of its time.
Since then he has written about "Illiterate America" (1985), about homelessness in "Rachel and Her Children" (1988) and about the disastrous state of urban education in "Savage Inequalities" (1991).
Publisher's Weekly, for the first time in its history, endorsed "Savage Inequalities" on its cover, imploring President George Bush to read it. The book went on to become a best seller.
On the other hand, some critics have found some of his books hectoring and self-righteous, as Christopher Lehmann-Haupt did in The New York Times. In his review of "Illiterate America," he wrote: "Eventually, one begins to wonder who precisely Mr. Kozol means to be whipping with the sodden lettuce leaves of his incessant piety."
Mr. Kozol, who is 59 and divorced (he has no children), speaks in soft, precise, professorial inflections. Although he admitted that his brand of consuming liberal angst was utterly out of fashion, he said that this says more about the times than about him.
"I talk to people, and they grow impatient," he said. "They say: 'Well, of course, we know all that. Tell us something new.' There's this kind of urbane equanimity about it, spiced with irony, like a cultivated kind of weariness. It's like you can't speak of this without incurring the charges of self-righteousness. But to me the central fact of life in New York City is the terrible sin hidden in the center of the city's romance."
To him, that sin is the racial segregation and crushing poverty in places like the South Bronx, where he spent the better part of the last two years while researching and writing "Amazing Grace." He writes of mothers with AIDS shuttled between unfeeling bureaucracies, of the children who make their way through an urban wilderness of crime, drugs and abandonment and of the children who die young there. A postscript lists 23 children who died while he was working on the book.
He was asked if some of his concerns, like his discomfort at being at parties where the food is served and the cleaning up is done by black maids, just as it was when he was a boy a half century ago, might come across merely as liberal guilt. This discomfort can also apply to other aspects of his life. In Byfield, Mass., a picturesque New England town where he lives in a 200-year-old farmhouse, "the golden retrievers have a nicer place to play than the children do in the South Bronx," he said.
"I'd say there's a lot to be guilty about," he continued. "A culture in which guilt is automatically assumed to be neurotic and unhealthy has devised a remarkably clever way of protecting its self-interest. I mean, what I've seen in this neighborhood and in similar neighborhoods for 30 years isn't a misfortune that happened by mistake. This is an injustice. This is an artfully created lazaretto, and I think those powerful people who created it have a lot to be guilty about and ought to be condemned. And the people in this book frequently do condemn them."
We left the restaurant and walked around the neigborhood, two white men in suits lost in conversation amid the bodegas, Caribbean music and crowds of young black and brown men on street corners.
There were so many deaths during the two years he was in Mott Haven that he stopped constantly to explain who died, when and how and in which building, becoming more intense as we walked along.
When I stopped and stooped to tie a shoelace in front of Public School 65, one of the 16 most troubled schools in the city that the new New York City Schools Chancellor, Dr. Rudy Crew, put under his direct control last week, he squatted down with me and kept talking without missing a beat.
"What's the newest slogan?" he asked. "Let's make it a 'site-based school,' a 'restructured school'? The solution for a bad ghetto school is to have a site-based ghetto school or a ghetto school with ghetto choices for ghetto children. But in New York and America no one asks why we still have ghetto schools a quarter century after Dr. King's death and why it isn't even questioned now."
As we walked down from P.S. 65, two officers in a police car eyed us warily, then cruised by and stopped.
"Do you know where you are?" the officer behind the wheel asked Mr. Kozol. "What are you doing here?"
Mr. Kozol explained that he was a writer. The officer looked at him as if he were crazy and encouraged him to get off the streets.
"You stand out like a sore thumb," he said. "I'm not going to tell you what to do, but you stay out long enough, and like on 'Monty Python,' you're going to have a 60-pound weight fall from the sky onto your head."
As Mr. Kozol turned a corner past the school, a hollow-eyed beggar in rags walked toward him, his hand out in a halfhearted begging gesture in a part of the city where the pickings must be exceedingly slim.
Instead of avoiding him, Mr. Kozol quickened his step as if he had fortuitously happened upon an old friend, dug his right hand into his pocket, pulled out a $5 bill and pressed it into the stunned man's hand.
After his two years in the South Bronx, Mr. Kozol said he had lost 30 pounds and had begun suffering from asthma, like so many of the people who live there. To some of his friends, these signs are just more evidence that he has gotten more involved in his story than is healthy, personally and perhaps journalistically.
He faces no such criticism from the people he has gotten to know in the South Bronx, like Alice Washington, a sharp-witted woman with AIDS who is a main character in the book. Or Dale Prentice, who works in the after-school program at St. Ann's Episcopal Church. Or the Rev. Martha Overall, the church's pastor. Or Aurea Picart, grandmother of Bernardo Rodriquez, an 8-year-old who fell to his death down the shaft of a faulty, bullet-riddled elevator in 1994. Mr. Kozol established a memorial fund called Remembering Bernardo, which he hopes to finance with proceeds from the book and with donations.
He lingered for a while at St. Ann's, an island of peace amid the turmoil of Mott Haven, and then walked me down to the Brook Avenue subway station.
"I have an enormous sense of having failed in life," he said, as the northbound train stopped and then clattered away. "If I had succeeded in everything I had tried to write, starting in 1965, there wouldn't be a neighborhood like this. Now there are more, and they're worse than ever before. I feel, in the end, as if everything I've done has been a failure."

HEADLINE: The Risks of Lettting Russia Disengage

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is vice president for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Carnegie Endowment.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The meager results of this week's lunch-hour summit between President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin will strengthen skeptics in both countries who say we should stop pretending to be "partners."
Zbigniew Brzezinski has called Russia "irrelevant," and this sneering term enjoys a minor vogue even at the State Department. In Moscow, Anatoly Adamishin, Ambassador to Britain and among the most likely successors to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, expresses a surprisingly similar view. Although he has for years been one of his country's most pro-Western diplomats, Mr. Adamishin now calls on Russia to "step to the sidelines." There's no need for all-out hostility toward the West, he wrote recently, but for the foreseeable future Russia will be too weak to be taken seriously by the United States and its allies. Better, then, to stand alone. 
 To date, both Governments have rejected the case for disengagement, as they should. Yet the rhetoric of "partnership" has grown perfunctory, and the reason is simple: neither side has taken the idea seriously enough to give it any real meaning.
Today Russian-American relations are a textbook case of how not to build lasting cooperation between great powers. It can't be built on charity (in any case, our aid to Russia is too small to affect large decisions). Nor can it be built on blackmail -- on fear of what the Russians might do if we don't stay on good terms with them.
Earlier this year Russian and American diplomats thought they might give the relationship a boost by reaching a special "understanding" between Russia and NATO. But the Russians reject anything that legitimizes NATO expansion, and the Americans fear a Russian droit de regard over Eastern Europe. Right now, neither side can gain from grand but empty agreements.
The idea of sending Russian and American peacekeepers to Bosnia is also turning out to be a loser. Cooperating on a job that neither side's military really wants to do, and that has little support in either country, may sink relations, not salvage them.
As a last resort, advocates of Russian-American partnership fall back on the "tens of thousands of nuclear weapons" defense. The two sides, it's said, have to work together to shrink their arsenals. True, and yet the enterprise is decidedly backward-looking. The need to mop up after the cold war is a weak basis for future cooperation.
If Russian-American relations stay on their present course, the case for "irrelevance," (or worse) will carry the day in both countries. "Partnership" will seem a serious undertaking only if it is connected to the real concerns that are likely to dominate each side's foreign policy over the next decade or so.
Start with nuclear weapons. For the first time since the beginning of the nuclear age, the big problem that Russia and America have to address is not how to deter an attack by the other. It's how to deal with new nuclear powers, especially so-called rogue states with access to high technology.
To deal with this emerging threat, both former superpowers are going to take a greater interest in building defenses against ballistic missiles. They can do so without threatening each other (and in fact their common interest is strong enough to justify joint research and development). But this won't happen automatically: If Russian-American relations worsen, it will be easy to ignite the Star Wars controversies of a decade ago, and the whole effort could bog down.
Across the board, our ability to deal with future security problems will be less if we have to cope simultaneously with problems of the past. Yet our policies rarely recognize this fact. Vast amounts of geopolitical pundit-time go into thinking about how to deal with the looming emergence of China as a military and economic colossus. Russian-American relations, strangely, are almost never treated as part of the equation.
This is a mistake. Isn't it obvious that, if we ever had to organize a broad coalition to contain China, Russia's orientation would be crucial? For that matter, aren't we less likely ever to need to organize such a coalition if China sees that the other major powers enjoy good relations that would make it easy for them to unite?
In other regions, Moscow will play a crucial role in determining the success or failure of American diplomacy. Russia has, in fact, helped to strengthen Ukraine, which many regard as a fulcrum of peace and security in Eastern Europe. Its policy toward Iran, by contrast, is damaging.
But whether we agree or disagree with Russian policy is not the issue; it's how to advance our interests. It will be far harder to offer meaningful support for Ukraine if Russian-American relations deteriorate. By the same token, it will be far easier to turn off Moscow's nuclear deliveries to Iran if relations improve.
In the shadow of the Russian-American dispute over NATO expansion, it may seem hopeless to address the problems sketched here. But they should not be left for later. What both sides need now is help in gauging the real costs of a break over NATO. They need a clearer sense of whether partnership will pay off in the future, or remain a matter of rhetoric. Not finding out means accepting "irrelevance," and paying its price.

HEADLINE: The Risks of Lettting Russia Disengage

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is vice president for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Carnegie Endowment.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The meager results of this week's lunch-hour summit between President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin will strengthen skeptics in both countries who say we should stop pretending to be "partners."
Zbigniew Brzezinski has called Russia "irrelevant," and this sneering term enjoys a minor vogue even at the State Department. In Moscow, Anatoly Adamishin, Ambassador to Britain and among the most likely successors to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, expresses a surprisingly similar view. Although he has for years been one of his country's most pro-Western diplomats, Mr. Adamishin now calls on Russia to "step to the sidelines." There's no need for all-out hostility toward the West, he wrote recently, but for the foreseeable future Russia will be too weak to be taken seriously by the United States and its allies. Better, then, to stand alone. 
 To date, both Governments have rejected the case for disengagement, as they should. Yet the rhetoric of "partnership" has grown perfunctory, and the reason is simple: neither side has taken the idea seriously enough to give it any real meaning.
Today Russian-American relations are a textbook case of how not to build lasting cooperation between great powers. It can't be built on charity (in any case, our aid to Russia is too small to affect large decisions). Nor can it be built on blackmail -- on fear of what the Russians might do if we don't stay on good terms with them.
Earlier this year Russian and American diplomats thought they might give the relationship a boost by reaching a special "understanding" between Russia and NATO. But the Russians reject anything that legitimizes NATO expansion, and the Americans fear a Russian droit de regard over Eastern Europe. Right now, neither side can gain from grand but empty agreements.
The idea of sending Russian and American peacekeepers to Bosnia is also turning out to be a loser. Cooperating on a job that neither side's military really wants to do, and that has little support in either country, may sink relations, not salvage them.
As a last resort, advocates of Russian-American partnership fall back on the "tens of thousands of nuclear weapons" defense. The two sides, it's said, have to work together to shrink their arsenals.

HEADLINE: For the Debate On Debt Limit, No Usual Script

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
By anybody's standards, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin is plenty rich. But even his staff blanched a bit when one of his predecessors, James A. Baker 3d, suggested recently that a quirk of Federal law would make Mr. Rubin personally liable for any Federal debt incurred after the Government hits a $4.9 trillion ceiling on borrowing sometime in the next two weeks.
The good news for Mr. Rubin is that the Treasury Department's lawyers think Mr. Baker was probably wrong. The fortune the Treasury Secretary accumulated on Wall Street -- roughly $100 million, or enough to keep the Government running for about 33 minutes -- is safe. 
 The bad news for Mr. Rubin is that he is already caught, politically if not financially, at the center of what has become a giant game of chicken in which both the White House and the Congressional leadership blame the other for pushing the country to the brink of default. And he is playing with two equally unpredictable opponents, Congress and the markets.
On Capitol Hill, the freshman class of Republicans have called the shots on this issue so far, using tactics President Clinton today characterized as "economic blackmail, pure and simple." On Wall Street wary traders are wondering whether the risk of lending money to the Government may be about to rise sharply.
The two are playing off each other and that combination has turned what was once a fairly simple political contest into a financial one with enormously high stakes.
Many in Washington and Wall Street say wearily that they have seen all this before. And they have. Time after time, Congress has threatened to hold an increase in the debt limit hostage -- preventing the Government from raising money it needs both to operate and to pay off Treasury bonds -- unless it gets its way on the budget. Democrats have made the threats in years past, and so have Republicans. After predictable histrionics, it has always ended without disaster.
But this time, a growing number of Democrats and Republicans say, an overreliance on history could be misleading.
The freshman and sophomore classes of House Republicans have made clear that they have no intention of sheathing their most potent weapon against President Clinton. They have yanked their Speaker, Newt Gingrich, back in line whenever he has seemed on the verge of suggesting a way to separate the budget debate from the authorization to borrow more money.
And President Clinton, after weighing the politics of it all, sounds like a man who thinks that Congress -- rather than the White House -- will end up taking the rap for sending financial markets into chaos if the United States flirts with failing to pay investors. He said as much today.
"For all their loose talk," Mr. Clinton said, "the Congressional leaders know that if they were to allow us to go into default, this would have a severe impact on our economy, on financial markets, and on the interest rates paid" by government, business and homeowners.
But in the next breath, Mr. Clinton said he would not let that risk force him to sign a budget he hates. "If they send me a budget that says simply, 'You take our cuts or we'll let the country go into default,' I will veto it," he concluded.
The problem, Mr. Clinton and his advisers know, is that it does not take an actual default to shake the markets. A credible threat of it can send interest rates up, especially if foreign investors are so spooked that they are tempted to invest their cash elsewhere -- say, in German marks.
The fear is that if this goes on, the Government might be faced with paying an "America premium," a slight increase in the interest rate demanded by investors for putting their money into Treasury securities. The phrase is drawn from the "Japan premium" that Japanese banks are now paying investors -- in the form of higher borrowing rates -- for the risk of investing in the tottering Japanese banking system.
"I think that this has already influenced the cost to the U.S. Government, and perhaps the value of the dollar," David DeRosa, a senior trader at the Swiss Bank Corporation, said.
 Other traders say it is impossible to tell if the argument over the debt limit is nearing the point at which it starts to exact a cost. Government bonds are now trading at their lowest levels since early 1994, indicating that the Government's borrowing costs are lower than they could be.
Still, warnings about upsetting the markets are usually all it takes to bring bickering politicians in line. But in the past few days the usual logic has worked in reverse. Mr. Gingrich said recently that he thinks the White House is using the potential reaction in the markets as a lever to win its way. Mr. Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company who spent years overseeing trading in government securities, has found his expertise more hindrance than help.
"Bob Rubin goes up to the Hill and talks about the signals to the markets, and they look at him like he's speaking Swahili," an official close to the Treasury Secretary said the other day. "This generation of Republicans doesn't know about the markets, doesn't care about the markets and enjoys making that clear to Bob at every turn."
But Mr. Rubin's expertise could come in handy. Given the political stakes, Mr. Rubin does not go into much detail about the wide spectrum of options he has to keep the United States from actually defaulting while the budget arguments play out. There are alternatives to a straight default -- in which the Government simply refuses to meet its obligations to existing bondholders -- but each, he said, has "serious and unresolved legal and policy issues," and all of them might cost a lot of money.
For example, he could stop the ordinary practice of putting cash held in Social Security or Medicare trust funds into Treasury securities. That would create more room for the Government to borrow money to pay its bills. But it would also deny the Social Security fund a safe way to earn interest on its holdings. In the current political environment, that would probably open the White House to charges that it was playing with senior citizens' money to win its way on the budget.
The debt debate continued to build this week. On Tuesday, Mr. Gingrich charged that Mr. Rubin was manipulating the date when the United States would run out of borrowing authority. The real deadline kept shifting, he complained, from Nov. 15 to Oct. 30 to Nov. 6. "We're waiting to see," Mr. Gingrich said. "Secretary Rubin has now changed by a week in a week."
Mr. Rubin said that he has been clear and consistent. The Republicans, he said, "don't want to hear the facts."
Postponing a coming debt auction to raise $100 billion or attempting makeshift ways to raise the money would affect rates, he said, "and on $100 billion, even a small increase in the interest rate can cost you a lot."

HEADLINE: Purchase for Preservation Fills a Gap in Putnam County

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: PHILIPSTOWN, N.Y., Oct. 25

 BODY:
Capping a four-year effort to preserve one of the last unspoiled tracts of woodlands and pasture in the lower Hudson River Valley, a private conservation group has purchased Glynwood Farm, a 957-acre estate here.
More than 700 of those acres are to be added to a surrounding 3,700-acre arc of forest already bought by the same group, the Open Space Institute. If New York State finds the funds, all that property is to be added to the adjacent Clarence Fahnestock Memorial State Park. 
 "We've finally plugged the hole in the doughnut," said Kim Elliman, president of the Open Space Institute. He said the $6.25 million purchase completed an effort by the institute to expand the protected lands in the Hudson Highlands, a mountain range bisected by the Hudson River 50 miles north of New York City.
The purchase, which was completed on Tuesday, was made with a grant from the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands, a trust set up in 1983 by the founders of Reader's Digest to preserve unspoiled parts of the Hudson Valley.
In 1991, the surrounding forest was also bought with Wallace Fund money by the institute. It is already being managed by the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation as an annex to the park, which is visited by about 220,000 people a year.
The parks office will now also manage the new 727-acre tract, which filled a vulnerable gap in the map of protected lands in western Putnam County. "This is a parcel we've been very interested in for a very long time," said Julia Stokes, a deputy commissioner for operations in the parks office.
The land will also be used by thousands of schoolchildren from New York City who each summer visit the adjacent Taconic Outdoor Education Center, which is also operated by the parks office, she said.
The core of the estate, 230 acres of cow pastures, ponds and farm buildings, will remain a working farm and will also house a newly formed nonprofit group, the Glynwood Center, that will study ways to mesh local economic growth with preservation of natural resources, said Judith LaBelle, the group's president.
Ms. LaBelle said the Glynwood Center planned to work with Putnam County and Philipstown officials to find ways to expand the local economy while preserving the rural landscape that gives the region its appeal.
The Glynwood Center will operate as an affiliate of the Countryside Institute, an existing private group that has done similar work with communities as far afield as Prince Edward Island, Canada, and Spring Hill, Tenn., Ms. LaBelle said.
Glynwood Farm was bought from the heirs of George W. Perkins, a financier who at the turn of the century was a partner of J. Pierpont Morgan, the industrialist and financier. Mr. Perkins, a noted conservationist, was one of the creators of the Palisades Interstate Park system, a chain of preserves west of the Hudson River.
For many years, the family had opened the farm to visits by schoolchildren, and that tradition would be expanded at the new center, Ms. LaBelle said.
Today, as patches of sunlight slid across the orange woods and green fields, Ms. LaBelle greeted visitors from the St. Agnes Children's Rehabilitation Center in Carmel, who were petting several Black Angus calves. Eight severely disabled children, accompanied by teachers and parents, reached through a fence toward several calves.
As Brian Desatnick wheeled his 4-year-old son, Lloyd, in a stroller along the edge of a pasture, he surveyed the corrugated ranges of fall-flamed hills and said, "It's terrific that this won't be developed."

HEADLINE: Emil Jonassaint, 82, Ex-Haiti President, Dies

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

 BODY:
Emil Jonassaint, the jurist who served last year as the puppet President of the military junta that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, died on Tuesday at his home in Port-au-Prince. He was 82.
Officials said Mr. Jonassaint died of natural causes. Several high-ranking military officers associated with the military junta have been killed recently in suspicious circumstances. 
 A former Supreme Court justice, Mr. Jonassaint was appointed President on May 11, 1994, by a rump Parliament to fill the vacuum left by the ouster of Mr. Aristide in a coup on Sept. 30, 1991.
But four months later he and Jimmy Carter signed an agreement that led to the departure of the military junta dominated by Gen. Raoul Cedras and to the return of Mr. Aristide.
Initially, the United States had shunned all contact with Mr. Jonassaint, describing him as nothing more than the nominal head of an illegal Government recognized by no other nation. But in a last-ditch effort to avoid an American invasion, Mr. Jonassaint was allowed to join other Haitian officials in two days of increasingly tense negotiations in Port-au-Prince with an unofficial American delegation headed by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell; Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, and Mr. Carter, the former President.
The resulting agreement, signed on Sept. 18, 1994, with American troops already in the air on their way to Haiti, called for General Cedras and other military leaders to give up power and allow Mr. Aristide's return to office in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions and passage of an amnesty. One day later, 20,000 American troops began landing in Haiti, meeting no resistance and incurring no casualties.
Mr. Jonassaint's brief tenure was marked by widespread violations of human rights, the suspension of basic constitutional guarantees and frequent accusations that he had betrayed the principles of the legal profession in his zeal to serve the military rulers of Haiti. He imposed a state of emergency, and also expelled a United Nations-Organization of American States Mission that had been monitoring human rights abuses, giving them only hours to leave the country.
During his five months in office, Mr. Jonassaint became known for his habit of scheduling his most important official pronouncements at odd hours of the night, sometimes as late as 2 A.M. American officials mocked that custom, saying he was afraid to face his own people, but Haitians merely assumed he had selected that hour after consulting voodoo priests.
Mr. Jonaissant was, in fact, an ardent believer not only in voodoo, but also in astrology, numerology and other schools of mysticism, all of which affected his policies and governing style. He was said by friends and other government officials to believe that Haiti was the last remnant of the lost continent of Atlantis, and that the United States coveted the country in order to locate and then steal the magic Philosophers' Stone.
Before the American troops landed, Mr. Jonassaint also boasted that voodoo spells would protect Haiti from enemy aircraft and predicted that an army of invisible voodoo warriors would arise to defeat any foreign troops foolish enough to attack. He urged Haitians to "mobilize all the resources and strategies of our ancestors" in resisting an American invasion.
A native of the northern city of Port-de-Paix, Mr. Jonassaint began his political career in the early 1950's, serving as a Senator in the military dictatorship of Gen. Paul Magloire. During the 30-year dictatorship of the Duvalier family, which ended in 1986, he withdrew from politics, however, and limited himself to practicing law and perfecting his knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin.
When a constituent assembly was organized to draft a new constitution in 1986, Mr. Jonassaint was chosen as its president. He served on the Supreme Court until 1991, when Mr. Aristide ordered him to step down because of his age, but he was restored to that position after the military seized power.
Once American troops landed, Mr. Jonassaint complained that the agreement bearing his name and Mr. Carter's was not being properly implemented, and showed reluctance to leave the National Palace. But with the disintegration of the armed forces that had been his only source of support, there was little he could do, and he finally left office quietly, just days before Mr. Aristide returned from exile in the United States.
After Mr. Aristide's restoration a year ago this month, Mr. Jonassaint dropped out of public life and spent much of his time, friends and associates said, rummaging through his extensive personal library, which included many law books and esoteric texts.
Family members, reached by telephone in Port-au-Prince, declined to disclose the names of survivors.

HEADLINE: Man in the News: John Joseph Sweeney;
New Fire for Labor

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
John J. Sweeney, the new president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., was not playing by Marquis of Queensbury rules when he told the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors in July that if it pushed through a plan to cut 18,000 workers from its payroll, his union would conduct "a massive campaign of resistance and retribution."
Mr. Sweeney, who has spent 15 years as president of the Service Employees International Union, warned the Los Angeles officials that instead of forcing labor to accept their plan, they had better show workers some respect and sit down with union leaders to discuss less-painful ways to make budget cuts. 
 And to show that he had some muscle to back up his threat, 3,000 members of his employees union were demonstrating outside. In a move that raised the ante, 20 protesters were arrested after they sat down and blocked traffic.
Just minutes after he was elected the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president yesterday, Mr. Sweeney told all who would listen to expect many more such confrontations. He said he was dead serious about jettisoning the federation's gentlemanly ways and about transforming it into an aggressive, often confrontational, voice for American workers.
"As your president, I will never forget that our movement grows by addition and multiplication, and not by division and subtraction," he said to the cheering delegates.
Mr. Sweeney also told reporters that he would visit President Clinton the moment he was invited so he can go over the issues important to labor. And inside the federation, he said he would conduct a review of all functions and immediately start changing the federation's ways.
In campaigning against Thomas R. Donahue, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s interim president, Mr. Sweeney made clear that he thought the federation had let labor become a patsy repeatedly victimized by management. In a debate on Tuesday at the federation's convention at the Sheraton New York hotel in midtown Manhattan, he told the union leaders that he deserved their support "if you are tired of being treated like so much road kill on the highway of American life."
Despite the vinegar of his words, Mr. Sweeney, who is 61, will never be mistaken for firebrand union leaders like the mine workers' John L. Lewis. Mr. Sweeney is soft-spoken and slow to anger, inspiring workers not through emotional speeches, but by talking to them in a heart-to-heart way showing that he knows their problems.
Judging from his years at the helm of the 1.1-million member Service Employees Union, experts predict he will lead the 13 million-member federation in several new directions at once. He promises to increase spending on union organizing more than fivefold, something he become known for at the service employees union, which spends 30 percent of its budget on organizing, compared with 5 percent for most unions. Under his leadership, his union has nearly doubled in size even as union membership nationwide remained flat.
He also promises to try to bring more women and minority members into unions, and particularly into leadership positions. He revamped his union's board so that 20 of its 57 members are female, black or Hispanic.
"If it hadn't been for Sweeney, people like myself never would have been on the executive board," said Eliseo Medina, head of the service workers' San Diego local, whose membership has jumped fivefold since 1985.
While the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has a reputation for focusing on protecting the best-paid workers, Mr. Sweeney plans to focus more on organizing and helping low-paid workers, like the 20,000 home health aides his union has organized.
At the debate on Tuesday, Mr. Donahue attacked Mr. Sweeney's plans to change the federation's direction: making it more combative. Mr. Donahue criticized a tactic by Mr. Sweeney's union to block traffic on bridges in September in Washington to draw attention to its continuing campaign to organize janitors. Unions should be building bridges, not blocking them, Mr. Donahue said.
But Mr. Sweeney says labor must be ready to engage in civil disobedience to command respect. "I believe in building bridges, whenever the shelling lets up long enough for us to put up steel and pour concrete. We need to be a full partner with our employers," he said. "But I believe in blocking bridges whenever these employers and those communities turn a deaf ear to the working families that we represent."
John Joseph Sweeney was born in the Bronx on May 5, 1934, to parents who had emigrated from Ireland. His mother, Tricia, was a cleaning woman, and his father, John, was a city bus driver who often took his son to meetings of the Transport Workers Union.
He attended parochial school, graduating from Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx and from Iona College in New Rochelle, where he majored in economics. He first joined a labor union while working as a grave digger during college. His first job after college was at I.B.M., but he was happy to drop that and take a job at two-thirds the pay as a researcher for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.
"John always wanted to be with labor unions," said his wife, the former Maureen Power. "Social justice is what motivates him. He has never forgotten where he came from." The Sweeneys have two children, Tricia, 23, who works for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s housing investment fund, and John, 26, who is studying to be a chef.
Mr. Donahue, who used to work for New York-based Local 32B of the service employees union, recruited Mr. Sweeney for a job in the union in 1960. Mr. Sweeney climbed the ladder at Local 32B, beginning as contract director, then becoming assistant to the president and, in 1976, president. At the local, which represents janitors, doormen and elevator operators, he led two citywide strikes of apartment workers.
In 1980, he moved to Washington to head the Service Employees International, where he developed a reputation as a rabble-rouser who wanted to shake up the labor movement.
"He would say that he wants labor-management cooperation, but he says it has to come when unions are in a position of strength," said Sandy Felder, head of a service employees local in Boston. "He says unions should be treated with respect. If they reach out their hand, and management pushes it aside, then he believes that hand should turn into a fist."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Turn Over Troops Accused of Murder or Rape to Japan

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Hoping to settle growing anger at crime by American soldiers in Japan, the United States agreed today to hand over troops accused of murder or rape.
The American concession is intended to defuse the passions provoked by the kidnapping and rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl in Okinawa last month, in which three American servicemen were accused of the crimes. 
 The three young men accused in the rape, who have not yet entered pleas, have perhaps affected Japanese-American relations more than anyone else this year.
That incident has provoked a broad rage and a growing campaign against American military bases.
Both the Japanese and American Governments are desperately trying to calm the fury before President Clinton arrives in Japan in the middle of next month for a summit meeting. The centerpiece of the meeting is supposed to be an agreement on the importance of the American-Japanese security relationship, but the public mood toward military cooperation has turned sour since the rape.
Today's agreement may not immediately diminish the demands for an American pullout from its bases in Japan, but it perhaps will go part-way toward easing the furor that has arisen since the rape in Okinawa. To many Japanese, it seemed galling that the American suspects were kept on an American base until their indictment, when they were handed over to the Japanese authorities.
Still, today's concession by the United States raises concerns about the legal protections afforded to American soldiers accused of crimes abroad. Japanese interrogators sometimes rough up suspects, or soften them up by depriving them of sleep, and that is why the United States in the past had not wanted to hand over American troops.
In addition, South Korea has already been demanding that the United States revise its procedures for handing over any troops suspected of crimes. Now Seoul is sure to press its demands even more.
Today's agreement is based on the "status of forces agreement," or the Sofa, a document that stipulates the rights and obligations of the 60,000 American forces in Japan. The Sofa now states that in most cases American troops suspected of crimes will be handed over to the Japanese authorities upon indictment.
The agreement today adds that that the United States "will give sympathetic consideration" if Japan requests custody of servicemen who are suspected of murder or rape but have not yet been indicted.
The clause is similar to one in the Sofa that covers American troops in Germany. But there the clause is almost never exercised, and American servicemen are normally handed over to German authorities only after conviction of a crime.
Although the Governments of both Japan and the United States want to maintain the existing bases in Japan, public opinion in Japan is ambivalent. In a recent poll by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, an economic newspaper, almost as many Japanese opposed the United States-Japan security treaty as favored it.
The poll showed that 40 percent said that the treaty should be abolished, while 44 percent supported it. The United States has gradually given up its claims to jurisdiction. In 1957, for example, there was a huge uproar when an American soldier shot and killed a Japanese woman.
There was a debate the in the United States about whether an American soldier could be tried in a Japanese court, but eventually the United States handed the suspect over and he was convicted. The soldier was never sent to prison, but was released and returned to the United States.

HEADLINE: A Budget Democrats Should Vote For

 BODY:
The House is scheduled to vote today on a remarkably sensible, though tough, budget plan sponsored by Democrats, mostly conservative. The plan will not pass, but the vote still matters. President Clinton is likely to veto the initial budget that the Republican-controlled Congress puts on his desk. His negotiating strength will flow from today's vote. If Democrats line up behind their colleagues' plan, then Mr. Clinton can pull the G.O.P. toward its provisions. But if the Democrats flee, then he is left with no option to fight for.
The Democrats' plan meets the stringent Republican test of balancing the budget within seven years. But the Democrats would more fairly spread the burden. Gone is the G.O.P.'s $245 billion tax cut that largely benefits upper-income families. That allows the Democrats to propose spending cuts 25 percent less severe than the harsh reductions proposed by the Republicans. Gone is the G.O.P.'s tax hike on the earnings of low-paid workers and the reduction in student loans. Also gone are Republican proposals to eliminate 60-year-old Federal entitlements for health insurance and cash assistance. 
 Attempting to be both fair and fiscally responsible, the Democrats would trim Medicare costs, in part by charging upper-income enrollees higher premiums, but they would take out about $100 billion less than the Republicans. Medicaid, the program of health insurance for the poor, would survive at lower levels and with a spending cap that adjusts for inflation and enrollment. The Republican plan calls for much larger Federal Medicaid cuts and takes no account of future enrollment and inflation surprises. The Democrats propose reducing cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other Federal benefits, but they cleverly design the system so that poor families should not suffer.
The plan has flaws, beginning with the Democrats' decision to match the G.O.P.'s goal of reaching a balanced budget on an arbitrary timetable of seven years. The goals and the timetable will require huge cuts in valuable public investments, including research, education and job training.
Indeed, discretionary spending under the Democratic plan could well drop as calamitously as it would under the Republican plan and, contrary to current law, the Democrats would no longer raise discretionary spending to offset inflation. Their proposed trims in agriculture subsidies -- one place where larger cuts would be fully justified -- are smaller than the Republicans'. The Democrats propose to tax the poor on the value of food stamps and on their disability insurance. They would also cap malpractice awards.
Still, the plan suggests the budget can be balanced by 2002 without pummeling the poor or Medicare. Liberals will not be pleased. But if the Democrats cannot back something like the budget their conservative colleagues have put forward, they will severely limit the President's bargaining leverage.
Correction
An editorial on Monday headlined "Save Sterling Forest" said incorrectly that a $2 billion bond issue would be decided in next month's New York State balloting. No such measure will appear.

HEADLINE: Labor Wakes Up

 BODY:
John Sweeney's victory over Thomas Donahue in the first contested election for the leadership of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. yesterday reflected the labor federation's recognition that it must change or continue to shrivel. But the campaign raised the possibility that Mr. Sweeney will waste his fresh start on convulsive organizing tactics when the federation needs not just energy but more sophisticated understanding of the global economy and the changing workplace to which it must adapt.
It is understandable, of course, that the delegates to the national convention in New York City this week want to shake off the lethargy that settled over the union movement during Lane Kirkland's tenure. Union membership in the United States has been shrinking drastically even though the value of ordinary workers' wages and their job security have been atrophying. But the campaign speeches about blocking bridges and getting arrested seemed oddly dated. Instead the new regime needs to start with an analysis of whether coal-mine and steel-mill tactics are the best way to win the loyalty of high-tech workers and the respect of corporations exploring new schemes of cooperative management. 
 To be sure, the awareness that something new was needed drove this election. Challenged by Mr. Sweeney's insurgent movement, Mr. Kirkland stepped aside last year and handed the leadership to his deputy, Mr. Donahue. But Mr. Donahue was shackled by the old craft-union legacy and came across as representing a failed status quo.
Mr. Sweeney, on the other hand, heads a union -- the Service Employees International Union -- that has almost doubled in size at a time when union membership in the nation has shrunk to 15.5 percent of the work force, its lowest level since the 1930's. Mr. Sweeney's most significant victories have come from his willingness to take on the classic, grinding and time-consuming task of the labor movement: organizing. He has done this by paying attention to those the labor establishment has most egregiously ignored: the low-paid, the non-white, the women.
He promises to continue and expand this commitment, spending more of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s considerable resources on organizing and political work and introducing a resolution to insure the diversity of its executive council. He promises to finance a political training institute, targeting vulnerable freshman Republicans in the next Congressional elections. He also wants to underwrite a labor-oriented think tank to answer the influential and ubiquitous messages of conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute.
Mr. Sweeney and others on his team have also expressed an understanding that to win public acceptance, the union movement must shake off the shadow of corruption and police itself vigilantly. He introduced a successful resolution to the convention to amend the federation's constitution by adopting an ethical practices code that includes possible suspension of corrupt unions.
All these steps will be needed to rejuvenate the labor movement, but Mr. Sweeney and his followers will need more than enthusiasm, commitment and honesty. They will need to develop a new, sophisticated understanding of the economic forces that have contributed to the weakened position of American workers. Demonizing corporations, while emotionally satisfying, will not deliver the new skills and productivity increases needed to give American workers more jobs at higher wages.

Let the Loser Lose

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
In a tie and suit, Fidel Castro, describing himself as a politician, flattered the media biggies gathered for lunch in Mort Zuckerman's Fifth Avenue apartment with: "You are the cream of the crop."
A dollop of sour cream came from this corner: If you claim to be a politician, why have you been unwilling for 36 years to face an opponent in a democratic election? 
 The Cuban dictator downmouthed elections as "a popularity competition between political personalities" engaged in by "speakers good at theatrics, demagogues and liars. I don't want to get involved in that kind of competition."
Fidel, the non-demagogue, is above all that. He took pains to remind us he won a law school election 180 to 33, and had perfected the techniques of organization and direct mail "even before your Christian right."
Then why not let the Cuban people vote? "I am not afraid, but we do not have presidential elections in our country." Later, he compared his selection to that of the Pope, elected by a ballot of cardinals.
All this nonsense is being peddled by the only totalitarian ruler in our hemisphere; his secret police informers, trained by the Stasi spies of East Germany, permeate every Cuban village and walk of life. Amnesty International counts 600 prisoners rotting in Cuban jails for daring to oppose the dictator's rule; the Stasi and the old K.G.B. would be proud of their pupil.
Castro, who rules by fear, avoids free elections because he is afraid he would lose. That should not be surprising because he is one of the great losers of our time.
After seizing power, he lost his revolutionary soul by taking Cuba down the Communist road to repression. He lost all chance for Cuban prosperity by burdening the people with 3.2 million government workers and a huge standing army to protect his regime from any need for elections. He lost Cuba's independence by making it a vassal of the Soviet Union, addicted to Soviet subsidies, renting out Cuban youth as mercenaries in Moscow's failed African adventures; and when that blood money dried up, Cubans suffered as never before.
Despite that record of colossal failure, he gets the loudest applause of all speakers at the United Nations. Why? Not for anything he has done for Cubans, nor for his necrophiliac love for a dead doctrine. His popularity in the striped-pants set is rooted solely in his four-decade defiance of the United States and his contempt for American democracy.
Every U.N. diplomat who envies and resents U.S. power gets a kick out of cheering Castro, who has clung to unelected power during nine elected U.S. Presidencies. (As the dictator denounced us, only the Israelis sat on their hands.) Turning biblical righteousness on its head, he is playing David to our Goliath, a strategy aimed at snatching one final, personal victory.
That is why he told the luncheon guests that "the U.S. is so astonishingly powerful that not even the Romans, Napoleon, the Germans in both world wars can compare. Your economic and political influence has no parallel." In the face of such power, unlike David, "we don't even have a slingshot."
This is the plaintive we're-no-longer-a-threat plea. End your embargo; send us your tourists; subsidize my regime with your investment money; help me adopt capitalism without freedom and rule for life with an iron fist; let me enjoy the last laugh at the exiles in Miami and the Colossus of the North.
This from the man who stunted Cuba's growth and jailed or exiled many of its patriots. To obscure his failure, the Communist who victimized his people is posing as the victim of a U.S. that he claims seeks "hegemony in a unipolar world."
Some U.S. business executives comfortable with state-monopoly deals help him sell this line; they're the same ones who assured us that trade would bring an end to repression in China. President Clinton cannot admit it publicly for fear of losing Florida in 1996, but if re-elected, I suspect he would end all pressure to bring down Castro, trotting out the same vague reason he used to embrace Vietnam: "It's time."
It will only be "time" when Dictator Castro quits or submits to free elections. Communism is tyranny that is bound to fail. Let the loser lose.

Tape at King Fraud Trial Reveals Threat by Accuser

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
Don King's lawyer continued yesterday to question the credibility of a crucial Government witness in the promoter's Federal mail fraud trial.
Joseph Maffia, King's former controller, has testified in United States District Court in Manhattan that King told him to falsify training expenses for Julio Cesar Chavez in order to make an allegedly fraudulent $350,000 insurance claim when an injury to Chavez forced the cancellation of his fight against Harold Brazier on June 28, 1991. 
 Maffia said King directed him to pad the claim in order to recover part of a $736,000 advance the promoter made to Chavez on March 18, 1991.
Peter Fleming Jr., King's lawyer, played a tape of a telephone call Maffia made to King in May 1992, eight months after being forced to resign.
The call began with the usually low-key Maffia loudly threatening physical violence. "Do you understand this?" he shouted.
King apparently did not recognize Maffia's voice and sounded confused.
"Is this my dear friend?" he said. "My landsman?"
After Maffia repeated his threat, King said, "Landsman? Landsman?"
"Who the hell do you think this is?" Maffia shouted.
"I don't know," King said.
To Fleming, Maffia said: "I just wanted to yell at him."
Maffia told Paul Gardephe, the Assistant United States Attorney, that he was angry at King for challenging his claim for unemployment benefits, seeking to revoke his state accountant's license and for an unspecified personal matter.
One point of great personal contention between the two men, writes Jack Newfield in "Only in America," a new biography of King, was their involvement with the same woman. (Earlier, United States District Court Judge Lawrence McKenna ruled that notes of conversations between Newfield and Maffia revealed "no evidence or impeachment material" that could be used by King's defense team.)
The defense wants to portray Maffia as an unreliable former employee -- one who wanted to be a promoter himself -- who is lashing out at King. Playing the tape was one strategy, but Fleming also tried to impeach him by eliciting vague and contradictory answers from the accountant.
An important element of King's defense is that the $736,000 advance against Chavez's next purse was insured under a $750,000 policy obtained by Maffia.
But Maffia told Fleming that advances were not insurable.
Asked if he had told King that the $736,000 was not insurable under the policy, Maffia said, "No, I did not." He added: "We did not insure the $736,000 so I did not tell him." Maffia said Tuesday that he found only about $150,000 in claimable expenses, including $80,000 for Chavez's training.
Maffia also said that he did not tell the retail broker, Gagliardi Brothers Insurance, the specifics of what he wanted to insure and did not read the insurance binder that was sent to him that laid out the conditions of insurance.
Gardephe scored points when Maffia read from a Don King Productions bookkeeping journal that showed handwritten entries, made after he stopped working for King, for Chavez's training costs of $80,000 and another for $270,000.
Together they add up to the $350,000 in training and "maintenance" costs that King's company fashioned for its insurance claim.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
DU PONT (E. I.) DE NEMOURS & CO. (DD,N)

 BODY:
The shares of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company fell yesterday after the company, the nation's largest maker of chemicals, reported third-quarter earnings that made investors nervous, even though they surpassed analysts' expectations.
At midday, trading was halted for almost an hour because of an order imbalance. The stock traded as low as $60.125, down about 8 percent, after the interruption. It closed at $61.125, down $3.875. 
 After charges and gains, the company's net income was $769 million, or $1.38 a share, up 18.9 percent from $647 million, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier. And it was higher than the average prediction of $1.34 a share by 15 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Du Pont had 18 percent fewer shares outstanding than it did a year earlier, after its repurchase of shares from the Seagram Company this year.
Revenue rose 3.9 percent, to $10.4 billion from $10 billion, the company, based in Wilmington, Del., said. Some of the increase came from an increased allocation of earnings from its pharmaceuticals joint venture with Merck and Company. Du Pont's chemical shipments were unchanged.
"The quarter was a warning of potential disaster for the fourth quarter, next year and into '97," said Paul Raman, an analyst at S. G. Warburg & Company. The results of Du Pont's core businesses reflected much slower growth in Europe and the United States, he said.
Andrew Cash, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., said that with chemical prices high, customers were tapping inventory rather than buying more chemicals.
Du Pont's president, John A. Krol, said, "The business climate in the third quarter was difficult, as growth in key global economies slowed." (Bloomberg Business News)

HEADLINE: A Temple of 80's Chic Gets a Corduroy Makeover

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY JACK WARD 

 BODY:
COULD it be true? Could it be that Morgans Hotel -- the harbinger of Eurostyle in New York, the prototype "designer hotel" when it opened in 1984 -- had become tired? Or -- as its French designer, Andree Putman, put it, "use jusqu'a la corde" -- threadbare?
Eleven years, one recession and one Return to Comfort later, it was all too true. Wear and tear aside, all that black and white and gray was no longer cool, just cold. And so last spring the hotel's owner, Ian Schrager (who also owns two other temples of interior chic in New York, the Royalton and Paramount hotels), asked Ms. Putman to return to the project that first propelled her to international fame. 
 Once a monument to designer excess, Morgans, at 237 Madison Avenue (37th Street), has gone soft, warm, vanilla. Well, more caffe latte, really. If the early-80's Morgans was a top-heavy power suit, the new-and-improved Morgans is a slouchy pair of corduroys.
Throughout the hotel, the palette has softened from cool, silvery tones with black-and-white-check accents, to a warmer, subtler mix that ranges from sandy to sandier. It is as if someone had gently fiddled with the little knob that adjusts the color on a television screen.
"These days, the less you see, the better you feel," Ms. Putman said.
The new lobby sets the tone: The sleek but uncomfortable designer-statement armchairs have been replaced by flea-market treasures. There are pairs of weathered caramel-colored leather club chairs that are inviting and familiar. A 19th-century mahogany, teak and rattan planter's chair sprawls by the front door. The three-dimensional design of the carpet is the same, but its new palette makes for a very different effect.
Styles of decorating change just as styles of living do. In 1977, Mr. Schrager could be found glittering the night away at Studio 54, which he owned with Steve Rubell, who died in 1989. But now, at 49, Mr. Schrager looks forward to spending the evening with his wife, Rita Narona-Schrager, and their daughter, Sophia, 2.
Ms. Putman, too, has changed. "I am not a saint, quite the opposite, but my passion now is to change life a little bit, to improve daily life," she said on a visit to New York in early October to supervise the finishing touches of the $1.3 million renovation. "I believe design is redemptive. The new goal is to create things that last."
The recent renovation of her duplex apartment in Paris, on the Left Bank served as a laboratory for Ms. Putman's new ideas. A new understanding of home coincided with the birth of her grandson, Alexandre, now 2. "The reality of my house is scenes spent with the child," she said. "Home exists, to my eyes, for him."
Her list of design dislikes remains the same: "Too much Louis-someone, too big flowers, too much the desire to intimidate. And I do resent the obligation of using lavish materials, pretending to be Versailles. The French have a heavy sense of decor, having never recovered from Louis XIV not being here anymore. But it is a painful and stupid nostalgia."
Ms. Putman seems equally disdainful of those who are obsessed with newness and acquisition. "For all the threatening advertising, and wanting so desperately to be in, suddenly people are realizing that buying things doesn't save" in the redemptive sense, she said, adding: "Design became a kind of show business. That even a teapot should be designed anew by an architect is so depressing, when China or Africa are filled with the most beautiful objects."
The guest rooms at Morgans Hotel were once dressed in sleek black leather, gray flannel and stainless steel and trimmed with a black and white checkerboard frieze. That was replaced by the new warmer palette. To make the small rooms look less cramped, beds and chairs are no higher than 16 inches from the floor. The original framed botanical photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe remain.
The headboards and window seats are now covered with a dove-gray washable synthetic suede. The aggressive right angles of a buffalo-plaid blanket have been replaced by a coffee-colored throw soft enough to wear, as Ms. Putman did during her stay, occasionally draping it around her shoulders.
Most emblematic of what the designer calls her new "obsession for warmth" is the boxy armchair, generously scaled, with a very deep, soft seat. It is covered in thick wide-wale corduroy the color of rich cream. Ms. Putman absently petted it with her fingertips as she mused, "Stroking this chair is a real pleasure."
Throughout the hotel, walls have been given a flecked finish that resembles pink granite. It is a spray-on pointillist concoction of specs in three similar colors. The overall effect is of a slightly taupey speckled eggshell.
But guests at the hotel, who pay $195 to $250 a night for a regular room, can still take a stroll on the wild side: A narrow stairway off the lobby leads down to a dark bar lighted only by quirky candlesticks and votive candles wedged into brick walls. Mr. Schrager asked Calvin Tsao, a New York architect and a protege of I. M. Pei, to create the bar in what had been a storage room.
"I was thinking Cocteau -- a grotto, very dark, mysterious, just a little sinister and surreal," Mr. Schrager said. A glowing translucent marble bar slashes diagonally through the room. On each side of the bar are totem-like wood stools designed by Chris Lehrecke, a Brooklyn artist.
One recent day, Ms. Putman took a break from putting Euroflash out of its misery and watched the people in the compact lobby. Four young men and women, snappily dressed, struggled through the front doors, loaded like pack mules with at least two shopping bags each from Brooks Brothers, Swatch, Banana Republic and the Gap, insignias a-flying.
"It is obscene, isn't it?" she whispered, referring to their trendy haul. "That will not console them, not for a moment."

HEADLINE: Giuliani? He Wouldn't Get Castro's Vote

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

 BODY:
Sitting at a polished oval conference table at The New York Times yesterday, Fidel Castro broke from his characteristic political discourse to make a pronouncement.
"I would not vote for the Mayor," he said of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Yet, despite the glittery galas and concerts that Mr. Castro missed at Mr. Giuliani's behest, it is something more profoundly prosaic that galls him about the Mayor's tenure. 
 "It's not just because he didn't invite me to dinner," the Cuban President said with a grin, "but because on my way into town from the airport there were such enormous potholes."
On his last day of a five-day visit to New York for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, Mr. Castro met for nearly two hours with the publisher of The New York Times and several editors at the paper's offices.
Speaking through his longtime interpreter, who not only mimicked his expressions but at times ended his sentences, Mr. Castro answered an assortment of questions, touching on his visit to the United Nations, political prisoners in Cuba and the fall of the Soviet Union.
Mr. Castro punctuated his remarks with disarming humor and, at times, long-winded asides. He wore his recently disclosed wardrobe of international diplomacy -- a starched white shirt, gold cuff links, a red tie and comfortable shoes.
The suit and tie, however, were no more than superficial accouterments. As the 69-year-old Mr. Castro tackled the tough questions first, then the more lighthearted, he showed no signs of bending his political will to suit others, defending his rule in Cuba as a form of democracy that enjoys deep public support.
Replying to a question about Cuba's longstanding policy of imprisoning dissidents, Mr. Castro agreed with estimates by Amnesty International that some 600 Cubans are in prison for political reasons.
But he quickly defended the policy, saying he was not alone in jailing those who fight against the state. Mexico does the same, he said, as do Argentina, France, China and a host of other countries.
Showing a keen knowledge of the United States political landscape, he spoke about Ross Perot and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but saved his most admiring words for President John F. Kennedy. He described Mr. Kennedy as a formidable opponent in the "positive sense" because he had the courage to stop the attempted invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs. "He is a man for whom I feel respect," he said.
Now, however, it is General Powell who has captured his attention. He said he ordered 46 translators to transcribe the general's recently published autobiography into Spanish, for reading by himself and by senior Cuban officials. His hectic schedule, however, has kept him from any bedtime reading.
On the economic front, Mr. Castro said Cuba was beginning to make headway, citing an increase in foreign investment and the large number of tourists and foreign entrepreneurs visiting the island. This openness, he said, poses a security risk, but one he is willing to take.
Emphasizing a recurring theme of his visit, Mr. Castro said he refused to abandon his principles and Cuba's sovereignty by moving toward democracy just to meet conditions set by the United States for lifting its economic embargo.
"This is not a business deal," he said. "This is not about bargaining."
Mr. Castro called his trip, his first to New York since 1979, successful, saying he tried to accommodate many of the 200 invitations he received to different functions. He went to a church in Harlem, a banquet hall in the South Bronx, a media executive's Fifth Avenue apartment and the homes of millionaire business executives.
He ended the day by meeting for two hours with about 100 religious leaders, overwhelmingly Protestant, at Cuba's United Nations Mission.
Mr. Castro joked about a trick he played in 1957 on a determined Times reporter, Herbert L. Matthews, in the Sierra Maestra, when his small band of guerrillas had been all but written off by the outside world. "We tried to give Matthews the impression that there were more of us," Mr. Castro said, recounting how he ordered the same troop of weary soldiers to parade past the reporter again and again.
Two years after Mr. Matthews interviewed Mr. Castro, his revolutionary movement had grown, and in January 1959 his forces swept into Havana. The visit by The New York Times to his remote encampment, he said, had been "really very helpful."

HEADLINE: Record S.E.C. Settlement by Merrill and Lazard Expected

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
In the largest settlement of its kind in municipal finance, Merrill Lynch & Company and Lazard Freres have each agreed to pay about $10 million to settle charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission over a secret fee-splitting contract that the two firms mantained.
 
 The settlement is expected to be announced by the commission shortly. At the same time, people close to the investigation said, a Federal grand jury in Massachusetts is expected today to indict Mark S. Ferber, a former Lazard partner. Mr. Ferber, a municipal-finance expert, is suspected of having collected more than $1 million a year in secret fees for Lazard from Merrill Lynch for steering business to Merrill from 1989 to 1993.
 The case reflects to new emphasis by the S.E.C. on cleaning up municipal finance, which has long been plagued by political payoffs and other forms of corruption.
 Even so, the arrangement between the two investment firms was highly unusual. Mr. Ferber, who had been hired by municipalities as a financial adviser, would recommend to his clients that Merrill Lynch be selected to conduct lucrative swap transactions. In less than three years, Merrill paid Lazard a total of $2.6 million for Mr. Ferber's recommendations.
 This arrangement was outlined in a contract between the two firms, the terms of which were to have been kept secret. In making the settlement, the two firms are neither admitting nor denying guilt. The S.E.C. settlement comes over charges that the two firms violated Federal securities laws by not disclosing the fee-splitting arrangement to Lazard's financial advisory clients, who were relying on Mr. Ferber's recommendations.
 In addition to settling with the S.E.C., the firms are also settling with the state of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Water Resources Agency. Mr. Ferber was hired by Massachusetts as an independent adviser to help arrange financing for municipal projects, including the cleanup of Boston Harbor, then one of the largest such projects in the country.
 During the course of the contract, Merrill and Lazard were incolved in six specific fee-splitting deals involving interest-rate swaps recommended by Lazard to its municipal clients and underwritten by Merrill. In nine other deals, Merrill Lynch served as a municipal bond underwriter, and Mr. Ferber was the financial adviser and in a position to recommend the hiring of Merrill.
 Richard Y. Roberts, a former S.E.C. commissioner, praised the impending settlement. "This is a good news to municipal-finance investors," he said after getting a description of the settlement. "And the size of the fine indicates the S.E.C. intends to address the kinds of shenanigans that were once part of the municipal-finance landscape. This is a strong step to restoring integrity to the municipal marketplace."
 The combined penalities of roughly $20 million are by far the largest ever brought by the S.E.C. in a municipal-finance case. Last August, in what was then the largest municipal penalty in S.E.C. history, a St. Louis brokerage firm, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, paid $1.44 million to settle a fraud case.
 The Merrill-Lazard case is one of a series of enforcement actions being brought by the securities commission in the municipal-finance markets. Currently, the agency is investigating possible fradulent actions in the sale of municipal bonds in Orange County, Calif., which is under bankruptcy protection, and in connection with the building of the new Denver International Airport.
 Merrill Lynch is also being investigated by the S.E.C. over its role in the sale of taxable Orange County bonds, as well as the sale of derivatives to the county's failed investment pool.
 People close to the Massachusetts investigation said the indictments on charges that Mr. Ferber defrauded his clients would be issued today. His lawyer, Catherine Weinman, would not comment on these reports.
 As part fo the settlement, the S.E.C. is delaying taking any civil action against Mr. Ferber, pending the outcome of the exected criminal charges. This delay came at the request of the United States Attorney in Boston, according to people close to the investigation, so that information currently held by the S.E.C. would not be available to Mr. Ferber through the civil discovery process that could be used as part of a criminal defense.
 This would be the second time that Merrill and Lazard paid sizable fines over a fee-splitting arrangement. The two recently paid a total of $3.6 million to the District of Columbia, which had hired Mr. Ferber as its financial adviser. Upon Mr. Ferber's recommendation, Merrill was hired to conduct two interest-rate swaps.
 As part of the settlement, no other restrictions have been placed on the firms by the S.E.C. in the conduct of municipal finance. Merrill Lynch is one of the largest municipal bond underwritters in the country, while Lazared often serves as a municipal-finance adviser to public agencies.

HEADLINE: Placing Bets On a New Medicare

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
When an elderly person breaks a hip, the typical hospital stay is just seven days. That is at least three fewer days than was the case a decade ago, before Medicare switched to a flat payment system for each illness or injury.
 
 But while the payment system was meant to cap Medicare spending, it wound up doing the reverse. Because such patients are hardly ready to dance home after a week, they are transferred to nursing homes for follow-up care. Medicare pays again, often at $400 a day, and it may pay later for therapy in the patient's home. "The Government ended up paying at least twice," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care securities analyst with Sanford C. Berstein & Company.
 In short, Medicare could not stop being a boon to health care providers, producing often-unexpected opportunities financed by an ever-flowing spigot of tax-payer dollars. Nursing homes and home health care companies that were quick to seize these opportunities segued easily into Medicare's services for the elderly and disabled and became Wall Street favorites.
 But now, if the Republican-controlled Congress has its way, it will be time for some of health care's fastest-growing sectors to pay the piper. Over the next seven years, $270 billion will be squeezed out fo projected Medicare payments, under budget-cutting bills now coming through both houses of Congress.
 In part, the latest shift is simply a matter of speeding the process of change spurred by managed care and other cost-containment efforts.
 "The cuts will accelerate a lot of things that are happening already, because employers have become very cost-conscious," said Richard L. Scott, chief executive of the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, the rapidly growing for-profit hospital chain that already controls close to 10 percent of the hospital business in the country.
 But in their overall impact, the proposed changes - like those instituted a decade ago- would repaint the landscape of the $1 trillion-a-year health care system, producing new peaks and valleys that promise shocks and surprises for patients, investors and employers, not to mention the heatlh care providers themselves. The deep budget cuts are certain to produce pain for some providers, analysts say, but new opportunities, both aniticipated and unanticipated, for others.
 The potential losers, at least among groups, seem obvious. Under the House bill, hospitals would receive almost $78 billion less in Medicare payments over the next seven years, the home health care industry would lose $17 billion and certain nursing homes about $10 billion. Home-oxygen suppliers, whose revenue had been growing by 15 percent a year, would also be reined in.
 But here would be winners, too, within these groups, because providers that have already been adapting to the changing health care market would be in a position to capitalize on the belt-tightening. Hospital chains like Columbia and the Tenet Healthcare Corporation would have new opportunities to grow by acquiring weak nonprofit hospitals pushed under by the cutbacks.
 The cuts would "just push us to be more aggressive in streamlining the delivery process and accelerating the consolidation of excess facilities and capacity," Mr. Scott said. "It will accelerate our growth."
 Columbia, which as 325 hospitals in 36 states and has announced plans to acquire at least 9 more, gets 45 percent of its $17.5 billion of annual revenue from Medicare.
 Wall Street has already been handicapping the prospects of companies throughout the health care industry. In most cases, it expects profits to be squeezed, as the proposals now stand. Nursing home and home health care stocks have been hammered this year. But H.M.O. stocks, after taking their own hits from lowered earnings growth earlier this year, have rebounded, partly on hopes for growth as Medicare pushed the elderly toward manage health care. Meanwhile, companies that make medical devices have also gained, but for a different reason: the Republican campaign to lower Federal regulatory hurdles for new products.
 Among analysts' new favorites, besides hospital chains, are the so-called physician practice management companies like Phycor Inc. Pacific Physician Services and Caremark International. These companies "rent" the services of doctor groups to hospitals and managed care plans.
 Other favorites are a few nursing home companies, like Manor Care Inc., that mainly serve patients who have private insurance.
 Drug companies are not affected by the proposed Medicare cuts, but they are lobbying hard for the chance to raise prices for Medcaid programs for low-income people.
 The planned budget cuts still have to clear several legislative hurdles and the threat of a White House veto. The health care industry will be lobbying for chantes down to the wire, but some version of stiff cuts seems likely. Following is alook at the potential impact fo the cutbacks, sector by sector.
 Hospitals
 Health care experts say the most successful hospitals will be those, like Colmubia's, that build networks of outpatient clinics, groups of regional physicians, nursing homes and home health care services. As a result, they will be able to offer one-stop shopping to H.M.O.'s and big employers. By contrast, hospitals that try to go it alone will face hard times, the experts say.
 The House bill would permit hospitals and doctor groups to compete with local Medicare health maintenance organizations by dealing directly with employer groups. These new provider-sponsored H.M.O.'s might succeed by grabbing customers from the insurance companies, eliminating the middleman. But the new groups could also lose if established H.M.O.'s retaliated by no longer referring patients to them.
 In addition to physician management companies like Phycor, "we might see a new little industry to help doctors and hospitals manage the risks by becoming more efficient," said Kimberly A. Purvis, a securities analyst with Doaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
 Mr. Scott said Columbia would consider establishing its own H.M.O.'s on a market-by-market basis. In cities like Nashville, where columbia is dominant, it has used its power to push for advantageous deals with the H.M.O.'s in town, analysts said.
 Mr. Scott noted that Medicare' rates have not kept pace with inflation since 1993, while payments by employers have actually declined. Even so, Columbia has thrived, he said, by cutting its own costs and increasing the flow of patients into its hospitals and outpatient clinics.
 H.M.O.'s
 For H.M.O.'s and other health insurers, the Medicare legislation is a mixed bag. Both the Senate and House bills encourage beneficiaries to join Medicare H.M.O.'s, which are already growing fast. But there would be sharp cuts in payments for Medicare H.M.O. patients in high cost markets like New York, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles.
 Analysts said the rate reductions would hurt Humana Inc, which has a big presence in south Florida, and Pacificare Health Systems in California, which gets 56 percent of its revenue from Medicare. In New York, Oxford Health Plans and U.S. Healthcare have been adding Medicare members, but they are a small part of their businesses.
 H.M.O.'s in lower-cost markets like Minneapolis have been promised higher pavments for elderly patients. The increases would alos encourage H.M.O.'s and other managed-care health plans to move into rural areas that they previously shunned, said George C. Havorson, president of Health Partners, a big Minneapolis H.M.O.
 In New York, for example, higher rates might attract companies like Oxford and U.S. Healthcare to expand in upstate counties.
 Nursing Homes
 The outlook for nursing homes is even more complicated. The House bill "is a nightmare for us," said David R. Banks, chief executive of Beverly Enterprises, which operates 700 nursing homes throughout the country.
 The payment squeeze on post-hospital therapy, which the industry calls "subacute care," would affect more than one-fourth of Everly's revenues, which were $834.9 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. "It would push us back into custodial care," where profit margins are much lower, Mr. Banks said.
 Nursing homes want Congress to adopt a version of the fixed-rate payment system for hospital care to cover the post-hospital care they provide.
 Worried investors have driven down the stock price of nursing-home companies like Integrated Health Services, which runs nursing homes for post-hospital Medicare patients. But Manor Care, a nursing-home chain that gets less than 15 percent of its revenue form Medicare, remains a favorite.
 Home Care
 Home health care companies also face many problems. The House bill cuts $2.5 billion over the seven years from homoe oxygen services, which received only $1.4 billion from Medicare last year. The Senate bill cuts even deeper, $4.5 billion.
 Home oxygen services have grown rapidly as equipment has improved and the population has aged. With Medicare picking up 60 percent of the bills, companies like Lincare Holdings Inc. and a precursor of Apria Healthecare Group went public in the early 1990's and then used stock to acquire smaller companies. But hefty profit margins, exceeding 30 percent, drew the attention of Government officials, who argued that Medicare payments were too high. The companies disagree.
 Now, the cmpanies' patients are sending thousands of letters urging members of Congress to soften the blow of the impending payment cuts.
 Tim Aitken, president of Apria, hinted that his company might move away from providing home oxygen for Medicare patients if the cuts siphoned off profits. Already, he said, the company was able to offer lower costs on other types of high-technology home care to H.M.O.'s in the highly competitive California market.
 Erik Wiberg, a health care analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said small home health companies that provide health aides and nurses would also be squeezed by the heavy Medicare cuts. Big home-nursing companies like the Olsten Corporation, could also be hurt.
 Labs and Equipment Makers
 The House bill also clamps down on payments for laboratory tests and medical equipment like wheelchairs. Analysts said this business was important to Apria, the Retech Medical Corporation and American Homepatient Inc.
 The bill would cut $6 billion from projected spending increases for clinical laboratories over the seven years. Lab companies like the Laberatory Corporation of America and the Metpath unit of Corniag Inc. would also face competition from doctors who would be freed from restrictions on owning and operating labs.
 "Laboratories have been a tough business for the last several years, and this will just make it that much tougher," Mr. Wiberg said.

HEADLINE: Militant Is Elected Head of A.F.L.-C.I.O., Signaling Sharp Turn for Labor Movement

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

 BODY:
With the election of John J. Sweeney yesterday as the new president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. the American labor movement took a sharp turn toward militancy, rebuilding union membership, moving women and minorities into the policy-making ranks and tackling in hostile Congress.
 
 Mr. Sweeney, 61, the longtime president of the 1.1 million-mmeber Service Employees International Union, won the votes of delegates representing 56 percent of the 13 million members of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Individual unions are allocated numbers of delegates in proportion to the size of their membership, so that small unions have just one delegate and the largest have more than 20.
 Mr. Sweeney defeated Thomas R. Donahue, 67, the federation's second highest ranking officer as secretary-treasurer for 16 years and president since August, when Lane Kirkland retired rather than face a Sweeney-led revok against him.
 With the announcement of the results in the convention hall of the New York Sheraton hotel, a man who openly accused the union movement of sliding toward irrelevance was handed Mr. Donahue's gavel, marking an immediate transition of power and the end of the Kirkland regime.
 With little comment beyond thanking his family, his service employees' union and the delegates, Mr. Sweeney then won the unanimous approval of the creation of a new office, executive vice prsident, which the Donahue forces had fought, and the unanimous election of his candidate, Linda Chavez-Thompson, 50, a vice president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
 Ms. Chavez-Thompson joins the other victor on the Sweeney slate, Richard L. Trumka, 45, president of United Mine Workers union. All three members of the new leadership mark an emphatic shift back to the labor movement's militant roots, with promises to blockade the economy and go to jail in promoting the interests of workers, especially those at the bottom of the wage scale.
 In nominating Mr. Sweeney, George J. Kourpias, president of the 448,000-member machinists union, spoke of a "humble and decent man, more a listener than a talker," who "understands there are times when you have to block bridges" and "who will put the movement back into the labor movement." The service employees' organization that Mr. Sweeney led for the last 15 years is one of the few unions that have grown throughout organized labor's decades of decline.
 After the election, Stephen P. Yokich, the new president of the United Automobile Workers, said: "This is the first time in 20 years there's excitement. I heard someone say we have in defend the middel class. Well, that's right. But we've got to defend from the middle class on down."
 Dally Willis, an official of the Communications Workers of America form Austin, said some bitterness over the election remained in the hall. But he said, "I'm just thinking about the job we have to do - go out and fight for workers."
 It was hard to find skepticism among women, who make up a third of all union members, and blacks, who make up a fifth, about the opportunities promised them by an institution that had become one of the nation's few prominent bastions of white male leadership.
 In negotiations between the Donahue and Sweeney sides that continued until early this morning the federation established a new policy making executive council of 54 mostly union president, but including 15 women and minorities, or 27 percent of the total. It succeeds a 35-member council with 6 women and minorities, or 17 percent of the total.
 "If they're not serious, they're getting serious," said Tony Hill, who si black and secretary-treasurer of the federation's Florida affiliate. Bernard Moore, a black New York staff member of Mr. Sweeney's union, said: "He believes in it. His heart is in it.
 Marjorie Taylor, a black delegate from a service employees' local in Baltimore, said, "John Sweeney personally gave me a fair start." He later moved heronto his union's board.
 Jennifer Trudeau, a white woman who is president of an operating engineers local in Jackson, Mich., said, "They're realized that women are part of the labor movement."
 Creating the new council was a feat of intense negotiations to solve two problems: accommodating unions that supported Mr. Donahue, many of them small, and broadening the mix of the membership. Mr. Donahue entered the convention proposing a council of all the federation's 78 union presidents, plus three top officers of the federation.
 Mr. Sweeney wanted to expand the membership to just 45, which would have meant adding unions supporting him, as weel as some women and minorities, who would not have been union leaders.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Using Creative Accounting to Reduce the Federal Deficit

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
WHEN Congress sells an oilfield, should the proceeds count toward reducing the budget deficit? To most economists, such a move is "pure window dressing." in the words of William D. Nordhaus of Yale University.
 Window dressing or not, Washington's latest foray into creative accounting does offer an excuse to examine how far the practice of deficit reduction has drifted from the theory. What started as an effort to increase national savings and investment is now a cause leacking any clear economic rationale.
 To cover budget deficits, Washington routinely sells Government bonds. To cover the deficit over the next few years, members of both political parties have decided to throw in some tangible assets: oil reserves, power plants in Alaska, the air rights to Union Station in Washington. What is the difference between selling bonds and selling of fields?
 None, by the reckoning of economists. Selling either reduces the private savings available for private investment in, say, factories or housing.
 Most elected officials presumably understand this. Even if they do not, they can read the law: order 1987 amendments to the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act, Congress explicity prohibited the "scoring" - counting - of asset sales as a deficit reducer. Why, then, the new enthusiasm for legislating a few dozen exceptions?
 For some, it seems a golden opportunity to get the government out of businesses in which is has no business. Selling off the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve in California certainly fits this category. For others, it is a way of locking in constituents' Government perks that may be threatened by future administrations. The sale of hydroelectric dams and irrigation systems at bargain-basement prices to local cooperatives belongs here. For yet others, it is a way of getting past powerful lobbies. Auctioning the oil right in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a sale long fought by environmental groups, fits here.
 But for many - including President Clinton - it is a means of delivering on promises to balance the budget with the least political pain: every dollar "earned" from selling Government assets is one less dollar that has to be cut from Medicare or highway repairs.
 So what else is new? Washington ussually makes policy with generous helpings of indirection. If the goal - maintaining the monentum toward a balanced budget - is a worthy one, why quibble over a few political compromises along the way?
 Robert Eisner, an economist at Northwestern University and a former president of the American economic Assoication, does not think the goal is espeically worthy. Fire sales of assets, he says, "are just one terrible consequence of budget-balancing paranoia." And while Mr. Eisner's convictions on the subject are unusually strong his contention that deficit reduction is no longer anchored in good economics does touch a nerve.
 The point of deficit reduction, most economists agree, is to reduce consumption to make resources - human and physical - available for investment. But the Government budget makes no distinction between investment and consumption. Nor, if Congress has its way, will it distinguish between revenues gained by reducing private consumption and revenues gained by selling productive assets. As a result, the current exercise of budget-balancing may reduce investment or increase it, depending on the composition of the revenues raised and the expenditures reduced.
 The only way to clarify the consequences would be to keep a separate set of books for capital spending. By this reckoning, a balanced budget would be one in which any additions to Government-financed assets like buildings and airplanes.
 And why doesn't the Government keep its books this way? In part, the reasons are that "cash flow" accounting is the way it has always been done and that capital accounting would create ways of cloaking deficit spending. Rudolph G. Penner, an economist at the Barents Group and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, worries that they gray area between consumption and intangible investment in health and education will be an invitation to expand the definition of investment. "How would the Clinton Administration count children's vaccinations?" he asks.
 It is undeniably true that the possiblities for fudging the books would rise: simply changing the rate at which the Air Force depreciated F-16 fighters or estimated the value of its real estate could change the deficit by $5 billion in a single year. But most state and local governments already use capital budgets, so there is plenty of experience to discipline the process.
 In any case, the clear and present danger of using asset sales to balance the budget and the subtler folly of failing to distinguish between cuts in Government spending and investment suggest that the current accounting system is fatally flawed. "The whole point is to know what you are actually doing." Mr. Nordhaus argues.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Germany's Central Bank Moves Spark Little Change in Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Conflicting signals from Germany's central bank confused currency traders yesterday, leaving the dollar little changed.
 
 The president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, "has been making comments left, right and center," said Chris Iggo, an international economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "It seems the Bundesbank is trying to contain some of the moves that happened this week."
 On Monday, Mr. Tietmeyer made comments that the market interpreted to mean that a strong mark was best for Europe, further leaving in doubt whether Germany would join the rest of Europe in a single currency by 1999.
 His remarks also stirred suspicions that Germany might not intervene in the markets on the dollar's behalf as it had this spring. The suspicions led the mark higher. On Tuesday, Mr. Tietmeyer apparently indicated that the Bundesbank might buy dollars.
 But such central bank intervention failed to materialize, and yesterday Mr. Tietmeyer said that cooperation between leading central banks could take several forms, not just inervention.
 In addition, he called recent moves in foreign exchange exaggerated and not reflective of fundamentals.
 "There's not much else going on, so the market is focusing on these views," Mr. Iggo of Chase Manhattan said. "But you have to question how much they are prepared to do. "It's just verbalizing at the moment."
 In New York late yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.3923 marks from 1.3944 marks on Tuesday and to 1.1326 Swiss francs from 1.1364 Swiss francs. The British pound edged up to $1.5785 from $1.5784.
 The dollar rose to 101.23 Japanese yen from 100.51 yen. In traditing between the mark and the yen, speculative investors sold the yen, helping the odllar's rise.
 Yesterday, currency traders were also watching several political developments in Europe.
 The Italian Government of Prime Minister Lamberto Dini may collapse today if a no-confidence vote succeeds, which would throw the lira into further turnmoil.
 In Spain, the 1996 budget was voted down yesterday, hurting the peseta and helping the mark.
 In other currency trading the Canadian dollar was fairly stable after seesawing the last several sessions over the possiblity of a separatist vote in Quebec succeeding Monday.
 Traders may be beginning to square their positions ahead of the vote, analysts said. In New York, the Canadian dollar was at 73.03 United States cents yesterday, down slightly from 73.13 cents on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Market Place

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
HISTORY never repeats itself. But that doesn't stop people from looking for historical patterns.
 
 One of the exhibits now being passed around by the dwindling number of stock market bears is the accompanying chart, which shows what happened to the Dow jones industrial average from February 1918 through 1934, and the Nasdaq composite average from February 1984 through the end of last month. The advances are some-what similar: 327 percent for the Dow through September 1927 and 313 percent for the Nasdaq through last month.
 The chart is based on one put together by Walter E. Stone, a Boston technical analyst whose publication, Long-Term Technical Trends, has a following among some institutional investors. He believes a sharp plunge in prices will come.
 Comparing the Dow to the Nasdaq may seem to be a stretch, but the Dow back in the 1920's was not as stodgy an index as it is now. It included Radio Corporation, which could be viewed as the Microsoft of that era. The Nasdaq index has been an especially strong index this year because of its technology components.
 Mr. Stone argues that the widespread belief that stocks will rise, year after year, at about a 10 percent rate "has produced a mutual fund mania that has created a tremendous speculative bubble in the U.S. stock market."
 "Since we are all inside the bubble, it is difficult to appreciate its true scope," he said "Yet, based on our studies, we believe it will ultimately take its place in the financial history books along with the Tulip Mania and the South Sea Bubble."
 Chart comparisons are, of course, a risky business. After the 1987 crash, a number of charts appeared comparing 1967 to 1929. The aftermath has been quite different.
 Still, there is no doubt that this market has its speculative elements. And for those how think past is prologue, it does look a little alarming.

HEADLINE: September Home Sales Reached Highest Rate in Nearly 2 Years

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes jumped to the highest level in 20 months in September as buyers took advantage of falling mortgage rates, a real estate group said today.
 
 Sales of previously owned homes rose seven-tenths of 1 percent - the fifth consecutive monthly increase - to an annual rate of 4.15 million units from a rate of 4.12 million units in August, the group, the National Association of Realtors, said.
 The rate was the highest since annualized sales of 4.17 million units in January 1994, the association said. It stood 7 percent above the rate a year earlier as prices edged back down after rising in August.
 Declining mortgage rates spurred most of the buying, economists said, adding that housing should continue to bolster the economy as rates were likely to remain low.
 "In view of the recent further declines in mortgage rates, we should expect additional gains in home sales in the fourth quarter," said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist at the First National Bank of Chicago.
 Regionally, sales rose in the Northeast and Midwest but declined in the South and West.
 "Even though the market is doing well, it is a case where buyers are still demanding some pricing descipline," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation.
 The median price of an existing home fell to $115,200 in September from $117,600 in August, the real estate agents' group said.
 Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 7.64 percent in August and 8.64 percent a year ago, the group said.
 The rebound in housing after sluggishness last spring is spilling over into purchases of furniture, appliances and other furnishings, economists said. It contributed about half a percentage point to economic growth in the third quarter, some analysis estimated. The Government's first report on third-quarter economic growth will be released on Friday.
 "I think the big implication of the existing home sales is more toward consumer spending on durables because there are a lot of things that go into houses like appliances, carpeting and furniture," said William Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. "It basically points to an economy that should be probably a little but stronger than what people expect in the third and fourth quarters."

HEADLINE: New York City Is to Lose Jobs in Pataki Transfer

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Pataki administration is preparing to transfer several hundred state workers from New York City to the Binghamton area, state officials said today.
The move would mark the third time this year that the Republican administration has announced plans to shift state jobs from predominantly Democratic legislative districts to heavily Republican ones. Word of the latest move drew criticism from Democrats and state labor unions. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki is expected to announce a group of job transfers, about 1,350 in all, in a news conference outside Binghamton on Friday. The workers will move from several state-government offices, including some in New York City. They will be transferred to a former I.B.M. office building in Glendale, about 180 miles northwest of Manhattan.
It was not clear today how many of those jobs would come out of New York City. Pataki administration officials have said in the past that about 1,050 of the transfers would be from offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Today, they said the number would be signficantly less than that, though they gave no figures.
Administration officials contend that the move will save money by allowing the state to consolidate several operations under one roof.
But Democratic legislative leaders attacked the move as "geographic patronage" intended to bolster the economies of Republican regions at the expense of Democratic areas.
"This is just one more chapter in the shell game they are playing, all under the heading of geographic patronage," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, whose lower Manhattan district could lose as many as 200 of the jobs. "The way to grow the economy is to grow private-sector jobs. You don't grow the economy by taking jobs from one region and moving them to another."
Mr. Silver and Assemblywoman Eileen C. Dugan, whose Brooklyn district is expected to lose most of the jobs, sent a letter today to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani imploring him to fight the transfer. "New York City has enough experience fighting to retain jobs from questionable economic development practices of neighboring states," it said. "Now the state administration is actually joining New Jersey, Connecticut and others to take jobs from the city."
But Robert J. Bellafiore, Mr. Pataki's press secretary, said the move would save the state millions of dollars by consolidating computer operations spread over several sites. "Surely, the Speaker of the Assembly is not suggesting that we should have inefficient, expensive government that doesn't perform for the people of our state."
The administration has already announced two other impending transfers of state jobs from a Democratic stronghold, Albany, to Republican areas. Albany is the only county outside New York City that voted against Mr. Pataki in 1994.
In September, Mr. Pataki said the state will move 800 workers from Albany to a former I.B.M. building in Kingston that the state plans to buy. Fleet Bank also agreed to move 2,650 part-time and 500 full-time employees who process tax returns for the state from Albany to the Kingston site. Kingston is represented by Republicans in both houses of the Legislature.
Several weeks ago, the administration said it would transfer 630 workers from Albany to Troy. Troy is part of the district represented by the state's second most powerful Republican: the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno.
Officials with state labor unions joined with the Democrats lawmakers in branding the planned job transfers a political payoff for loyal Republican areas. "It looks pretty obvious to us to see what they are doing," said Stanley Hornak, a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 95,000 state workers. "We don't think state workers should be pawns in a political game."

HEADLINE: Strong Profits Fail to Help Stock Market

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
American corporations are generally reporting better-than-expected profits for the third quarter, continuing a successful string that goes back two and a half years.
But this has not been enough to prevent nervous investors from sending stocks down sharply this week. Some have apparently seized on a few signs of consumer weakness -- notably an indication that more people are having trouble paying their bills. And others could be worried that while earnings are up, the pace of growth slowed in the third quarter and is expected to slow further in the last three months of the year. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average yesterday fell 49.86 points, pushing the average down more than 90 points for the week, with financial stocks leading the way. [Page D8.] Much of the nervousness came from one earnings report, from a home mortgage lender called the Money Store. It reported higher profits, but investors seized on the fact that the number of overdue loans was up sharply. Shares in the Money Store are down 28 percent since the report came out on Wednesday.
Over all, corporate earnings in the third quarter jumped almost 17 percent, the 10th straight quarter in which earnings exceeded expectations and the 14th quarter of double-digit growth in per-share earnings for the companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
But investors may focus more on the spottier performance during the summer quarter. Perhaps more important, the rate of profit growth at many of the nation's largest companies slowed significantly from the second quarter, despite what seems to have been a rebound in economic growth.
Worries about the near-term sustainability in the stock market's advance may also help explain an apparent slowing in October sales of mutual funds that invest primarily in stocks. The slowdown followed a three-month runup that made the third quarter the strongest in the history of the mutual fund industry. [Page D8.]
"In the aggregate, third-quarter profits are good," said Thomas McManus, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "Some companies continue to provide big, positive surprises. But more companies are starting to trip over the earnings bar than previously. At this time of the year, that raises caution among portfolio managers."
All of the returns are not yet in. But as the list of reporting companies lengthens, it is apparent that the third quarter was a difficult one for cyclical industries like automobile manufacturers and makers of home furnishings, as well as producers of basic materials like paper and steel.
But despite a notable stumble by the International Business Machines Corporation, profits at most other high-flying technology companies stayed high. A fairly benign interest rate environment helped financial service companies. Oil companies posted very strong gains. And an exceptionally warm summer pushed up profits at utilities.
According to Zacks Investment Research, a Chicago-based company that tracks earnings estimates of about 2,500 analysts, earnings at the companies that make up the S.& P. 500 index as of yesterday were up 16.8 percent from last year's third quarter.
That is a strong gain, but it nevertheless represents a slowdown from profit growth in both the first and second quarters, when earnings at the S.& P. 500 companies rose by 24 percent and 23.6 percent, respectively. Ben Zacks, an executive vice president at the research company, said analysts expected earnings growth to slow further in the fourth quarter, to an estimated 13.7 percent. "This is what has everybody concerned," he said.
Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said: "I think the problem starts in the fourth quarter. We are looking for sort of a weak profit level in 1996." In his view, the chances that the economy may fall into recession are about "five in seven," he said.
Still, the reported results have exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts, the professionals whose quarterly earnings forecasts can influence the tone of the stock market. The 16.8 percent increase is a full percentage point higher than expected before the reports started to roll in.
Of the roughly 1,950 companies that have reported earnings since the end of September, results at 53.5 percent of them have exceeded expectations, Mr. Zacks said, while 33 percent are below estimate. The 10 consecutive quarters of pleasant surprises is the longest string since 1985, when Zacks began tracking earnings estimates.
As of yesterday, about two-thirds of all companies operating on a calendar year, and roughly 80 percent of those in the S.& P. 500 index, have reported their results for the third quarter.
While an earnings slowdown may furrow some brows, it comes as no surprise. Indeed, given the length of the current expansion, economists and analysts have been impressed with the fact that corporate profits have stayed so strong for so long. As a percentage of gross domestic product, corporate profits are the highest they have been in more than two decades.
"At this point in the business cycle, you would expect profit growth to slow," said Gordon Richards, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington. "The largest gains in profitability often occur early in the cycle."
Even though a slowdown may be expected, few analysts are suggesting that profits in the fourth quarter and into next year are about to go into decline. In large measure, that is because the underlying factors that have generated such big increases over the last few years remain in place. Interest rates are relatively low, keeping a lid on borrowing costs. Wage rates are still under control. And inflation is still fairly tame.
"Profits have been this strong for this long because most of this growth is from the effectiveness of capital, which is replacing people," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. "The tools we are putting into people's hands are better, and the returns are going to people who make the tools, not to the people who use them."
Barring a recession, or an unexpected spike in inflation or interest rates, some analysts say corporate profits could continue to grow at a healthy clip for some time, in no small measure because of a shift in attitude among executives about their importance.
"It used to be that you looked at the economic environment, did your budgets, and profits were what was left over," said Gale Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board. "Nowadays, profits are not just left to fate. Prolonged periods of declining profits are not acceptable. Profits will still respond to recession. But in a period that could basically be considered to be normal, you will continue to see profits grow."

Mexican Peso Dives, as Economy Treads Water

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Although Mexico's major companies posted third-quarter earnings this week that were no worse, and in some cases noticeably better, than had been expected, a spasm of uncertainty sent the peso today into its deepest slide since March. It closed here at 7.2 pesos to the dollar.
In a sign of investors' anxiety, the Mexico City stock market sank this morning along with the peso, then rebounded later in the day to close down eight-tenths of 1 percent. In the last week, the main stock index has lost nearly 7 percent. 
 The Government insists that the worst financial hardship is past, but most Mexicans have yet to feel any relief from the economic plunge that began with the devaluation of the peso in December 1994. And the relatively positive corporate results have not been positive enough to calm widespread queasiness about Mexico's underlying stability or the prospects for overall recovery.
As expected, Mexican companies that are tied to the domestic market or that depend on Government contracts showed dismal results, bBut several leading export-oriented companies were able to exploit thriving markets abroad for this country's now-inexpensive goods. Others lifted their earnings by slashing costs and pushing out local competitors.
"Mexican companies are pretty much holding their own," said Christopher Taylor, an analyst with Interacciones Global Inc., a Mexican broker based in New York. "And since everybody was expecting a really poor third quarter, a little bad news amounts to good news."
On Tuesday, Telefonos de Mexico, the nation's phone monopoly and the stock market's benchmark issue, reported an 11 percent decline in quarterly earnings, mainly because of a lag in Government-fixed prices for telephone service. The stock fell again today, with Telmex's American depository receipts closing in New York at $26.625. down $1.375, on trading of more than 11 million shares.
The construction giant, Grupo Tribasa, which has a big chunk of its business in building highways, reported a 64 percent slide in earnings.
In banking, an industry badly weakened by the devaluation, Banca Serfin reported a drop of 69 percent compared with the third quarter of last year, but Serfin explained that it had used virtually all its third-quarter income to reinforce its reserves.
The glass and container powerhouse Vitro S.A. reported an 18 percent earnings decline in the third quarter, but a 250 percent increase in the first nine months of this year. Vitro's export sales have risen by 22 percent since January.
The steel and petrochemical conglomerate Alfa increased its exports 15 percent in the third quarter, bringing it a 138 percent earnings gain in the first nine months of 1995.
Another surprise came from the auto parts and petrochemical manufacturer Desc, which had a 12 percent increase in operating income in the quarter. Grupo Industrial Maseca, which mills three-quarters of the flour for corn tortillas, and Tamsa, a steel producer, also had modestly favorable quarters.
Government officials argue with increasing conviction that recovery has begun, and that steady growth can be expected starting early in 1996.
"The crisis has touched bottom," Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco told a group of textile executives on Wednesday. But industry leaders made it clear to Mr. Blanco that they did not share his optimism.
"Most of our companies are struggling to survive amid a collapse of the internal market, fiscal policies that don't encourage productive investment, high costs and tight credit," retorted Victor Manuel Diaz Romero, president of the national industrial association, in a speech following Mr. Blanco's.
Indeed, the economic data could support either view. On the negative side, inflation crept up by 1.1 percent in the first two weeks of this month, for an annual rate of 30 percent, considerably higher than Government projections for the year. To cope with the peso's decline, officials raised interest rates by two percentage points, to 42 percent, on Government securities, making scarce business credit even more expensive.
Yet one indicator that seemed to bolster the Government's optimistic view was a sharp increase in the number of workers enrolling in the Social Security program, a sign that they have started new jobs. More than 28,000 new employees registered with the Government program in the first two weeks of October, compared with less than 2,000 last month.
Foreign investors, Mexican businessmen and everyday workers remain wary, still nursing wounds from the peso debacle.
"The confidence in Mexico has been fragile, and the last couple of weeks have weakened it further," said Jay Pelosky, a Latin America strategist with Morgan, Stanley. He predicted that the skepticism would prevail until at least December, the first anniversary of the devaluation.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Lifts Rating Of Some G.M. Debt

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's Corporation increased its rating on the General Motors Corporation's senior debt yesterday, citing the auto maker's higher profits, as well as G.M.'s efforts to improve its product line, cut costs and reduce its unfinanced pension liabilities.
G.M.'s rating was raised one notch, to "A-," putting G.M.'s debt at the same level as the Chrysler Corporation's and two notches below the Ford Motor Company's senior debt, which is rated "A+." 
 "Ongoing cost-cutting actions and initiatives to improve product offerings, and the company's efforts to eliminate its unfunded pension liability have reduced G.M.'s vulnerability to future downturns in the U.S. automotive industry," S.& P. said.
G.M. and its units have about $78 billion of debt outstanding.
In the last two years, G.M. cut costs and returned to profitability after posting losses during the recession in the early 1990's. At the same time, it added to its United States pension funds, contributing $18 billion since the end of 1993.
As a result, "even in a severe downturn, the staggering losses generated during the past recession are unlikely to recur," S.& P. said.
In the third quarter, G.M.'s profits rose by 16 percent, to $642 million -- well above expectations -- as the company substantially trimmed its losses in its North American business and increased its United States market share.
The credit rating company raised its rating on the senior debt of G.M. and its General Motors Acceptance Corporation and Hughes Electronics Corporation units to "A-" from "BBB+." It bolstered the rating on G.M.'s preferred stock to "BBB+" from "BBB," and it affirmed its "A-2" rating on GMAC's and Hughes's commercial paper.
The "A" senior debt rating and "A-1" commercial paper rating on the debt of the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, G.M.'s computer services unit, remain under review for a possible upgrade, S.& P. said.

HEADLINE: Widest Gap in Incomes? Research Points to U.S.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The income gap between rich and poor was wider in the United States during the 1980's than in any other large industrialized country, according to the most comprehensive international study ever released on income distribution.
Britain, France, Italy and Ireland all had highly paid elites, but the gap between high-paid and low-paid Americans was wider in the mid-1980's than in these countries or in a dozen others included in the study, which was commissioned by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group that aims to coordinate the economic policies of the world's 25 richest nations. 
 The study, scheduled for release on Friday here and in Paris, suggests that the relatively high levels of inequality in the United States persisted into the early 1990's.
Income inequality has become a politically charged topic in recent years. Previous studies, contested by some conservative economists, suggested that the income gap grew in the 1980's.
The new study is considerably more comprehensive than earlier attempts and addresses many criticisms aimed at them. It also lays out a new methodology for analyzing income inequality. The new method has been reviewed by technical experts in more than a dozen industrialized countries.
The study ranked countries in terms of disparity on the income scale. For example, an American adult who barely made it into the top 10 percent in after-tax income earned 5.9 times as much in 1987 as someone who just fell into the bottom 10 percent, according to the study. The ratio in Finland, which had the least inequality, was 2.59.
Inequality rose markedly in the United States, Japan, Australia and Britain, and showed modest rises in five European countries during the 1980's, the study found. But inequality was little changed in five other European countries and Canada, and actually fell in Italy and Portugal. A shortage of reliable data, though, makes it difficult to establish rankings before the mid-1980's.
The rankings depended partly on the criteria. The broadest measure of after-tax income showed that the United States had the highest level of inequality between the top 10 percent and bottom 10 percent of individuals by incomes. But income was slightly more concentrated in the top 5 percent of families in Ireland than in the United States, and income was slightly more concentrated in Ireland when interest payments, dividends and other nonwage income was excluded.
Data for some nations in the study became public last spring, but not the detailed analysis and methodology seen in the full document.
The study avoids conclusions about the causes of the widening income gap, and makes no recommendations on what, if anything, should be done about it. Economists have offered many theories for the growing inequality, including the spread of computers, cutbacks in welfare programs and growing trade with low-wage countries.
The O.E.C.D., leery of political controversy, added a disclaimer to the book-length study, stating that it represented the views of the authors and not necessarily those of the international agency.
Many conservatives have argued that high levels of income inequality may not be bad if the rich invest their savings productively, contributing to faster economic growth.
"The existence of income differences does not necessarily have policy implications," the study concludes. "The importance of the results for policy depend on social judgments, including the trade-off between the level of income and its distribution."
Yet the results seem likely to provoke considerable controversy, as the Clinton Administration and Democrats in Congress have spent the last few weeks accusing Republicans of trying to cut welfare to help finance tax cuts for the wealthy.
Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group, said that while income inequality appeared to be rising in Europe and the United States, comparisons between countries with different economic systems were tricky, even with detailed data.
He also questioned the study's relevance to the current debate on the Federal budget, saying a breakdown of the American family and a rise in the number of unwed mothers had produced more poverty and a wider distribution of income.
Joseph E. Stiglitz, the chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, took the opposite tack when the report was described to him. "This is not the time to exacerbate the inequalities that may be arising from a whole variety of sources," he said, "and that is precisely what the House Republican budget and Senate Republican budget are doing," he said.
The new study was commissioned in 1991. It was written by three economists using data from the Luxembourg Income Study, a nonprofit group based in Walferdange, Luxembourg, that is financed by the National Science Foundation of the United States and its counterparts in almost two dozen other countries.
The O.E.C.D. circulated the study for extensive review for more than two years by organization officials and economic officials from most of its 25 member governments, who suggested some changes in the way their countries' figures were calculated. The final objections from the Governments of Australia and Ireland, which the study found to have fairly high levels of inequality, were addressed last spring, said a person involved in the study who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The economists who wrote the study are Timothy M. Smeeding, the director of the Luxembourg Income Study; Lee Rainwater, the research director, and Anthony B. Atkinson, the warden at Nuffield College at Oxford University in England.
In defining income, the study included wages, salaries, dividends, interest and private cash transfers like child support and pensions, as well as Government transfers like Social Security. It also included Government benefits like food stamps that are nearly convertible into cash, and took taxes into account.
But it excluded health benefits, like private health insurance, Medicaid and Medicare, as well as free or nearly free Government-provided health care in Europe. And it excluded large investment gains, like those from the sale of a house or stock. While some United States measures include these gains, most foreign countries do not.


GRAPHIC: After four years of analysis, study for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has concluded that the gap between the incomes of the rich and poor is wider in the United States than in 15 other industrial countries. The study used data supplied by governments from various years in the 1980's.
Graph: "Measuring the Gap"
 The authors calculated a median income per person after taxes for each country, adjusted for differences in family size. Then they examined the incomes of rich people at the 90th percentile and poor people at the 10th percential on the income scale -- that is, people whose income exceeded that of precisely 90 percent of their compatriots or precisely 10 percent -- and compared them with the median. The further apart the rich and poor incomes were in percentage terms, the wider the gap.

HEADLINE: RESEVOIR TOWNS AND NEW YORK CITY REACH AGREEMENT

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
After decades of conflict between New York City and the upstate communities that supply its water, the city has agreed to spend $1 billion during the next five years to preserve the quality of its water while spurring economic growth in the towns and villages around its 19 reservoirs.
The deal, brokered by Gov. George E. Pataki and expected to be announced next week, is an alternative to a far more expensive option: building a filtration plant, costing from $4 billion to $8 billion, to keep the water clean. 
 Negotiations were prompted by increasing development and pollution in the hills and valleys draining into the reservoirs. With New York City owning less than 4 percent of the land in its watersheds, Federal officials had threatened to order filtration this year if no plan were developed to protect the water.
Although a few issues remain to be worked out, participants in the talks expressed confidence that they did not threaten the agreement.
Under the plan, the city would upgrade and build sewage treatment plants in the reservoir watersheds, sharply increase monitoring of pollution, and initiate a series of environmental and economic programs to keep the water supply clean without overburdening local economies.
In return, the watershed communities would drop several lawsuits against New York City and agree to abide by a new package of watershed rules, the first revision of the city's water-protection regulations since 1953.
The city's early efforts to write stricter watershed rules were attacked by local communities, which felt their authority was being usurped and their hopes for economic development were being undermined. Given the cost of a filtration plant, Mr. Pataki, who as a state senator represented a portion of the watershed, was pressed to balance the interests of the 200,000 watershed residents against those of the nine million people in New York City and Westchester and Putnam counties who consume the water.
"Governor Pataki was in a unique position to do what he did," one participant in the talks said. "He was able to get the trust of local governments and reach out to environmentalists."
The costs of the program are expected to be borne by the users of the water, probably through a rate increase. But city officials declined to say how much water rates might rise, or if some other financing arrangement was being considered.
In a flurry of daytime, nighttime and weekend meetings during the last two weeks, negotiators representing interests as disparate as Delaware County dairy farmers, the Federal Government and Mayor Rudolph A. Giuliani attacked a final list of issues and whittled it down to a few remaining points of contention, participants say. The seven-month negotiating process was largely spurred by Michael C. Finnegan, Mr. Pataki's counsel.
One person involved in the talks remarked: "I was convinced as recently as two weeks ago that we'd end up with a bunch of unhappy people agreeing to a package of less than optimum alternatives. But the fact is, there's enough stuff in this agreement that everybody can find something to be pleased about."
Ceremonies were being planned in New York City and in the watershed areas to mark what would be the first broad-based accord over how to preserve New York City's century-old system for capturing more than a billion gallons of water a day in the hills of the Catskills and in the Delaware and Hudson Valleys.
But several participants said that, regardless of any announcement, putting a final accord into practice will entail years of work and potential setbacks.
The expected $1 billion agreement will be four-pronged, participants in the talks said, focusing on these areas:
*Increased investment by New York City in infrastructure within the watersheds, including repairing faulty sewage treatment plants, many of which are city owned and operated, and improving maintenance of city-owned bridges and roads, which local communities had for decades complained were being allowed to decay.
*An economic partnership in which money would flow from New York City to upstate towns and villages to offset economic burdens created by watershed regulations.
*City land purchases that would create a buffer to development or preserve wetlands. Several participants in the talks said New York City agreed to allow local communities to have some say over which parcels are bought.
*A revised package of watershed rules and regulations.
Several negotiators said the plan would involve experiments with new methods for protecting water quality, but with sufficient monitoring that if a novel idea was shown to be failing, more stringent rules could be enacted. Negotiators, sworn to secrecy by the Governor's office, would not provide details.
Several people said that an existing program, in which dairy farmers are cutting the flow of manure from pastures and barnyards in unorthodox ways, is an example of what could take place in other spheres.
Environmentalists, who were invited into some of the closed sessions only in the last couple of months, are apparently divided on whether the new rules are adequate to insure that contaminants are kept out of the water supply.
But one member of a private environmental group involved in recent sessions hailed the land-acquisition plan, saying: "It shows respect for local concerns. Condemnation is not going to be used. Taxes are going to be paid. It's a very civilized, almost revolutionary approach."
Many participants in the talks, including city and state officials, said the intensive program for monitoring pollution in the farthest reaches of the watersheds would set a national standard. Currently, most monitoring of water quality takes place once the water is already on its way to New York City.
Negotiators for the Coalition of Watershed Towns, which was formed out of the fiery debate that raged after New York City first proposed watershed rules five years ago, said they were pleased to see an imminent end to the conflict.
The uncertainty over watershed rules had depressed business and real estate activity in the watersheds west of the Hudson River, several upstate negotiators said.
One interested party outside the negotiations seemed to sum up their feelings. Raymond M. Christensen, Chairman of the Delaware County Board of Supervisors, said, "For five years there's been a cloud hanging over Delaware County. Maybe soon we'll see some sunshine."

Long Bond Tumbles After Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped sharply yesterday, on a stronger-than-expected Government report of durable goods orders in September, and continuing concern about the effects of drawn-out budget negotiations.
The traders' underlying fear was that a delay in a budget accord would also stall an expected cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve next month, maybe even endanger the chance of a cut at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in December. Few in the market are worried that the Government will default on its debt if an accord is not reached in time. 
 Donald E. Maude, chief fixed-income strategist at Scotia McLeod U.S.A. Inc., predicted that the yield on the Treasury's long bond could fall as low as 6 to 6.25 percent after a budget accord is achieved.
The current issue of the 30-year bond fell 1 1/32 to a price of 106 14/32 to yield 6.39 percent, up from 6.32 percent on Wednesday. It meant that bondholders lost more than $10 for each $1,000 of bonds held.
Orders for goods intended to last at least three years rose 3 percent in September; in contrast, economists were expecting a decline of four-tenths of a percent. Excluding military items, orders rose 3.1 percent; a rise of two-tenths of a percent was expected.
Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York, a research and analysis firm, said yesterday's selloff could well have reflected a realization by market participants that if a budget accord was delayed long enough, it could jeopardize a rate cut by the Fed. "On top of this, the economic numbers have not been uniformly weak," he said. "After today's durables report came in on the stronger side, there may be some caution in the market ahead of Friday's advance report on third-quarter gross domestic product.
The Labor Department also reported yesterday that the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims last week held steady at 359,000; economists had expected claims to rise to 362,000. The four-week moving average, a less-volatile measure of the labor market, increased to 354,000 last week from 348,000 the previous week.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation, in Columbus, Ohio, said that not much of what he heard yesterday could explain the strong drop in prices. But he did note that the volume of trading was par for a regular day.
One thought about a possible source of market weakness was the corporate debt market, which has seen a considerable amount of debt issued recently as treasurers hastened to take advantage of the low rates. Stephen W. Carter, an analyst with MCM CorporateWatch, a new-issues research firm, said that for the month of October, including yesterday, corporations sold $16.3 billion of straight and high-yield debt.
But if corporate supply and budget concerns were the bullets, it was the durable goods report that was the trigger for yesterday's selloff, one trader said. But, Mr. Donne said, "the durable number is notoriously volatile and will be adjusted."
"On balance the information in the last couple of days would indicate that some sectors are still responding to low interest rates."

HEADLINE: Salvador Helps Refugees Filing for Asylum in U.S.

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Oct. 25

 BODY:
Three years after its civil war ended, the Republic of El Salvador has begun offering a highly unusual service to its refugees here: free help in filing claims for political asylum based on El Salvador's own history of persecution.
The service is part of a nationwide immigration counseling program that Salvadoran officials insist is motivated by a desire to help refugees. But critics say its real goal is to insure that the flow of money home continues -- a system of informal foreign aid nicknamed dolares pobres, or poor dollars. 
 Salvadoran immigrants, more than a million around the nation who work largely as maids, landscapers and waiters, last year sent almost $1 billion to relatives in El Salvador, according to academics and Government officials, a sum that nearly rivals the nation's export earnings.
With a mandate from El Salvador's President, Armando Calderon Sol, the Salvadoran Government has added counseling services at its consulates and opened immigration offices in San Francisco and in an unpretentious Hempstead storefront squeezed between a camping store and a beauty salon. It has also hired legal staff, set up a telephone hot line and trained its consular employees in the intricacies of United States political asylum applications.
Wary immigrant rights groups say the free advice could lead to a surreal scene -- refugees who have fled persecution turning to the very nation that drove them north with a decadelong legacy of killing and torture.
The leadership of the Government and the right-wing ruling party, Arena, has changed since the worst excesses of that period. And Mr. Calderon Sol has tried to steer a more centrist path for the party, whose founder, Roberto d'Aubuisson, was widely viewed as the organizer of death squads in the 1980's.
But the President's latest effort to reach out to almost 200,000 political refugees living in the United States since 1990 has shocked immigration lawyers.
"I think they were off their rockers when they did this," said Patrick Young, legal director for the Central American Refugee Center in Hempstead, which is just three blocks from El Salvador's new office. "The last place I'm going to send an asylum applicant is to the country that they're fleeing from. It's absolutely outrageous."
Mr. Young and other officials from the center said it appeared that the Government's office has not been attracting many clients. One employee in the office said that most visitors were curious and asking questions but that few were filling out asylum applications.
The planning for the counseling service began last year with a demand from President Sol to "do something" for Salvadoran immigrants, said El Salvador's Ambassador to the United States, Ana Cristina Sol, a distant relative of the President.
She said the President's directive came as anxiety was building among Salvadoran immigrants in California over a successful state initiative limiting services to illegal immigrants. In the meantime, she said, the Salvadoran Embassy in Washington was fielding calls from Salvadorans who complained about the difficulties of applying for asylum.
In January, she said, the embassy started offering immigration counseling. Later, it won permission from the United States Government to expand outside the consulates.
"We're helping them to stay where they want," the Ambassador said, adding that all Salvadorans were still welcome to return to their homeland. "The problem is that there is not enough work to give these people. That's the main problem. If they go to El Salvador they will not be part of the economy."
After 12 years of a civil war that ended in 1992, the Salvadoran immigrants to the United States have settled largely in metropolitan Los Angeles, Houston and Washington and on Long Island. Many fled the small country's conflict between guerrillas and the Government.
Of the more than one million immigrants, about 190,000 are eligible to apply for asylum under a temporary Federal program, which has a Jan. 31 deadline. Those who settled in the United States before 1990 are eligible to apply for asylum.
Many of these immigrants subsidize their families in El Salvador with checks averaging about $150 a month. Their relatives use the money for basic expenses like rent, school tuition or medical care. Others have invested the money, expanding small businesses like bodegas or bakeries.
Some studies show that such support makes up as much as 30 percent of family income in El Salvador, said Roxana Ulloa, a Georgetown University graduate student whose master's thesis studied a small town in eastern El Salvador that depended on cash sent through money courier offices.
"This money is the Salvadoran version of the welfare check," said Oscar Chacon, of Centro Presente, nonprofit group in Cambridge, Mass., that offers asylum counseling. "Salvadorans in the U.S. are of tremendous strategic importance to El Salvador. For every Salvadoran in the United States, there is probably a family in El Salvador getting money. This definitely works as a pressure valve that releases the steam."
It is these immigrants that El Salvador's Government is trying to reach with appeals in Spanish newspapers in New York and Los Angeles and advertisements promoting, "informacion gratis."
The windows of the Government's cramped office in Hempstead are painted with brightly colored appeals to Salvadorans to take advantage of free immigration advice. Somehow, immigrants find the office even though it lacks an official sign and bears the name of a previous tenant, Corfinge, a money courier service.
Last week, Nelson Castillo, 26, a refugee who has already applied for political asylum in the United States, entered the storefront, formally known as the Office of Legal Assistance for Salvadorans, out of curiosity. As he gazed at a portrait of El Salvador's President and a poster of the country's national hymn, he said his memories of death threats and jail were revived.
"It's not really over," said Mr. Castillo, a Hempstead resident and catering worker. "You have flashbacks that come back to you when you enter any Government agency from your country. They did a lot of things that were not good, killing people without reason."
El Salvador's Ambassador insists that refugees have nothing to fear. She said that the guerrillas have disbanded and that most of the refugees seeking asylum fled the country because of a situation that existed up to 15 years ago. "So there is no conflict with the Government," Ms. Sol said, and "they have realized that we have no political intention behind all this."
As part of the immigration process, political refugees must fill out one immigration form detailing examples of persecution or their reasons for fearing repression.
Ms. Sol said the Government's legal offices would not complete this form "because we're not qualified to do that." Instead, the Salvadoran Embassy refers refugees to a Washington-based lawyer hired by the Government who consults by phone, fills out the form and mails back the entire asylum application to the local Salvadoran office. Immigrants then sign the documents with a Government employee as a witness.
"It may be that the Salvadoran Government does not understand the ironies of what they're doing," said Lucas Guttentag, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who filed a successful lawsuit seeking protected refugee status for Salvadorans. "As a general rule, it is not appropriate for a government to be involved in representing or advising or getting information from persons who are fleeing that very government."
Many immigrant groups are already offering political asylum counseling services, charging about $250 to prepare an asylum application, and embassy officials said they would also refer refugees to those agencies.
Ms. Sol said El Salvador decided to offer its own immigration counseling because "a lot of agencies closed their doors because they were having a swarm of people seeking services."
But even with an application deadline looming, most immigrant organizations that have historically served Salvadoran refugees contend that they have not been besieged. In New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and California, agencies are actually experiencing a lull in application requests.
In Hempstead, where the local refugee center and El Salvador's new office are a short walk apart, Mr. Young of the center said requests for political asylum applications have dropped. The agency, he said, has prepared more than 4,000 such applications, drawing from a growing Salvadoran community that local groups estimate at about 100,000.
Mr. Young said he was concerned that the Government's efforts, however well meaning, could damage a refugee's chance of obtaining political asylum. He advises refugees to say away from the Salvadoran consulates and the new immigration offices.
"It could potentially compromise their case" with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, he said. "How could someone apply at the consulate, claiming persecution from the country they're fleeing from?"
"I think they're out of their mind," he added. "Go to a private lawyer or nonprofit agency. Do not go to the Salvadoran consulate. People are absolutely loony to do this."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
How to Trade With Cuba

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
American businesses eager to do business with Cuba are pushing every pressure point they can to end the U.S. embargo, except the one that might work. They refuse to use their economic influence to pressure Fidel Castro to give Cubans political and human rights.
All these businesses achieved their wealth through the American system: free enterprise with political democracy. Democratic capitalism: the combination has been the key for them and American society. 
 By itself, capitalism can operate in a dictatorship. It did in Nazi Germany, in Imperial Japan and in Saddam's Iraq. Now it is at work in China, overseen by the Communists, and in a dozen other dictatorships.
The business executives involved know this. That's why they busily seek out new markets for capitalism in dictatorships like China, like Cuba.
So some critical questions are at the heart of the push for trade with Cuba. They have been at the heart of every controversy on empowering dictatorships through American economic might.
Once they were debated openly, passionately. Now they are not even raised, not by the business community, not by academics and journalists also trying to end the embargo.
Do U.S. businesses have the moral and political right to transfer the fruits of democratic capitalism, which come from the efforts of the entire American population, workers as well as C.E.O.'s, to strengthen a dictatorship so that it can more efficiently control and persecute its own entire population?
Or do they have the obligation to try to use the lure of capitalist investment to bring some liberty to the people of the dictatorships -- who will be making for Americans any profit they take out?
On Wednesday, President Castro demonstrated at The New York Times the wit and intelligence that so entrance the hundreds of American business leaders who make the pilgrimage to Havana.
Charming -- but not charming enough to erase memory. The man sitting there committed the greatest crime any revolutionary could. He asked for and got the help of Cuba's people to destroy the Batista dictatorship. Then he brought them not freedom but another dictatorship -- fully equipped with firing squads, kangaroo courts, political prisons, intellectual and political suppression. One party, one leader, one mouth.
He uses truth and falsehood not as values in themselves but as conveniences of the moment. He said almost casually that yes, Amnesty International's figures of about 600 political prisoners in Cuba were correct but that once there were thousands.
But for his original movement to be accepted by Cubans as a revolution for freedom he had told them he was not a Communist. He lied for years, until it suited him to reveal himself as part of the international Communist political and military apparatus.
When asked at The Times whether he would agree to an opposition party or press, or a free election, steps that would lead to virtually automatic lifting of the embargo by the U.S., he told his personal truth: Never, a long, polite stick them in your ear.
But he may not be able to hold out against liberties as long as he wishes. As an effective economic weapon, the embargo began just about 1990. Until then, Moscow made up embargo losses with $5 billion in yearly economic aid plus all the arms he could eat. And only in 1992 did Washington close loopholes that allowed American subsidiaries to do $500 million in trade with Cuba.
Cuba's economy is at about 40 percent of what it was a few years ago. The idea that economic pressures do not work is a myth; they did against the Soviet Union, Rhodesia, South Africa, Iraq and Serbia.
Mr. Castro can end Cuban suffering by his own decision to agree to those freedoms he dismisses now.
This is the precise time for American business people who want to trade with Cuba -- and all who pressure Washingon to end the embargo -- to ask Mr. Castro publicly to make it possible by permitting democratic freedom to go with capitalist investment.
He will do no such thing as long as he knows Americans put pressure only on their government, not him. Even so, he may keep refusing out of fear of his own people.
But either way, American businesses will at least and at last be standing up for Cuban freedom, and for the fountainhead of America's power and their own: democracy and capitalism, in combination.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Yields Its Early Gains, Hurt by Mexican Peso Losses

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed yesterday as gains made against the German mark eroded after a selloff of the Mexican peso.
The dollar surged early in New York trading on news that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia had been taken to a hospital with heart problems for the second time in recent months. His illness, which comes a few weeks before legislative elections, compounds the political uncertainty surrounding Russia. 
 The mark, which benefits from political turmoil in other countries as a currency of refuge, does not gain from problems in Moscow because of the many ties that German businesses have to Russia. Germany is Moscow's largest European lender.
In early New York trading yesterday, the dollar gained to 1.4100 marks, on speculative buying spurred by rumors that Mr. Yeltsin had died.
But the dollar reversed course after the peso came under speculative attack, knocking it down more than 5 percent in a few hours. The Mexican and American financial systems are closely linked these days, with the North American Free Trade Agreement and the United States-led bailout of Mexico.
Yesterday's peso selling followed reports of weak Mexican corporate earnings, which suggest that the nation's economy might face slower growth along with high inflation.
Adding to panic selling were new concerns about unrest in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas after the Zapatista rebel front threatened to withdraw from peace talks.
There is also some worry about Mexico's ability to repay a $20 billion American loan after the Mexican Government this week rolled over a separate debt of $1.3 billion in short-term credit lines.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.3915 German marks from 1.3923 marks on Wednesday and to 1.1312 Swiss francs from 1.1326 francs. It edged up to 101.43 Japanese yen from 101.23 yen. The dollar rose to 7.2350 Mexican pesos from 6.7850 pesos.
The mark may have also gained against the dollar by events in Italy, where Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's Government survived a confidence vote -- though Mr. Dini gained the required margin of victory by agreeing to leave office before the end of the year.
"The fact that the Dini Government was able to survive, that calms the European fears and is helpful to the Deutsche mark," said Lisa Finstrom, currency analyst at Smith Barney. "It means the European Monetary Union may be going forward, and that left the Deutsche mark in a position to benefit from the peso and dollar-selling."

HEADLINE: Durable-Goods Orders Rise 3% For Month, Surprising Analysts

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Brisk demand for commercial aircraft pushed orders for durable goods to a record in September, the Commerce Department reported today.
Bolstering the economic outlook, total orders rose a surprising 3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $169.03 billion, after an upwardly revised 5.1 percent surge in August -- the biggest monthly gain in a year -- as inventories from the second quarter were depleted. 
 Analysts said the September increase in orders would help manufacturing, and that in turn would lift the slow-growing economy.
"With capital-goods orders on the move and the inventory correction having pretty well played itself out, manufacturing now is moving back into a position of being a mildly positive influence," said Robert Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Separately, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans applying for state unemployment benefits was unchanged last week at 359,000.
The Commerce Department, underlining a more robust trend for factory business, said shipments of finished durable goods also rose in September, and backlogs of unfilled orders increased after being flat for two months.
Durable goods are products like cars and refrigerators that are intended to last three years or more and are relatively costly. Economists track orders for these goods to gauge future hiring prospects and to measure the willingness of consumers and business to spend money.
Sung Won Sohn, an economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said the latest evidence of economic firming was likely to help induce the Federal Reserve's key committee not to lower interest rates when it meets on Nov. 15.
Transportation orders were far and away the leading influence on September orders, increasing 10.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $43.18 billion after a 17.1 percent surge in August.
The Commerce Department does not separate the value of aircraft orders from those for autos, although it said demand for aircraft and parts led the increase in transportation. Excluding transportation, orders rose a relatively slight six-tenths of a percent in September after a 1.8 percent gain in August.
Separately, the White House announced the $6 billion sale today of 61 planes to Saudi Arabia -- an order that will take six to seven years to fill and support thousands of jobs.

HEADLINE: The Sound Of New York: Ska. Ska? Yes, Ska.

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
THE hunt for thriving regional music scenes has become an important one in the record business. Music labels in New York regularly send talent scouts to places like San Diego and Louisville, Ky., to make deals with new cadres of bands hoping to replicate the success of the Seattle grunge scene that spawned Nirvana and Soundgarden and the Berkeley, Calif., punk scene that produced Green Day and Rancid. What most record companies do not consider, however, is that for a dozen years a scene has slowly been expanding right on their doorstep, and it is close to exploding. It is perhaps the only underground musical movement that New York can now call its own. T-shirts in record stores and cover artwork on compact disks proudly proclaim it in large letters: NYC SKA.
Ska is an odd-looking word: short, punchy, almost funny. So is the music at times, a light, bouncy, horn-infused grandfather of reggae. (The word itself comes from the sound a guitar makes.) Ska has arrived in three musical waves, beginning in Jamaica in the 1950's and 60's as a home-grown version of rhythm-and-blues performed by collectives of former jazz musicians like the Skatalites. The music traveled to England along with Jamaican blue-collar laborers, quickening its tempo as it mixed with punk and working-class youth sounds in the 1970's. A second wave of interracial ska bands, including the Specials, the Selecter and the English Beat, first appeared on England's Two-Tone label, registering in America as a quick spark on the pop charts. But that spark slowly ignited an international fire as New Yorkers like Rob (Bucket) Hingley (a veteran of the English movement) and Jeff Baker not only started bands like the Toasters and the Boilers, but also helped to establish a solid underground network, connecting ska groups in New York with ones in Brazil, Japan, Germany, Hawaii and elsewhere through newsletters, fan magazines and record labels. 
 "It was New York that galvanized the national scene with bands like the Toasters touring," said Mr. Hingley, who runs Moon, the premier ska label in the United States, in addition to playing guitar and singing in the 12-year-old Toasters. "The music really hooks people once they finally hear it. First you meet a kid at a concert, next they have a band, then they're opening up for you and the next thing you know, you're putting out a record of theirs."
Five years ago, ska concerts in Manhattan were strictly underground events, where green-haired punks, skinheads and stylish ska fans known as rude boys danced to the holy triumvirate of New York ska bands: the Toasters, the Scofflaws and the N.Y. Citizens. Now there are concerts every weekend at downtown clubs like Wetlands, New Music Cafe, the Cooler and Coney Island High, and the audience is a broad, multi-racial mix, where hippies meet skinheads and college jocks dance with rude boys.
"You used to know everybody in the scene in New York, if not personally, at least by face," said Mr. Baker, a former member of the hardcore band Murphy's Law who now plays in the ska bands Skinnerbox and the Stubborn All-Stars. "Now I look around, and I see almost no one I know. It's not exclusively a rude boy and skinhead thing now. There are people from 15 to 50 at the shows. And I know why: it's the only music that makes me dance without thinking about it."
 
Bands and More Bands
 Chris Zahn, who books concerts at Wetlands in TriBeCa, said he had noticed not only an expanding audience for ska, but also an increasing number of people playing the music.
"What we have to do is package the ska shows, turn them into multi-band nights with five or six groups," Mr. Zahn said. "There just seem to be bands coming out of nowhere. I'm getting tapes from all over the coast that even people involved in the ska community have never heard of. I had a ska band from Venezuela here the other night dropping off their tape, and there's an Argentine band interested in playing here."
"But as popular as ska is getting, it's still surprising how many people don't know it," he added. "On a typical Friday, we get tons of phone calls about what's playing. When we say it's a ska show, there's always a pause and then we hear: 'Ska? What is ska?' We've gone so far as to say, 'Think of it as Jewish reggae: imagine 'Hava Nagilah' and then put some island rhythms in there.' "
Not every club in New York has such an open attitude toward ska. "I don't book ska shows anymore," said the manager of one club, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. "If there aren't fights inside, you have nearby restaurants and neighbors complaining about skinheads loitering around with 40-ounce beer bottles in their hands."
But other club bookers and concertgoers say that fighting at ska shows is becoming a rarity. The attitude of ska music has always been one of having fun in the face of oppression, as encapsulated in a warning made famous by the Jamaican legend Prince Buster: "Enjoy yourself. It's later than you think."
At Wetlands this month, when the New York band the Slackers opened for the English Two-Tone band the Selecter, the scene was peaceful and friendly. With fast, shuffling guitar strumming, infectious drumming on the offbeat and a horn section worthy of a 60's soul revue, the music had even the most awkward of club denizens skanking, or bouncing from leg to leg and swinging their arms.
Where most rock bands get by with three or four members, ska bands may have as many as a dozen. In addition to guitars, bass and drums, they often have an entire horn section. These groups sometimes find older players from the jazz or Latin music worlds; other times they recruit young people who have just graduated from their high school jazz band. Either way, it makes for eclectic music. At 11 members, the Slackers are among the more diverse and unpredictable bands in New York.
There are many different styles of ska being played today, but the main schism is between the bands that try to blend it with punk and hardcore music and the traditionalists who look back to Jamaica for a purer sound.
It is this first style that fans and record executives alike predict will make ska part of the fabric of popular music. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, from Boston, performed this summer on Lollapalooza, the alternative-rock package tour, exposing new audiences to high-energy ska-core, as the group's hard, fast hybrid is sometimes called. More recently, the California punk band Rancid (which was formed from the ashes of Operation Ivy, a ska-influenced band) put out a ska single called "Time Bomb," which has been played heavily on MTV and pop radio.
But the Slackers have their own dream of a slower, rootsier ska finding success. "The more modern stuff is what they're expecting to break through in the wake of Rancid," said Marcus Geard, who plays bass in the Slackers at night and delivers trees during the day. "But I think the VH1 audience is a perfect traditional ska audience. I think they dig the groove and the vibe more; they're more sophisticated and don't get put off by Latin and jazz influences. The beat's infectious, and then the other influences make it more interesting."
 
Investing in a Genre
 Profile Records in New York has become one of the biggest American record labels to make an investment in New York ska. Its rock division, Another Planet, recently signed the Stubborn All-Stars, a rotating New York supergroup with an old-time sound featuring members of the Slackers, the Toasters, the Insteps and Skinnerbox, along with the tenor saxophonist from the original Skatalites. The label has also signed the Insteps, and is courting one of the New York ska scene's brightest hopes, Mephiskapheles.
"Ska is probably the biggest underground network going right now,"said Fred Feldman, the general manager of Another Planet records. "Moon Records has a 15,000-name direct-marketing list, and the Toasters are selling at least 25,000 to 30,000 records now, most of it through nontraditional retail outlets. I think the bigger labels are still waiting to see what happens with this Rancid song and to see how Green Day does with the ska band it signed to its 510 label, the Dancehall Crashers. If any of it becomes huge, then you'll see a feeding frenzy."
Many bands, however, remain skeptical. For a long time, some musical pundits have written off ska as creatively defunct without ever having listened to the stylistic extremes of the music, which range from the swing- and be-bop-influenced instrumentals of the New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble to the industrial electronic ska of World Service. As Mr. Baker said, "One of the strengths of ska is that the foundation is so simple but so effective that it can endure a lot of changes but still maintain a relationship to the original style."
Nonetheless, Mikal Reich of Mephiskapheles added: "Ska is almost the marketing kiss of death. We've been talking to record labels, and they're always telling us they don't know how to market ska; they don't know who to sell it to. I used to think people in the record industry were barracudas and would jump on anything. Here you've got Rancid with a ska single in MTV's 'Buzz Bin,' and I still have to spell ska to people over the phone."
Steve Shafer, who is in charge of promotion at Moon, speculates that one reason for ska's obscurity is that it is stereotyped as a revival. "What happened with ska was that the Two-Tone revival was labeled as a rehash of the Jamaican sound, and critics couldn't see it as a re-examination and reinvention of that kind of music," he said. "There was punk and anger and frustration in it. And now it's still growing and going off in different directions: ska punk, ska-core, rootsy stuff that sounds like it came out of the 60's. We have our 'Spawn of Skarmageddon' compilation coming out, and there are 43 bands on it from all over the U.S., and none of them sound the same."
 
Beyond the Clubs
 Ska is not just a club event in Manhattan anymore. In February, Moon Records opened a store in the East Village selling records, T-shirts and books. It also serves as a general clearinghouse for information on concerts and on ska lore, usually courtesy of a counterman, Noah Wildman, who is working on a book on ska.
And for more than a decade, rude boys up and down the East Coast have been buying their Doc Marten boots and Fred Perry shirts at 99X, also in the East Village. Rude boys were originally unemployed youths-turned-gangsters from Jamaica's shantytowns who dressed in the latest clean-cut fashions to intimidate and impress.
Their narrow-brimmed porkpie hats, close-shaven haircuts, wraparound sunglasses, skinny ties and sharkskin suits with tapered legs have survived in ska wear today, as have the checkerboard patterns (symbolizing black and white unity) of England's Two-Tone look.
"Whenever there's a big show in New York, the store gets packed because all these people come into town from all over," said Alex Pietropinto, who works at 99X. "Their style hasn't changed. You can look at pictures of people 30 years ago, and see a rude boy now and they look the same."
Another factor that has helped ska endure is the word itself. The word "ska" can be combined with almost anything. There have been Skalapalooza tours and Skampilation records; this weekend, there's a Skalloween concert in the East Village, and in December New York is to have its first Skanukkah concert. "We thought we'd exhausted all the variations we could come up with on the word ska," Mr. Zahn of Wetlands said. "But then last week we booked a Skanksgiving show."

Talks at Historical Society
Don't be fooled by the seemingly quiet mood at the New-York Historical Society: interesting behind-the-scenes negotiations are in progress.
Merger talks have begun again between the society and the Museum of the City of New York. The last time the idea surfaced was in 1992, but those talks led nowhere. Neither institution would discuss what's going on, but those close to City Hall say Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is taking a personal interest in trying to make the merger happen.
Colleen Roche, the Mayor's press secretary, said: "Discussions to see whether a merger would be beneficial are very preliminary. At the request of the Mayor and John Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, Schuyler Chapin has been made available to participate in discussions." Mr. Chapin is the city's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs.
A report to the board of the Museum of the City of New York said that the Mayor had "asked the museum to take a leadership role in seeking a permanent solution to the society's chronic problems."
While the two institutions have similar missions -- to celebrate the city's rich cultural history -- each is in a period of flux. The Museum of the City of New York is involved in a capital campaign to start a $36 million renovation, expansion and reorganization of its 1932 Neo-Georgian building at Fifth Avenue and 103d Street. The city, which owns the building, is paying for half the project.
The Historical Society had its own facelift and reopened its doors in May after having been closed for two years. Despite its spiffier premises, it is struggling to pull itself out of serious financial problems. The city and New York State have provided $12.6 million and the State Attorney General's office, which oversees nonprofit institutions, allowed the society to sell a selection of Old Master paintings and Americana to raise money.
Most of the art and objects were sold at Sotheby's in New York in January in a sale that made $17.6 million. Fifteen marine paintings that were part of the original consignment sanctioned by the Attorney General's office were sold at Sotheby's on Sunday, and the Historical Society is $611,300 richer for it. The paintings were by the 19th-century New York artist James Bard.
Sotheby's sold 26 Bards in January and decided it was dangerous to try to sell them all then. "Under normal circumstances, we usually see two or three Bards a season, and we were worried about flooding the market," said Nancy Druckman, head of Sotheby's department of American Folk Art. "So we saved this core group until now."
Among the top sellers were "Steamboat Thomas P. Way" (1859), estimated to sell for $25,000 to $35,000; it sold to an unidentified collector for $112,500. Under the society's original agreement with the Attorney General's office, other New York State institutions can exercise a right of first refusal for any work at auction, and have a week after the sale to act. If something sells for its high estimate, the society gives the pre-empting institution a graduated discount. A Sotheby's spokesman said no institutions had pre-empted any of Sunday's Bard sales.
 
For Korean Art
 Two Korean foundations, the Korea Foundation and the Samsung Foundation, have given the Metropolitan Museum of Art a $5 million grant to develop a Korean arts program and a new gallery devoted to the arts of Korea. "This will encourage the development of our collections in this area, from the ceramics we now display to a well-rounded collection that represents the spectrum of artistic achievements of this rich culture," Philippe de Montebello, the Metropolitan's director, said.
The new gallery is expected to open at the end of 1997. The Korean Foundation will pay for the gallery's construction, while the Samsung Foundation will support the program, including displaying the art and educational programs.
 
Christie's Campaign
 Christie's latest marketing effort has gone beyond fancy shopping bags or scarfs or chocolates.
Fifty-five thousand subscribers to Christie's International Magazine received a special all-color brochure about the auction house's 19th- and 20th-century picture departments. But the art wasn't what Christie's seemed to be selling. The message was all about the "youth and experience" of its staff.
The lavishly produced, 13-page brochure was shot by Derry Moore, the English photographer known for his glamorous interior photographs in Architectural Digest. Each Christie's expert is posed on a separate page with a painting offered for sale this fall. Each expert either wears an outfit color-coordinated with the painting or poses in a manner similar to a figure in the work, sort of an artsy version of the way real estate agents and new car salesmen sell themselves these days.
"We were deliberately breaking new ground here," said John Lumley, the international head of Christie's 19th- and 20th-century paintings department, who masterminded the brochure. Mr. Lumley (the only expert not pictured) said he believed it was important to "sell the people concerned," adding, "They are stars in their world."
About half the experts have held their jobs less than a year, but Mr. Lumley said that had nothing to do with the concept. "These experts form an important part of our international network," he said. "We were not ignoring the works of art; it's the whole package that's important."
 
A Contemporary Arrival
 The long-awaited Jeffrey Deitch gallery, which has been hovering in the art world's imagination for nine months, has finally touched down. Mr. Deitch, a leading contemporary art dealer and adviser, has teamed up with Jeanne Greenberg, who has worked with him for about two years as director of his art advisory service. They have formed a joint enterprise called Deitch Greenberg Projects.
Its new home is the former Joe Fawbush Gallery, which closed this month after Mr. Fawbush's death in June. It is a modest but unusually beautiful space at 76 Grand Street in SoHo, which Mr. Deitch and Ms. Greenberg are planning to use as a project space for emerging and established artists. "We're planning to invite artists to do special installations," Ms. Greenberg said.
The gallery will open temporarily in November. Then the space will close for renovations in December and reopen in January.

HEADLINE: Mayor Offers 3 Hospitals For Lease

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration formally offered yesterday to turn over three public hospitals to private health care organizations. It also strongly suggested that the city would try to release the new operators from the terms of current labor contracts.
In two detailed plans, one for Coney Island Hospital and one for both Elmhurst Hospital Center and Queens Hospital Center in Jamaica, the city is offering to sign long-term leases with nonprofit companies that meet the city's requirements for delivering health care to the poor. 
 Although the city took pains to describe the offerings as leasing arrangements, they are in many ways tantamount to actual sales.
The two documents, which were prepared by the J. P. Morgan investment firm, read in places like upbeat real estate brochures, praising, for example, easy access by car and ambulance to Coney Island in Brooklyn, as well as the relatively low unemployment rates in the neighborhoods surrounding the Elmhurst and Queens hospitals.
"The transfer of these hospitals to not-for-profit entities can help the city insure access to quality health care services and meet the new demand of the communities, with the provision of increased primary care services and much needed capital improvements," Maria K. Mitchell, the Mayor's special adviser on health policy, said in a prepared statement.
But even before the documents were made public yesterday afternoon, board members of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the public hospital system, angrily denounced the privatization plan, saying that it would damage the health care system for poor people and that it was also probably illegal.
"I oppose these resolutions because they violate the law and are directly inconsistent with our obligations under the law," said David R. Jones, a longtime board member. "These actions will result in a fragmentation of the delivery of health services that the corporation was created to provide."
The suggestions in the offerings that the city is willing to revise its labor contracts with hospital unions is also certain to alarm hospital union leaders. Job security for hospital workers has been a thorny issue in the current contract negotiations between the city and District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said one city official.
Stanley Hill, president of District Council 37, expressed skepticism of the plan.
"We have always said that selling hospitals will increase the city's health costs and will not help the service," he said. "We're also concerned about our own interests, such as collective bargaining rights and benefits. We don't know the impact, who the buyer will be, so there's a big concern here."
The release of the formal offerings is the first concrete step the city has taken toward privatizing its public hospitals since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani first announced his intention to sell several hospitals shortly after taking office last year. In recent months, he has expressed hope of turning additional hospitals over to private companies, perhaps dismantling the system entirely.
The offerings make few specific demands on potential bidders, although the Queens plan stipulates that a new Queens Hospital Center must be built to replace the aging structure.
Beyond that, the plans simply insist that the organization that takes over any hospital must satisfy the city that it can provide a high quality of care to the city's indigent and uninsured.
The plans also leave considerable flexibility about how prospective purchasers will deal with the public hospital's powerful unions, whose rules have often been blamed for the system's inefficiencies. The plans suggest that the city will allow union contracts to be abrogated or at least significantly reworked.
While the city insists that the privatization plan will make the public hospital system more economical, others disagree. Just last week, Standard and Poor's dropped the hospital agency's bond rating, citing in part uncertainties created by the privatization plans.
"Not knowing what will or will not remain under H.H.C.'s umbrella or how such decisions will be made is a significant operational handicap," Standard and Poor's wrote.
Mr. Jones, a corporation board member, also raised questions about whether the city has the legal authority to transfer public hospitals without state legislative action, since the system was created by legislative act in 1969.
Beyond that, the State Department of Health must be asked to approve all transfers in hospital ownership or managerial responsibility. Lois Utley, a spokeswoman for the department, said that it had not received a copy of the offering plans, but noted that "the state would be concerned about continued methods for taking care of the patients who depend upon the hospital, particularly the indigent."
And then there is the question of whether there are any takers, particularly since the Medicare bill under consideration in Congress would take millions of dollars in Federal financing away from each hospital now on the sale block.
Mr. Jones said: "I think there must be oil under one or more of these hospitals, because we are supposedly going to generate so much money by getting rid of them."
 
A CLOSER LOOK: Would You Buy This Hospital
 
The Giuliani administration is seeking to lease three public hospitals to private companies. The two documents prepared by the J.P. Morgan investment firm read in places like upbeat real estate brochures. Below are excepts from the documents.
 
On Coney Island Hosptial:
Coney Island Hospital offers potential purchasers the opportunity to gain a competitive advantage in southern Brooklyn's dynamic health care marketplace. CIH has few comparable direct competitors within its service area and would be a significant addition to an existing health care network...
The Hoospital occupies approximately ten acres of lan at the intersection of Ocean Parkway and Avenue Z in the southern portion of Brooklyn. The Hospitl is located immediately off the Belt Parkway, making it easily accessible by car or ambulance...
The hospital has a proven abiliyt to generate a steady flow of patients...CIH could become a major feeder institution for a tertiary institution.
 
 On Elmhurst and Queens Hospital Center:
The Queens Health Network, which includes the Queens Hospital center and Elmhurst Hospital Center offer a potential buyer an excellent opportunity to establish itself as the pre--eminent health care provider in Queens...
The network provides the economies of sclae and scope required to meet the demands of today's health care marketplace...
Both Queens Hosptial Center and Elmhurst Hosptial Center are located in densely populated areas, with moderate to low income levels, and relatively low unemployment rates...
The Queens Health Network is chaired by Mr. Pete Velez. Mr. Velez has been with HHC for over 15 years in a number of different capacities and is a highly regarded citizen of the Queens community...

HEADLINE: South Africa's Rulers Ask, 'How're We Doin'? '

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: VOSLOORUS, South Africa, Oct. 24

 BODY:
With eight days until the second most important election in South African history, Max Sisulu might have been expected to be frantically pressing the flesh, kissing babies and doing everything he could to make sure his party's candidates win their races.
Instead, Mr. Sisulu, a legislator from Soweto and son of Walter Sisulu, lion of the African National Congress, was touring a tough township that does not contain a single one of his constituents, trying to determine whether his party's platform, issued two years ago, is on track. 
 The platform is the much-vaunted Reconstruction and Development Plan, the African National Congress's book-length outline for rebuilding South Africa.
Crime, housing, and how much power Zulu chiefs will retain under the Constitution are big issues in the Nov. 1 voting, which will elect city councils and ward committees across the nation. But one thing the ruling African National Congress's opponents have unfailingly bashed it with is the charge that "the A.N.C. has failed to deliver on the R.D.P.," as everyone calls it in the most acronym-mad milieu this side of the United States Army.
That's why Mr. Sisulu was here. "The A.N.C. has to deliver on its promises," he said. "If we do that, we'll win all the elections."
Not that he seemed worried. "We got 64 percent of the vote last time and we're hardly likely to lose this time," he said.
Unreleased polls bear out Mr. Sisulu's confidence. Markinor, a polling operation here, predicts that the Congress will again get nearly 65 percent of the vote.
Stan Greenberg, an American polling expert under contract to the Congress said, "The elites and the press keep looking for signs of voter impatience, but it doesn't show in the polls." He said the party could even make gains among mixed-raced voters, called coloreds,' who supported the opposition National Party in the last election.
Another fertile field for A.N.C. inroads, he said, was among people of Indian descent in the Durban area, frustrated with the continuing violence under the Inkatha Freedom Party, which rules their province. But elections there have been delayed by a court challenge.
President Nelson Mandela is not stumping; he has been visiting the United States. Of course, the big newspaper photos of him sitting with President Clinton do not hurt his party's image.
Saki Macozoma, chairman of the Congress's elections commission and a principal strategist, denied that the party is complacent, saying its national leaders will campaign hard this weekend. They did little before, he said, because his research showed voters were more interested in the local candidates.
The campaign has been short. The 15,000 candidates for city councils and ward committees were not even chosen until Sept. 22, and the first posters went up less than a month ago. That was deliberate; England's brief campaigns are South Africa's political model. Also, there was fear that a long, heated campaign would spark further killings.
But brevity was also a product of confusion and time pressure. It took months to raise voter registration to the current level of 76 percent of those eligible and to pick candidates for 701 separate elections. And there have been endless court challenges.
"I've never seen an election where the voters understood all the issues," Mr. Macozoma said. "But they know that whether or not they get resources in their neighborhoods depends on the outcome."
Mr. Sisulu's eyes are firmly on the number of houses built, jobs created, promises kept. As the chairman of the Parliament committee overseeing the Reconstruction and Development Plan, he is especially stung by the campaign criticisms. Asked how he would treat Jay Naidoo, the quick-witted, fast-talking Cabinet minister who is in charge of running the plan, if he suspected foot-dragging, he replied, "I'll hammer him."
But after touring Vosloorus, Mr. Sisulu was not reaching for the hammer.
In this zone, which also includes the townships of Katlehong and Thokoza, the Reconstruction and Development Plan seems to be changing the way life is lived. The army, the police, engineers, project managers and social workers of all races seem to be working together.
Murders and other "serious incidents," to use a South African colonel's classification, are down from a high of 580 in August 1990 to 18 last month. Hostels controlled by the Congress's bitterest opponents, Zulus of the Inkatha Party, are being painted and electrified, with the Zulus who live in them getting the jobs. Tracts of $5,138 houses -- two cinderblock rooms with a fiber-cement roof, two windows, an inside toilet and a coat of paint -- are being built, and the occupants own them. Nineteen police stations -- truck bodies with no toilets or water -- are in place. Squatter camps are getting water standpipes, brick outhouses and one vandal-resistant telephone every few hundred yards on which they can call for police, an ambulance or even sewer repair.
Mr. Sisulu talked to people at every stop -- most of them women washing clothes in buckets or men employed to paint houses. Invariably, they said they are grateful to the Congress for the houses and have even chased pamphleteers for the rival Pan Africanist Congress away. A landslide for the Congress seems certain here.
"But jobs is the real issue," Mr. Sisulu said. "Giving them houses is nice, but without economic development, nothing will happen."

HEADLINE: Philippine Leader Says He'll Leave in '98; Foes Have Doubts

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: MANILA, Oct. 26

 BODY:
When asked his plans after his term as President of the Philippines ends in 1998, Fidel V. Ramos tends to smile playfully and say something about spending the rest of his life on a golf course.
But his political adversaries suspect that the President's mind is actually far from the 18th hole. They assert that a recent campaign to replace this nation's American-style presidential system of government with a parliamentary system is part of a scheme by Mr. Ramos to remain in power indefinitely -- as Prime Minister instead of President. 
 Mr. Ramos insists publicly that he does not want to see the system of government changed during his presidency and that, regardless of what happens, he will step down in 1998, as is required by the current Philippine Constitution, which allows a President only one six-year term.
"I have no wish nor design to perpetuate myself in office," the 67-year-old President said a few weeks ago. "I will step down at the end of my term."
But still the suspicions have been raised, and apparently with good reason. The politician who has led the call for a constitutional change is Jose de Venecia, the Speaker of the House and a close political ally of the President. And in August, Mr. Ramos's supporters in the Senate engineered the ouster of the Senate President, a champion of term limits.
Opinion polls suggest that a switch to a parliamentary system and an end to term limits would be unpopular with the public -- term limits are as popular with voters here as they are in the United States -- and several prominent Filipinos have stated their opposition to constitutional changes, including Mr. Ramos's predecessor, Corazon C. Aquino.
Mrs. Aquino, who stepped down at the end of her term in 1992 and endorsed Mr. Ramos, said this month that "we have enough serious problems to address without putting forth issues which no doubt will divide Filipinos people at this time."
Mr. Ramos's political opponents are quick to point out that the last Philippine leader to seek a change to a parliamentary system was Ferdinand E. Marcos, who sought the change in the early 1970's in a transparent effort to remain in power.
When it was clear that a parliamentary system would not be adopted, President Marcos declared martial law in 1972 and held onto power until 1986, when he was forced out in an popular uprising led by Mrs. Aquino and Mr. Ramos.
Still, there are many other powerful Filipinos who would like to find some way of keeping Mr. Ramos in office, given his success in reviving the economy of a nation of 67 million people that was long seen as the economic laggard in Asia.
The economy is expected to grow this year by nearly 5 percent -- a growth rate that is modest by the standards of booming Southeast Asia, but is a near-miracle for the Philippines.
The wariness about Mr. Ramos's intentions grew after his political coalition engineered the ouster of the Senate President, Edgardo Angara, even though Mr. Angara was a party stalwart who had shepherded legislation on Mr. Ramos's behalf.
Mr. Angara's personal popularity had been rising, and he was increasingly seen as a viable presidential candidate in the next elections. He has accused Mr. Ramos of orchestrating his removal.
"There is no doubt what he is up to," Mr. Angara said in an interview. "Ramos may say that he does not want to stay in power, but his words are contradicted by the actions of his lieutenants. They wouldn't do anything without his approval."

HEADLINE: A Big Job For Labor

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
With words of militancy, the new president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is promising the third big surge of labor organizing in the nation's history, hoping to add millions of workers to union rolls just as the movement did during the Depression and after World War II.
American unions tripled their membership in the six years before 1941, thanks to the passage in 1935 of the Wagner Act, which set pro-labor ground rules for organizing Depression-era workers hungry for better wages. And after World War II, unions scooped up millions of more workers, fed up with wage controls. 
 Can they do so again?
In his acceptance speech yesterday, the day after delegates to the national convention of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations had elected him president, John J. Sweeney made clear that he was setting his sights high.
"The most important thing we can do, starting right now today, is to organize every working woman and man who needs a better deal and a new voice," he said. "As long as we speak for scarcely one-sixth of the work force, we will never be able to win what we deserve at the bargaining table or in the legislative process. That is why we're going to pour resources into organizing at a pace and scale that is unprecedented."
Mr. Sweeney's heartfelt vow to get the union movement running on all cylinders notwithstanding, he will find it hard to repeat the successes of yesteryear, because unions now face a constellation of forces that did not exist in labor's heyday: fierce economic competition from abroad, a Republican-controlled Congress hostile to organized labor, technological changes that are sweeping away factory jobs, and corporations that have honed sophisticated strategies to outflank unions.
"Changing the vigor with which they pursue new members doesn't change any of the enemies they have," said Ronald Seeber, a professor at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "They still face a global economy which is sending their job base overseas. They still face a hostile political environment in Washington and most state capitals. And they face a public indifferent to the cause of unions."
And that is not all. In the 60 years since the Wagner Act was adopted, Congress, the courts and the National Labor Relations Board have chipped away at that landmark legislation, making it less friendly to unions. And in the last 15 years, employment in manufacturing, the most heavily unionized sector of the economy, has shrunk by a sixth, while employment in the harder-to-organize service sector has nearly doubled.
Another problem is that Mr. Sweeney is inheriting a federation suffering from bureaucratic sclerosis: his predecessors' policy was that attracting new workers was the business of individual unions and not of the 13-million-member federation.
Despite so hostile an environment, Mr. Sweeney and the other insurgents who won control of the federation at this convention, in midtown Manhattan, are confident that they can reverse labor's slide. Before them they see huge swaths of territory fertile for organizing -- areas where wages are low and management largely unsympathetic, areas that Mr. Sweeney's predecessors all but ignored. Mr. Sweeney and his aides talk of organizing hospitals, nursing homes, discount stores and textile factories, and of focusing on the South in particular.
Mr. Sweeney, a 61-year-old Bronx native who has headed the Service Employees International Union for 15 years, is promising nothing less than the reversal of a four-decade-old trend in which union membership plunged to 15.5 percent of the work force in 1994, from 34.7 percent in 1954. At the once-mighty United Automobile Workers, membership has plummeted to 800,000, from 1.5 million in 1979; at the United Steelworkers, it has slid to 140,000 from 380,000 during the same period.
Mr. Sweeney and his aides have adopted the attitude that it is always darkest before the dawn. They say the time is ripe to woo workers to the unions because labor dissatisfaction is bubbling over during an era in which wages have badly trailed inflation and in which management, through constant "downsizing," has left workers feeling profoundly insecure.
Whether Sweeney & Company can tap this worker discontent remains to be seen. During the 16-year reign of Lane Kirkland, who stepped down as president in August in the face of a Sweeney-led challenge, it seemed that the federation had forgotten how to carry on a dialogue with American workers, more than 100 million of them, who do not belong to unions.
From the moment he was elected on Wednesday, Mr. Sweeney has sought to jump-start that dialogue. Addressing himself to all American workers, he said: "Our problem is your stagnant wages -- America needs a raise. The solution is a bigger, stronger labor movement."
But American workers may continue to tune out big labor's message, Professor Seeber said.
"The fundamental message of trade unionism still resonates with most American workers," he said. "They would like someone arguing on their economic behalf in the workplace; that's almost a universal truth. But when you attach the word 'union' to it, that turns a lot of people off. Unions will have to go back to core fundamentals to figure out how to reach these people."

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
HOUSE PASSES BUDGET BILL, BEDROCK OF G.O.P. AGENDA; MUCH BARGAINING REMAINS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The House of Representatives today approved the foundation of the Republican revolution: a mammoth bill that would balance the Federal budget in seven years, cut the taxes of most families and significantly diminish the place of the Federal Government in the lives of Americans.
President Clinton has vowed to veto the legislation, so it will be weeks before it is known how many of its elements will become law. But its approval today underscored the willingness of the members of the new Republican majority to cast difficult votes in areas that have proved politically risky in the past. 
 Spending on Medicare, the popular health program for the elderly and disabled, would be strictly limited, and the program would be changed so fundamentally that no one can predict with confidence what the consequences would be.
The 60-year-old commitment of Washington to provide subsistence for the poorest in the society would be ended, with that responsibility shifted to the states.
The money for Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program, and Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, would be much less than it would be without changes in the law. In both cases, the states alone would be allowed to decide who would receive benefits and how much they would get. Most Federal standards for nursing homes would be abandoned. [Page D20.]
"In seven years," declared Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, "we will balance the budget and save the country and save the next generation."
The sweeping legislation, called a budget reconciliation bill, was passed on a party-line vote of 227 to 203. Four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for the measure. Ten Republicans voted against it.
Earlier, a Democratic alternative that would have continued Federal commitments to the poor, allowed more money for Medicare and abandoned the notion of a tax cut was solidly rejected, 356 to 72.
The Senate, meanwhile, began voting on amendments to a companion measure, rejecting by nearly straight party-line votes Democratic attempts to restore money for Medicare, Medicaid, the earned-income tax credit, student loans and other social programs and to reduce the size of the tax cut. The Senate bill, expected to be adopted Friday, differs on the margins from the one the House approved today, but the themes are the same.
After blocking votes all day on Wednesday, Republican senators permitted them today in return for a promise from Democrats to limit the number of amendments they offered.
Many niggling details will have to be worked out by a House-Senate conference committee, on matters like how Medicaid money would be apportioned among the states and exactly who would be entitled to tax breaks.
But whatever comes out of the conference, no one doubts that a veto will follow. Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, criticized the budget bill, saying, "It will severely harm Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment, and raise taxes for working families while providing huge new tax breaks for the wealthy."
He added that the President "will continue to insist that Congress pass a balanced budget that protects seniors and working families."
Since Republicans do not have the votes in Congress to override a veto, the final budget can be written only after negotiations between the President and Republican Congressional leaders.
Rarely are the philosophical lines between the two parties drawn as starkly as they were in the debate in the House today.
For example, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, declared, "We believe the strength of America lies not with the Government but with each of us as individuals."
Over the last 30 years, Mr. Archer asserted, the Government "spent over $5 trillion on the war on poverty, only to lose the war."
But Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, the Democrat who previously led the committee, took an entirely different stance. The Republicans, he declared, intend to take "$450 billion out of children, out of sick people, out of nursing home people."
"This," he said, "is a travesty on the American people."
Representative Martin Olav Sabo, Democrat of Minnesota, accused Republicans of harboring "a vision that rewards the wealthiest and most powerful interests in our society at the expense of the most vulnerable Americans."
The Democratic whip, Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, said, "This budget doesn't reward the best in us. It appeals to the worst in us. It doesn't reward our best instincts. It tramples our most basic values."
But Republican leaders were adamant that their direction was the right one for the country.
"We don't have a right to tell the next generation that we can't stop ourselves from spending that extra trillion," said Mr. Kasich, the legislator more responsible than any other for putting together the package that was approved today.
"We're going to look over all the swamp, and all the muck and all the nasty rhetoric," said Mr. Kasich, his hand over his brow like the lookout in the crow's nest of a sailing ship. "We're going to look beyond that. We're going to look to the next generation. We're going to get this done for our precious nation."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, would have none of that. Wrapping up the Democratic side of the debate on the budget, he said, "It's wrong. It's morally wrong. It's economically wrong. It's the wrong thing for our country."
Much of the debate in the House and Senate today was over Medicare, the health program depended on by 37 million elderly and disabled Americans. The bills would spend $270 billion less on Medicare over the next seven years than would be spent without changes in the law. The saving would be accomplished primarily by reducing payments to doctors and hospitals, raising monthly premiums and providing inducements to encourage beneficiaries to move from the Government program into private insurance coverage.
Republicans said they were doing this to protect the program from bankruptcy and preserve it for the next generation of retirees. Democrats accused them of decimating the popular program to raise money to offset tax cuts.
In addition to welfare and Medicaid, the House bill would also restrain spending on other Federal programs for the poor, including the earned-income tax credit, child-care assistance, food stamps, school lunches, nutrition aid for pregnant women and help for low-income disabled children.
The Republican view is that these programs, mainly the products of the Democratic New Deal and the Great Society, have been allowed to grow out of control, to a point where taxpayers can no longer afford them.
Student loans would be restricted. But other entitlement programs with middle-class constituencies, like farm-price supports and veterans benefits, would see more modest reductions.
The cornerstone of the part of the bill dealing with taxes is a tax cut for all but the richest and poorest families, based on the number of children. For technical reasons, the bill approved today would put the tax credit at $365 per child. No one doubts that the conferees will approve $500 per child, the figure in the Senate bill and the one approved by the House in April. The only question is exactly which taxpayers would be eligible for the credit.
The measure would also lower the tax on capital gains (the profits from the sale of investments), expand eligibility for individual retirement accounts, reduce the marriage penalty for working couples, allow tax credits to offset some of the expenses of adopting a child and caring for an elderly relative at home, abolish the alternative minimum tax for corporations with large tax write-offs, increase the size of the estates that would be exempt from inheritance taxes, reduce the amount of Social Security benefits subject to taxation and permit companies to withdraw excess money from their pension funds.
Before taking up the overall bill today, the House approved a nonbinding resolution promising to vote later in the year on a separate measure that would increase the amount of money people over 65 could earn without having their Social Security benefits reduced.

HEADLINE: Fearing G.I. Occupiers, Japan Urgesd Women Into Brothels

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Governments have made plenty of outrageous requests of their citizens, but few are as remarkable as what the Japanese Government secretly requested of tens of thousands of Japanese women 50 years ago.
Six days after Japan's surrender in World War II, the Cabinet met in the Prime Minister's residence to discuss "urgent measures" that had nothing to do with the atomic bombings or the millions of homeless people or similar national crises. Instead, the Cabinet struggled with how to sate the libido of American "sex-starved soldiers." 
 Fearing that the Americans occupying Japan would behave as Japanese troops sometimes had overseas, raping any woman in sight, the Government quietly set up a front organization to establish brothels, and asked patriotic Japanese women to sacrifice themselves as "comfort women" for the Americans.
"We were told that our mission was to be a sexual dike to protect the chastity of Japanese women," remembers Tatsugoro Suzuki, who was then the 25-year-old manager of a fine restaurant. After two frantic weeks, using Government help to obtain futons, scarce in war-devastated Tokyo, Mr. Suzuki had turned the restaurant into a brothel with 30 women supplied by the Government.
The charge to the soldier (only Americans were admitted) was the equivalent of eight cents, and that included a bottle of beer. Half the take went to the woman and half to the house.
"The Americans didn't know this was a Government operation," Mr. Suzuki said. "That was a secret."
The 50th anniversary of the beginning of the American occupation has stimulated renewed interest in that chapter of Japanese history, and a television program has raised awareness and eyebrows with its fictionalized version of the life of Japan's own wartime prostitutes.
Internal documents of the front organization, the Recreation and Amusement Association, show that 55,000 women served in it. The figure includes some office workers, but the great majority worked as prostitutes.
"This really was necessary at the time, because we didn't know what kind of soldiers would come," said Tsunenori Ono, then a 29-year-old police official detailed to oversee the brothels. "It really seemed crucial to build this sexual dike."
The American military authorities nominally banned prostitution, but made few efforts to enforce the ban. The Americans became agitated only when venereal disease rates soared, leading them to declare the Recreation Association brothels off-limits in March 1946.
As a result, the association decided to close down. Other brothels, privately owned, did a booming business, but the Japanese Government's role as a procurer ended after seven months.
In the last few years the world has learned a bit about the Korean, Chinese and even Dutch "comfort women" who were forced to provide sex for the Japanese Army abroad. Yet the Japanese Government's efforts to gather Japanese prostitutes on behalf of American soldiers is much less known.
There is, of course, an enormous difference in that the overseas "comfort women" were mostly Korean teen-agers who were dragged away from their homes and forced into front-line brothels. The Japanese women mostly volunteered, albeit out of economic desperation, and they were paid several times the going rate in ordinary brothels.
Especially at the beginning, the Japanese women were primarily working prostitutes. Later, war widows and other women signed up because they had no other way to feed their families.
To read the yellowing internal documents of the Recreation Association is to peek through a window into a different time. Japan was then not only traumatized by defeat but also terrified at the prospect of the arrival of American troops.
Many families sent young women to the countryside, and one neighborhood association even distributed potassium cyanide capsules with the recommendation that women kill themselves rather than risk disgrace at the hands of savages. Government officials emphasized that the brothels were the best way to "protect the purity of Japanese blood," and they were particularly worried about what they saw as defilement by black American soldiers.
The Recreation Association officially was launched on Aug. 28, 1945, two weeks after the Japanese surrender. Its officials gathered in front of the Imperial Palace and swore an oath acknowledging that "this project is a cornerstone in protecting the chastity of Japanese women." The association's internal documents, gathered by a Japanese writer named Akira Murase, who has written a book about the brothels, refer to the prostitutes as "Okichi."
It is a term laden with sacrifice and sadness, for Okichi was a 16-year-old girl sent by the authorities in 1857 to be the mistress of the first American consul in Japan. Okichi was reviled by Japanese for her intimacy with an American, and so in despair she drowned herself.
Although in 1945 the Government was worried that Japanese prostitutes would not want to stoop so low as to have sex with "satans and savages," economic circumstances were so desperate that many applied. And despite Okichi's misfortunes, apparently the women were not scorned more than other prostitutes.
"They were even envied a bit by ordinary people, because they could earn lots of money," said Mr. Ono, the former police official, whose salary then was equivalent to 46 cents a month. "People were obsessed not with race but with how to make a living."
The first "comfort station," the Komachien, a huge wooden traditional building in a Tokyo suburb, opened with 150 kimono-clad women. One woman had 47 American customers the first day, thereby earning almost $2 for herself.
The prostitutes, who then ranged mostly between 18 and 25, have long since disappeared. They apparently mostly left Tokyo by the 1950's, never spoke of what they had done, and in many cases died early of the effects of venereal disease or other ailments.
The Government role in setting up brothels was less surprising in Japan than it would be in the United States, in that until 1958 Japan permitted prostitution in officially permitted and defined red-light districts.
Despite their theoretical ban on prostitution, the American military authorities in at least one area apparently asked the Government to set up a brothel.
"A month after the troops landed, an American general came to me and said, 'I need your help,' " remembered Yasuhiro Komatsu, then a 25-year-old liaison officer between the American and Japanese forces in the city of Moji. Mr. Komatsu says that the American general demanded that Japan set up a brothel for his men.
As it happened, the Japanese Navy had been running a brothel in one of its buildings in Moji for its own servicemen until the end of the war. So Mr. Komatsu asked the women if they would be willing to have sex with Americans.
"They said, "We're scared of the Americans,' " Mr. Komatsu recalled. "But they also said, 'We have no other job so we'll do it.' "
So the brothel quickly opened, charging much less than the Tokyo rates. Americans lined up, leaving their shoes at the door, and paying just over a penny per visit.
In a few cases, the authorities may have forced Japanese women to work in the brothels. One Japanese book asserts that female factory workers in the city of Kawasaki were trucked to a brothel for Americans and given a speech by a man who said he was from the Interior Ministry.
"You should be proud to be given this mission," he reportedly told the women, who had been told only that they would work in the tourism business. When one woman tried to escape, she is said to have been beaten and her right eye gouged out.
In another case, a women's corps affiliated with the army in Saitama Prefecture is said to have received an order on Sept. 9, 1945, dispatching the members to four brothels in Tokyo. The order, from the Interior Ministry, reportedly said: "You should bear the unbearable and be a shield for all Japanese women."
The Recreation Association followed Japanese tradition by setting up separate brothels for American officers, so they would not have to share women with enlisted men, but some officers declined to take part.
In Nagasaki, seven prostitutes complained formally to the American commander, Lieut. Col. Victor Delnore, that they should not have to pay an "entertainment tax," since they did not find their work entertaining. Colonel Delnore mentioned the issue to the Finance Ministry, and it granted a tax abatement to the brothel.
When the grateful prostitutes then presented Colonel Delnore with free passes, he declined them.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE SCENE
CAPITOL SKETCHBOOK;
The G.O.P.'s Wild Card Over at the White House

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Once President Clinton had explicitly vowed to veto the Republicans' ambitious seven-year budget bill, the grand two-house debate today over the measure began to take on the air of another day at the office. Lawmakers grappled across the debating mat, but looked beyond passage toward some future, more melodramatic showdown focused on the constancy of the President and his promises.
"Given the President's recent comments on taxes, how can I know what he will do?" Speaker Newt Gingrich remarked even before the day's debate. Almost merrily, he was relishing the cynical suspicion that had to be left unstated by Democrats that the President has proved to be their uncertain ally. 
 Most recently, Mr. Clinton recanted some of his own enthusiasm for the 1993 tax increase that he had the Democratic Congress pass, leaving his Capitol colleagues feeling hung out to dry and uneasy as they thundered against the Republicans into the night.
Mr. Gingrich exploited their unease over the President's latest promise Wednesday to stand fast. "He's now trying to make the left feel happy, having repudiated them last week on taxes," the Georgia Republican declared at a news conference, describing the President as off on his own "Kabuki theater" of re-election posturing.
Mr. Clinton's resoluteness became a sub-theme of the day's debate. First thing this morning, a House Republican, J. D. Hayworth of Arizona, offered another tired play on the David Letterman top 10 list, including still another unoriginal allusion to Halloween ("Trick the people, then treat Big Government"). But at the top, he listed the Democrats' "secret fear that the President will flip-flop again and refuse to veto."
Mr. Hayworth left the microphone grinning broadly, feeling he had struck home. He strutted past the front-row morning lineup of representatives waiting to speak before the main debate. They sat like bike messengers ready to leap up and deliver disjointed one-minute commentaries before the C-Span cameras that make a practiced lawmaker seem fully engaged even when the House is as empty as a bus terminal at midnight.
In the Senate, Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, stood early to debate another nearly empty chamber. He railed, as if before a crowd, against the Republicans' plan to cut the income tax credits that help the working poor stay off welfare. "This is one of those moments that is so clearly defining that it is even reachable by my own rhetorical skills," Mr. Bradley declared, resorting to mocking his own rather wooden way with words to measure his bitterness.
As all manner of speech mounted like slag across the day, Republicans reflected the implacability built into majority status. They often left the Democrats unchallenged on their many warnings. Still, there was an occasional confirmation that some opposing lawmakers heard one another.
"Let's reject the Civil War the Republicans are trying to wage," counseled Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, contending that the Republicans will trigger a "states rights" rush to deepen Federal cuts in the dole.
Across the aisle, Representative Charlie Norwood, a Georgia Republican with an ear for Confederacy politics, cautioned Mr. Kennedy in the gentlest drawl: "Everybody knows it wasn't 'the Civil War,' it was the 'War Between the States.' " He went on resolute as Stonewall Jackson in decrying the "Chicken Little Democrats" and their warnings of hardships to flow from Republican budgeting.
In their attempts to make these warnings graphic as Dickens, the leaders of the Democratic minority once more arrayed some of the poor, the elderly and the afflicted outside the Capitol's east staircase for a news conference of complaint. "They ought to be ashamed of themselves," declared a tourist who paused momentarily and felt offended at the sight of a brain-damaged boy displayed in a wheelchair as an example of who would suffer from home-care economies in Medicaid.
The Democrats were unapologetic. "The extreme right will have their victory," conceded Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, counting on the President to fulfill his veto vow.
One of the bipartisan anomalies of all the day's politicking -- the cross-barrage of increasingly severe warnings directed at a shrinking, often inert electorate -- seemed personified by Barbara Greenwell, a 67-year-old woman who said at the news conference that she was too poor to ever retire and could not afford to get ill.
"I haven't voted in years," she said rather brightly without apology to Democrat or Republican. "You know what? I'm going to register."
Up the steps and inside the House, the Republicans moved forward with the majority strength that accrued from the last elections.
"The Seven-Year Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995: Oh how that rings in my ears!" exulted Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, New York Republican and chairman of the Rules Committee. He was ready to move it ahead, if only to a short-term Presidential veto and the deal-making negotiations with the White House that might follow.
"Where's my easel?" asked Representative John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio and the Budget Committee chairman, rushing to the floor and sounding like a master late for his own chef-d'oeuvre. The easel appeared, filled with charts that made the Republicans' case gleam. The majority moved forward. The Democrats clung to the President's vow.

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET;
Excerpts From Debates in House and Senate on Budget Bills

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by lawmakers today during the House and Senate budget debates, as recorded and transcribed by The New York Times. 

IN THE HOUSE
 
David E. Bonior
Democrat of Michigan and minority whip
We may not have the votes to beat this rule, the votes to beat this budget, but we do have the votes to sustain a Presidential veto.I urge my colleagues to stop this tax increase on families, stop the destruction of Medicare, stop this war on kids and say no to this shameful budget.
 
John R. Kasich
Republican of Ohio
You know what the fight is about in this chamber? You know what the fight is all about in this whole capital, Washington, D.C., area? Whether we can go from $9.5 trillion to $12.1 trillion or whether we should increase that to $13.3 trillion.
The question you have to ask the American people is, Can we save a trillion dollars for the next generation? Nothing is more tragic than to go to the settling of an estate and have the children sit in the room and have it told to them by the lawyers that your mother and father put you in debt. We would consider that to be not a good thing to do, a bad thing to do, to tell your children that they have big bills. . . .
The same is true with the Federal budget. We don't have a right to tell the next generation that we can't stop ourselves from spending that extra trillion.
We're going to look over all the swamp, and all the muck, and all the nasty rhetoric and the shrill rhetoric that exists on both sides. We're going to look beyond that. We're going to look to the next generation. We're going to get this done for our precious nation. Support the reconciliation bill.
 
Gerald B.H. Solomon
Republican of New York
I've heard speaker after speaker after speaker after speaker stand up and say we need to spend more money here, we need to spend more money there. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've been spending more money here and more money there for years and years and we have just about ruined this country.
 
Kweisi Mfume
Democrat of Maryland
Mr. Chairman I obviously rise in opposition to this legislation. It is bad for America, and in my opinion, it is bad policy.
Supporters of the bill before us are likely to argue and make talk about the future and they will say that over the six or seven years this bill will lead us to the balanced budget and that they are doing it for our future and for our children's future. The real question becomes, however, What kind of future will these generations be inheriting?
Many of us believe that they will be living in a future among seniors that do not receive adequate medical care or enough income to survive despite having worked all their lives. We believe they will be surrounded by undereducated people who were brought up in the public school system that was plagued by drugs and violence and out-of-date books. And that those same people will also be relegated then to menial jobs in this new future because they cannot afford a college education and because their Government has turned their back on them.
And everywhere we look in this new future there will be whole families without adequate housing and without adequate health. Entire communities will be decimated by crime, by the lack of viable businesses that no longer have incentive and by abject poverty.
And so many of us believe, Mr. Speaker, that this bill is not good, it is not good for the working poor, it is not good for the middle class of this country, the elderly, and it is certainly not good for the children of this nation who will feel the brunt of this bill's damage. . . .
With this bill we are saying that the Congress has new priorities in that future, and that in that future, under this bill, American people are not one of those priorities.
 
Sam M. Gibbons
Democrat of Florida
Listen to me, Mr. Solomon, when you vote for this bill today you are voting to end Medicare. You're voting to end Medicare. Don't be hoodwinked, it's in your proposal. It is in there in the fail-safe device. That will put an end to Medicare and the Gingrich-Dole plan to end Medicare is in this vote today.
This is a serious, serious matter. This is not just about balancing the budget. This is putting an end, this is the proposal that Dole and Gingrich have cooked up to get rid of Medicare.
 
Christopher Shays
Republican of Connecticut
We need to get our financial house in order and we need to balance our Federal budget. We need to save our trust funds, particularly Medicare, and we need to transform our social and corporate welfare state into an opportunity to society.
The bottom line and the most difficult part is saving our trust funds. We know what the board of trustees, the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, has said. They said that in basically seven years the Medicare Part A trust fund literally goes bankrupt, but nobody on that side of the aisle even wanted to address it until a few weeks ago.
We are addressing that fund, we're making sure that $333 billion is benefited to the Medicare Part A trust fund and $137 billion benefits the Medicare Part B trust fund. We have extended its insolvency and its ultimate bankruptcy from the year 2002 to the year 2010.
Now what's so important about the year 2010? That's when the baby boomers start to get into this fund, and at that point we have the baby boomers from the year 2010 to the year 2030. By the year 2030 baby boomers from the age 65 to 85 will be in the fund. What does that mean? We have workers right now, three and a half workers are working for each individual in the trust fund. Right now three and a third workers work for every person in the social security trust fund. By the year 2030, 35 years from now, there'll only be two workers.
We're talking about what has happened over the last 40 years, in particular the last 25. Our Congress and regretfully our Presidents have mortgaged the farm and now we're trying to buy it back for our kids.
 
Bill Archer
Republican of Texas
The great social experiment of the last 30 years has led to an unparalleled expansion of the Federal Government. Sadly it has failed to solve our nation's most difficult problems.
Nowhere is that more the case than in our miserable and unfortunate welfare system, where in the last 30 years we have spent over $5 trillion in the war on poverty, only to lose the war. . . .
Government cannot take the tax dollars that are earned by one citizen, hand them over to another and then believe that they have improved the life of either citizen. Yet for 30 years, Government tried that. It's called tax and spend.
Mr. Chairman, the time has come to admit that tax and spend has failed. It's time to reduce the size of Government and to give the tax dollars back to the people who earn them. And I say to my colleagues across the aisle -- it ain't your money.
 
Edward J. Markey
Democrat of Massachusetts
You know, back in the 1960's our political leaders asked us not what our country could do for us, but what we could do for our country.
Well, in 1995 the Republicans' motto is, Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for the country club. This is a contract with the country club. This takes money out of the pockets of senior elderly, out of students, piles it up and then gives tens of billions of dollars of tax cuts to the wealthy in our country. The wealthy aren't asked to sacrifice.
You know, back in the Civil War, because the wealthy could buy their way out of the war, they said it was a rich man's war but a poor man's fight.
Well, here in this reconciliation battle in 1995, it's a rich man's war but it's a poor man's fight. The rich men get tremendous tens of thousands of dollars in tax breaks and the poor seniors have their Medicare premiums go up. The poor students and working class families have their student loan payments go up. And yet the Republicans stand here and tell us that they care about the working people in this country.
This is a wrong vote for America, just plain wrong.
 
Richard A. Gephardt
Democrat of Missouri and minority leader
This budget that we're about to vote on decreases the Earned Income Credit for families struggling to get into the middle class. In other words, it increases taxes on people that are struggling to get in the middle class, people earning $25,000 and $30,000 a year. And in the same budget we have a tax cut, a massive tax cut, for people at the top.
It takes my breath away. I cannot believe that someone seriously, in 1995, at the same time could make those two suggestions, simultaneously. It is wrong. It is morally wrong, it is economically wrong, it is the wrong thing for our country. . . .
But finally, let me say that I think this budget, more than anything that we've dealt with, presents a very clear and different vision between these two parties. This budget really presents a different vision for America.
A very prominent member in the other body said yesterday, "I was there fighting the fight, voting against Medicare, because we knew it would not work in 1965." My party, the Democratic Party, fought for and enacted Medicare in 1965. We believe that Medicare has helped the American people probably more than anything we as a people have ever done. And I believe the rhetoric we heard yesterday is really the real debate that we ought to be having.
If extremes in your party really do want to get rid of Medicare and to change it so dramatically that its emasculated, than let's have that debate, let's be proud to bring that difference to the American people. And if the extremes in your party really believe that the right thing to do is to raise taxes on the middle class, and lower taxes dramatically on the wealthiest people in this country, than let's have that debate between now and 1996.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, in conclusion let me say, this budget and these next 14 or 15 months are about real differences and a difference in vision of where this country should go. Let the American people decide and I believe they will decide for Medicare and for the middle class of this country, not the wealthiest of this country.
 
IN THE SENATE
 
Jon Kyl
Republican of Arizona
If there's a single vote on which the American people will judge the success or the failure of this Congress, if there is a single vote this session that will change the course of American history, it will be the vote on the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act which is before us today.
This single vote will determine whether we finally face up to the grim reality of a national debt that is $4.9 trillion and growing daily, a debt that now amounts to $18,500 for every man, woman and child in this country. Or whether we continue this spending spree that we've been on for the last 20 years at the expense of our children and grandchildren.
This single vote is more important than the votes on the balanced budget amendment and the line item veto. Those were the tools that will help us balance the budget and keep it there.
This bill actually balances the budget.
This single vote will determine whether we keep the promises we made to the American people last fall that we would balance the budget and provide badly-needed tax relief.
Or whether it's business as usual. Promises out the door as soon as it's time to make the final decisions, the difficult decisions.
 
Tom Harkin
Democrat of Iowa
One of the obligations we have is to insure that future generations have the ability to get a decent, sound education so that they can raise their families and they can compete in the world marketplace. That also is a moral obligation, and what this reconciliation bill does is pull the rug out from underneath that obligation that we have for future generations.
Mr. President, we hear a lot of talk about the tax breaks that are in this bill. And those of us on this side have been talking about the $245 billion tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of the elderly and Medicare cuts. Well, there is an $11 billion cut in student aid here, the largest cut in student aid in our history.
But what we're not hearing about are the hidden taxes that the Republicans have in this bill: the stealth taxes. . . .
This budget adds about $700 to $2,500 of debt per student. So that's a hidden tax on our students. Adds up to $5,000 in additional cost for families who use the PLUS loan program, another tax on students and their families. And then it imposes a direct Federal tax of .85 percent on colleges and universities participating in the student loan programs, a direct tax on colleges. And of course they're going to have to pass that on to their students. And last, of course, it forces schools out of the direct-loan program that has been so successful.
We hear about the tax breaks of the wealthy, we don't hear about the stealth taxes -- that it's in the Republicans' bills, and mainly it falls on students. . . .
And who does it hit? It hits moderate and low-income families the hardest. That's why we have to defeat this reconciliation bill and make sure that these students can get a decent education.
 
Larry E. Craig
Republican of Idaho
The future of our children, Mr. President, and our grandchildren, does not depend on a student loan. It depends on the economy of this country, and the vitality of that economy that produces the student loans, that creates the jobs, that offers the future, and the opportunity. . . .
I find it absolutely amazing that this President will argue a $200 billion deficit and a debt that heads toward $5 trillion and say that that's growth and that's opportunity and that's going to create a productive economy.
Let me tell you what that kind of $200 billion deficit does to the average child of today, the college student of tomorrow, the job seeker in the future. The average child today will pay $5,000 additional taxes over their lifetime with that $200 billion defecit. The Clinton budget projects deficits of that range out through the year 2000 and that alone adds up to an additional tax burden of $40,000 in the lifetime of that child.
 
Don Nickles
Republican of Oklahoma
Many of the allegations and the statements that are made are certainly not taking a look at the overall big picture. I want to help students too, and I understand that there may be a leadership amendment that's going to make some modifications into proposals that are being discussed, and I think I'll wait for the discussions on the specifics until that amendment is offered. . . .
But I will tell you the best news that we could give my kids who are going college is to balance the budget. And we only have one proposal before us to balance the budget. And that is the proposal that the Republicans have put forth that will give us a balanced budget.
I remember going to a town meeting not too long ago and somebody that was about 23 years old raised her hand and said, "Senator, will I ever see balanced budget in my lifetime?" And they were just as serious as they could possibly be.
Well, later today or maybe tomorrow we're going to be voting on a balanced budget, but there's only one. President Clinton doesn't have a balanced budget. We do.
 
Charles S. Robb
Democrat of Virginia
I have long believed that it would take courage and wisdom to develop and implement a plan that would lead to a balance budget. Without the courage to make tough choices and the wisdom to place budget policy above partisan politics, our ability to develop an equitable plan that can stand the test of time and public opinion is severely limited. And while I give our Republican friends credit for bringing this package to the floor, I must say that a certain element of this plan does not reflect courage, wisdom or equity.
A particular concern to me are the tax breaks which you've been included in the bill. Mr. President, it does not take courage to cut taxes. That's one of the easiest votes a legislature can cast. What takes courage is to resist politically popular tax cuts at a time we have a nearly $5 billion, $5 trillion debt.
And even a unified balanced budget is at least seven years away if we get there at all. And for all the talk about fiscal responsibility recently, how can we endorse a $245 billion tax cut that makes balancing the budget much more difficult and adds to the debt over the next seven years? . . .
It's not courageous, it's not wise, it's not equitable and I would implore my colleagues to reject the proposition that we should have tax cuts before we have a balanced budget.
 
Bob Graham
Democrat of Florida
This reconciliation proposal is filled with risks: risk of the unknown, risks that have consequences that are beyond our ability to forecast. There is no area in this entire legislation that has a greater risk to the people of this country than the proposals in Medicaid.
We are proposing to cut Medicaid by $187 billion. I repeat, a program last year which had a total Federal expenditure of $89 billion, we're going to cut, over seven years, by $187 billion. It is at risk because we are proposing, for those funds that are left, to place them in an inflexible block grant without Federal participation in terms of dealing with unexpected circumstances, and we are freezing in many of the inequities that have made this program inappropriate in the past.
 
Pete V. Domenici
Republican of New Mexico
Mr. President, speaking of risks, the biggest risk our nation faces is that we not balance our budget and that we continue to spend our children's and grandchildren's money to pay for programs we cannot afford. Obviously, this program is growing so fast, it's unsustainable. But anyone that thinks it is being cut is just not reading the facts. We're going to increase this program to more than $94 billion next year, $124 billion in 2002, and over the entire period of time, this program will increase at a rather healthy rate while most programs in the national Government are either frozen or reduced.
It's time we reformed this system so we can deliver on what we promised. But we also have to deliver on a promise to get interest rates down, to have growth and jobs for our children, and we cannot have the status quo and do that also.

HEADLINE: U.S. Inquiry Begins on Price For Newsprint

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26

 BODY:
The Justice Department said today that it had begun a significant investigation into possible anticompetitive pricing practices in the newsprint industry.
A spokeswoman at the Justice Department, Gina Talamona, announced the antitrust investigation but declined to identify which companies or individuals had been under scrutiny, or to say how far the investigation had progressed or when it could lead to possible legal action. 
 The announcement followed a series of complaints from newspaper publishers this year about the sharply escalating prices of newsprint. The increases have been cutting into newspaper profits, leading to layoffs, newsstand price increases and reductions in the space allotted for news.
Newsprint typically accounts for 20 percent or more of a newspaper's costs and is the second-largest expense, after salaries.
The rise of newsprint prices has been cited as a reason for the closing of The Houston Post and the consolidations at the Times-Mirror Company, as well as the merger of The Milwaukee Journal and The Sentinel.
Three dozen companies produce most of the newsprint consumed in the United States. Antitrust laws bar producers from collaborating on price increases, and suppliers have cited rising prices for pulp and a tight worldwide market for all grades of paper as the reason for the price increases.
An official of a paper industry organization said tonight that he knew nothing of the investigation. The official, Richard E. Storat, a vice president of the American Forest and Paper Association, said when reached at a meeting in Palm Beach, Fla., "This is something we have no knowledge of."
Newsprint is sold by the metric ton, or 2,204 pounds, and large newspapers use hundreds of thousands of metric tons of newsprint annually. For instance, it takes roughly 300,000 metric tons of newsprint to produce The New York Times every year. The price of newsprint has risen steadily in recent years, from $469 a metric ton in 1994 to $675 this spring.
Financial analysts and experts in the newsprint and newspaper industries say the explanation for the speed of the price climb is the law of supply and demand, which has had a sharp effect because an unusual combination of factors has exaggerated the price swings typical of commodity markets.
After suffering huge losses in recent years, when newsprint prices were at their lows, the newsprint industry has been trying to catch up. At the same time, the costs of raw materials used to make newsprint have climbed sharply.
Moreover, demand for newsprint has been up worldwide. As newspapers recover from the recession, they are selling more advertising and printing more pages. But supply has not been keeping up because mills have been running near capacity for years and virtually no new mills have been built in North America. 
 "An official of a paper industry organization said tonight that he knew nothing of the investigation. The official, Richard E. Storat, a vice president of the American Forest and Paper Association, said when reached at a meeting in Palm Beach, Fla., 'This is something we have no knowledge of.' "

CORRECTION-DATE: October 28, 1995, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about a Justice Department investigation of pricing in the newsprint industry referred imprecisely to the price of paper. Newsprint cost about $675 a metric ton last spring; it is now $730 to $750 and is expected to be around $800 early next year.
In addition, because of a production error, the continuation of the article included a scrambled passage in some copies. The passage should have read:

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall Amid Worries Over Earnings

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market tumbled again yesterday as traders and investors continued to find signs of consumer weakness in corporate earnings reports.
More disappointing earnings results yesterday fueled the market's nervousness. A durable goods report that was stronger than expected also revived worries that the Federal Reserve would not cut short-term interest rates again this year. A rate cut would mean lower borrowing costs for companies, thus improving the prospects for earnings growth. 
 "It doesn't take much to get a decline in stock prices going these days," said Hugh A. Johnson, senior vice president of the First Albany Corporation. "If anything is bothering investors, it's the volatility in the market. So if you are looking for a reason to sell, you can find it everywhere."
The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one point during the session fell more 80 points for its largest one-day decline in more than three months, partly recovered late in the day to close at 4,703.82, down 49.86 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.75 points, to 576.72, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 8.90 points, to 1,017.57.
A drop of more than 50 points in the Dow industrials at 2:27 P.M. set off the New York Stock Exchange's "collar," an effort to stabilize the market by curbing computer-guided trading programs. There were four such sell programs and one buy program yesterday, which accounted for 82 percent of the final decline in the average.
"This is an edgy market, but it's not the end of the world," said Jeffrey Rubin, an analyst for Birinyi Associates. "This is not the correction."
Declining issues on the Big Board overwhelmed the advancers, 1,727 to 664. A total of 467.7 million shares changed hands, compared with 433.6 million shares Wednesday.
A Commerce Department report that durable-goods orders surged unexpectedly by 3 percent last month was interpreted by analysts as an indication of faster economic growth that might cause the Federal Reserve to hold off on lowering interest rates. As a result, bond prices plummeted. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.39 percent, from 6.32 percent on Wednesday.
Among the companies that announced weak earnings yesterday were Xerox, Browning-Ferris and Philips Electronics. Xerox dropped 3 5/8, to 131; Browning-Ferris declined 2 3/4, to 28, and Philips Electronics fell 5, to 36 7/8.
Drug stocks, which have had run-ups recently, slid as signs developed that their earnings growth had peaked. Johnson & Johnson declined 1 5/8, to 80 3/8; American Home Products was down 1 1/8, to 89 1/2, and Upjohn fell 7/8, to 48 3/4.
Money-center banks were under pressure for the seventh day in the last eight, with more and more questions arising over the quality of their consumer credit-card loan portfolios. BankAmerica closed at 58 5/8, down 1 1/4; Chase closed at 56 1/2, down 1/8, and J.P. Morgan closed at 76 1/2, down 1/2.
Petroleum producers and refiners also fell, following a downgrading by Merrill Lynch of its investment opinion on Exxon -- partially because of fears that oil prices may get lower. Exxon dropped 1 1/2, to 75; Texaco fell 1, to 67 1/4; Amoco declined 5/8, to 64 1/2, and Mobil was down 1 5/8, to 100.
 Another article in Business Day on Oct. 27, about the previous day's stock trading, described Xerox's earnings incorrectly. Xerox's net income, which rose 27 percent, came in slightly higher than Wall Street analysts had forecast.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 6, 1995, Monday

 CORRECTION:
A brief report by Reuters in Business Day on Oct. 27 about the financial results of the Xerox Corporation referred to one figure incorrectly. Xerox's property and casualty insurance company, Talegen Holdings Inc., lost $20 million in the third quarter; it did not take a charge of that amount. The article also misstated the ownership of Talegen. It remains a unit of Xerox.

Economy Grew in Summer At Surprisingly Brisk Pace
 
The economy rebounded vigorously over the summer, growing at a 4.2 percent pace that surpassed nearly all expectations, the Commerce Department reported, while inflation, already low, subsided still further. "We're on the right track," President Clinton declared, trying to take advantage of the sunny report for his budget negotiations with the Congress. [Page 1.]
 
Stock prices rebounded after Thursday's selloff as money managers took heart that inflation appeared to be under control. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 37.93 points, to 4,741.75. Bank stocks and technology issues were strong. [37.]
 
Bond prices swung widely as traders first feared that the strong economy would keep the Fed from lowering interest rates further, then tempered their reaction, seeing hope for a budget accord. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.35. [36.]
 
Allied Signal to Cut 3,100 Jobs
 
Allied Signal reported a 15 percent rise in third-quarter net income but said profit in its automotive parts unit was off. The company said it would cut 3,100 jobs in that division, or about 3.7 percent of its total work force, and quit the car anti-lock brakes business. Allied's shares rose $2, to $43.375. [35.]
 
Aetna Earnings Jump 42%
 
Aetna Life reported an unexpectedly large 42 percent gain in third-quarter earnings from operations, to $212.6 million, citing reduced costs for pollution cleanup. [35.]
 
Look Out Coke, Arizona Is Coming
 
The small but feisty Arizona iced tea company is entering the cola wars. It is now making three flavored colas and a root beer. The line is being watched closely because of Arizona's record for smart product innovations. [35.]
 
Oil Partners Press Moscow
 
Kazakhstan and its partner Chevron are trying to win Russia's agreement to ship more oil from their Tengiz fields. They are also planning to build a pipeline to connect to the Black Sea. If successful, Chevron could finally cash in on its $1 billion investment. [34.]
 
Airbags Tied to Childrens' Deaths
 
Eight children may have been killed by airbags, according to a Government official, who said a redesign may be needed. [6.]
 
For TV Industry, a Cut-Rate Sale
 
Buried in the budget bill is a plan to sell off a chunk of the nation's airwaves over the next seven years for an estimated $14 billion. It would give broadcasters licenses for "advanced television service," such as high-definition or interactive television, that Government economists say could be worth $70 billion. [9.]
 
The Senate veered away from the House in approving several changes to the bill to balance the Federal budget by 2002. It killed a provision to let corporations withdraw billions of dollars in surplus assets from their pension funds, retained the Federal guarantee of Medicaid coverage for a variety of poor people and kept regulations on nursing homes. [1.]
 
Tougher Limits on Lobbyists
 
House Republicans plan a vote in November on tighter registration rules for lobbyists and on banning gifts to representatives and their staffs. The Senate adopted similar measures during the summer. [8.]
 
No Comment to the Japanese
 
In an unusually tart exchange, the State Department told the Japanese Ambassador that it would not explain or confirm reports that the C.I.A. spied on Japanese negotiators during tense economic talks this year. [4.]
Japanese regulators accused Merrill Lynch Japan of violating a rule meant to prevent brokerage firms from manipulating stocks during new-securities sales. Some analysts saw the move as a retaliation for American criticism of the big loss at Daiwa Bank. [34.]
 
Smaller Awards in Implant Case
 
The judge presiding over the silicone breast implant case disclosed details of a proposed
settlement, including proposals that would further reduce awards to claimants. [10.]

Dollar Gains, Aided by Peso
 
The dollar gained, benefiting from recoveries in the Mexican peso and French franc. It rose to 1.4090 German marks and 101.93 yen. [46.]

GRAPHIC: Chart: "YESTERDAY"
Dow Industrials -- 4,741.75 Up 37.93

HEADLINE: BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET;
White House Gets Specific on New Debt Ceiling

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 27

 BODY:
In the Administration's latest entreaty to Congress to avoid hitting the national debt ceiling in coming days, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has asked for a temporary increase of $85 billion, which he said should keep the Government running until mid-January.
Until today, Mr. Rubin and Speaker Newt Gingrich had parried over the debt limit, and the White House had declined to specify how large a temporary increase it would find acceptable. But with only days left before the current $4.9 trillion limit on borrowing is reached, Mr. Rubin made his first specific appeal in a letter to Mr. Gingrich. 
 The Administration's chances of getting that large an increase are almost nil. Congressional Republicans have not committed to any short-term increase, and they say that any permanent increase in the limit would be included in the spending bill they send to President Clinton. Mr. Clinton has repeatedly vowed to veto that bill, and said he would not submit to "economic blackmail" by signing it simply to achieve an increase in the debt limit.
Earlier this week Mr. Rubin said that unless an agreement was reached by Nov. 1, the Treasury would have to put off a $100 billion quarterly re-funding of its debt, a step that could have considerable cost. He has said repeatedly that the Republicans would have to bear the responsibility for driving the United States to the edge of default; the Republicans have said that he has manufactured the crisis.

HEADLINE: Georgia Neese Clark Gray, 95, First Woman as U.S. Treasurer

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Georgia Neese Clark Gray, whose signature -- as Georgia Neese Clark -- appeared on some $30 billion in paper money while she was the first woman to serve as Treasurer of the United States, died on Thursday at the Brewster Place retirement community in Topeka, Kan. She was 95.
President Harry S. Truman chose Mrs. Gray to be Treasurer in 1949, a year the Democratic Party promised a New Deal for women aspiring to high office. She had been a small-town Kansas banker and a Democratic National Committeewoman since 1936. Her confirmation by the Senate was unanimous. 
 As the nation's 29th Treasurer, she was in charge of all the bills and coins along with Government securities held in the vaults in Washington. The office is a division of the Treasury Department. When Dwight D. Eisenhower became President in 1953 he selected another woman to succeed her, Ivy Baker Priest, a Utah Republican.
Mrs. Gray was a highly visible figure in Democratic Party affairs, including its national conventions. She was an associate of Eleanor Roosevelt, with whom she often shared the speakers' platform.
After serving as a National Committeewoman for 28 years, Mrs. Gray resigned in 1964 to devote herself full time to banking and other business and farming interests.
Georgia Neese was born in Richland, a rural community of about 200 people 15 miles southeast of Topeka, where her father, Albert, had founded the Richland State Bank in 1892.
She received a bachelor's degree in economics from what is now Washburn University of Topeka in 1921. She then studied acting in New York and toured the country with stock companies for 10 years.
Her stage career ended when her father's health faltered and the arrival of talking pictures diminished the appeal of traveling stage troupes. By then she had married George M. Clark, her manager. They were divorced in the mid-1940's.
At her father's death in 1937 she became president of the bank; in 1964 she moved it to Topeka and renamed it the Capital City State Bank.
Her friend and mentor, Harry Truman, helped to dedicate the new bank. "Mrs. Gray is the only United States Treasurer since the Civil War who really worked at her job," he told the crowd. "She knows money affairs as well as any man, and anyone who brings their money here will know it is in charge of someone who knows how to take care of it."
Mrs. Gray was remarried in 1953 to Andrew J. Gray, a former New York and Washington newspaperman and press agent. He died last year. She is survived by a nephew, Ward Keller of Manhattan.
