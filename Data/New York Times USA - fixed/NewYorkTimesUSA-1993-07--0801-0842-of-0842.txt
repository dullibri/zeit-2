HEADLINE: Police Investigation Supervisor Admits Faking Fingerprints

 BODY:
In a widening scandal that has rocked the New York State Police, a lieutenant who supervised criminal investigations in seven upstate counties admitted yesterday that he had faked fingerprint evidence in three cases.
The lieutenant, Craig D. Harvey, also said in court in Delhi, N.Y., that he had been assisted in fabricating evidence by another lieutenant, Patrick O'Hara, who works out of state police headquarters in Albany supervising drug and organized-crime investigations. 
 Mr. who pleaded guilty yesterday in one case, was immediately dismissed from the force, and Lieutenant O'Hara, who has not been charged, was suspended without pay for 30 days pending an inquiry. Two other troopers had previously pleaded guilty in the scandal.
Taken together, yesterday's events painted a picture of almost routine fabrication of evidence in criminal cases in the identification unit of Troop C, based in Sidney, 65 miles southwest of Syracuse, beginning at least as far back as 1984. In general, officials said, investigators would use fabricated fingerprint evidence to build cases against people who had already been identified as suspects.
 
Another Arrest Expected
 The scandal has already undermined several criminal convictions, and in one case, led to the dismissal of charges of being accessory to murder against a woman who prosecutors now say had been jailed for a crime she did not commit.
Nelson E. Roth, the special prosecutor appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to investigate the Troop C scandal, said yesterday that he expected "at least one additional arrest," apparently alluding to Lieutenant O'Hara.
"The whole affair is incredibly disheartening and unfortunately creates some unwarranted public scrutiny of the entire state police," added Mr. Roth, who said he believed that the scandal was limited to Troop C.
Just last month, Thomas A. Constantine, the superintendent of the state police, predicted that there would be no additional arrests. He was in New Jersey yesterday and not available for comment, said James V. Atkins, his spokesman.
In March, Mr. Constantine issued a sweeping series of changes in the rules governing evidence handling to prevent a repeat of the scandal.
 
Whole Identification Unit
 Two other investigators from Troop C have admitted faking fingerprint evidence against suspects in various crimes. But Lieutenant Harvey was the highest-ranking officer to admit wrongdoing in the scandal, which now encompasses all five investigators who worked in Troop C's criminal identification unit between 1982 and 1992.
"What you have here is a very serious problem within a particular troop," said Richard Girgenti, the state's criminal justice director. "We're satisfied a complete review has been and is taking place."
But Mr. Girgenti said there was no way to know when the state police would have learned of the scandal if a former investigator, David L. Harding, had not bragged to a C.I.A. official during a job interview that he had faked fingerprint evidence to help win criminal convictions.
In the first of two court appearances yesterday, Lieutenant Harvey pleaded guilty in Delhi, in Delaware County, to faking fingerprints in a 1986 double murder, and admitted faking fingerprints in two burglaries dating from 1984. He agreed in a plea bargain to serve 2 1/2 to 7 1/2 years in prison.
 
Implicated by Friend
 He also implicated Lieutenant O'Hara, a close friend. Both men are 17-year veterans of the force and joined Troop C in 1982. When they were promioted to lieutenant in 1989, Lieutenant Harvey was made a supervisor of criminal investigations in Troop C, and Lieutenant O'Hara was assigned to Albany.
In a separate proceeding yesterday afternoon in Tioga County Court in Owego, Investigator David M. Beers, who pleaded not guilty in May to evidence-tampering charges, pleaded not guilty to new charges that he faked a fingerprint on a machine gun during a 1991 narcotics investigation.
As second in command of Troop C's bureau of criminal investigation, Lieutenant Harvey directly supervised 40 investigators, including Mr. Beers, Mr. Harding and Robert M. Lishansky. Mr. Harding and Mr. Lishansky have pleaded guilty to evidence tampering in two dozen criminal cases and are serving prison terms.
The 4,000-member state police force handles most serious crimes in rural upstate New York, giving critical forensic and laboratory aid to local police and sheriff's departments.
 
Problem With Confession
 The department plays a much less visible role in New York City and on Long Island, but it recently drew attention with the June arrest of Joel Rifkin, an unemployed landscaper who the authorities say has admitted killing 17 women. He was picked up after troopers discovered a body in the back of his pickup truck during a routine traffic stop.
Even in that case, though, the state police has drawn criticism for failing to make either video or audio recordings of Mr. Rifkin's confessions or to have him sign a written confession.
The state police learned from Federal officials last summer that Mr. Harding had bragged in a 1991 job interview with the C.I.A. about faking fingerprints. Mr. Harding pleaded guilty last December to fabricating fingerprint evidence in four cases, and his partner, Mr. Lishansky, pleaded guilty in April to evidence tampering in 21 cases.
Also in April, Mr. Harvey became the third trooper charged in the scandal when prosecutors accused him of lying when he claimed to have discovered a murder suspect's fingerprint at a crime scene. In court yesterday, Lieutenant Harvey said he and Lieutenant O'Hara lifted the suspect's fingerprint from equipment in Troop C headquarters after the suspect was booked, and later claimed they had found the fingerprint at the scene of an execution-style double murder.
The suspect, John Spencer, was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison, but has asked the judge to void his conviction because the faked fingerprint was part of the case against him.
"The terrible thing is that the fingerprint wasn't crucial to the case," said Malcolm C. Hughes, the former Delaware County District Attorney who prosecuted the double murder.
 
Troopers Under a Cloud
 All five investigators in the identification unit of Troop C in Sidney, N.Y., from 1982 to 1992 have been implicated in an evidence-tampering scandal.
DAVID L. HARDING A former investigator and 7-year veteran of the force, was sentenced Dec. 16, 1992, to 4 to 12 years in prison and fined $20,000 for fabricating evidence in four cases.
ROBERT M. LISHANSKY A former investigator and 11-year veteran, was sentenced June 10 to 6 to 18 years in prison for faking evidence in 21 cases.
CRAIG D. HARVEY A lieutenant who once headed the identification unit and was a 16-year veteran, admitted on July 29 that he had fabricated evidence in three cases, and agreed to serve 2 1/2 to 7 years in prison.
DAVID M. BEERS An investigator and 15-year veteran, pleaded not guilty on May 5 and on July 29 to fabricating evidence in two cases.
PATRICK O'HARA A lieutenant and 16-year veteran, was suspended July 29 pending an investigation into Mr. Harvey's allegations that Lieutenant O'Hara helped fake evidence.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEBATE;
Crux of Debate On Energy Tax: $1.18 a Month

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
With everything riding on politics and perception, and substance amounting to little, seven Democratic Senators spent all day today and worked into the night to figure out how much they could raise the gasoline tax and still carry enough votes to pass President Clinton's deficit-reduction bill. They got hung up over whether to require the typical driver to pay an extra $1.18 a month for gasoline.
At midafternoon, the Senators -- the Democratic conferees on the tax portion of the budget package -- decided that an increase of 6.5 cents per gallon in the 14.1-cent Federal gasoline tax did not do the trick. 
 Since the six Republican tax conferees will vote "no" on everything, all seven Democrats must stick together. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, one of the seven, said 6.5 cents was too high for him. In addition, the word outside the room was that there was no way 50 Senators, the bare minimum, would vote for the bill if the gasoline tax went up that much.
So the conferees adjourned for the afternoon and met again this evening to see whether 6 cents would fly.
It wouldn't. So the conferees reverted to the 4.3 cents in the original Senate bill. "The probability is that the Senate gasoline tax is where we will end up," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the chief Senate tax negotiator, when the session ended for the night.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, said he expected the conferees to approve a compromise on the deficit-reduction legislation Friday and send it to the House and Senate for final votes next week.
 
Four Cents a Day
 In reality, they were talking about less than 4 cents a day per driver. According to the World Almanac, the average driver drove 12,858 miles last year. At 20 miles to the gallon, that amounts to 642.9 gallons of gasoline for each driver. Senator Baucus argues that his constituents drive much longer distances than the average, but Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey says studies show that Western drivers commute distances that, by and large, are no longer than those in the East.
A 6.5-cent increase would cost the average driver $41.79 more a year for gasoline. A 4.3-cent increase would cost $27.60, a difference of $14.19 a year. That is what the fate of the legislation and, possibly, the ultimate success or failure of the Clinton Presidency is hanging on.
The main elements of the budget package -- higher tax rates for upper-income taxpayers, deep cuts in spending for the military and a variety of other tax and spending measures -- were settled long ago. Everything now revolves around the gasoline tax. It is the only additional tax in the bill that would fall on middle-income workers.
The President and Democrats in Congress say they want to reduce the Federal budget deficit by $500 billion over five years. If the gasoline tax is high enough, other taxes can be lowered or spending programs can be cut by less. But if the increase is lower, other taxes must be raised or cuts in programs must be deeper. As a practical matter, that probably means a stricter limit on the growth of Medicare spending.
 
Dealing With the House
 Then there is the ticklish matter of the House of Representatives. The House has proposed an increase of 9 cents per gallon in the gasoline tax, which would cost the average driver $57.86 a year, and it wants to use the extra money for social programs or for tax incentives for businesses.
No one was willing to predict this evening where Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chief House negotiator, was likely to stand. But no one expected him to accept the Senate's position without change. That would amount to a loss of face.
Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a deputy Democratic whip, said a gasoline tax in the range of 6 cents could be passed by the House.
When President Clinton was asked what he thought was the likelihood of his program being approved, he said: "I think it's good. You have to listen not only to what's being said but to how it's being said."
Administration officials and their supporters in Congress touted today a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showing that the public, by a margin of 54 percent to 32 percent, thought that the Clinton economic plan would be a step in the right direction.
Senator John B. Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, said the poll showed that the Administration's lobbying and publicity blitz was working.
But in the Senate, where all 44 Republicans are pledged to vote against the President, the program still seemed to lack enough votes for passage. "The President's package does not have the votes of 50 senators today," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut.
None of the six Democratic Senators who voted against the budget last month have been turned around. And today, Senator Herb Kohl, the Wisconsin Democrat who voted for the bill last month, said he would vote against it next week if it contained a gasoline tax increase higher than the 4.3 cents in the original Senate bill.
The recess is supposed to begin the end of next week. But the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said the recess would not begin until the budget bill was approved.
One possible way to relieve the pressure, Mr. Lieberman said, would be to fall slightly short of the goal of $500 billion in deficit reduction over five years, perhaps to only $485 billion.
But Senator Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin said that might shake his support. "My greatest concern," Senator Feingold said, "is that at the 10th or 11th hour, someone will decide they can shave off 10 or 20 billion."

HEADLINE: Special Pleaders: A periodic look at lobbying.;
Lobbyists Appear Inept When They're the Issue

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
When they come up with just the right campaign to defeat a piece of legislation, Washington's lobbyists can bury Congress in letters and mailgrams. They can overwhelm the White House switchboard with angry phone calls, forcing the Government to take notice.
But now that they are trying to devise a lobbying strategy on their own behalf -- to keep their tax deduction for lobbying expenses -- they seem so torn by insecurity about their own standing with Congress and the American people that they have become virtually paralyzed. 
 "It's obvious we're not the white hats," said Richard H. Kimberly, president of the American League of Lobbyists. "Supporting lobbyists would be a very dangerous thing for any member of Congress to do." As a result, he added, "it's been very hard to get people to listen very much."
Timothy Jenkins, a lobbyist who formed a small coalition of businesses and trade groups to fight the move to do away with the deduction, puts it bluntly: "Name a member of Congress who's going to stand up and take this on. This is something that's very appealing to the public."
The plan to eliminate the tax deduction for lobbying expenses was proposed by President Clinton and is a part of the budget reconciliation bill now being debated by a Senate-House conference committee. The Administration estimates that the provision would raise $800 million to $1.2 billion a year for the Government.
Lobbyists deplore the idea. Using language that echoes some of their recent campaigns, they warn that eliminating the deduction would drive some of them out of business, deprive hundreds and perhaps thousands of people of their jobs, damage the economy and thus result in added costs to the Government instead of savings.
 
The Postage Argument
 Robert Boege, a vice president of the American Society of Association Executives, took one phrase in the bill to an illogical extreme and suggested that if it became law, businesses and trade groups would have to spend more than $83 million a year in postage alone.
He made that calculation by adding up the names on the membership lists of every association that ever lobbies -- 287 million names, he said, because many people are on more than one list. Since members would not be able to deduct that portion of their dues that was used to pay for lobbying, Mr. Boege said, associations would have to mail each of them a letter every year detailing any tax obligations they might have. Each letter would take a 29-cent stamp.
With lines of argument like that, lobbyists in recent times have devised vast grass-roots campaigns to promote issues that seemed sure losers at the start. For example, the restaurant industry has staged so effective a lobbying campaign that Congress now appears ready to retreat from its decision to reduce the tax deduction for business meals, a matter on which it seemed resolute only a month ago.
If lobbyists "put 100 percent effort" into defeating the loss of their own tax deduction, Mr. Kimberly said, "I think we could stop it."
But aside from a few desultory efforts, none seem willing to try.
 
'Who's the Grass Roots?'
 "There's been some discussion of starting a grass-roots campaign," Mr. Kimberly said. "But it would take a significant amount of money because you'd have to lobby the whole country.
Casey Dinges, a lobbyist for the American Society of Civil Engineers, doubts that such a campaign would succeed. "Who's the grass roots they'd be using?" he asked. "Even my own members see me as a necessary evil. I don't know what kind of grass-roots campaign any of them would be able to bring to bear."
Many lobbyists say that another reason most of their colleagues seem unwilling to engage in a fight for their own is that they worry that their employers might not like it.
"My philosophy is you have to play to have a chance of winning," said Mr. Dinges, a board member of the lobbyists' league. "But this one, it's so funny. I sit in on the board meetings, and it's almost as if we're paid by people to lobby on substantive issues; we're not paid to lobby on our own livelihood. So nobody does anything.
"The other thing," he added, "is that the atmospherics on this thing are so negative, it's like hopeless."
During the Presidential campaign last year, Ross Perot and, to a lesser extent, Mr. Clinton blamed lobbyists and "special interests" for much of what was wrong in Washington.
Many lobbyists say they felt wounded by those attacks. So in January the lobbyists' league decided to run advertisements and encourage press coverage of what they considered the positive aspects of their work.
But in February, Mr. Clinton jabbed at the lobbyists again, complaining in a speech about his new economic program that "special interests" were already out to defeat him. "Many have already lined the corridors of power with high-priced lobbyists," he said.
With that, many lobbyists say, they simply gave up. "We backed off the campaign," Mr. Kimberly said. "It was pointless."
And when the lobbying deduction proposal came forward, most lobbyists decided it was pointless to fight that, too. Besides, their clients wanted them to spend their time on other issues in the budget bill. "It's frustrating," Mr. Kimberly acknowledged.
Jack Bonner agrees. He runs Bonner & Associates, a lobbying company that mounts large-scale grass-roots campaigns for a wide range of clients.
"To me, this whole thing is a terrific opportunity for us," he said of the lobbying deduction proposal. "Here's a chance to change the public perception with a big campaign.
"One reason lobbying gets such a bad reputation is that no one is willing to stand up for it."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Soars Above $400; First Time in 3 Years

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Gold prices soared above $400 an ounce yesterday for the first time in about three years as growing concerns that the European Monetary System is near collapse sent investors rushing to precious metals. Silver also hit a three-year high.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery ended the day at $397.80 an ounce, up $4.40, after surging as high as $401 an ounce. December gold, the most active futures contract, jumped $4.40 to settle at $402.20 an ounce. Meanwhile, silver for September delivery jumped 5 cents, to $5.22 an ounce. 
 Germany's central bank left its key discount rate unchanged yesterday and lowered its Lombard rate only slightly, throwing the European Exchange Rate Mechanism into chaos. The mechanism is designed to keep currencies trading in a narrow band.
Investors buy gold when currency fluctuations threaten the value of other assets. "People are very nervous that the E.R.M. is about to fall apart," said Julia Bussie, an analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons.
"It was a flight to gold as a safe haven," Ian McDonald, vice president of the precious metals division at Credit Suisse in New York, said. "People don't see how the E.R.M. can hold together if Germany refused to cut its rates more."
Some traders predicted that gold would probably continue to climb after breaking through the psychologically important level of $400 an ounce. "It's only going higher," said a trader with the Millennium Futures Group in New York.
And William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch in New York, said he was looking to see if gold rises to $420 an ounce in the next few weeks, based on renewed investor confidence and a trend toward lower interest rates. Lower rates can lead to higher inflation, making gold more attractive.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING;
The Floods' Environmental Legacy: Mankind's Bane Is Wildlife's Boon

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KAMPSVILLE, Ill., July 28

 BODY:
For weeks it was all that state and Federal officials here in the Upper Mississippi Basin could do to cope with the vast destruction and hardship wrought by the great floods of 1993. It is only now, with the water in large stretches of this region receding, that they are beginning to turn full attention to the environmental aftereffects.
What they are finding is that the danger of tetanus, toxic contamination and disease-carrying mosquitoes does not seem particularly severe at this point, although it may pose some threat to the people of the Midwest for quite a while. 
 At the same time, the floods are already proving to be a boon to much of the region's plants and wildlife, having provided them with lush new feeding and breeding grounds.
 
Fertilization and Feast
 Plants along vast stretches of the Mississippi River have been newly fertilized by sediment from the floods. Ducks and other waterfowl that feed on the plants are thriving throughout much of the region. Fish have been dispersed to large new bodies of water where the aquatic nutrients they need are plentiful, and their numbers are exploding. The eagles and hawks that feed on the fish can look forward to a banner year.
"What we have are certain feasts and famines on the river system," said Robert L. Delaney, program manager of the Environmental Management Technical Center, a Federal research office in Onalaska, Wis. "Drought is a famine for the aquatic system and the animals that live in it. What we have now represents the feast part of the cycle. For the whole aquatic system, it is good."
The floods' effect on farm fields is also being studied by scientists, although the results of this research are not likely to be known for months after the waters fully recede. Scientists generally believe that flood waters deposit rich nutrients on low-lying fields, giving them a free application of natural fertilizer. But it is not known how much long-term damage has been done outside the flood plain by erosion resulting from the extraordinarily heavy rain in the Midwest this summer.
 
Ribbon of Undisturbed Nature
 The plants and animals that are the beneficiaries of the floods' bounty reside for the most part in a long and narrow ribbon of wet ground and open water that is the largest inland flood-plain ecosystem in the United States. The ribbon extends along the Mississippi for more than 500 miles, from roughly the midpoint of Missouri's eastern border north to St. Paul; a spur stretches northeast along a Mississippi tributary, the Illinois River, from St. Louis to Peoria, Ill.
Much of the ecosystem was formed during the last half-century by the construction of locks and dams. As each dam went up, water that was restrained by it formed marshlands and open "pools" -- actually the size of lakes -- upstream.
Many of these marshes and pools are now protected from development by their designation as Federal or state wildlife refuges, and, unlike large developed stretches of the Upper Basin, most of the more than one million undeveloped acres along the ribbon have no levees to wall them off from the whims of flooding.
 
'A Time-Share Apartment'
 And that is precisely the way nature likes it. Although the floods of this historic summer have spread the ecosystem to land that it had not visited in decades, scientists have long understood that the more modest flooding that is a regular occurrence of springtime is every bit as vital to natural life along the Mississippi as are fires to the renewal of Western forests.
Indeed, "the absence of a flood is a much bigger disturbance in this ecosystem" than even the most severe flooding, said Richard E. Sparks, an ecologist in Havana, Ill., about 80 miles upstream of this flooded town along the Illinois River.
"Deer will simply move out during the flood and move back in when water recedes," said Dr. Sparks, who is director of the River Research Laboratories for a state agency, the Illinois Natural History Survey. "On the other hand, fish and other aquatic organisms will move into flooded lands to take advantage of the food available. It's like the flood plain is a time-share apartment. The land animals use it part of the time, and aquatic animals use it the other part of the time, depending on the river stage."
 
Threat of Disease
 For people, of course, the floods of 1993 have not been nearly so easy. Beyond the dozens of lives lost and the billions of dollars in damage, the flooding continues to pose a threat of disease and illness. So far, though, health officials foresee no vast outbreak.
To keep matters that way, emergency crews are working day and night to repair public water systems and sewage-treatment plants overcome by the flooding. Because of the threat of tetanus and other infections from fecal bacteria let loose by swamped sewage plants, health officials continue to warn Midwesterners to be immunized before wading into flood waters and to bathe carefully afterward. And states are forming teams of technical experts to help homeowners sterilize private water wells and household pipes that the flooding has contaminated with bacteria.
Another concern is that standing water left by the floods will give rise to swarms of mosquitoes, including one species, Culex pipiens, that carries a strain of potentially lethal encephalitis. But Illinois health officials who trapped mosquitoes in flooded areas found none that were carrying the disease, a sign that the threat at this point is low.
Still, officials of the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are meeting in Kansas City, Mo., with representatives of Midwestern state health departments this week to prepare plans for battling mosquitoes, should such a fight become necessary. Among the proposals under consideration is aerial spraying of standing water with chemical insecticides.
"It's all going to depend on the situation," said Linn Haramis, an entomologist for the Illinois Department of Public Health. "If it's just nuisance mosquitoes, that is one thing, unless they become so bad that it interferes with the cleanup. If it's a disease problem, that is a different situation. Mosquitoes like standing water, and right now the water is still moving along and we aren't finding much of a problem. We don't want to apply chemicals for the sake of applying chemicals."
 
Pollution by Chemicals
 Yet another focus of attention is pollution by toxic chemicals flowing from swamped farm-chemical warehouses, gasoline stations, industrial storage sites and the like. But officials of Iowa and Illinois, as well as the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, have taken samples of flood waters and detected only traces of such compounds.
"The dilution factor is enormous," said Harry Hendrickson, a ground-water specialist for the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources. "Any toxic materials are spread out to the point where we are not expecting it to be a big concern."
Nevertheless, officials are wary that chemical compounds, having bonded to sediment carried by the flood waters, may be deposited in marshes and elsewhere along the flood plain to form "hot spots" of toxicity. The states and the E.P.A. are developing plans for more extensive testing of water and soil once the flood waters fully recede.
A greater worry is the disposal of the enormous quantities of toxic substances -- used motor oil, cleaning agents, chemical solvents, home pesticides, paint and the like -- that homeowners and businesses will be removing from their flooded properties.
The states are already urging homeowners to separate toxic material from ruined household items that are bound for landfills. The toxic agents are to be handled by trained personnel and disposed of at licensed hazardous-waste centers. An official in Iowa said he was expecting the largest amount of household toxic agents ever collected in that state.
 
A Vast Open-Air Lab
 As health officials prepare for the cleanup, environmental scientists are poised to turn the Upper Basin into an open-air laboratory for studying nature's resiliency to floods and the lessons offered by what Barry Drazkowski calls "a once in a lifetime event."
"What makes the Mississippi River so unique is that you have such rich wildlife habitat co-existing with billions of dollars in economic uses by people," said Mr. Drazkowski, deputy director of the Environmental Management Technical Center. Given continued agricultural and business development and mankind's management of the Mississippi's flow, "the river is changing," he said, "and we need to understand this flood in every way we are able to. Without that, we can't begin to try to do a better job managing the natural values and the economic values."
But already it is evident that nature was well prepared for these vast floods. The pulse of nutrients in sediments carried by the flood waters has fertilized thick crops of aquatic plants on which ducks and other birds feed. The high waters spreading across farm fields and marshes have also dispersed turtles and other predators that feed on baby ducks. Federal researchers using radio tracking devices have found that more ducklings than usual are surviving this year and are likely to make it to adulthood, said Mr. Delaney, the technical center's program manager.
Because of the greater quantity of food in the marshes, he said, migrating ducks and geese are likely to find particularly favorable conditions for their flight south later this year. Scientists are also predicting abundance for the eagles and hawks that feed on fish. The flood has opened new areas to the fish, and Mr. Delaney said commercial fishermen had reported that catfish and other game species were more plentiful than ever before.
One case in which the floods may have increased ecological problems is occurring on the Illinois River, said Dr. Sparks, the Illinois official who heads the River Research Laboratories. That case involves the zebra mussel, an alien species native to Europe.
Zebra mussels invaded the Great Lakes years ago, brought there by trans-Atlantic shipping, and have caused economic havoc by attaching themselves to boat bottoms and piers and clogging intake pipes at power stations, municipal water plants and industrial plants.
The Chicago River, which flows from Lake Michigan and into the Illinois, has provided an outlet for the zebra mussels to invade the Mississippi ultimately. Wildlife officials have found swarms of zebra mussels in the Illinois this month, and they fear that zebra-mussel larvae are riding flood crests into tributaries of the Mississippi not only in Illinois but also in Iowa and Missouri. So adaptable are zebra mussels, Dr. Sparks said, that they could outcompete and displace two species of endangered native mussels.

HEADLINE: G.D.P. Gain Is Stronger In Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
In a moderate rebound powered by the spending of consumers and businesses, the economy's growth rate climbed to 1.6 percent in the second quarter as inflation eased, the Commerce Department reported today.
While the rise in gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services within American boundaries -- was short of most expectations, there was wide agreement among analysts that the 1.6 percent advance was better than it appeared and represented significant improvement from the meager expansion of seven-tenths of a percent for the first three months of the year. 
 "The actual implication of the report for the economy, going forward, was fine," said William C. Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. He cited buoyant consumer spending, which surged 3.8 percent, and continued robust investments by businesses in new equipment. Indeed, the total annualized value of G.D.P. adjusted for inflation in the second quarter exceeded $5 trillion for the first time, reaching $5.019 trillion.
 
 
Bond Prices Are Lifted
 Bond prices rose smartly today, apparently reflecting the market's belief that the Federal Reserve will find it hard to raise interest rates when economic growth remains subpar and inflation is on the decline. [Page D12.]
For the first half of 1993, the economy's growth rate has been only about 1.2 percent, compared with 4 percent in the second half of 1992.
An index published with the G.D.P. data showed prices rose at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, down from 3.5 percent in the first three months of the year.
What limited second-quarter growth was a drag from inventories of unsold goods, which had the effect of chopping second-quarter G.D.P. by about two percentage points. All goods produced add to G.D.P., even those that go unsold. Inventories rose only one-fourth as rapidly in the second quarter as in the first, when consumers cut their spending after the holidays and a blizzard disrupted economic life in the East. The effect was that $25.3 billion in inventories was subtracted from second-quarter G.D.P. after $23.7 billion was added in One of those who had expected a higher G.D.P. figure was Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who had predicted last week a second-quarter gain of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. His forecast came during a Congressional appearance where he stressed the need to be vigilant against inflation.
In another report today, the Labor Department found that first-time claims for unemployment insurance jumped 43,000 last week to a 10-month high. Analysts tended to dismiss this, however, since the figures were distorted by annual shutdowns at General Motors auto plants and by flooding in the Midwest.
 
Tyson Cautions Congress
 At the White House, President Clinton's top economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, called the G.D.P. report a mixture of "some bad news and quite a bit of good news." Among the latter, she cited the strong demand by consumers for new cars and other goods.
She took the occasion to caution that a failure by Congress to pass the Administration's budget next week would "send a very disturbing signal to the financial markets" that could undermine the economy.
But while the politics of the budget legislation remained fluid, there seemed little in today's report to shift the debate significantly. Perhaps all that can be said is that the economy, with managable inventories, might have become less vulnerable to proposed tax increases, which Republicans contend will flatten growth.
"The economy's performance was stronger than the 1.6 percent increase suggests," declared Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist in New York for Nationsbank.
 
 
Ninth Quarter of Expansion
 He predicted "three-ish" type growth in the third quarter, a pace that Ms. Tyson and Alan Blinder, also a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, projected for the balance of the year.
The rise in G.D.P. this spring was the ninth straight quarter of expansion after a three-quarter recession that ended in March 1991. Most of the gains have been considerably weaker than normal after a recession, except for a burst of activity in the second half of 1992.
Particularly noteworthy in today's report was the sharp reversal in final sales of domestic products, the sum of all expenditure categories, which expanded at a 3.7 percent pace after declining in the winter at a 1.2 percent rate. To support this spending, however, consumers were forced to tap into savings, with the result that personal savings as a percentage of disposable personal income slipped to 4.3 percent from 4.9 percent in the first quarter.
As for prices, the department estimated that about half of the eight-tenths of a point slowing in the rate of increase in the fixed-weighted price index reflected a pay increase for Federal workers that occurred early in the year. The balance was in consumer prices.
 
 
G.D.P. in Current Dollars
 G.D.P. expressed in current dollars, instead of 1987 dollars, rose at a 4 percent rate, somewhat less than the 4.3 percent pace of the first quarter.
At the White House briefing, Ms. Tyson said in response to questions that Midwest flooding was estimated to add one-tenth or two-tenths of a point to the Consumer Price Index this year and another tenth of a point in 1994, mainly through the food component.
Producer prices could rise more, as much as six-tenths of a point this year and four-tenths next year, she said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Gets 10 Years for Giving Data to Foreigner

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 29

 BODY:
In a harsh warning against sharing official information with foreigners, the Government has sentenced a former Foreign Ministry employee to 10 years in prison for providing documents to a reporter for The Washington Post.
The Beijing Intermediate People's Court confirmed this week that it had given Bai Weiji a 10-year sentence "for the crime of illegally providing national secrets to a foreigner." It said it had sentenced Mr. Bai's wife, Zhao Lei, to six years for the same crime. 
Two others, including a newspaper reporter and an assistant to a Cabinet minister, are believed to have received lesser sentences in the case.
Mr. Bai's sentence is unusually long and apparently reflects the alarm of the State Security Ministry, which handled the case, that China's bureaucracy is turning into a sieve through which confidential information regularly reaches foreigners.
 
Friend Got Documents
 The sentences, which were handed down May 20 and upheld by a higher court this month, were first reported on Sunday in an opinion section essay in The Washington Post. The essay was written by Lena H. Sun, The Post's Beijing correspondent, who was a close friend of Mr. Bai's and the recipient of the documents.
Ms. Sun described how the couple's year-and-a-half-old child, Melanie, is now being cared for by a peasant woman. She recalled that Ms. Zhao, before her arrest, tearfully telephoned to ask Ms. Sun to adopt Melanie.
John T. Kamm, an American who has raised Mr. Bai's case in discussions about human rights with Chinese officials, said he found the length of the sentences "very troubling."
"We haven't had much good news coming out of China in the last few months," Mr. Kamm said, speaking of human rights. "On the contrary, we've had some serious disappointments."
Several dissidents have been arrested in Shanghai since late May and one has been confined to a mental hospital. The authorities have also modestly stepped up their harassment of some dissidents and Christians in other parts of the country.
 
Reporter Briefly Detained
 The authorities arrested Mr. Bai in May 1992. Two weeks later, the case came to public attention when State Security officers briefly detained Ms. Sun and her family and searched The Post's office in Beijing. The security officials seized some documents from the safe and apparently used them in their case against Mr. Bai and his wife.
The United States Embassy in Beijing complained about the search, but Mr. Bai's arrest attracted much less attention. He remained in detention for a year, and Ms. Zhao was arrested in April of this year.
Mr. Bai had been dismissed from the Foreign Ministry in 1989 because of his support for the Tiananmen democracy movement, so he had no direct access to official documents. The two other people convicted in the case apparently were accused of supplying him with the materials that he passed on to Ms. Sun.
The court did not identify the other two, but Chinese familiar with the episode say that one of them is Tang Yi, 36, who was the assistant to Commerce Minister Hu Ping. Mr. Tang is believed to have admitted to the authorities that he showed documents to Mr. Bai but to have insisted that he did not know that they were going to be given to a foreigner.
Mr. Tang's wife, who was pregnant with their first child when he was arrested in September, had an abortion because of uncertainty about her husband's fate. Her career has also been affected; she was passed over for a routine promotion at the hospital where she works.
The fourth person convicted in the case is believed to be Wang Jun, a journalist at People's Daily. Mr. Wang was sentenced to two years in prison.
In her account in The Washington Post, Ms. Sun acknowledged receiving internal documents from Mr. Bai but suggested that they were innocuous ones, relating to People's Daily, a provincial gambling case and other mundane matters.
"The brutal sentences passed on Bai and his wife show just how determined the Beijing authorities are to thwart the emergence of a more open and free society in China, economic reform notwithstanding," said Robin Munro, a researcher in Hong Kong for Asia Watch, a human rights organization.
The Foreign Ministry and the State Council Information Office declined to comment on the sentences.
More than a dozen Chinese have been sent to prison since the early 1980's for giving information to foreigners. In almost every case, the foreigner is scolded and perhaps expelled but not otherwise harmed, while the Chinese is arrested and usually imprisoned for many years.
In 1987, for instance, an editor for the New China News Agency, Tang Dadi, was arrested and charged with providing information to a Japanese reporter. Mr. Tang is apparently still in prison, and he is believed to be serving a seven-year term.
Two years later, in the aftermath of the crackdown on the Tiananmen democracy movement, a 25-year-old student named Zhang Weiping was sentenced to nine years in prison for telephoning the Voice of America radio and passing on "rumors." Mr. Zhang is still apparently serving his sentence.

HEADLINE: U.N. Finds Teen-Age Girls at High Risk of AIDS

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
Sexually active teen-age girls are emerging as the next "leading edge" of the AIDS epidemic, a United Nations study in Europe, Africa and Southeast Asia has found.
An analysis of AIDS research by the United Nations Development Program found that women under the age of 20 have higher rates of infection of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, than older women or young men. 
 The study, released on Wednesday, said one reason for this is that the genital tracts of teen-age girls are not as developed as those in older women and thus leave them more prone to sexually transmitted diseases.
"Suddenly we see young women emerging as the next leading edge of the epidemic," said the author of the study, Dr. Karen Hein of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.
 
Women Infected Earlier
 The analysis looked at information from 31 European countries, and Uganda, Rwanda, Zaire, Thailand and Myanmar, formerly called Burma. It found the rate of H.I.V. infection peaked for young women at age 15 to 25. The peak for men occurred in those 25 to 35.
In most of the developing world, there are as many infected women as men or more, and the women are infected on average 5 to 10 years earlier than the men, the report said.
Studies of rates of infection found that cultural, economic and physical characteristics place teen-age girls at greater risk.
"It is plausible that women become infected more easily than men, possibly at all ages and most definitely when they are in their teens and early 20's and after menopause," the report said.
Dr. Hein said in an interview that the genital tracts of teen-age girls have not developed characteristics that protect older women from transmission of disease.
The vagina in young girls is lined by thin mucous membranes. These thin membranes are a less efficient barrier to the human immunodeficiency virus than the thicker vaginal walls of older women, the report said.
 
Early Sex Affects Development
 In addition, mucous production is thinner than in older women and offers less protection against abrasion and contains fewer immunity-producing cells.
Early sex also affects the development of the cervix and uterus and possibly leaves more of the area called the transition zone where cervical cancer develops exposed to sexually transmitted viruses.
In Thailand, H.I.V. infection in women between 15 and 25 is greater than among all other women. In Uganda, there are more than twice as many AIDS cases among young women 15 to 25 than men of the same age. In Rwanda, more than 25 percent of pregnant women are infected and 17 percent who have sexual intercourse before age 17 will be infected.
One study has shown the same higher rate of infection for girls than boys in the United States. A Government study of 270,000 American youths found 4.2 girls per 1,000 were infected compared with 2.0 per 1,000 for boys.
Teen-age girls generally have their first sexual intercourse at a younger age than teen-age boys. Frequently, it is with an older partner who is more likely himself to be infected. Initial intercourse for boys is generally with younger girls who have not been infected with H.I.V.
"Delaying the age at first intercourse would be a terrific step," Dr. Hein said.
The United Nations plans to make $100 million available through 1996 to developing countries for AIDS education, to encourage condom use and behavioral changes.
Teen-agers use condoms less frequently than women in their 20's. In some countries, forced early marriage and forced early pregnancy contribute to the risk of H.I.V. infection.
Teen-age girls in many countries are out of school and engage in what Dr. Hein called "survival sex" for money and drugs.

HEADLINE: Police Say Hunt for Bodies Is Futile in Serial-Killing Case

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 29

 BODY:
Acknowledging that they had reached an impasse in their search for the bodies of 4 of the 18 women Joel Rifkin is believed to have murdered, state police officials said today that their identities may never be learned unless investigators get a second chance to interview Mr. Rifkin.
Col. Wayne Bennett, who heads the state police Bureau of Criminal Investigation, said in an interview that investigators had exhausted virtually all their leads in pursuit of the identities of the four. He said the lack of concrete evidence has made any further searches for bodies futile. 
 "Based upon the information we have, it would be extremely difficult to commence a search for a body, and equally difficult to establish a tentative identification of who that person would have been," Colonel Bennett said. "Without the further cooperation of Mr. Rifkin, we may never make a positive identification."
In the month since Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper from East Meadow, confessed to killing 17 women over the last three years, law-enforcement officials from throughout the region have been trying to match the victims with the names and faces of missing women, or the bodies of women that had been found but not identified.
 
Fruitless Searches
 So far, the police -- who say the actual number of victims is 18 -- have identified 11 of the women and have linked Mr. Rifkin to the deaths of three others whose bodies remain unidentified. The four missing women, the authorities say, are known to them only through vague descriptions of the murders that they say Mr. Rifkin gave to them during his confession on June 28, the only time he has spoken to the police. Mr. Rifkin's discussions with state investigators ended that day when his lawyer, Robert Sale, intervened.
"We have no names, only approximate dates, approximate circumstances and locations," Colonel Bennett said, referring to the four cases. "It's not precise enough."
Lieut. Eugene Corcoran, a supervisor of the investigation at the state police barracks in East Farmingdale, said that information supplied by Mr. Rifkin led the police to believe that one of the four missing bodies is in the West Nyack area, two are in New York City and one may be in New Jersey. Using search dogs, the state police conducted repeated sweeps of sites in West Nyack but found nothing.
"Without talking to Rifkin, we have very little chance of locating those four," he said.
Mr. Rifkin has been formally charged with one murder, that of Tiffany Bresciani, 22, whose body was found in the back of his pickup truck when he was stopped by state troopers on a street in Mineola early on June 28. He has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and is being held without bail in the Nassau County Jail.
Many identifications were made through personal items the police say they found in Mr. Rifkin's house. Today, the Nassau County District Attorney's office released a list of items that the state police took from the house during a second series of searches on July 8 and 9. Earlier searches had yielded a chilling inventory of items, including books about serial murderers and knot-tying, as well as women's clothing, curlers and jewelry.
The list of items released today included a number of mundane household items, like sheets, towels, pillowcases, typewriter ribbons, plastic wrap, books, magazines and even a shower curtain and barbecue grill cover. But it also included axes, machetes, pruning shears, a chainsaw, a sickle, a coping saw, a knife, a syringe and duct tape.
The state police also removed a stain sample from the floor of the garage, notebooks and folders, Rolodex cards and used condoms.
Colonel Bennett said that in many instances, investigators were looking for traces of blood or hair on the items that might be linked to Mr. Rifkin or any of those believed to be his victims. In other cases, they were looking for articles that might have been used in the murders.
"What we're looking for is trace evidence," the official said. "Things like the chainsaw blade: That was taken for analysis to see if there was any human tissue or blood, to see if it was used as a weapon or as an instrument of dismemberment."
Once the evidence has been examined, Colonel Bennett said, investigators will decide whether to submit it for DNA analysis.
Although pessimistic about the four bodies that have not been found, Lieutenant Corcoran said he believed he was closer to identifying a body that had been found, that of a woman known to the police as victim No. 16. Her body was found earlier this year off County Road 31 in Riverhead.

Though the New York metropolitan region's economy remained in the doldrums in the first half of this year, it did not lose jobs as fast as last year, according to a Federal midyear report released yesterday. Still, the region fared badly in comparison to the rebound of labor-market indicators in most of the rest of the nation.
The lone bright spots were fat pay envelopes on Wall Street and a rebound by technological and information-service industries that moved to the outlying suburbs and prospered during the 1980's, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the Federal regional Labor Commissioner. 
 Wall Street payrolls, even with 30,000 fewer jobs than in 1987, now eclipse the combined payrolls of the manufacturing and construction industries for the first time in history, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
 
'A Clear Pattern'
 But over all, he said, the regional payroll and employment data present "a clear pattern of the region continuing to bump along the bottom" of the three-year-old recession without strong signals of recovery.
Otherwise, he said, the most encouraging news was that the torrent of job losses in the regional economy, where about 300,000 jobs have vanished since the official national economic recovery began in 1991, has slowed to a trickle and in some cases stopped.
"The region has taken a beating and it feels a little better now that it seems to be stopping," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. But he offered little solace for those waiting for the pain to be replaced with joy. "There is no indication that a broad and sustained upturn in jobs is on the way," he said.
Most worrisome was evidence that the economic core of the region with nearly half of its jobs -- Manhattan, Brooklyn and the northern New Jersey counties of Hudson, Essex, Union and Passaic -- had fewer jobs now than at the beginning of the 1980's economic boom.
 
Easing in Job Losses
 In 23 New York and northern New Jersey counties, the number of jobs fell by 17,000 between December 1992 and June 1993, the Labor Department reported. Meanwhile, unemployment in those 23 counties, plus Fairfield County and parts of Litchfield and New Haven Counties in Connecticut, held steady at 8.4 percent, essentially unchanged from the corresponding period in 1992, a figure that represents about 785,000 jobless workers. Nationally, unemployment fell from an average of 7.6 percent to 7.3 percent in the period.
Job losses eased chiefly among private employers. Government jobs in the region, declining by just 2,000 in all of 1992, fell 8,000 in the first five months of this year, data released yesterday showed.
In New York City alone, nearly all of the 3,258 jobs lost so far this year came in the public sector, representing Federal, state and city cutbacks.
Jobs held steady in New York City manufacturing and other industries, while inching up in construction, a change probably influenced by work made necessary by the bomb explosion that heavily damaged the World Trade Center.
The northern suburbs of New York -- Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange Counties -- had the sharpest losses of jobs in the region, about 8,000, labor officials said. That was caused largely by layoffs at the International Business Machines Corporation and other companies located there, officials said.
 
A Payroll Surprise
 A major surprise, Mr. Ehrenhalt noted, came in 1992 Labor Department statistics just released that showed a vigorous increase in New York City payrolls even as the economy reduced the number of jobs.
Wall Street led the way, with total payrolls in the securities fields jumping to $17.1 billion last year from $11.7 billion in 1991.
Average annual pay in the securities fields reported by firms in the city leaped 40 percent, to $131,152 in 1992 from $90,924 in 1991. Mr. Ehrenhalt said some of the increase could be explained by a decision by many financial concerns to bunch parts or all of bonuses for two payroll years in 1992.
"Still, we've never seen an increase like this," he said.
Average annual payroll increases in jobs outside Wall Street rose a healthy 8 percent, he said.
Wall Street firms, with a work force that declined to 135,000 in the latest period from 163,000 at the time of the 1987 financial crash, represented only 5 percent of the city work force. But their total payrolls last year surpassed the combined payrolls of the manufacturing and construction industries in the city. Wall Street also exceeded the combined payrolls of the wholesale and retail trades, Mr. Ehrenhalt asserted.
 
A Changing Profile
 In a job environment that is shrinking, the profile of workers in New York continues to change, with job declines thinning out the ranks of clerical and blue-collar workers. While the numbers of professional workers in the financial and information sectors are not growing, they are prospering, he said.
"What we are seeing is that the structural transformation of the job market continues through thick and thin in the direction of better-paid and more skilled and knowledgeable workers that constituted the primary growth center of the 1980's," he observed.
"Even while New York City goes through a tough job decline, people in the better-paid jobs arer doing much better. The lesser-skilled jobs are the ones taking a big hit."
Another surprise in the data from the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, was the size of declines in employment in military-related industries within the region.
The metropolitan region had about 90,000 such jobs when the Defense Department started ordering post-cold war cuts but has seen more than one-third of them disappear in the last few years.
Long Island was the hardest hit in New York and New Jersey, losing nearly half of its defense-related work, the Commissioner said. The average decline nationally was 17.5 percent, he added.

HEADLINE: 2 Challengers Put Holtzman on the Defensive in Debate

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
In the first debate in the New York City comptroller's race, the incumbent, Elizabeth Holtzman, found herself on the defensive, fending off criticism from her two challengers about allegations that she helped a bank get city business in return for a campaign loan.
Ms. Holtzman and her challengers, Alan G. Hevesi and Herman Badillo, spent much of the hourlong debate at a midtown Y.W.C.A. telling people about their accomplishments and sounding the themes that will shape their campaigns. 
 The incumbent, who has often been accused by colleagues of being frosty and aloof, labored to portray herself as a warm and empathetic comptroller who has "always seen the human faces behind the numbers."
 
More Than Just Audits
 Mr. Badillo, a former deputy mayor and Congressman from the Bronx, started the year as a mayoral candidate but later joined the Republican-Liberal campaign as a candidate for comptroller. In the debate yesterday, he often sounded themes more often heard during the mayoral campaign. He said he would use the influence of the comptroller's office -- a fiscal watchdog that makes few policy decisions -- to do such things as privatize city hospitals and raise admission standards in the City University.
"I'm not interested in running for Comptroller at this stage in my career merely to put out audits," he said.
Mr. Hevesi, a veteran State Assemblyman from Queens whose biggest problem so far in the race has been a lack of publicity, joked about his relative obscurity. "We are at the stage in the campaign where we are telling everyone in New York that they don't know me," he said.
But the initial friendly tone of the debate darkened when a reporter questioned Ms. Holtzman about a $450,000 campaign loan she received from Fleet Bank last fall. A few months after the loan was made, the bank's sister company, Fleet Securities, was named as an underwriter of city bonds on the recommendation of Ms. Holtzman's office, and the city Department of Investigation is looking into the matter. Ms. Holtzman has maintained that she was not aware of a deputy's decision to choose Fleet as an underwriter.
Ms. Holtzman was asked how she could have remained ignorant of her deputy's decision to include Fleet in the underwriting syndicate when she signed documents listing Fleet as an underwriter.
 
'Can't Micromanage' Office
 "A chief executive can't micromanage an agency," Ms. Holtzman responded. As she has in the past, Ms. Holtzman asserted that the loan complied with Federal election rules and that the bank had shown her no favoritism in granting the loan, which was unsecured and carried a 7 percent interest rate.
Ms. Holtzman's opponents seized on the issue.
"I don't know how many of us have tried to get a loan for one percent above prime for $450,000 from a bank," Mr. Badillo said in a rebuttal, "but I doubt anyone in this room would be approved."
Mr. Badillo said he found it "inconceivable" that Ms. Holtzman could have failed to notice who the underwriters were, given her reputation for mastering details. He said she had a responsibility to voters to know the companies receiving city business.
Mr. Hevesi said the loan, whether legal or illegal, has illuminated a flawed system in which Wall Street firms seem convinced that they must give to candidates' campaigns to reap city business. "That process, unfortunately, has sometimes turned into an auction," he said.
 
A Time for Integrity
 The Assemblyman also attacked Ms. Holtzman's record as the city's chief auditor, contending that she had produced far fewer audits a year than her predecessor, Harrison J. Goldin. Several times Mr. Hevesi said Mr. Goldin, along with Arthur Levitt, a longtime state comptroller, had set the standard for integrity and honesty for comptrollers and asserted that "it's time we return that to the office."
But Ms. Holtzman, who defeated Mr. Hevesi four years ago to become the first woman to serve as the city's comptroller, turned his point at him, suggesting in front of a predomaninantly female audience that the tone of his criticism was sexist.
"People seem to think comptrollers can only wear suits and ties," she said. "It think it's a good thing there was a change four years ago."
The forum was sponsored by the New York Women's Agenda.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Advance Sharply

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Treasury market did another about-face yesterday, as the price of Treasury bonds and notes rose sharply and yields fell. The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 6.56 percent, just a shy of its recent 16-year low, from 6.65 percent.
With no clear trend in the economy or in the budget negotiations in Washington, the market has been jostled up and down recently by the day's news. And one day's report has often been contradicted by another report a day or a week later. 
 That was the case yesterday, when the report on economic growth in the second quarter of 1993 came in weaker than forecasters expected and, more importantly, much lower than the chairman of the Federal Reserve had predicted at the beginning of last week.
 
 
Government Report
 The Commerce Department reported the the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent after adjustment for inflation. The economy grew at a seven-tenths of 1 percent rate in the first quarter of the year.
The prediction by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, had been for growth around 2.5 percent to 3 percent for the three months ending June 30. This forecast of stronger-than-expected growth from an official who is considered in the know, worried the market. And when combined with Mr. Greenspan's stated disappointment in the battle to reduce inflation, traders and investors decided to sell last week.
They saw the possibility of both stronger-than-expected growth and stubborn inflation, which are both bad for the fixed-income market, especially the 30-year bond. And they interpreted Mr. Greenspan's remarks to imply that the Fed's next move on interest rates would be to raise them, which would be bad for shorter maturities. The selling pushed the yield on the 30-year bond up to 6.7 percent from its 16-year low of 6.54 percent, while the yield on the two-year note jumped to 4.2 percent from 3.97 percent.
 
 
Easing Inflation Fears
 Yesterday's report was a chance for relief, easing both fears of inflation and the threat of a rise in short-term interest rates by the Fed. It showed that the economy was creeping along at just a 1.2 percent annual rate in the first six months of the year. As a result, the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates any time soon.
In addition, the report showed that inflation, measured in a way that reflects both changes in prices and consumption, was slower in the second quarter, rising at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, compared with 3.3 percent at the beginning of the year.
As a result, both the long and short end of the Treasury market advanced.
In secondary trading, the price of the 30-year bond due in February 2023 was up 18/32 points as the yield fell to 6.56 percent, from 6.65 percent Wednesday. The yield of the two-year Treasury note, which was auctioned at a 4.26 percent yield Tuesday, fell to 4.1 percent, down from 4.2 percent, as the price jumped 6/32 point.
Like the two-year note, the buyers of the five-year note auctioned Wednesday have also done well because the price backed up ahead of the auctions and then rallied. Yesterday, the yield on the five-year note dropped to 5.11 percent as the price rose 12/32 point. It was auctioned at a yield of 5.25 percent.
Since the report on the G.D.P. covers past activity, it does not indicate how much speed the economy might pick up in the second half of the year. So the uncertainty about the economy is likely to continue for some time; this means that the prices and yields, which move in opposite directions, can continue to be volatile.
"I think the economy is going to grow at in excess of 3 percent in the second half of the year, but there is no risk it will grow much faster and that is not inflationary," said Joseph Liro, the chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
In little over a week, the market faces the Treasury's quarterly auction, when the Government sells 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. The expectation of further supply could slow any rally until after the auctions. This will be the last quarterly sale of 30-year bonds. After August, the Treasury will sell 30-year bonds only twice a year. The next 30-year bond auction will be in February.
 
 
German Discount Rate
 Traders said that the refusal of the German central bank, the Bundesbank, to reduce its important discount rate helped lift the short end of the Treasury market in the United States because the turmoil in the European currency markets is expected to continue. Because of this, many foreign investors may be coming to the American markets as a safe harbor, traders said.
A cut in the German discount rate was expected by many analysts because it was needed to allow other countries, especially France, the room to cut their interest rates and stop the speculative selling of their currencies.
The Bundesbank left the discount rate, which sets a floor on short-term interest rates at 6.75 percent, while it cut the less important Lombard rate to 7.75 percent from 8.25 percent.

HEADLINE: Bonds Help to Lift Stocks As Dow Advances by 13.97

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices climbed yesterday, lifted by a powerful bond market rally that sent interest rates tumbling. The Dow Jones industrial average closed within a point of its all-time closing high.
The Dow ended with a gain of 13.97 at 3,567.42, just shy of the record 3,567.70 finish established on Monday. It had traded above its record several times during the session. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered declines on the New York Stock Exchange by about 12 to 7, with 1,249 up and 740 down.
Volume on the Big Board came to 266.6 million shares as of 4 P.M., down slightly from 273.1 million in the previous session.
Bonds were buoyed by the report that second-quarter gross domestic product grew a less-than-expected 1.6 percent. The yield on the 30-year bond dropped from 6.65 percent, to 6.56 percent, just shy of its recent 16-year low.
Bad economic news is often good news in the bond market because slow growth tends to keep strong inflation and high interest rates at bay. Low interest rates also encourage investors to shift to stocks for higher potential returns.
"When the G.D.P. came out this morning, the bond market started rallying," said Ned Collins, head of trading at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "It basically took the stock market with it."
Several futures-related buying programs lent support to a fairly broad-based advance. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 3.05, to 450.24, the New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 1.48, to 249.34, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.65, to 707.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index went up 1.81, to 436.59.
Companies issuing quarterly figures included General Motors , which gained 1/2, to 47 1/2. The auto maker said it earned 92 cents a share in the second quarter, a big improvement from a year earlier, when G.M. recorded a per-share loss of $1.18. Other automotive stocks also rose.
One decliner among the blue chips was Walt Disney, which went down 1 1/8, to 38 5/8.
Lower interest rates helped financial stocks including some insurers and a handful of Dow issues. Allied Signal gained 2 1/2, to 71 3/8, after reporting a 21 percent gain in second-quarter earnings; Eastman Kodak, advanced 1 1/2, to 53 7/8, J. P. Morgan, gained 1 1/4, to 73, and McDonald's, rose 1, to 52 1/8.
 Among insurance stocks, General Reinsurance rose 5 3/8, to 124 1/8; American International added 3, to 137 7/8, and Transamerica gained 1 1/2, to 56 1/8.
 The mutual fund firm T. Rowe Price jumped 4, to 54, after reporting a rise in second-quarter profits.

A 24-Hour-a-Day Show, on Gaudy, Bawdy 42d Street

BYLINE: BY ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
It may have looked good on paper, the plan to have artists create artworks for some of the empty storefronts and theater marquees that line 42d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenues in Manhattan. But in reality this strange little show swerves erratically between silly and serious, amateurish and appropriate. Organized by the 42d Street Development Project and Creative Time (a nonprofit arts group), it includes work by Jenny Holzer, Karen Finley, Glenn Ligon and the art teams of Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel, Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, and John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres. The 18 works in "42d Street Art Project" are on view 24 hours a day.
Most participants set out to contribute work that in some way parodies, examines or celebrates some aspect of this sordid yet vital corner of Manhattan, now on the brink of being radically changed by an urban renewal project that may or may not work. The problem is that too many of the artists' efforts simply blend in and all but disappear. There is definitely such a thing as being too site-specific. 
 Probably the most extreme example is the big billboard designed by M & Company that functions as the show's opener. It blares the word EVERYBODY at passers-by in black letters one story high against a yellow background, and is punctuated by real chairs painted various bright colors. But it's easy to mistake this egalitarian message for an unusually abstract Benetton advertisement. Elsewhere, one gets the feeling that it's difficult to compete with the gaudy patchwork of peepshows, shop signs, billboards, adult-movie houses and video stores that make the area both notorious and visually manic.
This is a show that elicits lots of double takes and second looks, where things turn out to be not quite what they seem. The best pieces intervene quietly in all the commotion, discreetly subverting the norm while playing with the visual conventions of the area, and operating somewhere in the gap between art and public service announcement or social commentary. Displayed in a store window, Adelle Lutz's politically correct yet amusing fashions -- especially the two garments made of condoms -- match the street's tacky visual style while encouraging safe sex. "Wear Condoms!" is the caption to her visual one-liner.
Although Jenny Holzer is represented by the terse but familiar aphorisms of her "Truisms" and "Survival" series from the 1980's, in many ways her words have never looked better nor seemed more pertinent. Emblazoned in big plastic letters on movie marquees that have seen better days are phrases like "Raise Boys and Girls the Same," "What Urge Will Save Us Now That Sex Won't" and "Boredom Makes You Do Crazy Things." Such sentiments play well against store signs advertising Le Sex Shoppe or Martial Arts Cutlery + Gifts.
The work of Mr. Ahearn and Mr. Torres, who are well known for their colorful portrait casts, also transplants effectively to this locale. The two artists have set up their sculpture-making operation in an abandoned storefront and anyone can walk in to watch or have a portrait done. The results are mounted on the walls, forming a collective portrait of the area's diverse population that expands daily.
Another successful transplant is Tom Otterness's monumental bronze penny, which sits in the middle of the sidewalk like the big red 9 on West 57th Street, but with a difference. The coin's democratic sentiment (E Pluribus Unum) reads loud and clear at this scale, while the little Otternessoids grouped unequally around it (some push it like a big wheel, others sit on top taking a free ride) suggest that it just ain't so.
Like Ms. Holzer, Mr. Ligon creates almost imperceptible fissures and contradictions in the fabric of the street, in his case by having everyday shop signs painted with comments from members of a 42d Street focus group that included retailers and other denizens of the neighborhood. They reflect sharply divergent attitudes toward the 42d Street Development Project and gain significance by being read on the very territory under debate.
One person calls 42d Street "the center of the gaudiest, most aggressive, most active city in the world" and likens any change in its character to the destruction of Pennsylvania Station. Another says, "They could bring in a bunch of stores for the tourists but what they really need to do is clean up the place for the people who are already there." A more chilling assertion is, "We have to take 42d Street and assume, with proper control, that those people will go away."
Other works make partial or fleeting impressions. Diller and Scofidio's big red lips, projected onto the doors of a movie theater, are visually arresting, even if the words coming out of them sound like diluted Holzer. (Their explanatory text panel, which touches on the range of illicit and licit commodities available in Times Square, is more interesting than the piece itself.) In the entrance to another theater, Ms. Jones and Mr. Ginzel have created a ghostly queue: rows of empty white and gray garments and shoes lined up like people waiting to see the latest movie. It is haunting for a few seconds, but the tone seems wrong: pious, nostalgic and Midwestern (it made me think of Walker Evans's Dust Bowl photographs). And Jane Dickson has decorated a window with ersatz portraits of brides, a display that looks too much like the real thing, although the plastic-wrap wedding gown visible through the doors conveys a combination of cheapness, purity and false hope that is surprisingly touching.
This show is best if taken as a whole, with each piece offering a different glimpse of the contadictory realities that make up 42d Street, past, present and future. It's a bit like a lens that magnifies its surroundings while remaining largely transparent itself. It is important to consider what this work makes visible, but also to realize that it does so too often at its own expense.
The "42d Street Art Project" remains on view on West 42d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenues in Manhattan until early November.

Facing Up to the Big Screen
A fresh set of statistics shows that amid much publicity about electronic delivery, home video via tape and the VCR is not only growing, but is more than holding its own against movies in theaters and on pay-per-view television.
The findings are from a new study by Veronis, Suhler & Associates, a New York investment bank that specializes in the communications business. 
 The figures show that last year Americans spent $12 billion to rent or buy videos, and $4.9 billion at the movie box office. The number of tape rentals went from 3.37 billion in 1991 to 3.58 billion in 1992. Rentals for each household with a VCR were 49.5, or under one a week, which is up a bit from last year but significantly below the peak 57.1 figure reached in 1987, when renting movies was relatively new to many people.
Movie revenues were up slightly in 1992, but theater admissions fell to under a billion for only the second time in the last decade.
The Veronis, Suhler study blames the economy, among other factors. Americans, the report says, are very price conscious when it comes to entertainment. Last year, the average rental price of a movie on tape was $2.30. The average price in a theater was $5.05 and the cost of a film on pay-per-view television was $4.35.
In 1992, the average VCR household spent $165.75 on videos: $113.91 on rentals and $51.84 on purchases. The study predicts that both figures will increase by several dollars over the next five years despite projected increases in the cost of electronic delivery and pay-per-view.
The study also says that sales are growing faster than rentals, though sales now bring in only about half as much revenue ($3.7 billion to $8.2 billion). The average retail purchase price fell from $60 in 1982 to $14.15 in 1992.
 
Families in Mind
 A key word in video stores these days is family. Studios and distributors have decided that Americans want good clean fare, and are speeding to comply with releases of new material and old titles, some never before on tape and others brought out again under the banner of family entertainment.
In September, Warner will stamp its new family-entertainment logo on releases of "Alice in Wonderland" (a 1985 version with Telly Savalas as the Mad Hatter) and "Spencer's Mountain" (with Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara), as part of a package calculated, as the promotion puts it, to draw viewers " 'round the electronic hearth."
Next month, MGM/UA begins its family promotion with "Namu, the Killer Whale," a 1974 musical version of "Huckleberry Finn" and some 50 other titles both famous (Frank Capra's "Pocketful of Miracles") and not so famous ("Jack the Giant Killer" in "Fantascope").
Out to a good lead in the family sweepstakes is LIVE, whose family- entertainment label reissued "The Wild Pony," "On Golden Pond" and other titles in June.
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES
 
Scent of a Woman
1992. MCA/Universal. $94.98. Laser disk, $39.98. 157 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Al Pacino is Lieut. Col. Frank Slade, a blind and boozy former military man who speaks in tirades and tailored bromides. Hired to watch him over Thanksgiving, a prep school student (Chris O'Donnell) is intimidated by the colonel into escorting him to New York City for what becomes a wild weekend of trial and self-discovery. With Mr. Pacino in control, Bo Goldman's screenplay serves up the one-liners, and Martin Brest's direction stands aside. Left to evolve in Hollywood-formula fashion, the plot winds confusingly through an implausible surrogate father-son relationship. Even so, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, the principals and film makers "succeed in turning a relatively contrived situation into a terrific showcase for Mr. Pacino's talents."
 
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York
1992. Fox. $24.98. Laser disk, $29.98. 120 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.
In the footsteps of the third-highest-grossing movie ever, the sequel doesn't strain for many departures. As before, little Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) accidentally gets left behind by his family. This time, though, the boy lands in Manhattan, where he is again threatened by the same dirty duo, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), who assaulted him the first time. And again Kevin retaliates with a level of violence that, funny or not, belongs in a mob saga. But that's the bottom line when an original "appealing fantasy has been replaced by one most eager to maintain the status quo" (Maslin).
 
1492: Conquest of Paradise
 1992. Paramount. $95.25. Laser disk, $39.95. 142 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
Slogging ashore in Ridley Scott's film, Christopher Columbus (Gerard Depardieu) finds himself caught between fact and lack of film-making imagination. The more authentic events occur back in the throne room with Queen Isabella (Sigourney Weaver) and on the docks with the adventurer gazing westward in handsome profile. Out on the briny, however, and later in the New World, flagging dramatic invention is evident in a film that is "a lot less interesting than the elaborate physical production that has been given it" (Vincent Canby).
 
Sex and Justice: The Highlights of the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas Hearings
1991. First Run Features. $24.95. 76 minutes. No rating.
The charges and denials live again in these well-chosen bits of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, interspersed with somewhat overbearing commentary from Gloria Steinem. Though it adds little to what is known about the characters or issues, the tape is a reminder of how powerful television images can be and how we are left to grasp at the truth behind them.

HEADLINE: Review/Film: Rising Sun;
A Tale of Zen And Xenophobia In Los Angeles

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
THE opening sequence of "Rising Sun," Philip Kaufman's glitzy adaptation of Michael Crichton's best-selling mystery novel, establishes the movie's tone, method and manner.
There is first a series of grainy, definitely not high-definition television images from a sing-along music video: shots of wide-open Western spaces and, at the bottom of the screen, looking like subtitles, the lyrics of "Don't Fence Me In." Someone sings along offscreen. Among other things, the singer wants land, lots of land, and a starry sky above. 
 The camera pulls back to reveal a youngish Japanese man standing in the middle of the floor in a third-rate nightclub. It's the end of a long night. With eyes closed and tie loosened, the man pours his drunken voice and heart into a hand mike. The place is almost deserted. A few other Japanese men sit around in various stages of stupor. At one table sits a very beautiful young American woman who is not enchanted by her date's performance. She wants to go home.
When the two do leave the club, arguing so furiously that the man threatens to beat up the woman, it is dawn but not in Osaka or Tokyo. It's somewhere on the edge of Los Angeles. It's not the Los Angeles that Americans know, but a Los Angeles that Mr. Crichton describes in his novel as "a shadow world," "a second world," a world occupied by faceless Japanese businessmen and their yakuza gangster associates. Much like the aliens in Mr. Kaufman's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," these Japanese are trafficking in American souls, sometimes with their victims' complicity.
It's a good sequence that effectively introduces the somewhat remodeled, though no less xenophobic remains of Mr. Crichton's wake-up call to America. The novel proclaims its concerns proudly with a simple mind. The film, which Mr. Kaufman adapted with Mr. Crichton and Michael Backes, tries to sound the same alarm, but without giving offense.
It changes the identity of the killer. One of its two principal American characters (both of whom are now morally flawed) has become a black man rather than white, and one of its principal female characters is the product of the union of a black American soldier and a Japanese mother. The movie aims to be demographically balanced.
Yet the onscreen "Rising Sun" remains insufferably smug. It still offends. It directs attention not to the internal reasons for America's economic problems, but to inscrutable, generalized, unknown others from abroad, whose yellow skins and strange manners announce their evil purposes as much as their unfair trade practices.
In most other, superficial ways, "Rising Sun" is a rather slick piece of movie making. It stars Sean Connery at his most avuncular as a Los Angeles police detective, John Connor, an old Japan hand and a font of arcane wisdom. At the film's beginning, Connor is assigned to investigate the death of a high-priced American call girl, found on a boardroom table while a gala reception is in progress at the shiny, new, 53-story Nakamoto Building in Los Angeles.
The head of Nakamoto has himself asked that Connor be put on the case. The Japanese businessman doesn't want his reception terminated by a mere murder. The publicity could also be embarrassing because Nakamoto is in the midst of controversial negotiations to acquire yet another American company involved in space-age computer technology. Connor is regarded as some kind of sage.
In fact, as written and played, he is a pompous old windbag, though his new partner, Web Smith (Wesley Snipes), a police lieutenant, remains surprisingly polite as they drive to the murder scene. Connor is said to be a master of Japanese, but he speaks it much in the way that Miss Piggy ("Who? Moi?") speaks French. He's not quite as overstuffed with questionable observations as the character in the book, but those he comes up with are dillies.
Connor advises Smith to be modest in his body language. "The Japanese find big arm movements threatening," he says, not adding, as he might, that they have this in common with the mountain gorillas of Ruwanda. Connor has the makings of a rich character, that of a man fascinated by a culture he understands less and less the more he gets to know it. Yet that character remains unrealized, first in the book and now the movie, which lays more on Mr. Connery than he can make coherent.
The film's form is also unclear, though much of it is an extended flashback. It seems to be an after-the-fact police inquiry into the manner in which the murder investigation was conducted. Yet the film includes material that Smith, the officer who is giving testimony, would not know about. Though the point of the story is who killed the call girl Cheryl Austin (Tatjana Patitz), that's only the excuse for Mr. Crichton's and the film's larger concerns: American-Japanese trade relations and the unscrupulous practices that give the Japanese such an edge.
Americans invented robber barons in the 19th century but, from "Rising Sun," you might think that this country's economic successes were based entirely on hard work, pluck and willful stupidity. That's the way it looks in a scene in the film in which the Japanese are shown to be monitoring the private conversation of their American counterparts during high-level business negotiations.
As if to defuse all accusations of Japan-bashing and racism on its own part, the movie, like the book, has a character, Tom Graham (a police officer comically well played by Harvey Keitel), who gets to present the bigoted nut-case's view of things. When it's finally revealed that the call girl was killed by someone who liked to play sado-masochistic games, Graham says of the Japanese, "These guys are known world-class perversion freaks."
Yet the movie, which sends up Graham's excesses, also invites the audience into a kind of private brothel where beautiful American women are kept for the sole purpose of satisfying the unspeakable demands of their Japanese employers. The Japanese are not only stealing our trade secrets, they're also despoiling our women! Even Fu Manchu, Sax Rohmer's Chinese arch-fiend, was never quite so bold.
With all this peripheral nonsense going on, it's not always easy to follow the unraveling of the mystery, which centers on the careful decoding of the images on a videotape, shot by a hidden camera in the Japanese company's board room. In the interests of the plot, the film's audiences are put into the position of being world-class perversion freaks as, over and over again, they study the images of the woman as she entertains a succession of men.
Ms. Patitz doesn't get the opportunity to say much, but she's a very attractive victim. Mr. Snipes's performance is suitably cool and sometimes seriously funny. Prominent in the supporting cast are Kevin Anderson, as an American flunky for the Japanese; Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, as one of the few Japanese characters who, though hot-headed, generates sympathy; Ray Wise, as a soft-headed United States Senator, and Tia Carrere, who plays the woman of mixed Japanese-American blood.
The film's mysteriousness is not profound. Anybody who hasn't guessed the killer's identity after 30 minutes should be forced to watch "Rising Sun" three times a day until Christmas. Or, as Connor says in a Zen-like mood at the end of the film, "The Japanese have a saying: if you sit by a river long enough, you'll see the body of your enemy float by."
O.K., so it doesn't make sense here, but then it doesn't make sense in the movie either. End of Zen.
"Rising Sun" has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has vulgar language and scenes of violence and various kinds of sexual relations.

HEADLINE: Where Sharks Face Off With Gentler Souls

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
WE, the people, stand in darkness. They, the sharks, circle tirelessly in the eerily lighted water. We are separated by three inches of glass and an ocean of cognition.
The animals' jaws never stop opening and closing. Their hundreds of teeth are big, and as sharp as razor blades. Their restless, unceasing purposefulness is unnerving. 
 "You're looking at man's most feared predator," a docent said, "an animal that's been around since before the dinosaurs."
Sharks are the ocean's undertaker, specializing in savaging the old and the weak. If you were to mix one drop of blood with a hundred million drops of salt water, a shark could detect that drop of blood as far as a quarter mile away. Vicious scars on female sharks -- incurred from males during their understandably single sexual experience, the one leaving them with enough sperm for a lifetime -- underline the animal's brutality.
So why is my chubby-faced little son Guy, almost 3 years old and sweet as sugar, shrieking with pleasure and hugging his foot-long rubber shark, this week's favorite possession?
"I like the big one," he announces, pointing excitedly to Bertha, a 9-foot 350-pound sand-tiger shark.
Bertha and the other sharks; their cousins, the giant stingrays, and assorted little fish one can't help worrying about just keep going round and round. If they know a couple of hundred human voyeurs are hooting like a baseball crowd at their daily 1:45 P.M. feeding, they are long past letting on. They seem secure in their 90,000-gallon world, we in ours.
So Guy watches, open-mouthed. What is he thinking? What am I thinking? What does it mean to be a shark? How is it that we humans are two-thirds salt water, yet feel so displaced from what was our predecessor species' natural environment? Why are so many moviegoers this summer enraptured by "Free Willy," a love story between a boy and a killer whale ?
Just what is so darned mesmerizing about sea creatures?
These are the kinds of thoughts that cross my mind at the New York Aquarium in Coney Island, Brooklyn. For a subway token and $5.75, this is a bargain for those in search of the deeper perspective. Was the novelist Tom Robbins right when he suggested that humans evolved to move water from one place to another?
Who cares? And enough already. There is another equally compelling reason to visit the aquarium: to watch people have a grand time. Toddlers are hoisted onto ledges in front of windows for a better view. People shriek greetings to lobsters, piranhas, penguins, starfish. It is the oddest, most unexpected thing, but the aquarium is decibels noisier than the zoo.
A mother holding a baby stares as the newborn baby beluga, 150 pounds of whale, nuzzles her mother, Marina. A teacher with a class of day-campers in identical red T-shirts points with delight to Mookie, the star of the sea lion show, and informs one of her charges, "Look at the way he walks. He's like you."
Not really. Trainers have watched Mookie for countless hours waiting for the natural sea lion behavior they want him to emphasize for the show. They then blow a whistle and toss him a fish. His seemingly anthropomorphized behavior thus becomes reinforced, although the yelping sea lion will never know why.
 
A New York Tradition
 This is one level of education that occurs at the aquarium, a sense of commonality with distant species. Another level is a sense of wonder at the fascinating behavior of a particular animal: how, for instance, an entire school of fish instantly changes direction. (The answer is that the single nonconformist controls everything.) A third level is the scientific, or learning for learning's sake.
It is no surprise that Louis E. Garibaldi, the aquarium's director, calls himself an educator first. His goal: "to provide people with an experience worth remembering."
And so it has been since P. T. Barnum bought a Boston aquarium in 1850 and moved it to Herald Square. It burned down a couple of times, but attractions like a beluga whale, a distressingly short-lived one, as it turned out, kept them coming, even with a fee.
In 1896, the New York Aquarium at Castle Clinton in Battery Park opened. It was a grand place. Two gilded figures of sea horses were carved above the main doorway. In number and variety of specimens, it was the biggest aquarium in the world; it was free, and, with well over two million visitors a day, it was by far the best-attended public institution in New York.
Then it was destroyed in Robert Moses' grand scheme to build a bridge to Brooklyn. The plan failed, but not before it had killed the beloved aquarium in 1942. For the next 15 years, the old Lion House at the Bronx Zoo housed a goldfish bowl or two. Finally, in 1957, a revived piscine playhouse landed in Coney Island.
 
Coney Island's Story
 The idea was to use the aquarium to rejuvenate a teetering entertainment area. No go. Traditional amusement parks were being gnawed to death by television. And because the new aquarium ran far over cost, there was an admission charge. This, combined with the length of the trip, cut visitors to 800,000 a year.
And it was not a pretty place, relying on concrete building blocks and such. "To be visited for its contents rather than envelope," said the most recent American Institute of Architects Guide to New York City.
The aquarium, which is operated by the Wildlife Conservation Society (as the New York Zoological Society is now calling itself) and partly financed by New York City, became, at best, the city's best-kept secret, a characterization Mr. Garibaldi still often hears. It did not fit into its Coney Island neighborhood, being neither beach nor barker. Out-of-town tourists were rare; Brooklynites predominated.
Then, slowly, the aquarium began coming back, although it has been an upstream swim and things still look a little rough in the spawning ground. (There is no city or private money to finance a much-needed restaurant, for example.) Concessions are unimaginative, involving long waits and not much selection. Some of the older buildings look like farm sheds from the outside. This is a pretty foothill compared with the huge and elegant Everest that is the John G. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.
But things have been improving in recent years, reflecting a national trend toward polishing aquariums into municipal jewels. The fact is that they are far cheaper than many other economic development expenditures, particularly ballparks. So from Boston to Camden, N.J., to Baltimore to Seattle and Monterey Bay, Calif., people are streaming like salmon to new or refurbished aquariums, often at prices half again the New York charges.
"They have become a focal point for urban renewal," Mr. Garibaldi said. Indeed, this year for the first time, the aquarium is running a joint promotion with Astroland, the amusement park next door, a step toward fulfilling its original mission.
 
Inside Views
 The first blossom opened in 1978, when the shark tank was constructed to give viewers a look at three major groups of sharks and stingrays on exhibition: top, middle and bottom dwellers. Viewing panels are positioned at different angles to guide visitors' line of sight toward these three levels of waters.
The definitive leap forward, though, came four years ago with the opening of Discovery Cove, which more than tripled the aquarium's size. Entering, you pass a lobster boat -- in a bit more than picturesque disrepair -- sitting in a saltwater pool with small sharks and sea turtles.
Inside, you walk through a salt marsh, stay dry inside crashing waves at another exhibit, and touch crabs and sea urchins at still another. "Remember when we were at the shore last summer and that little crab bit your toe?" a mother says. "Well, there he is."
A coral formation on one side is built of coral from the Atlantic, on the other side with coral from the Pacific. Fish from both oceans mingle chummily, water being water and all that.
A highlight is a coral tank, where a visitor steps inside a half-cylinder. Visually, It feels like actually diving. Nearby, a big bubble juts outward, creating a feeling that fish are swimming into human space. Adults are forever bending over and banging their heads on it, but their specific pain is assuaged more generally by watching all the children who give the ball full of fish a great big hug.
 
Coaching the Otters
 The biggest new aquarium feature is the Sea Cliffs exhibit, which roughly doubles visitors' space. It is a rugged-looking melange of ocher man-made cliffs, real trees, wildflowers and other vegetation. The topography changes as one moves from Alaska at one end, replete with walruses, to Baja California and South African penguins. (You figure it.)
One thing is certain: it sure feels better to see seals in something besides blue swimming pools.
Sea Cliffs' mission is to entertain while highlighting the precariousness of continued existence for the marine mammal species it so engagingly highlights. The walruses, Nuka and Tiipaq, were rescued as babies after being orphaned off Alaska. Among the various breeds of seals are northern fur seals, a species threatened in the wild.
Sea otters are a particular example of the conservation society's longstanding but newly underlined mission of fighting for species survival. The otters all come from California, where fishing and oil development threaten the species. Each otter is an orphan, and each is a dropout.
It seems that just about everything a sea otter knows was taught by its mommy. So the Monterey Bay Aquarium collects orphans and assigns some of its aquarists to the task of diving with the otters and turning over rocks to find food. Learning the ropes, as it were.
But, alas, some don't learn to eat on their own in a 36-hour test. (Not as easy it sounds: sea otters can eat up to 23 percent of their body weight in a single day.) The flunkouts are the ones kept for exhibition in Monterey or shipped here.
One last twist. For reasons nobody knows, males are found as orphans eight or nine times as often as females. The New York Aquarium, accordingly, has decided not to have its own breeding program, on the theory it can help species preservation better by simply providing a comfy bachelor pad. So even as more males arrive, the single female, Elsa, is preparing to ship out for the Monterey breeding program.
There are many wonderful things about Sea Cliffs. The majesty of a swimming walrus from the below-ground viewing level. The easy coexistence between local gulls and the penguins, which started at a population of 17 and grew to 40. A scale where a class of children can see if together they outweigh a walrus.
As always, the comments of people seem dearest. As a graceful fur seal flew toward a subterranean window, a little boy screamed, "Superman!" Another boy examines a walrus relaxing underwater and inquired why he looked like a big lump.
"What's he doing?" his mother answers. "He's doing nothing. Maybe sometimes you lie down and do nothing."
 
Sea Lion Vaudeville
 The next big aquarium improvement will be the Aquatheater, which involved only sea lions the other day. (The dolphin performers were all pregnant.) This fall, the seats will be doubled to 1,800 from 900 and will be reversed in direction. The audience will then see Sea Cliffs and the Atlantic Ocean in the background, rather than housing projects and clattering subways.
The show is, of course, sophomoric, but that in itself is a bit of an achievement for marine mammals and their trainers. And in truth, wild behavior has just been time-released. That might also apply to the comedian acting as M.C., who had his very young audience down cold.
"You know what kind of fish this is?" he asked, holding up what would soon be a sea lion's treat. "It's dead fish! That's right!"
And guess the wild and uproarious answer to this question: "How many of you guys want to get wet while you're here today?"
So it goes through three hours or so, the recommended stay at the New York Aquarium. Such small attractions as minnow-sized desert fishes, which are rapidly being destroyed in their sandy habitat in northern Mexico, bounce around in watery memory with the still unnamed baby beluga and a collection of local game fishes, arousing bitter memories of not a few that got away.
Guy and I find ourselves back by the shark tank. I asked him what his fearless finned friends eat. He pointed to the kitelike creatures flapping endlessly by.
"Stingrays," he chirped matter-of-factly.

"Cuba's Ills Encroach on Health" (news article, July 16) describes Cuba's sanitarium for those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, without mentioning that the residents are there because of a compulsory quarantine policy. Indeed, mandatory H.I.V. screening to identify the H.I.V.-infected, with forced isolation of the infected, have earned Cuba the unenviable honor of having the world's most repressive AIDS policy. 
 Hence, it has been Cuba's commitment to quarantine, and not, as you report, the free distribution of condoms, that is the centerpiece of Cuba's AIDS prevention program.
When compulsory isolation began, it was to be lifelong, mitigated only by periodic, accompanied home visits. Only now, after years of international criticism and under the pressure of a collapsing economy, has a liberalization been announced. Those judged responsible and trustworthy after six months of compulsory isolation will be able to leave the sanitarium.
However one judges the quality of care provided to Cuba's H.I.V.-infected medical inmates (by most accounts it is superlative, given Cuba's resources); however the condition under which most of the inmates live puts to shame the squalor in which the United States confined H.I.V.-infected Haitians at Guantanamo, and however one judges the effectiveness of Cuba's approach to stemming the spread of H.I.V. infection (by many accounts Cuba has been spared the kind of epidemic witnessed elsewhere in the Caribbean), the price paid in liberty must never be lost sight of.
A question that cannot be answered is what Cuba, with its superior health care system, might have done to prevent the spread of H.I.V. infection if it had chosen not to resort to the medical incarceration of men and women whose only crime was H.I.V. infection.

Embargo Myth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Cracks in the Cuban Permafrost" (editorial, July 16) perpetuates the myth of the United States embargo. Since it is not a blockade as Fidel Castro always refers to it, Cuba can and indeed does trade with the entire world. Cuba buys United States products in Mexico, Canada, Venezuela and anywhere else it pleases. It is the failure of the Stalinist system and President Castro's own stubbornness, not the embargo, that has plunged the island into economic chaos. 
 The United States embargo is a political statement, not an economic tool. Your suggestion that lifting the embargo will deprive Mr. Castro of an excuse to blame the United States for Cuba's economic hardships indicates that you still do not understand Mr. Castro. He will certainly present the lifting of the embargo as a major political triumph.
President Castro has over the years outwitted United States policies, most of the Cuban exile community and certainly those who once thought he was a Jeffersonian democrat. The hero and former guerrilla leader you mention are no more representative of the desires of the Cuban people than is the Cuban American National Foundation.
Ask the Cuban people in Cuba what they want. No one else has the right to decide their future. When will you forcefully call for an end to the 35-year-old Stalinist dictatorship and stop suggesting measures that will prolong it?

HEADLINE: Cuba's H.I.V. Quarantine Takes Toll in Liberty;
Medicine From U.S.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Cuba's Ills Encroach on Health" (news article, July 16) errs in reporting that United States laws, "recently tightened through new legislation . . . prohibit trade with Cuba by American companies and their subsidiaries, even in medicines." Recent changes in United States laws have greatly expanded the ability of United States companies to sell medicines in Cuba. 
 United States companies have long been able, even under our trade embargo, to sell medicines to Cuba for which they were the sole source. These sales, and donations to Cuban nongovernment organizations, were allowed under condition that the medicines not be re-exported, used in the Cuban Government's biotechnology industry or used for torture.
Under the Cuban Democracy Act, United States law was amended last year to permit United States companies and their subsidiaries to sell any and all medicines to Cuba, as long as the same conditions are met and verified through on-site inspection. Under one arrangement under consideration, a United States subsidiary may carry out this inspection through its home country's embassy in Havana.
Cuba's real problem is that it has little foreign exchange with which to import vital supplies, including medicine, due to the loss of massive Soviet subsidies and the collapse of its socialist economy.

HEADLINE: Stakes High in Apple's Bet on PC

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 29

 BODY:
In high-tech country this week, the favorite topic around the water coolers and Stairmasters is whether Apple Computer Inc. has a hit product or a flop in its hand-held Newton Messagepad computer.
First announced 17 months ago, with its debut set for a computer trade show in Boston on Monday, the Newton has generated a flurry of opinions on whether Apple has produced the next equivalent of the cellular phone for mobile workers. The machine, which fits in the palm of the hand, is designed to read handwriting, serve as a digital appointment book and use radio waves to send and receive faxes and electronic mail. 
 "This is certainly the buzz of Silicon Valley," said J. Gerry Purdy, a specialist in mobile computing at Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. "People are looking for the next big thing beyond the personal computer."
Ever since silicon met transistor nearly 35 years ago, growth in Silicon Valley has been based on a steady stream of new technologies and new products, from the pocket calculator to the digital watch to the video game to the personal computer to the laser printer. But with the Valley in the economic doldrums lately, everyone is anxiously awaiting the next microelectronic best seller.
 
 
Apple Needs a Winner
 And Apple, in particular, is desperately seeking a winner. Blindsided by a slowdown in its desktop and portable computer businesses, the company is laying off 2,500 employees -- 16 percent of its work force.
The Newton, under development for six years, is the highest-profile example of a product that Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and dozens of small start-ups, as well as Apple, hope will help pull the industry into the next growth cycle.
Apple's most immediate competition seems to be the EO Personal Communicator, a $1,995 electronic tablet that contains a cellular phone and has the marketing muscle of A.T.& T. behind it. And due this fall is the Zoomer Z-550, a collaboration of Tandy and Casio Computer that is similar in some ways to the Newton and is expected to be comparably priced. But this week, the industry talk is all Apple.
"The early indications are that there is a tremendous amount of excitement about the Newton," said Apple's chairman, John Sculley. "I'm more and more and more convinced that this could be Apple's home run in the 1990's."
 In developing and marketing the Newton, Apple has changed the way it does business. With its flagship Macintosh line of personal computers, the company has always jealously protected its technology to prevent the manufacture of cheaper "clones" of its products. But Apple has already licensed the Newton technology to Motorola, the Japanese electronics giants Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sharp Electronics, and the German industrial power Siemens, in hopes of establishing the machine as an international standard.
Not everyone in the Valley agrees that the next breakthrough product will be one that can be carried in a pocket and that is endowed with enough built-in intelligence so that its user does not need a degree in computer science. The skeptical are weary of the hyperbole that tends to accompany technology introductions.
 
 
No Revolution Seen
 "We haven't had a good Atari-style bust for a while, but I think there is a chance it will happen with Newton," said John C. Dvorak, a computer magazine columnist, referring to the video game company that grew rapidly on one product in the early 1980's before the market took a nearly devastating turn.
And Andrew S. Grove, president and chief executive of the Intel Corporation, the leader in personal computer chips, sees no revolution in the making. "These hand-held devices don't start a new branch of computing," Mr. Grove said.
But Apple is betting that its Newton will prove valuable to nomads, even if they do not regularly sit down to a personal computer at home or office. The company hopes to attract millions of business people and workers who do not currently use computers in their jobs. Many who have seen and tested the Newton argue that it more than meets expectations and stands a reasonable chance of being a runaway success.
"The classic Silicon Valley mind-set is to look at vaporware the way that vampires look at crosses," said Roger B. McNamee, an investment fund manager at Integral Capital Partners, who has been one of the few outsiders to have extensively used the Newton. ("Vaporware" is the Valley's favorite pejorative for products announced far in advance of their availability.)
"But the Newton," Mr. McNamee said, "has a snappy user interface and the best handwriting recognition that I have used." ("User interface" is Valley-speak for what a person sees or touches to make a gadget work.)
The Newton Messagepad, said several executives who have used early models, can keep appointments, notes and other similar kinds of information, in addition to sending faxes and electronic-mail messages. It can also perform other functions, like operating as a portable city guidebook or as a personal sports trainer with the addition of a read-only memory card. It can also receive wireless pager messages with the addition of a special card being made by Motorola.
Newton's user interface, which breaks away from the Macintosh design, has drawn early raves from those who have used it. The features are intended to be intuitive for people without special computer training. For example, if users want to erase something, they can scribble over it on the screen. The erased material instantly disappears as the image of a puff of smoke flashes on the screen.
 
 
Question of Price
 But price is certain to be a major issue affecting the early success of Newton. The company has been giving early briefings on Newton and indicating that it will sell for at least $700, significantly more than Sharp Wizard-style organizers now on the market, which are typically priced at less than $300, but still cheaper than most notebook computers, despite their rapidly falling prices.
What Apple must prove is that Newton is worth the investment.
"It's a chicken-and-egg thing," said Steven P. Jobs, Apple's co-founder who is now chairman of Next Inc., a Redwood City, Calif., software company. "They are going to have trouble getting the volume up. If Apple was doing really well they could forward-price them, but there is no way they can sell enough Newtons at $700 and up." ("Forward-price" is Valley jargon for setting initial prices below cost in hopes of generating volume sales.)
Another high hurdle may be the Messagepad's handwriting-recognition system's ability to live up to expectations. Promoted as able to recognize such simple handwritten messages as "Fax this to Mary" and "Lunch next week with Dan," the Newton must endure the acid test of shoppers unfamiliar with the technology, who will take five-minute test-drives by scribbling on the system at sales counters.
Early testers say that Newton's handwriting-recognition capabilities are significantly better than anything else now on the market but not perfect. Even Apple representatives in demonstrating the product have said that it may take an hour or so of experimenting for individuals to make the machine comfortable with their idiosyncratic scrawl. And that could cause potential buyers to shy away.
The business risks that Apple faces in all this are hard to overstate. Silicon Valley is dotted with craters left by companies that crashed by riding on unproved technologies.
"Nothing looks as good as product that hasn't shipped," warned S. Jerrold Kaplan, chairman and co-founder of the Go Corporation, a Foster City, Calif., software company whose operating system controls the inner workings of the EO device.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
ITT Registers a Big Jump In Second-Quarter Profits

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
The ITT Corporation, whose businesses range from auto products to hotels and insurance, yesterday reported that second-quarter earnings more than doubled.
Industry analysts said the results were better than expected, reflecting cost-cutting and improved profit margins in the company's insurance and finance units because of low interest rates. About 55 percent of ITT's operating profit came from these two segments. 
 For the quarter, ITT's net income was $267 million, or $2.15 a share, compared with $106 million, or 84 cents, in the comparable period a year earlier. Sales rose to $5.5 billion from $5.4 billion.
 
 
'Really Strong Quarter'
 "This is the first really strong quarter since all the write-offs," said Jack Modzelewski, an analyst for Paine Webber.
In the second quarter of 1992 quarter, earnings were depressed by unusual items, including $36 million in charges related to the Los Angeles riots. For all of 1992, ITT, based in New York, had an estimated $3 billion in restructuring costs for its insurance, finance and manufacturing businesses.
"The mood toward ITT is, it's a little like Babe Ruth," Mr. Modzelewski said. "They said they were going to dramatically increase earnings and they did." He increased his estimate of full-year per-share earnings to $6.80 from $6.35.
Others did also. Phua Young, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, raised his forecast for ITT to $6.90 a share from $6.30.
Besides big operating gains in finance and insurance, which includes ITT Hartford, ITT Financial and ITT Communications and Information Services, the company's factories -- which produce auto parts, weapons systems, pipes and pumps -- posted a 59 percent improvement in operating profits for the quarter. The Manufactured Products Group comprises ITT Automotive, ITT Defense and Electronics and ITT Fluid Technology.

The year-earlier six-month results also included the effects of adopting two new accounting standards, which resulted in a restated net loss of $381 million. This included cumulative catch-up adjustments of $580 million for the adoption of SFAS No. 106, and $45 million for the adoption of SFAS No. 112. The period also included capitals gains of $106 million, or 80 cents a share.
 
Year-earlier results were restated to reflect the sale of the company's consumer small-loan portfolio, losses for which are now in the disposition category, and the adoption of SFAS No. 112.

HEADLINE: MEDICARE DISPUTE HOLDS UP ACCORD ON A BUDGET PLAN

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
Only hours after the White House declared it a done deal and all wrapped up, House and Senate negotiators plucked at a thread on President Clinton's $500 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases late today, and it seemed to unravel again. After a night of fruitless work, the negotiators quit until Monday.
Already lagging in delivering the package to the House and Senate for votes next week, the negotiators have "taken an oath" to finish by next week, said the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Jim Sasser of Tennessee. 
 The negotiators played down the seriousness of the problems and appeared in no great hurry to fix them. Congress has until next Friday to vote on the package before its monthlong summer recess, although the legislators could always be held in town if the need arose.
 
Agreement on Gas Tax
 "There are a couple of issues still outstanding," said the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine.
Indeed, the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, said tonight that all the major fiscal issues were basically settled and that the remaining disputes were, in the grand scheme, minor ones.
Mr. Mitchell confirmed tonight what had become common knowledge, that the negotiators had agreed to raise the tax on gasoline and diesel fuel by 4.3 cents a gallon, considerably less than Mr. Clinton had sought.
Nevertheless, the remaining issues appeared to revolve around legislators' desires to spend more money than the negotiators have to give away, with the most serious one being a fight over a plan to cut the explosive growth of Medicare spending.
One potential alternative to that and other cuts that are being considered, one negotiator said, is to roll back the effective date of an increase in the top personal income-tax rate to January of this year, instead of the current proposal of March 1. The rate would rise to 36 percent, from 34 percent, for individuals with incomes over $115,000 and couples over $140,000, and to 39.6 percent for couples and individuals earning more than $250,000 a year. That would raise several billion dollars, officials suggested.
Nevertheless, the hitches today strongly suggest that the negotiators are having genuine problems assembling a small enough tax package to allay conservatives' anger, while spending enough on social programs to keep liberals happy.
To do both, and still stay within hailing distance of the $500 billion deficit-reduction goal to which President Clinton and conservatives are pledged, is proving a near-impossible task, some negotiators said.
The White House tonight described that state of play as an "agreement in principle" that would meet each of Mr. Clinton's central goals. Mark D. Gearan, the communications director, said that he expected a final agreement on Monday and that the President would probably address the nation from the Oval Office that night to urge Congress to approve the accord.
In the dispute today, liberal Democrats led by Representative Henry A. Waxman of California protested a proposal by Senate negotiators to cut the five-year, $1 trillion Medicare budget by an extra $2 billion. Mr. Waxman and other House negotiators had already tentatively agreed to cut $54 billion from the Medicare budget, a figure midway between the House and Senate versions of the economic package, but the additional cuts proved to be the last straw.
 
'He's Got Deep Concerns'
 "He's got deep concerns, and he's expressed them," a spokesman for Mr. Waxman said today.
Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the Senate's top negotiator on health care issues, said, "Of course Henry's upset." He added, "I've never done a Medicare or Medicaid negotiation where I didn't stay up all night at least one night."
The Medicare dispute, a tiny one in terms of Federal dollars, sounds almost like the mirror image of the liberal-conservative dispute over the size of a proposed gasoline tax, which was solved on Thursday night in the conservatives' favor.
In that battle, conservative senators threatened to torpedo the economic package unless the negotiators scaled back the gas tax from a split-the-difference compromise of 6.5 cents a gallon -- a level that would have generated about $10 billion more for deficit cutting and social programs -- to a more meager 4.3 cents a gallon.
That made conservatives happy, but it forced negotiators to start cutting other programs, like Medicare, to stay within reach of Mr. Clinton's $500 billion goal. "When you go from a 6.5 cent gasoline tax to a 4.3 cent gasoline tax," Mr. Rockefeller said tonight, "something has to give."
Whether it would be Mr. Waxman and the liberals was uncertain. The White House and Mr. Rockefeller insisted that the problem was not major.
 
Surprise to President
 Major or not, it was a surprise to Mr. Clinton, whose aides had already told reporters that the negotiators had effectively agreed to a package that cut the deficit by $490 billion over five years, and that Mr. Clinton would endorse it in a Rose Garden appearance.
Tonight, that planned celebration was both postponed and scaled back. The White House said Mr. Clinton would appear in the outdoor setting on Saturday morning to welcome what his aides described as encouraging progress on the budget package.
The White House already had begun to trumpet the $490 billion figure as a triumph in the face of Congressional pressure to back away from the $500 billion deficit-reduction goal. Mr. Clinton's spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, had proclaimed the apparent compromise as one that would meet "98 percent" of the President's objective.
This evening, a senior White House official expressed concern that any solution to the Medicare dispute might cut the deficit-reduction figure below $490 billion, a level that could now take on some political importance.
"I'm not happy," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, "but it's not the end of the world."
 
Concern Over 2 Senators
 It could, however, mark an end to Mr. Clinton's budget package in its present form. Senate negotiators said today that some legislators fear that conservative senators will begin to desert any compromise if it does not reduce the growth of the Federal debt by more than $490 billion over five years, and preferably much more.
Of particular concern, one White House aide said, are two Democratic Senators who reluctantly voted for the Senate version of the package last month, but now are wavering: David L. Boren of Oklahoma, and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. In a Senate speech earlier this week, Mr. Boren denounced what he said was the package's puny mix of spending cuts. Mr. Kerrey has since called for a special session of Congress dedicated solely to cutting Federal spending.
One negotiator said tonight that those two, and other conservatives in the Senate, could be hauled aboard the coalition supporting the package if the amount of deficit reduction in it comes close to $500 billion. The problem is that reaching that figure seems to require spending cuts that drive away liberals in the House.
Curiously, nearly everyone agrees that these figures are wholly symbolic. The difference between $490 billion and $500 billion amounts to mere static in a Federal Government that plans to spend $7 trillion through 1998. The Federal debt will increase by at least $1 trillion anyway, even if Mr. Clinton's plan is enacted in toto, according to projections by Congress.
"It's a seesaw, and now it's down to the human dynamic," said a senior White House official.
The President's economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, was overheard in the White House's "war room," where the political battle for the plan is being waged, inveighing against legislators who are holding up the economic plan for a few billion dollars in spending cuts.
"I'm outraged that people care" about the $10 billion difference in deficit reduction, another Administration official quoted her as saying. "The bond markets don't care. Why should people care?"

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Blitz Against Budget Puts Democrats on Defensive

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 30

 BODY:
It had to be a little unnerving for Lynn Schenk, a first-term Democrat elected to Congress from a heavily Republican district in San Diego, land of right-wing talk shows, Navy captains and stressed middle-class taxpayers trudging through recession.
For six days recently, radio advertisements placed by the Republican Party took her to task for voting for Mr. Clinton's "tax and spending" package. The ad then gave her phone number in Washington and urged people to call and "tell her that Californians aren't taxed too little -- the Government spends too much." 
 She voted for the original budget that passed the House in May, but is uncertain whether she will agree to the compromise of the House and Senate versions expected next week.
 
Agony of Indecision
 "I have not made up my mind what I'm going to do," Representative Schenk said. "There's no question that if I were drafting the plan it would be quite different, though it does represent an honest attempt at deficit reduction."
Such intense lobbying shows why the President's budget plan is on such shaky ground in Congress. Numerous middle-of-the-road Democrats, notably Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who faces re-election next year, are considered possible defectors.
Actually, Congressional offices say the intensity of calls and letters has abated since the first version of the budget passed last spring, when the disputed B.T.U. energy tax was still on the table. But it has now picked up again somewhat as the Republicans and the Ross Perot forces try to exploit the President's weaknesses, and as Mr. Clinton tries to keep wayward Democrats in line.
The problem is that President Clinton, whose popularity has dropped precipitously in this state pounded by recession, has not convinced Californians that the package offers much to them. Not the higher taxes for people earning more than $115,000, which is middle class in this high-cost region, not the new taxes on Social Security income in a state with so many elderly, not the higher gasoline taxes in a state where many people drive an hour or more to work daily.
While the lobbying is uneven, and apparently not highly organized, it has had its effect from the Oregon to the Mexican borders, giving Republicans new hope for regaining lost ground, for unseating California Democrats they consider vulnerable, like Senator Feinstein and Representatives Schenk, and Bob Filner, Vic Fazio, George E. Brown Jr. and Dan Hamburg.
"Once this passes, Clinton's history in California," said a leading Republican, Steven A. Merksamer, a Sacramento lawyer. "This state will be in the Republican column in 1996. We are going to capture the Senate in 1994 over this. I hear it from secretaries, gas-station attendants. People see it as a tax package, not a cut package. This is still the state that gave us Proposition 13."
On Thursday, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, added to the pressure on Democratic lawmakers by issuing a report challenging the President's assertion that the budget plan would create 1.9 million jobs in California over three years. Rather, his chief economist, Philip Romero, said the plan's "fiscal drag" would cost the state 359,000 jobs over five years.
But President Clinton and the Democrats have not been above the lobbying fray. The Democratic National Committee has also bought radio and television advertising around the country to rally support for the Clinton plan.
On a more personal level, the committee has been placing calls to voters in the district of Representative Richard Lehman, a Fresno Democrat who voted against the budget package in May. If the caller expresses support for the package, he is patched directly into the Congressman's office.
With such assistance, phone calls to Mr. Lehman's office have shifted from about 200 calls a day opposing the budget plan to a majority in favor, said Mr. Lehman's spokesman, Joe Rosato. But Mr. Lehman, a five-term veteran who represents a conservative agricultural district in the Central Valley, has not budged. "He is still not convinced there are any substantial cuts," Mr. Rosato said. "It's the same old story. People want to see cuts."
 
Clinton, Via Satellite
 And today, Mr. Clinton tried to invade Mr. Lehman's home turf directly. The White House arranged a satellite news conference this afternoon at the studios of the local NBC affiliate in Fresno, KSEE, with 15 local reporters. The White House selected the reporters. "The White House called Tuesday," said Ron Wolfe, executive producer at KSEE. "They wanted to get a local market blitz going."
Not entirely secure, President Clinton has invited a number of California "opinion leaders" to the White House on Monday to hear a pitch for his plan.
In keeping with the White House strategy to deliver its message without it being filtered throught the national press corps that has often criticized him, the President also spoke today by satellite with reporters in Arizona. The approach has had some success: when families from three states were invited by the President and Mrs. Clinton to the White House on Thursday to demonstrate their support for the economic plan, their presentation received little attention from the networks but earned at least two minutes of local television coverage in their home states, Georgia, Kentucky and Oklahoma.
Republicans have also trained their sights on Representative Hamburg, a freshman who represents the northern coast, where unemployment is as high as 14.5 percent in Del Norte County, which is logging country. His spokeswoman, Meg Ryan O'Donnell, said the effects were mixed, with spurts of irate calls after the Republican ads ran. She said the main pressure has come from the elderly in Lake and Napa counties, where there are many retired people in the wine country, but that working people in general were more supportive.
"We got mail asking, 'How is this going to affect me?' " she said. "Most of them are willing to make a sacrifice."
Mr. Hamburg supported the first budget bill, but has reservations about the compromise, particularly over the gasoline tax and the paring down of jobs investments and the scaling back of the earned-income tax credit.
The brightest spotlight has been turned on Senator Feinstein, a centrist Democrat. Given that it took a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Al Gore to pass the original budget last month in the Senate, her possible defection has given her special influence and put her in a tough political spot. She has complained loudly to the Administration that the emerging compromise does not help California's recovery enough. Calls to her office have been overwhelmingly against the package.
 
White House Attention
 President Clinton made a personal appeal to her at the White House on Sunday, and she has been called by seven members of the Cabinet.
Her spokesman, Bill Chandler, says Ms. Feinstein feels the bill does not do enough to create jobs in California. In particular she is pressing for higher research and development tax credits to encourage businesses to expand and certain exclusions from capital gains taxes to encourage small and medium sized businesses to grow.
"She is undecided," Mr. Chandler said. "She is going to wait until the full package comes out of conference. She is here to raise awareness in the Administration for the state."
The entire episode poses a difficult political dilemma for Senator Feinstein. If she defects, she will probably destroy her own Democratic President's majority; if she votes 'yes,' the Republicans are sure to make good use of it at re-election time next year.
But for the average representative, the lobbying pressure has lessened a bit. "The volume of calls is down," said Representative Schenk.
In an interview, she described the tax increases on the affluent, "including my husband and me," both lawyers, as fair. But she said the package did not include enough money for childhood immunization and did not slice enough into what she thought unnecessary spending, like price supports for mohair wool, apparently restored in the final package.
"I thought I would come to Congress and get rid of the wool mohair subsidies," she said. "Right! Or as the kids say, 'Not!' "
But all in all, Ms. Schenk said, despite pressures from talk show groupies and Perot forces, she was inclined to go along with Mr. Clinton. "I'm more positive about this than a couple of weeks ago," she said. "The Senate has made improvements. We are beginning to head in the right direction."

HEADLINE: EUROPE'S CURRENCY CRISIS;
Getting a Good Dollar Deal While Abroad

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
The European currency crisis has created confusion for many Americans who plan to visit Europe soon.
With currency exchange rates in flux, many people are seeking ways to get the best possible deal when they convert dollars into European currencies and protect themselves from sharp declines in the dollar while they are overseas. 
 Some experts recommend using credit cards as much as possible abroad. Credit card companies like Mastercard, Visa and American Express get the wholesale rate when converting currencies, while individuals get the retail, or less favorable, rate in a store or restaurant.
"I generally advise people to charge things overseas because it's a lot safer and the currency exchange is made at the wholesale rate," said Gerri Detweiler, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America.
The downside of using credit cards in Europe is that some American issuing banks charge a conversion fee that cuts into the favorable exchange rate. But Ms. Detweiler noted that travelers could ask their banks before leaving whether they add such fees.
Another suggestion from travel specialists is that traveler's checks be bought in foreign denominations. American Express, Thomas Cook, Visa, Mastercard and other companies sell traveler's checks denominated in leading currencies like the British pound, the mark and the franc. Purchasers who do this can lock in exchange rates before leaving the United States and still have the safety of traveler's checks.
"You know what it is going to cost you, as opposed to a different rate every day," said Fran Taurasi, vice president of Thomas Cook Currency Services. "This gives you cost control."
Travelers to Europe might also consider buying more of a foreign currency than the usual amount they would need to pay for the first day's expenses. By acquiring foreign money before leaving the country, Americans can lock in an exchange rate -- although there is usually a service charge added before the exchange is concluded.
There are other ways to protect against currency fluctuations overseas.
"You should also get a guaranteed rate in dollars for your lodgings before you leave," said Herbert J. Teison, publisher of Travel Smart, a travel newsletter. "You can make a reservation from here with one of the chains by calling an '800' number and then you won't be surprised at the rate you are charged."

HEADLINE: Small Businesses May Hold Fate of Clinton Budget Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
As far as business is concerned, the biggest debate about President Clinton's budget plan is whether it will inhibit small businesses from creating jobs.
Straining to swing small-business owners (and voters) against the plan, Republicans assert that the President's proposed higher taxes will hurt about a million small businesses and cause thousands of them to lay off workers. 
 But Administration officials counter that the higher taxes will hurt just 300,000 very wealthy small-business owners, who represent only 4 percent of small business.
"The average income for these 300,000 people is $560,000 a year," said Leslie Samuels, the Assistant Treasury Secretary for Tax Policy. "We're talking about a very wealthy group of people."
In this debate, the economic and political stakes are high. If the Administration is wrong and the President's budget plan does indeed punish small business, that will make it exceedingly hard for Mr. Clinton to reach his goal of creating 8 million jobs by 1996. And the political stakes are high because of the voting clout of the 21 million small-business owners -- if they become convinced that the President's plan is bad news, that could spell trouble for the Democrats in the 1994 and 1996 elections.
The Republicans maintain that the Administration, eager to hold down any political pain, is cooking the books to underestimate the number of small businesses that will be hit by higher taxes. Beyond that, they say, the 4 percent that will face higher taxes are precisely those thriving, dynamic small businesses that have created the most jobs over the last decade.
"President Clinton said only 4 percent of businessmen and small-business women are going to pay more -- they're the ones who create 70 percent of the new jobs in America," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader.
But David Birch, the president of Cognetics, an economic research firm that specializes in the small-business sector, emphatically disagreed. He said the higher taxes would hardly touch the fast-growing businesses that are creating most of the jobs because those companies report very little income. The reason: They are so busy reinvesting in plant and equipment that their profits are minimal.
"The growing company that is investing like crazy is probably paying very little in current taxes," Mr. Birch said.
Mr. Dole apparently took his numbers from Mr. Birch's research, which shows that 4 percent of the country's companies produced 70 percent of the jobs over the last five years. Mr. Birch said this 4 percent was quite different from the 4 percent the Administration said would face higher taxes.
Those small businesses that will be affected will be hit for the most part by the increase in the personal income tax on households earning more than $140,000. The top rate, now 31 percent, will jump to 36 percent for that group, and to 39.6 percent for households with incomes of more than $250,000.
 
Categories of Taxes
 Owners of sole proprietorships and partnerships pay their taxes at the individual rate, rather than the 34 percent corporate rate, which Congress appears likely to raise to 35 percent. Another large group of small-business owners pays taxes governed by Subchapter S of the tax code, under which corporate profits flow directly to shareholders, who pay the individual tax rate. There are about 1.5 million of these S corporations, which cannot have more than 35 shareholders.
The Republicans have sought to portray the increase in personal income taxes as a rude shock to local hardware stores, dry cleaners and other shops on Main Street. But the Administration vigorously argues that owners of mom-and-pop stores usually do not earn close to $140,000 a year.
Much of the brouhaha stems from the definition of small-business owners. While the Republicans count as small-business owners all of the 21 million Americans who reported small-business income in their tax returns, the Administration counts only 7 million of this group. The Administration counted only those who received more than half their income as profits from small businesses, including partnerships. The idea is to exclude people who may receive part of their income from small businesses, but are not truly active in running the businesses.
The Republicans say 900,000 of the 21 million will pay higher taxes, while the Treasury estimates that 300,000 of the 7 million will.
The Republicans see this as deliberate low-balling. "The Treasury reinvented the English language in defining small business," said Representative Richard Armey of Texas, a former economics professor and the chairman of the House Republican Conference. "These people can't be trusted with words or numbers. Quite frankly, I don't buy the 300,000 number."
 
High-Paid Professions Involved
 Mr. Samuels of the Treasury said more than 40 percent of these 300,000 taxpayers are doctors, lawyers, investment bankers and lobbyists -- not exactly the dynamic entrepreneurs that the Republicans say need to be nurtured.
Administration officials say the President's plan includes plenty of good news for small business, including a capital gains tax break for investments in start-up businesses held for more than five years and more generous provisions for expenses, allowing companies to write off more of their investments in the first year.
"If the tax rate goes up a modest amount and the incentives go up a modest amount, that makes sense because you're encouraging people to invest more in new equipment," said Mr. Birch, the consultant. "That encourages people to build better companies over time, rather than just take their income out now and consume it."

HEADLINE: Vacationers Go Undercover at Sea to Film Dumping

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 30

 BODY:
Encouraged by environmental groups, and with the prospect of six-figure rewards by the Federal Government, passengers aboard cruise ships are using their video cameras not just to record vacation moments but to help prosecute illegal dumping in the high seas.
Earlier this month, Princess Cruise Lines paid a record $500,000 fine to the Federal Government after pleading guilty to illegal dumping. The major evidence for the United States Attorney in Miami was provided by a Michigan couple, Alvin and Marilyn Levett, who videotaped the crew of the Regal Princess hurling more than 20 plastic bags of garbage into the ocean five miles off the Florida Keys. Under the reward system for environmental whistle-blowers, the Levetts received half the fine, or $250,000. 
 Federal prosecutors here and in Tampa are now investigating two other instances of ocean dumping that were videotaped or photographed by cruise passengers. The authorities said they would not comment on the cases because of the inquiries.
 
Some Dumping Allowed
 International maritime law permits cruise ships to discard some garbage at sea, but Federal guidelines require that items that will sink -- like glass, metal and aluminum -- be crushed into square-inch pieces. No plastics, including garbage bags, may be dumped, and no dumping may take place within 12 nautical miles of shore. Until recently, cases were nearly impossible to prosecute because of lack of evidence.
But public concern over the environment is playing a role in the increased reporting of illegal dumping, said Heidi Lovett, a spokesman with the Florida offices of the Center for Marine Conservation, an environmental organization based in Washington.
"People want to see recycling inside ships," she said. "They are doing it in their offices and at home and they think that cruises can do the same."
At the same time, the Coast Guard has toughened its enforcement of ocean dumping by asserting the right to prosecute any violation within the United States's exclusive economic zone, which is 200 nautical miles from shore. Before last fall, the United States would refer any violation in the high seas -- outside the three-nautical-mile zone of territorial waters -- to the ship's country of registry, often Panama or Liberia. In most cases, those countries took no action.
To enlist the help of passengers in its crackdown, the Coast Guard set up a toll-free number for those who wish to report violations. It refers cases of suspected illegal dumping to United States Attorneys' offices.
In one case under investigation, Cindy Swoope of Gloucester, Va., a passenger on the Dolphin Cruise Lines's Sea Breeze, videotaped several instances of dumping last May. Ms. Swoope had seen a television program showing such videotaped dumping, so she decided to take her own camera.
At 3 A.M. on May 5, Ms. Swoope said in a recent interview, she and a friend took a walk around the ship's pool and heard a bang. They walked toward the noise and, as they told the United States Attorney's office in Miami, saw crew members throwing six white plastic bags into the sea as well as glass bottles. She got her camera and began videotaping. When she disembarked, she turned the tape over to agents from the Attorney's office, who flew from Miami to Virginia to interview her.
A vice president of Dolphin Cruise Line, John Markakis, said in a recent interview that an internal company investigation had disproved Ms. Swoope's accusations, though he conceded that he had not seen the tape. "The vessels don't have a need to dispose of waste in an illegal way because the ships have shredders to process food waste and compactors for plastic glass and aluminum cans," he said.
Environmental groups estimate that more than seven million tons of waste are illegally dumped into the ocean each year from all types of ships. The upsurge is partly attributable to huge luxury liners that can accommodate as many as 3,500 passengers, said the Center for Marine Conservation, which estimates that 15 percent of the illegal ocean dumping in the ocean can be traced directly to cruise ships.
Plastics are particularly troublesome because they can take up to 400 years to decompose and pose an immediate threat to marine life, according to the center. The center estimates that one million birds and 100,000 marine mammals and sea turtles die each year by ingesting plastic products or by becoming entangled in the plastic six-pack rings that are used to hold beer and soda cans.
The other case under investigation, by the United States Attorney's Office in Tampa, involved sluething by a Tampa woman, Stephanie Richards, who accompanied her mother on a seven-day Caribbean cruise in February aboard the Regency Cruise Line's Regent Sea.
In a statement to the Marine Safety Office of the Coast Guard, Mrs. Richards described nightly dumping that was so loud it woke her. The first night, she went to the upper deck and saw crew members hurling plastic bags over the side, she said. The next night, she looked out her porthole and saw garbage falling.
 
'Felt Like Nancy Drew'
 "It was a mixture of foodstuff, full plastic bags and cut bags with plastic cups, cans, straws, cardboard and wine bottles," she told investigators.
The third night, she said, she managed to open her porthole wide enough for her 35-millimeter camera and took pictures as bags flew past. Mrs. Richards also told investigators that she had felt threatened by the crew members, who had seen her with a camera, and that she thought she was being watched.
"I felt like Nancy Drew carrying around the film, afraid they might take it from me," she said. Back home near Tampa, Mrs. Richards contacted the Center for Marine Conservation, which referred her to the Coast Guard.
Anne Burgeuieres, a spokeswoman for Regency Cruise Lines, said the company was reviewing the matter.
Since Princess Cruise Lines was fined, the Center for Marine Conservation has reported an increase in the number of inquiries about cruise ship dumping, both from travel agents and potential passengers, said Betsy Schrader, director of the marine debris office of the center.
Mr. Levett, whose videotape incriminated Princess Cruise Lines, said he would consider another voyage. "It would be interesting to go on another cruise to see the changes that have taken place as a result of the Princess case."

HEADLINE: Bonds Quiet After Thursday's Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Despite the currency turmoil in Europe, the Treasury market was quiet yesterday after its sharp rally on Thursday.
The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond was unchanged, at 6.56 percent, while yields on shorter-term securities rose slightly as prices slipped. 
 Most of the decline in shorter-term maturities was related to profit taking, in which investors sold bonds to lock in profits from the prior day's price increase.
"It's sort of impressive the market has managed to hold up as well as it has after such a big move yesterday," said Matthew Alexy, market strategist at the First Boston Corporation.
The bond market rallied on Thursday after the Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product grew at a lower-than-expected 1.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter. In addition, the report said a measure of inflation tied to the G.D.P. rose only at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent, down from 4.3 percent in the first quarter.
Traders and investors saw the reports as indicating that the Federal Reserve would not act soon to raise interest rates. Higher rates would dilute the value of existing bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return.
Further news of economic sluggishness came yesterday morning with a report from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago. The group's index fell to 50.1 in July from 53.9 in June.
The report gave some investors a reason to buy bonds, helping to push prices to their highs for the day, Mr. Alexy said. The report, an indicator of regional economic trends, gets added attention because it comes out just before the National Association of Purchasing Management's assessment of the overall manufacturing sector, due Monday.
Further turmoil in Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism continued to lend some support to the Treasury market as investors who had sold off foreign currencies for dollars parked their money in United States Government securities.
The bond market's had a muted response to a huge jump in gold prices to above the psychologically important $400 level for the first time in three years, said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "It's been a nagging negative for most of this session," Mr. Liro said.
The bond market tends to be depressed by big increases in gold prices, because they indicate that inflation fears are growing.
But yesterday's jump in gold prices was tied to the tremendous demand for dollars on world currency markets, which was leading many investors to buy gold with the United States currency.
Short-term Treasuries fell 1/32 point to 3/32 point and intermediate maturities fell 1/8 point to 5/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 3.02 percent. The discount rate on six-month bills rose 2 basis points, to 3.18 percent, while the discount rate on one-year bills also rose 2 basis points, to 3.38 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 31/16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10121/32 , up 1/16 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 5.78 percent, down from 5.79 percent.

HEADLINE: Personal Spending and Home Sales Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
Personal spending rose six-tenths of 1 percent in June and new-home sales jumped 11 percent, reports issued today showed.
But personal incomes stagnated in the month, raising the question of whether consumers would be able to spend enough to keep the economy improving. 
 "The bottom line is: this can't last," said Donald H. Straszheim, an economist with Merrill Lynch.
Personal income was unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.3 trillion, breaking a string of six consecutive increases, the Commerce Department said.
In a separate report, the Housing and Commerce Departments said new-home sales surged 11 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 678,000, the second-largest total since October 1989. But that followed a 12.5 percent drop in May.
In June, sales rose everywhere except the West. In the South, they soared 33.6 percent, to the highest level since June 1986.
The department also said that the median price of a new home was $122,300, down from $129,000 in May and $124,500 in June 1992.
The combination of relatively brisk consumer spending and no income growth depressed Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- to 3.9 percent. That was the lowest since October 1990 and down from 4.6 percent the month before.
"We've seen several months now with not much income growth and still halfway decent increases in spending," Mr. Straszheim said. "The net result is people are spending increasingly out of savings. That's not a sustainable process. What's necessary is for employment to pick up."
The unemployment rate has remained stuck at 7 percent virtually all year.
"Consumer incomes are rising very slowly and there seems to be nothing around to change that," said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the WEFA Group, a forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
Income last failed to increase in November, when it was also unchanged. It had risen five-tenths of 1 percent in May and two-tenths in April. Spending, which reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.32 trillion in June, had posted gains of four-tenths of 1 percent in May and 1.3 percent in April.
The department said income was somewhat depressed in both May and June by decreases in farm subsidy payments. Excluding that, income would have risen one-tenth of 1 percent in June and seven-tenths in May.
The most-watched component of income -- wages and salaries -- slipped one-tenth of 1 percent in June after a 1 percent gain the month before.
Real disposable income -- inflation-adjusted income after taxes -- fell one-tenth of 1 percent after a gain of three-tenths in May.
Consumer spending rose six-tenths of 1 percent for long-lasting durable goods like cars and appliances. It increased three-tenths of 1 percent for nondurable goods and eight-tenths for services.

HEADLINE: South Africa in the Open

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, July 30

 BODY:
Angela King's mother lives in Kingston, Jamaica, where she watches CNN on her bedside television and frets about her daughter's safety here in the reputed carnage capital of the world.
Miss King, who heads the United Nations observer mission in South Africa, knows that South Africa has dangerous places because it is her job to visit them, but like almost everyone else who can afford to she goes home at night to a safe suburb. 
 On the whole, she says, she feels safer in Johannesburg than in Kingston.
Although apartheid is formally no more, there are still two South Africas. One is African, largely impoverished and often brutally violent. The other is European, largely affluent and secure, and its residents usually experience the deadly side of South Africa the way Miss King's mother does in Jamaica -- on television.
That is why the unexplained killing of churchgoers in a white suburb of Cape Town on Sunday has terrified white South Africans out of proportion to the 11 deaths.
Whether the blacks who strafed the multiracial congregation were township militants or hired assassins, most whites saw the killing as a visit from a world that has always been a fearsome but distant mystery and now threatens to spill into their own.
"It's an absolute realization of their worst nightmare," said Graham Simpson, deputy director of the Center for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation at the University of the Witswatersrand. "The townships were out of sight and out of mind. The white suburbs were safe and inaccessible. Now the walls are coming down."
With the repeal of apartheid laws, the distance between blacks and whites has begun to narrow. Some blacks have earned their way into formerly white neighborhoods; and years of recession, in turn, have demoted many whites into multiracial shelters and soup kitchens.
But for the most part the divisions originally based on race and enforced by apartheid laws remain, now based on income and enforced by high ramparts, menacing dogs and 24-hour security services. Some white suburbs have actually discussed enclosing their entire communities behind great walls.
When white South Africans complain, as they often do, that they reside in the world's most murderous country, they are thinking of the other South Africa.
Most of the political violence that took an estimated 3,000 lives last year, and most of the crime that killed 16,400 more, is visited upon black communities. Of all those victims, according to a statistic the police will provide on request but do not publish, 630 were white.
A white South African's chances of being killed last year were one in 8,000, about double the risk faced by white Americans. A black South African's chances of being killed were one in 1,400.
For whites who can recall when their skin was all the protection they needed, though, the trend is amply alarming.
 
Freighted with Vengeance
 Not only is crime growing in general, but when it does penetrate white enclaves, it is often gratuitously brutal, as if freighted with a measure of racial vengeance.
Moreover, South Africa is so thick with guns that minor crimes are often lethal. Automatics are pouring in from demobilized warriors in Mozambique, military weapons are turning up from pilfered arsenals, and the nation has a plethora of over-the-counter shotguns and pistols. Burglars arrive bearing AK-47 assault rifles, possibly assuming that their victims will also be heavily armed.
The assault on the church in Cape Town, Mr. Simpson observed, was a style of killing associated with the townships.
The killers burst upon the crowded church in midservice and sprayed the congregation indiscriminately with automatic rifle fire and hand grenades. In townships, churches have not been attacked, but funeral vigils are a favorite target of terror, and the tactics are often identical.
 
Growing Violence
 Miss King said the brutality of the Cape Town attack parallels a development in the black townships: in recent months, for reasons no one can explain, the violence has grown more horrifying. There has been a resurgence of the most gruesome kinds of killing -- hacking with machetes and "necklacing" with gasoline-soaked tires set alight.
The whites' fear worries many black leaders as well. While they may see justice in whites tasting the routine fear of township life, they realize that governing South Africa will be far more difficult if whites withdraw their wealth, run away or resist.
Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, has repeatedly implored whites not to flee the country. His organization has promised to begin its own search for the church killers.
"We are all in the same boat, and the name of the boat is South Africa," said Tokyo Sexwale, chairman of the congress's Johannesburg region.
As Mr. Simpson points out, the African National Congress is engaged in a political negotiation that depends on the trust of whites and an election campaign in which it hopes to win white votes.
But Mr. Mandela also seems to realize that whites have expertise, capital, the ability to sell South Africa to foreign investors, and conversely, the ability to sabotage a new Government.

Like Australia's duck-billed platypus, a hairy mammal that lays eggs like a bird, the International Trade Commission is an unusual beast that defies easy classification.
But the power of the six-member body, which on Tuesday stripped away much of the American steel industry's protection from imports, is real and growing. 
 The commission is not part of the Government's legislative or executive branches, although it is a Federal agency with members chosen by Congress and the White House. And it is not part of the judicial branch, even though the commissioners decide legal cases and write verbose opinions.
The commission may confound fans of organizational charts, but it has the final say on whether industries receive protection from imports. With three new commissioners, it appears increasingly reluctant to approve protective tariffs.
 
Impact of Steel Ruling
 Indeed, although price and tonnage limits on steel imports have protected the American industry for almost three decades, the commission earlier this week eliminated most tariffs on construction and machinery steel. It retained tariffs on corrosion-resistant steel.
The ruling sent steel stocks plunging and the industry leaders vowed to take the commission to court, a costly maneuver that could take at least a year. They huddled today with members of Congress about possible legislation to help them.
Created in 1916 by Congress, the commission has two tasks: to assess American trade agreements and decide if industries seeking tariffs, like steelmakers and car makers, suffer "material injury" from imports.
Tuesday's decision on steel "says that the commission feels it is free to make decisions without worrying much about the politics of it, and the simple fact that an industry isn't doing well is not enough anymore," said Ronald A. Cass, who was the vice chairman of the commission in the late 1980's and is now the dean of the law shool at Boston University.
The first sign of the commission's new tilt came a year ago, when it stunned Detroit auto makers by eliminating steep tariffs on Japanese mini-vans that the Commerce Department had been ready to impose.
The new independence reflects the disintegration of a bloc of four commissioners, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, who had routinely approved protective tariffs through much of the 1980's.
Two of the four commissioners had resigned or retired at the end of their nine-year terms, and were replaced by President George Bush with lawyers who interpret American trade laws literally. The other member, David B. Rohr, has become less responsive to domestic industries, voting against Detroit in the mini-van case and American steelmakers in many of the 72 steel cases on Tuesday.
The result has been the almost complete isolation of Don E. Newquist, the chairman of the commission and former leader of the bloc. Irritable at the end of the hearing on Tuesday, he was wistful for bygone days in an interview the next day. "We were together pretty much on everything," he said.
A new and less predictable bloc of four centrist commissioners, including Mr. Rohr, now dominates. Three are lawyers appointed by President Bush -- Carol T. Crawford, Janet A. Nuzum and Peter S. Watson -- who put considerable emphasis on literal interpretations of the statutes governing the commission.
The sixth member is Anne E. Brunsdale, an avowed free-trader and economist who has forced the commission staff to come up with increasingly elaborate economic models of the effects of imports. Her nine-year term expired this summer, but a commissioner can remain until a replacement is found.
Steel industry lawyers hope to refile some of their cases if President Clinton replaces her with someone more sympathetic to the domestic industry. But her vote decided only a handful of the 72 rulings on Tuesday.
 
Squabble Over Travel
 The current ferment over trade policy coincides with a squabble over Mr. Newquist's travel. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed the commission last week to reduce its spending by nearly a tenth, adopt new controls on travel spending and protect the office of the commission's inspector general from staff cuts while travel audits are performed.
The committee acted after Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said Mr. Newquist had spent 97 days on the road during the eight months through the end of May, and 112 days traveling during the 12 months before that. The travel during the period included 26 trips to or through his home state of Texas.
Mr. Newquist said he had been asked to speak there on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the travel had not hurt his ability to assemble coalitions on the commission or analyze the issues.

HEADLINE: Nassau County Finds a Bond Rating It Likes

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 30

 BODY:
In what Nassau County officials hailed as a sign of fiscal recovery, a credit-rating agency today gave the county's bonds a small but significant boost.
Only eight months ago, a different agency, Moody's Investors Service, had dropped the county's bond rating to its lowest level ever because of continuing budget problems, including a $120 million deficit. The Moody's rating of Baa is the agency's lowest investment-grade rating. 
 But today, Standard & Poor's, in its first evaluation ever of Nassau County, gave the county a rating of A- -- roughly one notch higher than the Moody's rating. County officials said the new rating should save Nassau thousands of dollars on insurance for bond sales and make the county's bonds more attractive to investors.
"This is great news for the taxpayers of Nassau County," said County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, who said it was "a clear sign that we are well on our way to financial stability."
 
A Better 'Second Opinion'
 But others suggested the improvement was partly the result of savvy maneuvering by the county in going to another credit-rating agency for a new evaluation.
Supervisor Bruce Nyman of Long Beach, a Democrat, likened it to going to a doctor for a "second opinion on an X-ray."
"It's certainly better news than we've been getting, but you still know something's wrong," Mr. Nyman said.
In a break from its past practices, the county several months ago requested an evaluation from Standard & Poor's -- at county expense -- in addition to Moody's, which has evaluated the county's credit rating for decades. While it is common for municipalities to have two or three evaluations of their credit ratings, some bond experts said that the county's decision to go to Standard & Poor's was a smart business move.
Philip R. Michael, director of New York City's Office of Management and Budget, said that Nassau County had little to lose by seeking a second opinion. After a credit rating is downgraded, he said, "You usually assume it won't be up for two or three years."
The decision by Moody's to downgrade the county's rating by two levels last year cost the county millions of dollars and was a blow to the image of a county that is one of the wealthiest in the nation.
At the time, officials at Moody's cited a "protracted and contentious political stalemate" in the county's government that had left it in a precarious financial position. The company said the county was in danger of running out of cash to pay its bills in six to eight weeks unless it acted soon.
 
Fiscal Turnaround Foreseen
 Since then, a bipartisan coalition was formed on the Board of Supervisors, and the county passed a budget that Mr. Gulotta and Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli, an Oyster Bay Democrat, claimed would reduce the deficit through cuts and long-term borrowing.
Officials at Standard & Poor's said the county's fiscal problems had led them to give the county a rating that was slightly below average. The A- rating is the same as New York City's.
In a statement, the company said the rating was not lower because of the county's substantial economic assets and because the company believed that "the county is beginning to come to terms with a sizable fiscal deficit and will over time turn around a declining financial situation."
Michael Johnston, a vice president and manager at Moody's, declined to comment directly on the Standard & Poor's rating. But he noted that Moody's will issue a new report on the county in several weeks, and that the primary reason for downgrading the county's rating -- political gridlock -- "seems to have stabilized."

HEADLINE: U.S. Stocks Lose Out To Europe's

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
Money flowed into stocks in Europe yesterday, where currency turmoil has raised hopes for lower interest rates.
The shift hurt American stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 27.95, to 3,539.47. 
 "The assumption by many U.S. stock traders is that interest rates won't continue to fall," said Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst for MMS International.
 
Assessing Interest Rates
 But in Europe, he said, if the exchange rate system collapses, "you could see interest rates come down further."
"That usually means higher stock prices, so you're beginning to see people moving money into those markets," he continued.
Germany's refusal to lower its discount rate to help the sinking French franc set off the currency crisis and cast doubt about plans for future European currency union. It also pushed the major stock indexes of France, Britain, Spain and Italy higher, and that of Germany down.
The decline of the Dow yesterday pushed it further from Monday's closing record high of 3,567.70. Some analysts expressed doubts whether such an easily spooked market could sustain the long-awaited, oft-deferred summer rally. Indeed, despite setting the record on Monday, the Dow lost 7.27 points for the week.
 
A Broad-Based Decline
 Weighed down by computer, drug and steel stocks, most other leading domestic market indicators also sank yesterday. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.11, to 448.13, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.54, to 704.70. Only the American Stock Exchange composite rose, edging up 0.41, to 437.
On the New York Stock Exchange, trading was moderately heavy at 254.4 million shares, compared with 266.6 million on Thursday.
Mr. Walberg said he was worried that the Dow appeared unable to sustain advances much above 3,550. "That's just not the sign of a strong bull market," he said.
But others argued that the news was not so grim yesterday. "The overall market was a little better than the averages," said George Pirrone, senior trader for the Dreyfus Corporation. Breadth was almost even, he said, with decliners outnumbering advancers by just 10 to 9.
Among over-the-counter stocks, computer issues declined after Microsoft announced that its growth in 1994 would lag behind the 1993 rate. Microsoft fell 5, to 74. It was the most actively traded stock on the exchange yesterday, at 8.9 million shares.
Powersoft, another software developer, fell 3 to close at 31 1/4, while Lotus Development dropped 2 7/8, to 36. Sybase dropped 3 1/4, to 70 3/4.
Drug stocks, a favorite whipping boy for months, took another beating yesterday. As the market continued to digest the news of Merck's $6 billion purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc., the mail-order drug retailer, investors fled other drug companies.
"It signals a truly profound change in the way the companies do business," said D. Larry Smith, managing director of Hambrecht & Quist. "This is causing the final capitulation in the group, which had been shaky anyway."
Those investors who are not simply panicked that the industry has lost its virtually unrestrained ability to raise prices may fear that other companies will follow Merck's lead and make costly acquisitions. They may also be concerned about the strengthening dollar, since much of the sector's business is overseas. Yesterday, Pfizer lost 2 1/4 to close at 59 1/2, while Schering-Plough dropped 1 3/4, to 61 1/4.
The biggest loser among blue-chip stocks yesterday was a drug company -- but one with bad news of its own. A. L. Laboratories announced that its 1993 earnings would come in below last year's, and its stock lost more than 38 percent of its value. It dropped 9, to 14 5/8.
"I think people are just disgusted," said Jack Lamberton, a vice president for the NatWest Securities Corporation. "This is not the first time that the company has set expectations at a certain level and then surprised them."
The company is not meeting its targets, he said, because it failed to win approval for some generic drugs from the Food and Drug Administration, as well as approval from some foreign governments to market a dental gel overseas.
Steelmakers had another bad day yesterday, after slipping on Tuesday when the International Trade Commission said that it would not impose punitive duties on some imports. Yesterday, investors took flight because three major steelmakers are nearing the expiration of their labor contracts and there are no signs of anyagreements. U.S. Steel declined 1 1/4, to 30 1/8; Bethlehem Steel fell 3/8, to 14 1/2, and National Steel dropped 1/2, to 13 3/4.
Among the stocks in the Dow, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing led the losers, dropping 3 3/4, to 105, after reporting lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings.
The Dow transportation average provided one positive sign yesterday. As the price of crude oil sank, airline stocks rallied, driving up the average by 19.66, to 1,613.81.
In Tokyo, stocks closed lower yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues lost 76.71 points, or 0.37 percent, to 20,380.14. On Thursday, the Nikkei jumped 627.27 points.

HEADLINE: Visionaries Offer Eyewear to Uzbeks

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VALLEY STREAM, L.I., July 30

 BODY:
 When the idea of selling eyewear to the Uzbeks was presented to her more than a year ago, Norma Scalzulli was caught off guard. Not only was she unfamiliar with the latest consumer trends in Central Asia, she had only the vaguest notion where -- or what -- Uzbekistan was.
"Very honestly, I did not know anything about it," said Ms. Scalzulli, vice president for franchising of Cohen's Fashion Optical, a Long Island-based chain with 104 stores in the Northeast and Florida. 
 Nevertheless, she took the proposal to her boss, Robert Cohen, the president of the chain, who was also not on intimate terms with the former Soviet republic. But the more he learned about the idea from the pair of emigre cousins who worked for him and had made the pitch, the more he liked it.
So Cohen's, which began 68 years ago selling eyeglasses from a pushcart on the Lower East Side, has become a multinational operation. On July 1, the chain added to its list of stores, in places like Paramus, Great Neck and Stamford, its newest, in Tashkent, capital of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
 
A Willing Government
 Many larger companies, sensing the potential for consumer growth, have established offices and entered into joint ventures in many of the former Soviet republics. But it has been much less common for smaller companies from the metropolitan region, like Cohen's, to set up shop there.
While it is considered to have one of the stronger economies among the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, a major cotton-producing nation of 21.6 million people, faces severe economic problems. Conversion to private ownership has gone slowly and foreign investment has been minimal, in part because of its unstable political environment.
But Dr. Cohen, talking about the move as he sat in a Cohen's store in a mall here, said he was persuaded to make the initial investment of $200,000 because the Uzbekistan Government was willing to become a partner in the venture, and because of the powers of persuasion of Vladimir and Mark Flek, 39-year-old emigre cousins who run a Cohen's store in Manhattan and have extensive business contacts in Uzbekistan.
"Uzbekistan is more stabilized republic," said Vladimir Flek, who came to the United States from Odessa in Ukraine 15 years ago and is now managing director for Cohen's operations in Uzbekistan. "Very nice people. Very nice city."
While the opening of a store selling designer eyeglasses does not, as a rule, make news in this country, the opening of a 5,000-square-foot shop with marble floors and chandeliers on the site of the former eyeglass Store No. 1 in downtown Tashkent caused a sensation, the Flek cousins said. The event, which included a blessing of the store by a clergyman and the cooking of a national dish over an open fire in the back, was covered by national television and newspapers.
"We're on back page, we're on front page," Vladimir Flek said, adding that families from all over Tashkent visit the store just to gaze at its contents.
State-run eyeglass stores in Tashkent traditionally offer only a handful of styles and can take weeks to fill a prescription, the Flek cousins said. At the new store, which stocks 1,000 styles of eyeglasses, the staff of 30 salespeople and opticians can produce a pair of glasses in an hour. In its first day, the store sold 500 pairs of glasses, and since then has been averaging 250 to 300 customers a day, well above the 50 or so most franchises in this country serve daily, Cohen's officials said. Uzbeks prefer eyeglasses with large frames, the officials said.
Dr. Cohen said the Tashkent store, where the lowest-priced glasses sell for the equivalent of $15, is already turning a profit. The chain has plans for an American-style expansion across Uzbekistan, with more than a dozen additional stores planned for the cities of Samarkand, Bukhara and Fergana.
Next month, Dr. Cohen said, the company will introduce a product new to the people of Uzbekistan: contact lenses.

HEADLINE: Russian Bankers Looking West

 BODY:
It was a classic socialist concept. A power plant would be built in Russia and rather than being paid for by local citizens would be financed by a state-owned bank.
"Can anyone tell me what's wrong with that?" asked Suresh C. Chugh, a managing director at J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. who was on loan for the day to Fairfield University in Fairfield, Conn. The 40 Russian bankers in the class held headphones to their ears and concentrated on the translation of Mr. Chugh's question. 
 "No cash flow," Sergei Mytarev, a 36-year-old Moscow banker, replied.
Mr. Chugh nodded his head.
"It is not enough to complete projects," Mr. Chugh said. "You must produce hard currency. What do we care about as bankers? Cash flow. Money back."
His students, some of Russia's and Kazakhstan's best and brightest bankers and financiers, chuckled, suggesting both an appreciation of Mr. Chugh's socialist example and a collective sense of relief. It is time to make money in Russia.
Yet, as these men and women know, turning a profit in the country the 19th-century Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev called the "homeland of patience," is still largely an idea waiting to land on stable ground.
With Russia's banking system in its infancy, International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials said it was difficult to produce any reliable measurements of its size.
But the United States Agency for International Development, which provided the primary financing for the seminar, said about 1,600 commercial and state-run banks are operating in Russia, with 9.8 trillion rubles, or $9.8 billion, in assets. By comparison, banks in the United States hold $3.5 trillion in assets.
So it was that 229 bankers came to Connecticut for five weeks to attend a series of seminars about how the West, especially the United States, runs a private banking system. They are going where no banker has gone before, into the primordial landscape of Russian private finance.
Their mission is formidable: cultivate a new banking system that is flexible enough to take risks, vibrant enough to promote a liquid stock market, and independent enough to break the hegemony of the Central Bank, which last week announced a vastly unpopular policy to nullify pre-1993 ruble notes to fight inflation.
But perhaps the toughest chore is garnering the trust of the people on whose deposits the new Russian banking system will largely rest.
"Only real responsibility based on property ownership will transform Russia's system," said Gennadi Dekhtiarenko, a director with the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm in Moscow who attended the seminar.
The seminars, called the Academy for Advanced Studies in Banking and Finance, are sponsored by the Russian-American Bankers Forum, a private organization President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia created in 1992 to help promote economic reform. The Federal Reserve Bank in New York works closely with the forum.
The seminar's curriculum includes fundamental courses like "The Basics of Credit" and advanced classes like "The Role of Commercial Banks in the Privatization Process." Following the seminars, which concluded July 23, the bankers, 40 percent of whom are women, will have three-week internships in American banks.
Though most of their time has been absorbed by the ways and means of economics, the group shifted gears easily, raiding the fresh fruit baskets in the school's cafeteria daily, shopping for clothing and jewelry in Fairfield and watching the Yankees beat the Oakland Athletics in the Bronx.
Eager for a piece of the new Russian order, young professionals like Yan Parkhomento, a 24-year-old loan officer with Metracom Bank in Russia's Black Sea region, are making momentous decisions.
After years of military training, Mr. Parkhomento abandoned his promising Red Army career after only eight months. "I preferred to retire," he said with a wry smile.
Hired, he said, because of his fluency in English and Chinese, Mr. Parkhomento is working on financing a $4 billion to $10 billion seaport-airport project in Taganrog, a city on the Sea of Azov. At the same time he is taking classes at a local business school.
 
Facing Many Obstacles
 But the bankers say they face many obstacles. A major one, Mr. Dekhtiarenko said, is convincing new owners who still hold to old ideas, former Communist Party officials, for example, to go public with companies they control, promoting the country's nascent stock market.
"Closed companies are a large problem," he said. "These owners don't understand the real necessity for change. But it might not be ideology, it might be misunderstanding, a psychology. That's not for one generation to solve."
Another obstacle, the bankers said, is persistent central control. "In spite of the new legislation, rules and reforms, the regions still have to demand, ask, beg for money from the center," said Aleksandr Rassakov, a publisher with the Minst company in Moscow, which publishes economic textbooks and rules and regulations for the Finance Ministry. "It's just like in the old days."
Mr. Rassokov, a 42-year-old former middleweight boxer who is spending three weeks working at the Missouri Independent Bank in Jefferson City, Mo., said he was stunned to learn of the Central Bank's June 24 decision to eliminate pre-1993 ruble notes.
"I have rubles with me, 80,000 rubles, about $80, that I brought for my American colleagues," he said. "I thought it was money but now it is only beautiful papers."
President Yeltsin softened the currency measures June 26 by extending trade-in deadlines and permitting Russians to exchange more old notes for new ones.
As he strolled across the Fairfield campus to the cafeteria for a lunch of sloppy joes, Mr. Dekhtiarenko said meeting his Russian colleagues might be the most valuable part of the trip.
"They feel the direction," he said. "There are a lot of roots in Russia, just like America, but they should be encouraged. We need to push them."

HEADLINE: TAXES;
Caught in a Bind? I.R.S. May Let You Pay Less

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
TAXPAYERS who dealt with April's agony by filing an automatic four-month extension on their tax returns face their day of reckoning on Aug. 16. Many of these people are expected to owe money, and some will find that they simply do not have it.
In a change of policy, the Internal Revenue Service granted extensions this tax season even to people who owed money. It was extended to provide some relief to taxpayers affected by the Government's decision to decrease withholding last year in hopes of encouraging spending. 
 As a result, extensions in the 1993 filing season surged 14.7 percent, to 5.5 million from 4.8 million in the 1992 season, I.R.S. figures show. That equals 5 percent of the 110 million returns filed.
Still, extensions merely absolve taxpayers from nonfiling penalties. They must still pay taxes, plus interest on payments made after April 15.
People who find themselves short of cash -- including filers who have received I.R.S. notices of sizable tax liabilities that they do not contest -- basically have three choices:
*If they have assets like securities, home equity or whole life insurance policies, they can sell or borrow against them to pay their taxes.
*If they lack assets but have income they can file Form 433 askingto pay in installments.
*If they are truly in a financial bind with no means of paying the tax bill now or in the future, they can make an offer of compromise on Form 9465 to pay less than is owed but as much as possible, which may be in installments.
Neil O'Keeffe, an I.R.S. spokesman, confirmed reports by tax practitioners that procedures for offers of compromise have been streamlined in the last year. "The goal now is to try to get people to file," he said.
Samuel J. Friedman, senior tax partner in the New York law firm of Hall, Dickler, Lawler, Kent & Friedman, who has represented clients on compromise offers, said, "It's an opportunity to get your house in order."
Offers of compromise were warranted from a man who borrowed heavily in 1989 to buy a New York co-op that is now worth less than he owes on it, an investor who had big capital gains in 1992 but huge losses this year, an entrepreneur who has no assets outside her troubled small business and a divorced woman who still faces a joint tax liability from when she was married.
"Any offer of compromise is conditioned to your absolute faithful adherence to tax law for the next five years," Mr. Friedman said. The offer and detailed financial statements, which are required if more than $10,000 is owed, are made "under penalties of perjury."
Julian Block, a tax lawyer and author in Larchmont, N.Y., advised people filing an offer of compromise, to "paint as truthful but as dire a picture as you can." Those who are unemployed have the best chance of having their offers accepted, he said.
Mr. Friedman said the I.R.S. would generally allow taxpayers to continue making rent or mortgage and utility payments and to keep a business going, but "they expect you to eat very modestly." He suggests that people making offers of compromise pay off credit card and other consumer debt first because money owed the I.R.S. takes precedence.
"Make an offer that is reasonable enough the I.R.S. will pay attention to it," Mr. Friedman said. How much depends on individual circumstances. The entrepreneur, for example, offered 40 percent in February and is waiting to hear from the I.R.S.
Consider borrowing from a third party, one who has no obligation to pay, to make a down payment to the I.R.S. as evidence you are doing everything possible, he said. The entrepreneur got a loan from her elderly mother.

HEADLINE: Japan: The Voters' Reward

 BODY:
Democracy is alive and well in Japan. It's only a first step, of course, but the millions of Japanese who voted two weeks ago for an end to the corrupt "money politics" of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party are about to get their reward.
Morihiro Hosokawa has been chosen by a wide coalition of former opposition parties as their nominee for Prime Minister. His ratification by Parliament next week is considered a sure thing. The aristocratic Mr. Hosokawa quit the L.D.P. more than a year ago, before such defections were seen as a shrewd career move. He has become the personal symbol of a new, cleaner political style. 
Meanwhile, the L.D.P., still Japan's largest party, chose a new reformist leader of its own. Even if the new coalition quickly crumbles, the reform ideas that won the election are poised to persist.
Symbolically, at least, Mr. Hosokawa is the perfect choice. Other leading opposition contenders, like Tsutomu Hata and Ichiro Ozawa, were too recently at the center of L.D.P. scheming to be credible exemplars of renewal. Both are experienced and agile politicians, and if their recent political conversions prove real, they could get a turn at the top later on.
Now, the relatively untested Mr. Hosokawa faces a daunting challenge. He must hold together a group of parties and personalities ranging from the dovish left to the hawkish right, representing constituencies from organized labor and rice farmers to big business and urban consumers. If he is successful, President Clinton might call for advice.
The coalition platform talks about issues from economic stimulus to foreign policy. But its main focus will be political reform -- crafting a new and more representative electoral system and enacting tight campaign finance restrictions.
If it manages that, the coalition could attract enough independents and L.D.P. defectors to lay the basis for a stable two-party system. Real political competition would offer the best insurance against the return of old-style corruption and give ordinary Japanese citizens maximum clout.
Americans shouldn't expect the overnight transformation of Japan into a consumer society. Most Japanese see some advantages in their producer-oriented system, like low unemployment and the survival of small neighborhood shops. But few see any advantage in the present political role of organized crime or in bid rigging designed to help one giant firm over another.
Washington needs to extend a supportive and understanding hand to Tokyo in what looks like an extended period of political transition. Wisely, Mr. Clinton showed a new sensitivity on his recent Tokyo trip, backing off from the harsh trade rhetoric of last spring.
Rhetorical bullying now would not only be counterproductive. It would also jeopardize a still-fragile democratic renewal. That renewal represents the best long-term hope for better relations between the U.S. and Japan.

HEADLINE: Saipan, 15 Years On, Correcting Labor Abuses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I respond to "Saipan Sweatshops Are No American Dream" (front page, July 18) as a citizen of the United States and a resident of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.
Yes, many issues in the commonwealth need to be and are being addressed. Many have to do with supporting an island economy that is rapidly changing from primitive to progressive. I have been a part of workshops and planning groups on economic and social reform. 
 We need outside labor, whether United States citizens or "alien" (including Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, Europeans, Filipinos, Chinese, Taiwanese, Koreans, Southeast Asians and other Pacific islanders). Remember, the commonwealth is only 15 years old!
Before obtaining independence in 1978, the indigenous Chamorro and Carolinian people, going back to the 16th century, were governed by the Spanish, the Germans, the Japanese and then the United States. Self-governance is a new concept here, and many people from Asia and the United States have used this opportunity to make fast profits and run.
Most outsiders come on one- or two-year contracts, to work at a specific job and return home. Some from developing countries come hoping to move on to the United States. They come here because they can make more money in a short time than at home, and send the money back. As in other parts of the world, some workers are exploited. Others are not.
I have seen a garment factory barracks with four people to an air-conditioned room, each with an enclosed sleeping area. They eat in a cafeteria on the grounds. Some garment factory owners take advantage of their workers, and some run out of money. These problems are being addressed by the commonwealth Department of Commerce and Labor.
I have lived near San Fernando, Calif., and saw the exploitation of the Hispanic-Americans and African-Americans of nearby Pacoima. I lived in California's Orange County when refugees began pouring in from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. A woman who became a good friend of mine had been a physician in Cambodia. Because she spoke several languages, but not English, she was forced to work in a garment factory at far below minimum wages there.
I have visited the native American villages of Zuni, Isleta and others, and have seen how they are kept dependent on the United States Government. I have visited New York City's garment district and heard the stories of mob involvement. And I have read about exploitation of mushroom growers in Pennsylvania, garment workers in Appalachia, textile workers in the Southern United States. The new owners of garment factories in Saipan have come from Georgia, looking for cheap labor.
You talk about Chinese workers whose employer went out of business, leaving them stranded. The surety company that bonded the company also went out of business. The workers are staying in a former World War II bunker until a way is found for them to return to China. These bunkers are also used by typhoon victims until their houses are rebuilt. Food is provided by emergency rations from social service agencies.
Because we live on a developing island in the western Pacific, we are often without electric power or water. Our infrastructure is steadily improving and is far ahead of most other Micronesian islands. Our social systems are far behind many parts of the United States, but also improving. With a grant from the Administration for Native Americans in Washington, a network of island social services has been computerized and will provide better services for alien workers and indigenous people.
During the first 15 years of the United States there was no Bill of Rights. The first 10 amendments to the Constitution were passed in 1791. We have much work to do, but I hope history will judge us by our accomplishments, and not by our failures.

HEADLINE: Exports Can Fuel Recovery for U.S.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 17 front-page analysis of a national economic recovery too weak to create many jobs lays the bulk of the blame on American consumers, who "have simply not purchased with their usual gusto." Yet you do not mention exports as a way to offset weak demand at home.
Despite the slump in world growth, United States exports continue to increase, creating about 800,000 jobs in the last two years. These tend to be higher-paying jobs, in part because 80 percent of our exports are in competitive manufacturing industries. 
 We have billions of new customers in newly created or liberalized economies from Asia to Mexico to Eastern Europe. The dollar exchange rate allows us to compete globally. Even the European Community, with its own economic problems, has bought more than $100 billion of our exports in each of the last three years.
Yet we are doing little to exploit the job-creating power of exports. The way to jobs and growth through exports is relatively straightforward:
Keep the exchange rate at levels consistent with export growth; encourage other industrial countries to pursue more growth-oriented policies; adopt export promotion policies, including improved export financing and removal of export controls, and give greater priority to penetrating foreign markets, particularly in the third world.

HEADLINE: EUROPE'S CURRENCY CRISIS;
EUROPEAN SYSTEM TYING CURRENCIES FACES A RUPTURE

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 30

 BODY:
The European Monetary System, the cornerstone of exchange-rate stability within the European Community since 1979, was threatened with extinction today after speculators decided that France could no longer defend its currency and mounted an all-out attack on the franc.
The battle, pitting currency traders against both the French and German central banks, is especially bitter because it is about a lot more than money. The steady exchange rate in recent years between the German mark and French franc has come to symbolize the strength of the French-German alliance and Europe's aspirations toward greater monetary and political union. 
 But today the parity between the two currencies appeared on the verge of collapse -- a development that would destroy the vestigial credibility of the European Monetary System and make a mockery of Europe's plans for further integration.
 
 
Franc Falls to Its Limit
 Despite the Bundesbank's huge outlays to support the franc by buying it -- currency dealers in London said the German central bank spent about $8.6 billion today -- the French currency plunged to its floor of 3.4305 francs to the mark before rising very slightly by the end of trading in Europe. In New York late today, the franc-mark rate was right at the 3.4305 floor, or the equivalent of 0.2915 franc to the mark.
Under the monetary system's rules, a currency's floor is the lowest limit at which the currency is permitted to trade. The system sets broadly stable rates, and currencies are allowed to fluctuate only within a narrow band.
 
 
Stocks Drop in U.S.
 Investors pushed up stock prices in Paris, Madrid and London on the assumption that interest rates will fall outside Germany, inducing an economic recovery. But stocks fell in Frankfurt as disappointed investors digested the Bundesbank's action. The flow of money into European markets also hurt share prices in the United States. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.95 points, to 3,539.47. [Page 35.]
And panicked investors seeking a safe place for cash amid turmoil in the currency market rushed to buy gold, pushing prices to levels not seen in nearly three years. [Page 46.]
By the close of trading in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $407 an ounce, up $9.20.
Money also moved to the Japanese yen, which is seen as a safe haven amid the turmoil. The yen strengthened to about 104 yen to the dollar -- a postwar high -- before settling late in the day at 104.70.
The attack on the franc came after a decision on Thursday by the Bundesbank to fight German inflation by refraining from a cut in its discount rate. That rate sets a floor on short-term interest rates in Germany and in countries like France whose currencies are closely tied to the mark. Instead, the bank trimmed the Lombard rate, which serves as a ceiling for money market rates.
Those moves signaled to traders that the French Government would not be able to cut interest rates quickly to jump-start its economy and ease pressure on the franc. As a result, currency traders sold francs heavily.
The speculators calculated that France could not long battle a deepening recession and rising unemployment as long as it had to maintain the high interest rates necessary to keep its currency attractive to investors, and so insure the franc's parity with the German mark.
The franc was not the only currency under attack today. The Belgian franc, the Danish krone, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo were all pegged at or close to their floors in trading today. Over all, traders estimated that the central banks of Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal spent about 30 billion marks, or $17.25 billion, supporting the weak currencies.
Traders were virtually unanimous in saying that France would have to seek a devaluation or, more likely, abandon the monetary system as Britain and Italy did almost a year ago. "It's hard to see how the franc can hang on," said J. Paul Horne, the chief economist in Paris for Smith Barney, Harris Upham, the American brokerage firm. "There'll probably be a generalized floating of the European currencies."
 
 
Defending 'Le Franc Fort'
 There were widespread suggestions from traders that the European Community's monetary committee would meet this weekend to decide on a franc devaluation or on its flotation outside the system. But a spokesman for the German Finance Ministry, Karlheinz von den Driesch, insisted that such talk was "pure speculation" and said the French economy remained fundamentally strong.
The French Government -- which has made a defense of "le franc fort," or a strong franc, the cornerstone of its economic policy -- vowed to resist. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said the monetary system continued to function and vowed, "France will not allow anything to be imposed on it." A spokesman for the French central bank, who insisted on anonymity, said, "Franco-German solidarity cannot be abandoned."
But although France and Germany battled shoulder-to-shoulder today, their alliance looked frayed after the Bundesbank precipitated the crisis. But the Bundesbank -- an institution that has become, for many European countries, synonymous with stubborn rigidity over the last year -- continues to insist that rates cannot fall too quickly as long as inflationary pressures stemming from German reunification have not been tamed.
Indeed, George Soros, the New York financier who made close to $1 billion last year by speculating against the pound before Britain withdrew from the monetary system and allowed the pound to float, said the Bundesbank's decision meant the end of the system.
In a statement released in New York, he said, "It is futile to attempt to protect the European Monetary System by abstaining from trading in currencies when the anchor of the system, the Bundesbank, acts without regard to the interests of other members."
He added, "I think that the system is now going to be broken."
Earlier in the week, before the Bundesbank's decision, Mr. Soros had told Le Figaro, the French daily, that he was not speculating against the franc because he did not want to be accused of destroying the system. That commitment, he made clear today, is now void.
 For France and Mr. Balladur, the options look bleak: either devalue, which would amount to a political humiliation after vows of resistance, or try to hang on, at potentially devastating further cost to the economy.
The woes of the franc today coincided with an announcement that France's unemployment rose by 44,600 people in June to a record 3.2 million, or 11.6 percent of the work force. The economy continues to slow, and it is now expected to contract by seven-tenths of a percent this year.
In these circumstances, just as in the last American recession, economists believe French interest rates must come down sharply. European rates remain several points higher than those in the United States.
But if the pressure remains on the franc, and France decides once more to stay in the monetary system and try to avoid devaluation, a raising of French rates may well be necessary to make the franc more attractive. Already last week, the Bank of France was obliged to raise overnight rates to 10 percent from 7.75 percent.
A growing number of politicians, including members of the governing centrist and conservative Gaullist parties, argue that this policy amounts to political suicide for Mr. Balladur, the Prime Minister. They say the time has come to break free of the monetary system, devalue, slash interest rates and seek growth that creates jobs.
Britain has followed this sort of course since leaving the monetary system last year and is the one European Community country showing glimmerings of economic growth after a bruising recession.
So far, Mr. Balladur has resisted. Indeed, he has said he would rather resign than devalue. His determination, shared by the Socialist President, Francois Mitterrand, is rooted in a political conviction that France's future lies in an integrated Europe.
Both men therefore see the assault on the franc as, in some ways, an attack by American and British speculators on Europe's plans for union.
The Bank of France's reserves, at the end of last week, stood at $21 billion -- higher than economists had expected. So the country may have the means to defend the franc by buying it for a while.
If not, the alternative is either a realignment of the system -- which would probably involve a devaluation of the Danish, Belgian Spanish and Portuguese currencies, as well as the franc -- or a French decision to leave the system. Economists say the latter course is more likely because it would give France greater economic freedom and avoid the risk of a renewed assault on the franc at a lower level.
A franc devaluation, however, accompanied by devaluations of other currencies, would at least have the merit of conserving the monetary system, albeit in tenuous form. For if the franc is withdrawn, there will effectively be nothing left, at least for now, of a system that is supposed to lead Europe to a single currency by 1999.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 3, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Saturday about the turmoil in the European Monetary System misstated the exchange rate of the German mark against the French franc late Friday. In trading in New York, the franc was quoted at 0.2915 mark, or the equivalent of 3.4305 francs to the mark.
