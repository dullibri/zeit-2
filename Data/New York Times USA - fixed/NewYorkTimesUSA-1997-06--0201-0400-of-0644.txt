HEADLINE: CONGRESS AND TAXES: THE REACTION;
Potshots From All Sides Offer Tax-Fight Preview

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Offering a preview of the rancorous debate that lies ahead, interest groups pounced on the tax package proposed today by the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, with some calling the tax cuts too limited and others calling them too generous to the wealthy.
The package drew a guarded response from White House officials, who said they had some "serious concerns" about parts of the plan. 
 "There are a lot of problems that are going to need some serious attention," said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who joined others in complaining that the plan drafted by the Republicans was weighted too heavily against poorer people.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation, released details of a five-year plan for net tax relief worth $85 billion -- about $135 billion in tax cuts and $50 billion in new revenue from tax and fee increases -- at a noon news conference on Capitol Hill. Within minutes, his proposal was being picked apart.
Citizens for Tax Justice, a tax research group, called the plan a "flimflam." "They have cooked the books so much that French chefs would be jealous of this fine work," said Robert S. McIntyre, the director of the group. Corn growers and an alternative fuel association vowed to fight an attempt to eliminate tax subsidies on ethanol production.
The nation's largest lobbying group for small businesses, the National Federation of Independent Business, said that while it was pleased with much of the plan, it found the proposed changes on estate taxes -- increasing the current $600,000 exemption to $1 million over the next 17 years -- too limited.
In what could well be one of the major political flash points, a coalition of Indian tribes challenged the constitutionality of a provision that would impose a new Federal income tax on gambling and other commercial enterprises on American Indian lands. The tribes are backed by 45 members of Congress from both sides of the aisle.
Mr. Archer, who tried and failed to push a similar measure through the last Congress, said the new tax would generate $1.9 billion in revenue through 2002.
But critics of that idea -- who include Senators Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the majority whip, or second-ranking Republican, in the Senate, and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee -- said that Federal law and Federal court decisions had recognized the special sovereign status of Indian tribes and had given them the same legal status as states, whose gambling operations are not subject to taxation.
One major provision of the tax package, the per-child tax credit, was also part of the House Republicans' Contract With America, and Mr. Archer said it would benefit the families of 41 million children under the age of 17. It would start with a maximum credit of $400 per child in 1998, which would be $500 per child thereafter.
But even that came under criticism today from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which argued that the tax credit would not apply to two of every five children, or about 28 million, because their family incomes are not high enough.
About the only supportive comments Mr. Archer heard today came from his Republican counterpart in the Senate, Senator William V. Roth Jr., the chairman of the Finance Committee. "I know how difficult it is to balance the competing interests within a limited tax bill, and I think he did a fine job," Mr. Roth said in a brief statement.
A major lobbying group for big business and Wall Street gave its approval to the proposed cut in capital gains taxes. The proposal would reduce the current 28 percent rate to 10 percent for couples making less than $41,200 a year and would set the rate at 20 percent for people in higher income brackets.
"I think the capital gains portion is extremely well crafted, and it will have a positive effect on the economy," said Mark A. Bloomfield, president of the group, the American Council for Capital Formation.
The tax cuts were part of the budget deal that Republican Congressional leaders and President Clinton signed off on last month.
In broad terms, the two sides agreed to net tax relief of $85 billion over the next five years -- $250 billion over the next 10 years -- that would include a tax credit of $500 per child, roughly $35 billion in postsecondary education tax incentives demanded by the Administration, broad-based capital gains relief, expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts and a "significant" reduction in estate taxes.
But it was left to Mr. Archer to fill in the details. White House officials suggested today that he might have strayed from the agreement.
For example, Mr. Archer's plan -- called a chairman's mark -- proposes a scaled-back version of Mr. Clinton's proposal for a $1,500 tax credit to help parents pay for a child's first two years of college. And it limits the deduction of up to $10,000 that Mr. Clinton wanted for postsecondary education expenses by requiring parents to invest in special savings accounts. It also would make it much more difficult for low- and some middle-income people to get the college tuition tax credit.
"Our basic objective is to have a tax plan that is good for the American people, good for working people, good for average families, good for the economy and that is permeated by fairness throughout," Mr. Rubin said. "By that test, we have serious concerns with significant parts of the chairman's mark that we have received today."

HEADLINE: Deregulation in Boston: Disruption, but Also Construction

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 4

 BODY:
In the two years since Massachusetts voters ended most rent controls for the cities of Boston, Cambridge and Brookline, two distinct interpretations of the results are beginning to emerge: While tenant advocates and landlords agree that noticeable disruptions and turnover have occurred in some neighborhoods, landlords say there are also signs that eliminating the rules has encouraged new housing construction and repairs.
One scenario is on display at the Hemenway Hotel apartments, a rambling eight-story building in the Boston neighborhood known as the East Fens. Sitting in her apartment in the building recently, Susan Starr counted the stalwarts: the former Avon lady who had lived in her apartment for 40 years; the retired merchant marine who had been there almost as long; the man who ran the cluttered antique shop on the ground floor, a fixture for two decades. 
 They were among the few longtime tenants who had gone to court to fight rent increases and remain in their building, as other neighbors were replaced by college students and young professionals.
The other side of the complicated rent decontrol story unfolding in and around Boston comes from landlords, who say the return to a market system here has already been beneficial citywide, leading to an increase in property tax revenues and appearing to cause new housing construction, which could eventually bring prices back down.
Furthermore, while landlords concede that some neighborhoods have been inevitably and sometimes even painfully changed, they say that the most vulnerable tenants, the poor and the elderly, have been affected much less than expected.
It is difficult to draw significant economic comparisons between New York and the Boston area because Boston's huge student population skews the market and New York has higher demand and 20 times more rent-regulated apartments, but both sides in New York have plucked examples to use as lessons for lawmakers in Albany.
Citing the Hemenway and buildings in other neighborhoods where prices have risen sharply, tenant leaders say Boston has already proven that ending rent regulations, whether quickly or over several years, forces the working class and middle class out of desirable neighborhoods.
Tim Davis, a tenant advocate with the Fenway Community Development Association, a nonprofit housing group, said: "There are now only two kinds of people here who are able to afford to live in a lot of the buildings in this neighborhood: People who make $50,000-plus or students who are willing to double and triple up."
Blocks in the neighborhood once had an eclectic mix -- from municipal and college employees to hotel dishwashers to lawyers, artists and students -- but, Mr. Davis said, "There's really no mixture anymore."
Ms. Starr, a secretary at Northeastern University who makes $24,000 a year, has fought the owners of the Hemenway, as the building is still called, although the name was formally changed to the Parkside when it was bought and renovated in late 1994. She said the owners wanted to increase the $565 monthly rent for her one-bedroom apartment to $850. And while she has succeeded in keeping her old rent for two years, she does not think she or many other old tenants can stay much longer.
"In December of 1994, the Hemenway had about 160 tenants, most of whom were rent-controlled," she said. "As of today, there are fewer than 20 of those people left -- in a mere two years. It's not the same building."
The owners of her building, Forest Properties and Fenway Parkside Limited Partnership, did not respond to several requests to be interviewed for this article. But as a group, the city's landlords do not dispute that tenants have been pushed to other neighborhoods and sometimes to other cities by rising prices. They are not apologetic, however, saying that it was grossly unfair for landlords ever to have been saddled with the rent rules.
"The hypothetical secretary might have to come to the realization that she's not entitled to an apartment in a given block," said Edwin J. Shanahan, the managing director of the Rental Housing Association, Boston's largest landlord group.
He said the end of the rent controls appeared to be having a beneficial effect for the city as a whole and the housing industry, which could eventually increase the stock of affordable housing.
A study released this week by Henry O. Pollakowski, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reported that in Cambridge, which had the strictest controls, building permits increased in 1996 and assessors predicted that residential property tax revenues would rise 9 percent.
Since the Boston area was in the middle of a housing boom when the rent controls were lifted, Mr. Pollakowski's study said, it is difficult to know how much of the building can be attributed to rent deregulation. But the current high level of renovation and repair of Cambridge buildings once under rent control had not been matched during the previous market peak, in the late 1980's, the study concluded.
Those on all sides of the issue agree that Boston rents have increased on average, but the effects of decontrol are still developing. and it is hard to pin down exactly how much they have risen and where.
In Cambridge, which adopted rent controls in 1971 and had about 15,000 regulated apartments two years ago, Stanley Lastoff, owner of Porter Square Realty, said that one-bedroom apartments then renting for $433 a month can now fetch about $900.
While landlords say that such increases were bound to happen in some neighborhoods, they contend that the effect on residents has been much less predictable. And they argue that there were far fewer elderly, disabled or poor people who had to look elsewhere than originally expected.
When rent controls were ended in January 1995, the State Legislature provided for two-year extensions for the elderly, the disabled and the poor, if they qualified under certain income guidelines. But in the three affected cities of Boston, Cambridge and Brookline, where about 45,500 units were subject to rent controls, only 3,090 units eventually qualified for the exemption, according to Mr. Shanahan and the M.I.T. study.
"Our experience indicated that a lot of people could afford the increase and they paid the increase," Mr. Shanahan said. "A lot of others just said, 'Well, the jig's up.' It wasn't a case of people undergoing mass relocation."
At the Hemenway, Ms. Starr and the remaining holdouts said they had begun to accept that they would not be able to stay much longer. The antique shop owner has already decided to move and close his store. "I probably won't be around here in a couple of years, either," Ms. Starr said.
But while she remains, she said, she will continue to argue that the landlords' purely economic viewpoint overlooks a lot: "Whatever happened to neighborhood stability and civic pride and human connections?"

HEADLINE: Peru's Stark Poverty Dulls Fujimori's Gleam

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, June 6

 BODY:
Eager to show what a man of the people he was, President Alberto K. Fujimori drove his jeep high into the dusty slums where Lima's poor live. With his country's two most important guests in tow, he rolled over stretches of new road and pointed out freshly built schools. He waded into swarms of cheering mothers and youngsters, who scrambled to touch his sleeve.
But after the President and the dignitaries had gone, the people who remained behind spoke of a desperation for jobs that was not about schools or roads or a presidential handshake. 
 "He comes once every five years," said Willy Saavedra, a 27-year-old father of two. "Only when he needs something."
Less than two months after Peruvians treated him like a conquering hero and sent his popularity soaring to 69 percent, Mr. Fujimori finds himself facing an increasingly hostile electorate. Polls show that his approval rating has plummeted in recent weeks and now stands at 39 percent -- exactly where it was before the raid.
For the first time in seven years in office, Mr. Fujimori is confronting public protests stirred both by the pervasive poverty and some of his recent actions.
There have been media exposes about corruption, killings and torture by the intelligence services that are integral to his hold on power. And the President came under diplomatic and domestic criticism when his congressional majority dismissed the three judges who had ruled against his bid to run for a third term in the year 2000.
But the most pervasive threat to Mr. Fujimori's popularity can be seen in places like the The Carnations soup kitchen, an unlit shack more cave than house, where the hot lunches that sell for 40 cents are gone by 1 P.M.
 
Economic Crisis A Way of Life
Throughout the country, thousands of soup kitchens like The Carnations began with the economic crisis of the 1980's. Now, people here said, crisis has become a way of life.
It was to places like the soup kitchen that Mr. Fujimori invited the Unites States' special envoy, Thomas F. McLarty, and Enrique Iglesias, chief of the Bank for Inter-American Development, on one of the President's locally famous "windshield tours" through the slums. And it is in places like the soup kitchen that the discontent that simmered after he left helps explain the drop in the President's popularity,
Seven years of the President's fiscal austerity program, for example, has left countless young fathers like Mr. Saavedra waiting on the sidelines, praying for a job.
According to figures published in Gestion, a financial newspaper, last week, 19 percent of all Peruvians, or 4.5 million people, live in extreme poverty, without sanitation, water, electricity or gas. Half the population lives below the poverty level, up from 38 percent in 1985.
"We didn't even get to work on the road, because the Army did it," he said. His wife, Yesinia Ramos, watched one of their daughters, Lady Denise Rosa, as she fed a pebble to her doll, lying on the ground.
Like Mr. Saavedra, Luis Garcia, 22, was waiting for work. He left school at the age of 10 to collect fares on a public transportation van. At 15, he got his first and last steady job, at a shoe factory that went bankrupt before the year was out. On Monday, the last day somebody hired him, Mr. Garcia was back collecting bus fares for the day. He earned less than $4.
Last year, Mr. Garcia's wife abandoned him and their daughter, Damares Milagros. The child is now 18 months old, with a moon face and bangs that fall over her eyes, and Mr. Garcia is raising her alone. She wears unmatching socks, but her clothes are clean. Her father's sneakers are torn clear across the top.
Political analysts say the President, facing popular protests for democracy for the first time since taking office in 1990, is at a turning point. The slack that he was once granted, in the name of overcoming terrorist violence and righting the economic shambles left by his predecessor, appears to be running out.
"Only 15 percent of all Peruvians either don't know, don't care, or think we're living in a democracy," said Hernando de Soto, an economist who is a former adviser to Mr. Fujimori. The gutting of the Constitutional Tribunal, however, was "the last straw" for many Peruvians.
"Before, the things Fujimori may have done that weren't following the rules, people saw them as necessary or required to end the violence," he said. "Now, there's a sense that these measures are being taken in terms of personal interests and ambition."
Last week, a broad base of opposition leaders, students and workers turned out by the thousands in protests the country had not seen in at least a decade. The Pontifical Catholic University of Peru took out a newspaper ad to decry the dismantling of the Constitutional court.
 
Tales of Torture Raise Public's Ire
News media reports of torture, killing and corruption by the intelligence services have set off crackdowns, with journalists complaining that they have received death threats and harassment in the form of sudden problems with the bureaucracy.
Mr. Fujimori himself lashed out last week at the news media, using a speech at a meeting here of the Organization of American States to accuse some journalists of taking bribes "to attack those who try to eliminate corruption."
Mr. Fujimori's speech notwithstanding, the Government worked tirelessly at the meeting to build a fire wall between its image and the sparks of discontent. Beatriz Ramacciotti, the Peruvian Ambassador to the O.A.S., worked tirelessly, and ultimately unsuccessfully, to prevent the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights from publishing a special section in its annual survey criticizing Peru.
The report condemned Peru for maintaining a state of emergency in many places, even though the threat of terrorism had generally diminished. It also attacked two 1995 laws Congress passed in the middle of the night, the first granting amnesty to all agents of the state and the second barring judicial review of the law.
"Some of the crimes covered by the amnesty, including acts of torture, forced disappearances and extrajudicial executions, have been considered an affront to the conscience of the hemisphere and are crimes against humanity," the Commission's report says.
Though Cesar Gaviria, the Secretary General of the O.A.S., would not comment on the dismissing of the judges, the Human Rights Commission issued a statement criticizing the dismissals and heard a rundown of the cases that have been the focus of popular ire.
They heard about Leonor La Rosa, a whistle-blower who disclosed the "Bermuda plan," which she said was a secret strategy to silence the press.
Ms. La Rosa's lawyer said she was tortured by her former colleagues in the basement of military headquarters, nicknamed the Pentagonito, where suspected terrorists were also tortured. Despite a court order, Ms. La Rosa was held against her will at the Military Hospital while the O.A.S. met. On Friday, she was transferred to a private clinic.
The commission also heard about Baruch Ivcher, president of a television station, who was now being threatened with losing his citizenship and his station after his investigative news shows reported on the La Rosa case, and raised questions about the annual income of Vladimiro Montesinos, the shadowy head of intelligence and Mr. Fujimori's adviser.
Mr. Montesinos, who seldom appears in public, has not denied a report that he receives a salary of $600,000. Nor has he answered the questions Peruvians inevitably began asking: who could be paying him so much money, and why?
 
'Step Backward For Democracy'
After the broadcast, Mr. Ivcher, a naturalized Peruvian born in Israel, became the target of accusations that he was an agent of Israeli intelligence who sold weapons to the Ecuadorians during that country's brief border war with Peru. The accusations, which Mr. Ivcher maintains were based on forgeries, were printed in publications friendly with the military, but remain so far unsubstantiated.
Mr. Fujimori declined a request for an interview. But both Mr. Iglesias and Mr. McLarty said the President of Congress, Victor Joy Way, had defended the dismissal of the judges. He said the Constitutional Tribunal had no right to rule on the re-election law, since three of the seven judges had abstained.
Mr. Iglesias, who five years ago froze the development bank's funding of projects here after Mr. Fujimori dismantled other branches of Government, said he found Mr. Joy Way's explanation for the current actions "interesting." Mr. McLarty, though he backed a statement by American Ambassador Dennis C. Jett branding the dismissal of the judges "a step backward for democracy," called Mr. Joy Way "impressive."
Aside from lashing out at unidentified, nefarious interests in the media, Mr. Fujimori has not addressed the accusations or protests directly. But in a sense, his answer to his critics is the practice of making visits to the poor districts of Lima. Here, he can show the practical results of his Administration, and the appreciation of poor people. The poor, after all, make up 49 percent of Peru's population.
In the slums Mr. Fujimori visited with his guests, nearly all of the signs announcing works in progress bear Mr. Fujimori's name. Even a vocational program in a small, empty restaurant carries a plaque with his name. But the need is vast, and what people in the slums notice is not the number of signs, but how thinly the money is spread -- too thinly to give them hopes of a better life.
 
Fears That Power Breeds Corruption
While ministries and various programs -- like the newly-paved road where he waited -- are funded with Government money, Mr. Saavedra said, he was troubled by the concentration of power in the Presidency. "I just hope that when Fujimori leaves, it doesn't turn out that he took everything, like Alan Garcia." He was referring to Peru's previous President, who fled to France after he was accused of enriching himself in power.
The local soup kitchen said it received some $170 a month from the Government, and a couple of sacks of rice. Though Mr. Garcia is blamed for sacking the country's coffers, people at the soup kitchen's said they received more substantial help under his Administration.
"He may have been a crook, but at least we could eat meat," said Pablo Correa, a 32-year-old taxi driver who said he worked 14 hours a day. At Peruvian prices, his family of four gets to eat meat no more than twice a month, he said.
Some do not rule out Mr. Fujimori moving toward greater democracy under the new-found pressure from Washington, the broadening opposition and the streets. Until now, a former ally of the President noted, there has been no counterbalance to the repressive tactics of the military and intelligence branches.
But there has been an unexpected turnaround since the special forces killed the guerrillas: the two men Mr. Fujimori paraded through the house after the raid, Mr. Montesinos, and Gen. Nicolas Hermoza Rios, have become his greatest liabilities. Though cleared by a military court, the amnesty spared the two from publicly answering questions about alleged atrocities in the early 1990's. According to polls, they are the most reviled public figures in Peru.
And the misgivings over the President's respect for institutions like courts, which arose with reports guerrillas were executed instead of arrested when they tried to surrender, appear to have grown, and pushed Peruvians near their breaking point.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS AND TAXES: THE OVERVIEW;
G.O.P. LAWMAKER UNVEILS PROPOSAL FOR A BIG TAX CUT

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
The chief Republican tax writer unveiled his plan today for apportioning the first big Federal tax cut since 1981, making good on his party's promise to reduce tax bills for investors and families but prompting criticism from Democrats that the plan favors the wealthy.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, laid out his legislative blueprint for tax cuts that would be worth nearly $135 billion over the next five years, paid for in part by about $50 billion in new revenue, for a net tax relief of $85 billion. The new revenue would come from sources that include an extension of a tax on airline tickets and a proposal to tax business activities by Indian tribes, including casinos. 
 Mr. Archer's proposal will frame the debate over taxes as Congress turns to the details of enacting the balanced-budget package agreed to in outline by the Republican leadership and the Clinton Administration last month.
But the proposal faces the likelihood of amendment as Mr. Archer writes a bill that can win President Clinton's signature while accommodating the somewhat different demands likely to emerge from Senate Republicans.
The centerpiece of Mr. Archer's plan is a reduction in the top rate on capital gains from the sale of stocks, bonds and other assets to 20 percent from 28 percent -- a proposal that helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average today to 7,478.50, the second straight record finish for the blue chip index -- and a credit for many families of up to $500 per child under the age of 17.
The plan would also expand the Individual Retirement Account program, reduce inheritance taxes slightly and try to stimulate economic development in the beleaguered District of Columbia.
It includes tax breaks for college tuition sought by Mr. Clinton, but in a scaled-back form, one of several issues that put Mr. Archer in conflict with the White House and Democrats in Congress.
While today's announcement by Mr. Archer generated no shortage of partisan and interest-group protest, the start of this year's tax process is welcome to both political parties.
It gives them their first chance since the beginning of the Reagan Administration to enact broad-based tax relief, the dividend from more than six years of economic growth that has swelled the Government's coffers sufficiently to allow both parties to claim they are balancing the budget even as they cut taxes.
"The tax relief package that we will consider represents a solid first step toward a smaller government for bureaucrats in Washington and a larger paycheck for workers in America," Mr. Archer said.
Democrats said Mr. Archer's plan rewarded Wall Street and wealthy families at the expense of middle- and lower-income working families.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said he doubted that Mr. Archer's proposals would have any Democratic support in the committee, which is scheduled to vote on the tax bill this week and move it on to the full House for consideration.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the Administration had serious concerns about the Archer plan because "it seems to have moved the tax benefit away from the less well off, and even away from middle-income people, toward higher-income people."
Some Democrats said they feared that the final bill could include even less in the way of tax relief for lower- and middle-income people than Mr. Archer's proposal because two of the measures he is relying on to pay for the tax cuts are politically unpopular even among Republicans and stand little chance of being adopted.
Mr. Archer wants to raise $4.5 billion over the next decade by imposing a Federal income tax on the earnings of businesses run by Indian tribes. A bipartisan group of senators representing states with large Indian populations came out against the plan; among the senators was Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.
Mr. Archer is also standing almost alone among Republican leaders in proposing to scale back and eventually repeal all subsidies for the production of ethanol, a corn-based alternative fuel that has long had strong support from farm-state delegations. Mr. Archer's plan counts on $4.1 billion over 10 years from eliminating the subsidies.
The chairman's plan also includes the following:
A tax credit for families with children under 17. The credit would be $400 per child in 1998 and $500 thereafter, to be phased out for single taxpayers with income above $75,000 and for couples filing jointly with income above $110,000. Mr. Archer estimated the cost of the program at $71.3 billion over five years and $148.4 billion over 10 years.
A reduction in the top rate on capital gains. The top rate on profits from the sale of securities, real estate and other assets would fall to 20 percent from 28 percent, effective for all sales starting last May 7. The gain on the sale of a principal home would be exempted up to $250,000 for single people and up to $500,000 for joint filers. Starting in the year 2001, capital gains would be reduced to account for the effects of inflation on assets held for at least three years.
The capital gains rate for corporations would be gradually reduced to 30 percent in 2000 from its current level of 35 percent.
Tax breaks for college expenses. The plan would create a tax credit of up to 50 percent of the costs in each of the first two years of college after accounting for financial aid, up to a maximum of $1,500 a year. The President's version of the plan was more generous, and White House officials said Mr. Archer's plan would shortchange lower- and moderate-income students in community colleges. Mr. Archer's plan also radically rewrote Mr. Clinton's plan to offer families a deduction of up to $10,000 a year for college expenses, limiting it to those families that put money into special education-savings accounts.
Mr. Archer would help pay for the tax breaks by requiring employees of colleges and universities to pay taxes on the value of tuition breaks that their children receive.
The Republicans had agreed to spend $35 billion over five years on higher education proposals "consistent" with the President's plan, but Mr. Archer's blueprint came to only $31 billion, reflecting Republican reluctance to apportion such a large chunk of the tax cut to a program that had only modest support.
An expansion of the Individual Retirement Account. The plan would create accounts into which taxpayers could make non-deductible contributions. The interest earnings could be withdrawn tax-free for retirement or buying a first home.
A reduction in inheritance taxes. Under pressure from the small-business lobby, Mr. Archer included a reduction in the Federal estate tax. He proposed a gradual increase in the portion of an estate exempted from the tax, to $1 million from the current $600,000, to be phased in over 17 years.
Changes to the alternative minimum tax. Mr. Archer proposed phasing out the alternative minimum tax for corporations and to eliminate it entirely by 2006. The tax had been intended to insure that all companies paid some tax even if they had access to sophisticated tax-avoidance strategies. For individuals, the plan would gradually increase the income level at which they would become subject to the alternative minimum tax.
Over all, the Republican plan largely fulfilled the demands placed on the party by its two most powerful factions, the social conservatives who wanted a substantial child credit, and the economic conservatives, who made a deep cut in capital gains taxes their priority.
But to do so, Mr. Archer had to keep the costs down, and he did so by structuring many of the tax cuts in ways that Democrats and some independent analysts said hit lower- and middle-income taxpayers harder than the wealthy.
In particular, they said, the child credit was structured in such a way that many families with incomes under $30,000 who benefit from the earned income tax credit would not receive the full $500 credit.

Chart: "IN BRIEF: Highlights of the Tax Proposal"
Here are the main tax reductions proposed today by Representative Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and the estimated revenue effects over the five years covered by the balanced budget agreement. Dozens of additional proposals will bring the total tax cut to $135 billion over that period, partly paid for by $50 billion in new revenues.
 
TAX CREDIT FOR CHILDREN -- $71 billion revenue loss
Parents would be given a tax reduction of $400 in 1998 and $500 every year afterward for each child 17 years old and younger. The credit would be reduced for families with incomes over $75,000, and families with incomes over $110,000 would not be eligible.
 
CAPITAL GAINS -- $3 billion revenue gain
The top rate for individuals, now 28 percent, would be lowered to 10 percent for taxpayers with incomes below $41,200 and to 20 percent for everyone else for property sold after May 7, 1997. Beginning in 2001, profits would be adjusted for inflation. Couples would be exempt from taxation on $500,000 in profits from the sale of their principal home; for a single person, the exemption would be $250,000. After $3 billion revenue gain through 2002, a loss of $35 billion through 2007.
 
RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS-- $33 million revenue loss
A new form of individual retirement account would be created for taxpayers regardless of income in which the deposit would not be tax deductible, but the money could be withdrawn tax-free after retirement or for the purchase of a home. A revenue loss of $33 million through 2002, but $13 billion through 2007.
 
EDUCATION -- $31 billion revenue loss
Taxpayers would be entitled to a tax credit up to $1,500 a year to help pay as much as half the cost of each of the first two years of college. Couples with incomes above $100,000 and single people with incomes above $50,000 would not be eligible. A deduction of up to $10,000 per year (but no more than $40,000 aggregate per student) could be taken regardless of income to cover undergraduate expenses paid through a state-sponsored prepaid tuition program. A tax break would be allowed for money parents contributed to an education savings account, similar to an I.R.A., and then withdrew to meet tuition expenses. The revenue loss includes other, smaller tax breaks for education.
 
ESTATES -- $3 billion revenue loss
The amount of money in an estate exempt from taxation, now $600,000, would be increased by $20,000 a year through 2002 and $25,000 a year thereafter, to a maximum of $1 million. The revenue loss includes other, smaller tax breaks for estates. (pg. D25)

HEADLINE: In France, the Grass Isn't Greener Than Ours

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Diane Johnson has swallowed the reassuring lies the French tell themselves when they begin to suspect that their society is perhaps not the best in the world ("Liberty, Equality, Bon Appetit," Op-Ed, June 8). 
 "Working mothers have day care": yes, if they sign up a year in advance. "Early retirement for people who work at hard jobs": rather, for people whose predecessors 50 years ago worked at hard jobs; but if anyone thinks of decreasing those privileges, the country comes to a standstill.
American society has many problems, and might look with longing at the greener grass; but it should know that those same problems the French thought impossible in their society are now taking root: run-down projects, unemployed youths forming gangs and dealing drugs, deteriorating education and emergence of an underclass marked by skin color.
On the other hand, the French economy has created fewer jobs in 20 years than the United States does in a year, and the last time the French unemployment rate was below 8 percent was in 1981.
The French were not offered the choice between an American economic model and social protections; the Gaullists believe too much in the state to offer anything like the dreaded "Anglo-American" model. The choice was between one and the same; the Socialist leader Lionel Jospin promised more jobs, fewer taxes and a smaller deficit, which is what Jacques Chirac promised in 1995.

HEADLINE: In France, the Grass Isn't Greener Than Ours;
Low Child Poverty

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Comments on the French election have emphasized some of the luxuries that the French people enjoy and want to try to keep, such as long vacations, early retirement and those famous 500 cheeses (Op-Ed and Week in Review cartoon, June 8). 
 But the French welfare state does far more important things. For example, it finances programs that keep child poverty low. The child poverty rates in the United States and France are 22 percent and 6 percent, respectively, despite similar rates of out-of-wedlock births.
The French keep child poverty low by spending about 80 percent more than we do to help families with children and concentrating a lot of that help on parents who work at low wages.
A French single mother with two preschool children leaving welfare to go into a modest job would not lose most of her benefits, as would be the case here. She would get cash and housing benefits equal to about $6,000 a year to supplement her wages, free or highly subsidized high-quality child care, and coverage under France's national health insurance plan.
The American economy would be somewhat less prosperous if the United States behaved more like France. But the American people might consider the trade-off worthwhile.

Germany's Immigrants

To the Editor:
Your June 4 front-page article "It's Young vs. Old in Germany as the Welfare State Fades" overlooks one of Germany's potential strengths: its immigrant population. Immigrant populations are younger than the host population and have a higher birth rate, both of which will serve to shore up a shrinking labor force.

HEADLINE: The Urban Happiness Quotient;
New York's Well-Being Is Up. Figures Don't Lie, Right?

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Wouldn't it be swell (for the mayor of a big city who had staked his reputation on upgrading the quality of life) if there were a Dow Jones-style index for tracking the city's mental and social state?
The Giuliani administration, thinking just that, paid a mathematician and a team of researchers $25,000 last year to come up with a formula with which to follow the ebb and flow of the city's mental health and social well-being. 
 The researchers spent months pondering indicators, numerators and denominators, conferring about domain factors and data sets, and charting billowy (and opportunely upward-sloping) shapes on graphs.
Then they delivered a 41-page report, jam-packed with phrases like "need per unit of economic output" and "support per unit of need," purporting to have discovered a diagnostic instrument for gauging the city's health.
Here it is:
 
[The urban happiness quotient]
 
(where a,b and c are greater than 0, and a+b+c=1)
Into that formula they had plugged all sorts of statistics; on poverty, employment, wages, murders, education spending, the mental-health budget, homelessness, even the number of housing units near boarded-up buildings.
Presto!
According to the "social and mental well-being index" developed for the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services, and to be presented at a meeting of psychiatrists in Washington this fall, the well-being of New Yorkers in general rose 14 percent between 1991 and 1995.
And according to the "mental health index" the researchers developed for the department to gauge conditions for the mentally ill in New York, the improvement there was a modest, but still cheery 9 percent.
Sounds nifty. What does it mean?
"It's like I.Q., what does I.Q. mean?" said Dr. Carole Siegel, head of a lab at the Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research in Orangeburg, N.Y., who led the team that developed the indices.
"I.Q. measures what's in the Stanford-Binet test, but we use it to say something about intelligence," she said. "So the mental well-being index is about mental well-being. What is it? It is what we've measured."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani moved quickly to use the findings to enhance his own well-being. "This study shows scientifically what New Yorkers have felt for the past few years, that the quality of life in New York City is improving," a spokeswoman said. "This is an objective measure that what we're doing is making a difference."
Ruth W. Messinger, who would like Mr. Giuliani's job, was withering about the results: "They don't tell me anything. Somebody else could look at the same indicators and reach a different conclusion. Why is this something useful to do with tax money? I just don't get it."
Every New Yorker, of course, has his or her own way of measuring the city's state of mind: assessing communal hypertension on the IRT, or the attitudes of panhandlers outside the bagel store, or the fortification quotient in taxi cabs.
And every New Yorker has an opinion about whether urban well-being is even desirable, considering that psychic stability has never been a building block of the city's reputation.
But look at it this way: even if New Yorkers are too neurotic to accept that the city could ever become less neurotic and dysfunctional, the formula is exportable. Another city, San Diego or San Antonio or Sao Paulo, could put it to good use.
The idea of the indices first surfaced in 1995, when members of Mayor Giuliani's staff and the mental health department began talking about creating a "report card" to measure the agency's effectiveness.
So the agency contracted with Dr. Siegel, who had once tried to find simple ways of tracking the mental health of entire countries for the World Health Organization (she says she found it "an almost impossible task").
The agency and Dr. Siegel decided that while they were looking at the quality of life for the mentally ill, they might as well use the same approach to figure out how everybody else was doing.
"We very much wanted to have a measure to assess the progress we've made toward improving the quality of life for people with mental illness and for all New Yorkers," said Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the Commissioner of the department. "It tells us how much we've accomplished and where we need to go from here."
Dr. Siegel's group began by compiling long lists of indicators that might reflect the mental health and well-being of the city, from socioeconomic factors like the poverty rate to data on crime, infant mortality and drug-related hospitalizations.
Then the researchers gave their lists to an outside panel of researchers, policy makers, public officials and others to scrutinize, and to rank each indicator on a scale of importance, Dr. Siegel said.
Finally, they wrote the formula: outcomes plus supports plus economic conditions divided by needs equals urban contentment, or lack of it.
"If the outcomes improve, the index improves," Dr. Siegel said. "If supports improve, the index improves. If economic conditions improve, the index improves. But if need goes up, and everything else doesn't, the index goes down."
Indicator projects are fashionable. Marc L. Miringoff, a social policy analyst at the Fordham University Graduate Center in Tarrytown who has been doing an annual index of the country's social health for 11 years, said no other projects existed when he began. Now there are 200.
Some, like the Oregon Benchmarks project, track progress toward environmental, educational or other goals. Others have taken factors from alarm-clock sales to amounts of time lost commuting to and from work as their indicators.
"We measure the stock market every day," Professor Miringoff said. "We have durable goods and factory inventories and housing starts measured every month. All those things are very visible and precise. What we don't know is the social well-being of our people."
Dr. Juan E. Mezzich, a professor of psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, called the report useful. But because it had to rely on available data, he said, it lacked any assessment of emotional health.
But D. J. Jaffe, a board member of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, complained that the mental health department should not be spending its money finding out if people in general are happy. "The economy is up, therefore fewer people have brain disorders?" he said. "It's ludicrous."
Will it last?
Dr. John A. Hornik, a former official of the New York State Office of Mental Health who advised Dr. Siegel, said: "Politicians are going to be happy about it as long as the index continues to show improvements. But as soon as the curve turns, people who are happy with it now are going to say: 'There must be some methodological problem.' "
 
The Serenity Equation
Try this at home at the risk of your own mental health:
The formula used to develop the mental health and social and mental well-being indices adds O (outcomes, like the murder rate), S (supports, like the size of the mental health budget) and E (economic factors like the average income of full-time workers), then divides that by N (needs, like the number of New Yorkers with serious mental illness).

CORRECTION-DATE: June 12, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the indexes devised for New York City mental health officials to measure the social and mental well-being of New Yorkers misstated the mathematical formula involved. Three factors in the formula -- labeled outcomes, supports and economic factors -- are multiplied, not added.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Looking At What Black Looks Like

BYLINE: By MARGO JEFFERSON 

 BODY:
I have been reading fashion magazines for years, and most of them have been filled with women who looked quite unlike me and wore clothes I was unlikely to wear in settings I was unlikely to find myself in. And yes, one of the obvious differences between us was racial.
I would have been delighted to see Lena Horne or Dorothy Dandridge photographed beyond the racial cloister of Ebony Magazine, draped, say, on a divan in Vogue or exuding hauteur on the boulevard of some major European capital for Harper's Bazaar in the 1950's. And I despised the reasons they were excluded, if prejudice, ignorance and timidity can be called reasons. 
 But thank goodness I could still love great non-Negro models like Suzy Parker and Lisa Fossangrives. It is fine visual and imaginative training, this learning to be at ease with something that on the surface seems quite removed from you. It is the kind of training people go out of their way to acquire when they believe that esthetics, not race or ethnicity, are at issue. The truth is, when it comes to fashion, esthetics can't really be separated from how we visualize race and dramatize ethnicity.
Women of color (some color, more color, less color) started showing up in white fashion magazines in the 1960's and 70's. Donyale Luna, Naomi Sims, Pat Cleveland, Beverly Johnson and Iman neither resembled one another nor added up to some comfortably all-purpose African-American type.
Their presence did illustrate the little-known but interesting fact that the people we have called colored, Negro, black and African-American exhibit a range of looks that goes from Nordic to Sub-Saharan, with all sorts of geographic in-betweens. (When I was growing up, we also had the Negro-Mediterranean, American Indian, East Indian, Mexican-Indian, Sephardic, Egyptian, Nubian and Ethiopian looks.)
These models and the clothes they wore also signaled that the United States was no longer in a state of acute culturally infantile paralysis. Non-Nordic styles could now, like avant-garde art, rhythm-and-blues and sexually frank European films, be appreciated openly, not pored over in secret and in flagrant violation of all civilization held dear.
Oh for that brief moment when politics, esthetics and economics were in perfect accord! In the 1960's and 70's, fashion matched civil rights and civil liberties with visual rights and imaginative liberties. Fashion saw that it needed new markets to expand and new stimuli -- colors, shapes and fabrics -- to thrive. Whenever a new physical type appears (new in terms of height, weight or bone structure, not just ethnicity), whenever designers experiment with new cultural styles and references, we, the consumers, have to expand not only our sense of fantasy, but also our sense of reality.
Sometimes consumers just can't or won't: last week The New York Times quoted a forthcoming Vogue magazine editorial to the effect that whenever nonwhite models appear on the covers of mostly white magazines, sales go down. The Times article also noted that the layouts that use, in fact depend on, nonwhite models follow highly predictable, shall we say old hat racial and cultural conventions: lush tropic paradises, funky third world streets accessorized with natives in native garb.
I don't mind some of this visual tourism. The black and British Naomi Campbell looks wonderful in Ralph Lauren's Masai-esque dresses. But so might the white and German Nadja Auerman, especially if you like your Masai stylings to have a high-Teutonic Leni Riefenstahl gloss. And Naomi Campbell also looks wonderful in Ralph Lauren's mega-WASP Polo ads, as does the black American Tyson Beckford. (After what must have been a careful study of the Benetton and Tommy Hilfiger ad campaigns, Mr. Lauren has finally realized that when you put black people in preppy clothing, you create a refreshingly up-to-date un-nostalgic brand of chic exoticism.)
What I do mind is the lack of inventiveness that so often restricts models of color to these ostentatiously "natural" habitats. And don't just blame the consumers for that: blame the editors, stylists and photographers. This is not about being politically correct. This is about being visually alert and creative, which is, after all, their job. And the lack of inventiveness is not limited to race and ethnicity. It never is: a failure of racial imagination is always tied to other lags and lapses.
Fashion photography is filled with cliched layouts and pseudo-narratives right now. Apart from the heroin chic look under attack (wan, hollow-eyed forms slumped against pale bathroom tiles), they include the lone girl, sullen and enigmatic, standing or squatting on a highway or roadside in semi-biker or high-toned slut gear; the lone girl, vibrant but contemplative, walking along a generic beach or wading in a generic body of water; the lone girl, poised in a botanically undistinguished garden or field, wearing something fragile and lyrical, and the lone girl against a blank backdrop, displaying a set of 60's-starlet attitudes. What is with all these fake-cinematic photo-soliloquies? Why aren't they more interestingly lighted and designed? And why aren't there more dynamic group photographs in magazines?
When we look at a fashion layout, all kinds of conscious and unconscious reactions roil around inside us. If the model is our ethnic or racial twin, we may find ourselves rooting for the home team. If the model is wildly exotic or "other," we may borrow the fantasy for an everyday costume or encounter. We may feel judgmental or condescending or intensely envious. But we have to feel curious and excited, eager to be (or play at being) something we hadn't yet dared to imagine.

HEADLINE: Stanley Schachter Dies at 75; Psychologist of the Mundane

BYLINE: By KAREN FREEMAN 

 BODY:
Dr. Stanley Schachter, who delighted in finding simple explanations for seemingly complex social behavior, died on Saturday at his home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 75 and also had a home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
The cause was colon cancer, said his wife, Sophia. 
 Dr. Schachter, a professor emeritus at Columbia University, was one of the few social psychologists to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Judith Rodin, president of the University of Pennsylvania, called Dr. Schachter, who had supervised her doctoral work at Columbia, the "greatest living social psychologist of our time."
Dr. Schachter's interests were wide-ranging, and he asked the kinds of questions about topics like obesity, addiction, emotions and the behavior of stock market investors that the public found interesting.
In studies on obesity, Dr. Schachter found that people of normal weight ate when they were hungry and stopped when they were full but that overweight people ate because of other cues, like the presence of enticing food, the time of day and other external factors.
Dr. Schachter found that the way food was presented helped determine how much an obese person would eat. "He found that if you put peanuts under a light, fat people would eat them," said Dr. Don Hood, a colleague at Columbia. "If you hid them in a dark corner, they wouldn't walk over to pick them up."
Dr. Schachter also liked to puncture the elaborate theories of others. In the 1970's, he and Dr. Hood challenged the efficient-market hypothesis of economists, which said that the stock market operated independently of the behavior of independent investors. They produced data that ran counter to that theory and showed that the psychology of individuals was affecting the market.
The answer, Dr. Schachter said, was simple. So simple, in fact, that if the economists had asked their grandmothers what was going on, he contended, their grandmothers would have told them to pay attention to the fear and greed of individual investors if they wanted to understand the market. He coined the term "bubba psychology" ("bubba" is "grandmother" in Yiddish) to describe this common-sense approach.
Dr. Schachter's friends and colleagues were sometimes swept up by his experiments.
When he became interested in the metabolic basis of cigarette addiction, Dr. Schachter persuaded friends near his summer home in East Hampton to join a study.
He gave the friends cigarettes with different levels of nicotine but did not tell them which cigarettes they had been given. The friends kept track of their cigarette consumption and other activities and even kept daily urine samples in their refrigerators for graduate students to pick up.
As a result of that study, Dr. Schachter came up with the idea that social interactions can affect the acidity of urine, which affects nicotine retention and, therefore, cigarette consumption -- a metabolic explanation for why smokers smoked more in social gatherings. Dr. Hood said that that idea had been validated since then.
But the experiment was not trouble-free for Dr. Schachter's friends. "It led to problems in some families, with people on the low-nicotine cigarettes going into withdrawal and getting hard to live with," Dr. Hood said. "Husbands and wives were coming to Stanley to say, Will you please give him or her the real cigarettes."
Dr. Schacter's interest in why people become tongue-tied was aroused at a faculty meeting, said Dr. Robert M. Krauss, a psychology professor at Columbia, when he began keeping track of how many times each colleague stumbled for words by saying "um." Soon he had students out recording professors giving lectures in various fields and counting up how many times they cast about for a word. He found that professors lecturing in the humanities were much more prone to do that than those in the sciences, and professors in the social sciences fell in between.
But all professors showed the same tendency to trip over their tongues in interviews on another subject, leading Dr. Schacter to conclude that it was the subject matter, not the kind of person attracted to each field, that accounted for the differences. In the humanities, he said, the number of ways to voice a particular idea are far greater than in the sciences, leading to more indecision.
Dr. Schachter was born in New York City in 1922. He got bachelor's and master's degrees from Yale University in 1942 and 1944, and, after serving in the Air Force, earned his doctorate in social psychology at the University of Michigan in 1949. After teaching at the University of Minnesota, the University of Amsterdam and Stanford University, he joined Columbia's psychology faculty as a professor in 1961. He became the Robert Johnston Niven Professor of Social Psychology there in 1966, and he retired in 1992.
He won many honors, including the James McKeen Cattell Award, the Social Psychological Prize of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and awards from the American Psychological Association and the Society for Experimental Social Psychology. Dr. Schachter was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Science in 1976.
In addition to his wife, Dr. Schachter is survived by a son, Elijah, of New York City.

Prices Slide As Corporate Flood Is Due

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
An expected flood of new corporate debt weighed on Treasury prices yesterday, erasing early gains on increased buying from foreign investors and on a regional report that showed moderate economic growth.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 6/32, to 97 10/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.84 percent, from 6.82 percent on Monday. 
 Treasury prices were helped in early trading by concerns over the prospect of European monetary union, which drew foreign investors seeking a safe haven.
But a number of large corporate debt issues are scheduled to come to market this week and that prompted some investors to sell Treasury securities, especially the 10-year note, as a hedge yesterday, said Greg Jones, an economist at Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif.
The Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae, plans to sell $2.5 billion of securities backed by student loans. The MBNA Corporation plans to sell $500 million of credit card back debt, and the Olympic Financial Corporation plans to issue $775 million of debt backed by auto loans. Some analysts said the abundance of higher-yielding asset-backed debt could lure investors away from Treasury bonds, causing Treasury prices to fall further.
With interest rates low and demand good, several companies priced debt yesterday. The Associates Corporation sold $500 million of three-year notes at a price to yield 6.46 percent, about 18.5 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- more than a comparable Treasury security, through underwriters led by UBS Securities. The A. H. Belo Corporation priced $750 million of debt in three parts through Morgan Stanley & Company, with $250 million of notes due 2002 priced to yield 6.923 percent, or about 47 basis points over a comparable Treasury security; $300 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 7.236 percent, or about 67 basis points over a similar Treasury, and $200 million of 30-year debentures priced to yield 7.754 percent, or 87 basis points over a comparable Treasury.
Waiting in the wings are the Mercantile Bancorporation and the Long Island Savings Bank among others that are planning to sell a total of at least $4 billion of debt this week.
A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond bolstered Treasury prices yesterday. Although the report is only a regional survey, it helped confirm a view that the economy is still growing at a moderate pace.
The Richmond Fed reported declines in its major monthly retail and services indexes, but rising price trends. The service revenue index fell to 26 in May from 33 in April and the retail revenue index fell to 14 from 36. New orders also fell, to 16 from 25 in April.
Though the economy appears to be slowing moderately, the report outlines a tighter labor market and rising price trends, said an economist with the Richmond Fed, Raymond Owens.
Another report, the weekly LJR Redbook retail sales survey, showed signs of a pickup, however. Retail sales rose a surprisingly strong 2.3 percent, according to the survey. "It is the first clean evidence that the slowdown in consumption in April through May could be blamed on the cold weather," said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York.
The next notable economic report comes tomorrow, when the Government releases its report on retail sales for May.

HEADLINE: City Budget Deal Was Not Just Political 'Theater'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"The Next City Budget Debate" (editorial, June 6) remarks that the New York City Council did little to change Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's fiscal plan. 
 You neglect the Council's creation of a $30 million "emerging industry" development fund for job creation, our large expansion of library services, our initiative to begin eliminating double taxation through changes in the unincorporated business tax, and our financial support for alternatives to incarceration -- not to mention a host of other investments long supported by your editorial page.
You also seem surprised that the "let's-party end of City Hall" would adopt a budget "more fiscally responsible" than the one proposed by Mayor Giuliani.
Since the 1989 charter revision, the City Council has been as fiscally responsible as any mayor, if not more so. In addition, the Council's more accurate revenue forecasts led both sides to a budget agreement that included greater tax cuts and new investment in the economy than the Mayor had initially proposed.
You are correct that the adopted budget is a better budget for the city than the one proposed by the Mayor. However, that was the result not of "theater," but of a lot of hard work by both sides.

HEADLINE: TRACK AND FIELD;
Having What It Takes To Perform a Perfect 10

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, June 10

 BODY:
As a kid growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, Chris Huffins wanted to be Julius Erving, not Bruce Jenner. His interest was basketball, not the decathlon. If he was to toss anything, it was to be a jump shot, not a javelin.
When Huffins was 11, his mother moved to Indianapolis, never imagining that her son would eventually become a favorite to win a national decathlon championship in her adopted hometown and that he would one day challenge for the title of world's greatest athlete. 
 "I was looking for blue skies and green grass," Sandra Gay said. "Indianapolis beat a poke in the eye with a sharp stick."
After remaining a year with his grandparents, Huffins followed his mother to the Midwest in 1981. But she kept his athletic endeavors on a short leash. School before sports, Gay told him. She had carried a double major of education and drama at Fordham University, and she had little interest in her son becoming a double-letter winner in basketball and track. Choose one sport, she told him. He chose basketball.
Finally, in Huffins's junior year at Cathedral High in Indianapolis, his mother relented and allowed him to compete in track and field, as well. Eventually, he leaped 23 feet 6 1/2 inches in the long jump, took third in the state meet and reached the state semifinals in the 100-meter dash.
After a short, unhappy stay at Purdue, Huffins transferred to Cal-Berkeley and took up the decathlon. Last year, he ran the fastest 100 meters ever for a decathlete, 10.22 seconds, qualified for the Olympics and finished 10th in the Summer Games in Atlanta.
This week, the national championships have come to Indianapolis, to the very same Indiana University track where Huffins competed in high school. Dan O'Brien, the Olympic champion, has withdrawn because of an injury, which makes Huffins the favorite in the 10-event competition that begins Wednesday. He also believes he can win at the world championships in Athens in August.
"I feel like it's my year," the loquacious, 27-year-old Huffins said of the national championships. "I came with a mission to win."
O'Brien, who withdrew from the nationals with a stress fracture in his right tibia, has said he will likely petition American officials for a wild-card berth in the 1997 world championships. "There should be exemptions for people who deserve them," O'Brien said recently.
The United States is the only country that selects athletes for the Olympics and world championships on the strict basis of a first, second, or third-place finish in the national championships. Huffins said that while he understood O'Brien's argument, he preferred the current selection system over wild-card entries.
"I think it would set a bad precedent," Huffins said. "It's cutthroat, but there's something to be said about earning your way onto the team."
Huffins's own rise to Olympian heights is as improbable as any story in track and field. It seems as unlikely to him as the emergence of a rapper named LL Cool J, whom Huffins used to see entertaining at block parties in Hollis, Queens.
For Huffins, the playgrounds in Brooklyn held the allure of basketball, not the running, jumping and throwing of a decathlon.
"I knew who Bruce Jenner was and I thought he was cool, but I wanted to be Doctor J," he said. "That's pretty much it."
At Cal-Berkeley in 1991, the 6-foot-2-inch, 180-pound Huffins attempted a decathlon on the advice of his coach, Ed Miller, who had been the 1976 collegiate decathlon champion.
A year later, in only his second official decathlon, Huffins competed in the 1992 Olympic trials. By 1995, he had finished eighth in the world championships, shooting up the charts like one of LL Cool J's songs.
In 1996, Huffins qualified for the Olympics, delivering 7 personal bests in the 10 events at the trials: 10.22 seconds at 100 meters; 53-11 in the shot-put; 6-7 1/2 in the high jump; 48.05 seconds at 400 meters; 14.09 seconds in the 110-meter hurdles; 15-9 in the pole vault and 208-9 in the javelin.
His mother, who works in a local bookstore, is proud and amused by her son's achievements. Gay was a high jumper herself at Samuel J. Tilden High in Brooklyn "about 100 years ago." But, admittedly, her passion for the decathlon is not exactly a threat to her passion for poetry and the theater.
"It was interesting to see people pay so much attention to him at the Olympics," she said. "I was thinking, 'This is the same kid who didn't want to take out the garbage or walk the dog.' "
With another 18 inches to his pole vault, 10 seconds off his personal best of 4:51.20 at 1,500 meters, and an improved high jump, Huffins feels he can one day succeed O'Brien as the world record-holder (8,891 points) and approach the 9,000-point barrier that is to decathlon what four minutes was to the mile.
Huffins, the holder of a degree in the political economies of industrial society, is now a consummate student of track and field. He trains up to 60 hours a week, participates in a track-and-field fantasy league and has collected an estimated 200 videotapes, everything from college meets to 60 hours of NBC's ill-fated Triplecast of the 1992 Barcelona Games.
"I want to be the best decathlete that ever lived," Huffins said. "If you take the top 10 in the world, we can play any sport -- basketball, bowling. I've been in some vicious pool games. World's greatest athlete is probably the most glamorous title on the planet. Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey can fight about who's the fastest athlete. That doesn't have any implications for who the greatest all-around athlete is."

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
A Law Firm Takes Years To Find the Right Space

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
When the 112-year-old Atlanta-based law firm of King & Spalding recently signed a lease to move its New York offices to 1185 Avenue of the Americas, a small news article appeared. But behind that report were two years of planning and six months of negotiations, a combination of decision- and deal-making that provides a glimpse into the complex strategies and economic considerations of commercial real estate.
"We've been in New York for seven years," said James H. Wildman, the partner in charge of the 50-lawyer New York office for the 350-lawyer firm. "We started with three lawyers in a building on Fifth Avenue. Then we merged with a small firm that was already in Tower 45, 120 West 45th Street, and moved in." 
 They renegotiated the lease and, as the firm grew, wound up with three full floors, about 33,000 usable square feet. But the firm kept growing.
"About two years ago, we started to look very hard into how to accommodate more growth," Mr. Wildman said. "We looked first at Tower 45, but there was no way to expand on contiguous floors. And for a law firm, being on contiguous floors is very important -- there's a sense of community that you can't achieve otherwise."
So they entered the market. They hired Richard Bernstein of the Edward S. Gordon commercial brokerage company, which is now Insignia/ Edward S. Gordon Company. The goal: to find sufficient space for growth, and to get that space at the right price.
"For a growing law firm in New York, the challenge is having just the right amount of real estate," Mr. Wildman said. "Unlike any other market, it's virtually impossible to acquire options to expand in anticipation of growth. And you don't want too much space so you're overloaded. Occupancy cost is the second-largest expense for a law firm, after attorney compensation, and with clients concerned about billing rates it's very important to keep occupancy costs below a certain level."
Next came the questions of location, of the quality of the building -- and of its owners. He said he knew he could find "great economics" in the Wall Street area, where a high vacancy rate brought about by the recession of the early 90's has kept rental rates much lower than in midtown.
"But most of our clients are in midtown," he said, "and our lawyers' commuting patterns were such that relocating downtown would extend their commute."
He also wanted to be where other law firms are. A decade ago, that would have most probably meant east of Fifth Avenue, but recent years have seen a westward movement by many law firms that includes a large concentration on the Avenue of the Americas.
"We looked on Park Avenue," Mr. Wildman said, "and even east of Park, and were actually fairly close to a Park Avenue deal that didn't work out, but eventually we turned to Sixth Avenue. A number of buildings satisfied us in a general way, but Richard Bernstein took us to 1185, and everything came together."
The 42-story, 1.1 million-square-foot office building between 46th and 47th Streets is run by W & M Properties, the marketing and management arm of the Malkin real estate family; Peter L. Malkin and his son, Anthony E. Malkin, are the general partners of 1185 Avenue of the Americas Associates, which owns the building.
Finding large blocks of contiguous office space in midtown is becoming increasingly difficult, but 1185 had such space left -- its last large bloc -- from the move of Alexander & Alexander Services, an insurance consulting and brokerage company, to 11 Madison Avenue, at 24th Street.
King & Spalding was interested in about 53,000 square feet, the 34th and 35th floors. The negotiations began and lasted about six months.
"With any deal there are bumps in the road," Mr. Wildman said, "but they were resolved as amicably as possible. When you negotiate a deal you're laying the groundwork for a relationship that will extend for a long time. The object is not to squeeze the last cent out of the deal. You want it to work for everyone."
He declined to specify the bumps, but the end result was a 15-year lease valued at about $30 million, reflecting an average annual rent in the upper $30-a-square-foot range. Fred C. Posniak, vice president of W & M Properties, said his company was building the space for the tenant, reflecting a landlord contribution to the deal of more than $2 million, or more than $40 a square foot.
"We could have got superior economics elsewhere," Mr. Wildman said, "but it would not have been for as good quality space, as good location and as good ownership. What you pay in rent is important, but the rent in terms of cost per lawyer is important, too. We hired Gensler & Associates architects, and they laid out the space in all the buildings we looked at.
"And 1185's space was the most efficient. There was a low loss factor. The building is rectangular, nearly square. There's a good depth from the window to the core, which is perfect for a law firm in terms of design, and you get a good lawyer count per square foot. The number of buildings that do not work for a law firm is surprisingly high, and at 1185 you can get in enough lawyers without crowding."
The plan is for King & Spalding to move in by Sept. 1. And it will be moving in to even more space than originally planned. After closing the original deal, the firm decided to take an additional 15,000 square feet, just downstairs on the 33d floor.
"Real estate deals don't often work out this easy -- or this friendly," Mr. Posniak said.

HEADLINE: About New York;
In Yiddish Or English, A Valued Voice

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
ABRAHAM CAHAN, the legendary editor of The Jewish Daily Forward, used to say that his newspaper's job was to teach immigrants who traded shtetls for tenements how to live in America. It steadied their grip on their adopted culture, with stories and advice on such varied things as baseball and schooling for girls. It strengthened their resolve, covering the struggles of the nascent labor movement. It gave them an unvarnished vision of the Golden Land.
"It wasn't averse to talking with its readers about problems with their behavior," said Harold Ostroff, the general manager of the Forward Association, which publishes the paper. "This included not being ashamed about talking about Jewish criminals, Jewish prostitutes and the seedy side of life. Yet it always held out the hope we could overcome that through the educational process and improving the economic life of those unfortunate people who used other means to survive. It was always a teaching experience." 
 Such was their success that the Yiddish paper went from a daily circulation of 250,000 in the 1920's to a weekly readership of 10,000 today. Time and upward mobility have eroded its base of Yiddish speakers. But even in its centennial year, no one is setting type for its obituary. An English version that began publishing in 1990 is aimed at the children of those immigrants who grew up with the old Forward. More recently, the publishers rolled out a Russian-language edition to serve thousands of new immigrants.
RATHER than bemoan past glories, there is a sense at the paper that the changes are in keeping with the tradition of reassuring its readers that they could treasure the best of their heritage while moving, naturally, forward.
"Those ideas are in question in the Jewish community itself," said Sam Norich, who will succeed Mr. Ostroff next year. "We can help maintain what The Forward helped to create, which is an understanding of pluralism as central to American culture. That's a notion that's more and more at risk these days with the resurgence of true-blue Americanism. This country was made by immigrants who figured out -- sometimes with the example of The Forward -- how to maintain respect for where they came from while becoming American."
Founded by Socialists, The Forward was a general-interest newspaper for Yiddish-speaking immigrants who cut, sewed, hawked and hauled. The working man was able to read the day's grittier news and also keep up with the literature of stellar Yiddish writers like Isaac Bashevis Singer. Its coverage of politics and labor gave it a preeminence that later came into play when the paper broke from its Socialist past to endorse Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
"The Forward spoke for the largest single block of Jewish voters in the critical city of New York," said Arthur Hertzberg, a professor at New York University and a contributor to the Yiddish version of The Forward. "It had a major hand in creating the Jewish labor movement's participation in the New Deal coalition. So it has been a shaping influence in New York as a liberal state and on liberalism in America."
Roslyn Bresnick-Perry, who first heard of The Forward as a child in White Russia, recalled how the newspaper reminded her that Jews were capable of greatness, too.
"They really developed in us a sense of pride," said Ms. Bresnick-Perry. "Look who's Jewish: Einstein, Freud, Marx. Even though Eugene Debs isn't Jewish, he likes Jews."
THE paper's supporters say it is still capable of greatness, even if Yiddish is more studied than spoken. There is now talk about making the English Forward a daily newspaper.
Seth Lipsky, who left The Wall Street Journal to edit the English paper, flicked his finger across stories from recent editions, pointing to scoops big and small. He acknowledged that moving away from Yiddish was a break from tradition, but it presented an opportunity to help new generations connect with topics from a Jewish perspective.
Miriam Goldstein grew up with the Yiddish Forward. Such was its influence that her voice cracks and her eyes grow moist at the memory. It reminds her of childhood, not to mention the days when her mother would cover newly mopped floors with old editions of the paper to keep the floor clean on the Sabbath.
"I have a subscription to the English Forward," she said. "I do read Yiddish, but it takes me ten thousand years."
By then, who knows what language the paper will be printed in.

HEADLINE: Sport Utility Vehicles Pose Growing Danger to Car Occupants

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 10

 BODY:
The rising number of sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks on the nation's roads, combined with their increasing weight, poses a growing danger to car occupants and pedestrians, the Transportation Department concluded today in its first study of the issue.
In collisions between cars and light trucks, 80 percent of the fatalities are in the cars, the study found. Even though cars remain twice as common as light trucks, collisions involving cars and light trucks have been killing more Americans than collisions between cars since 1992. 
 "Continued growth in the number and weight of light trucks, unless offset by safety improvements, is likely to increase the hazard in collisions between the trucks and smaller road users," today's study concluded. "A reduction in truck weights is likely to generate significant benefits for pedestrians and car occupants that might exceed the added risk for the occupants of the trucks."
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Transportation Department agency that produced today's study, has already formed a working group to review ways to reduce the death rate in collisions involving vehicles of very different sizes. Philip R. Recht, the agency's deputy administrator, said that today's study would be added to that review, but was not enough by itself to justify regulatory changes.
Today's study only looked at the statistical relationship between weight and collision casualties. The height and rigidity of light truck bodies, which sometimes override protective bars built into car bodies, may also play a role in the death rate, and this also needs to be studied, Mr. Recht said. If the Federal Government decides that regulatory changes are needed, one possibility would be to change the crash safety tests that vehicles must meet before being allowed on the road, he added.
Current crash tests and Federal safety ratings are designed to simulate a vehicle crashing into a similarly shaped vehicle within 500 pounds of its own weight. The tests do not measure how a one-ton compact car would fare in a collision with, for example, a Chevrolet Suburban weighing nearly three tons. But auto safety engineers here say privately that it is nearly impossible to design a small car that will do well in such a wreck.
Officials in the auto industry, which has benefited from strong sales for the biggest mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, quickly pointed out that light truck weights have risen partly because the Government now requires them to carry many of the same safety features as cars, like air bags. Barry Felrice, the director of regulatory affairs at the American Automobile Manufacturers Association in Washington, emphasized the study's finding that reducing the weight of a light truck would provide somewhat less protection for the occupants.
"If you're an occupant of that light truck, you probably wouldn't be happy to put your family at greater risk to reduce the risk to another family," Mr. Felrice said.
The average light truck now outweighs the average new car by half a ton, or 1,000 pounds. Reducing the average light truck weight by 100 pounds would decrease road fatalities by 40 a year, cut serious injuries by 601 a year, but increase less-serious injuries by 1,794 a year.
The reduction in fatalities is not statistically significant. The margin of error for the estimate of 40 deaths is plus or minus 60 deaths with 95 percent confidence, meaning that there is a small chance of an increase in deaths.
Barring Government regulatory changes, light trucks are likely to grow even heavier and more numerous in the coming years, judging by the future models displayed by manufacturers at recent auto shows.
Federal fuel-economy standards have been the main limit on vehicle weights for the last 20 years, because lighter vehicles can go farther on a gallon of gasoline than heavier vehicles of similar design. Auto makers must produce cars that go an average of 27 miles per gallon, while light trucks only need an average fuel economy of 20.7 miles per gallon. So cars have stayed small in recent years while light trucks have become much bigger and heavier.
Detroit auto makers, which produce 86 percent of the nation's light trucks, are preparing to build even more heavy, low-mileage sport utility vehicles. They are beginning to take advantage of a provision in Federal law intended to encourage the building of vehicles that can burn ethanol, a type of alcohol commonly made from corn. The legal provision lowers the fuel-economy standard for cars or light trucks by up to 1.2 miles per gallon for auto makers that produce vehicles that can run on either gasoline or ethanol or a combination of both.
The Chrysler Corporation announced today that it would begin this autumn to produce 180,000 dual-fuel mini-vans a year. The Ford Motor Company announced last week that it would produce 250,000 dual-fuel vehicles by 2001, almost all of them Ranger pickup trucks.
Safety experts have been appalled by the spread of dual-fuel vehicles.
"It'll probably allow them to make even heavier trucks," widening the weight disparity in collisions with cars, said Gerald A. Donaldson, the senior research director at Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety in Washington. "This is awful for safety."
The General Motors Corporation has also been considering whether to introduce a dual-fuel vehicle.
Republicans in Congress have, with the support of the auto industry, attached provisions to the Transportation Department's budget for the last two years barring the agency from further increases in fuel-economy standards for light trucks. The original fuel-economy legislation, which dates to the first oil crisis in 1973-74, called for regulators to steadily increase fuel-economy standards as technology improved. While the Clinton Administration has discussed whether to seek higher fuel-economy standards, it has not actually done so.
Today's study began two years ago partly because Transportation Department officials wanted to know the safety effects if they raised fuel-economy standards and vehicle weights dropped. But the final report omits any discussion of fuel-economy issues.

HEADLINE: New Survey Shows Americans Pessimistic on Race Relations

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
Four days before President Clinton is scheduled to deliver an address on race relations, a new survey shows that a majority of Americans are pessimistic that blacks and whites will ever learn to get along.
The most despairing among those polled by the Gallup Organization were young, college-educated blacks. 
 According to the survey, 55 percent of both blacks and whites, believe that relations between whites and blacks will "always be a problem" in the United States, while 42 percent say that a solution will eventually be found.
As Mr. Clinton was preparing his speech on race relations that will be delivered on Saturday in San Diego, the survey provided fresh evidence of how daunting a task he faces.
In one sharp difference, whites generally opposed and African-Americans supported increased governmental efforts like affirmative action to lift black achievement.
"When he does advocate those types of remedies for problems, he will certainly have agreement from the black American community that that's an appropriate action," said Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, "but he'll be running up against a wall of attitudes of white Americans who are saying we don't see that there are problems currently and we don't believe therefore it is necessary for the Goverment to intervene."
Only 6 percent of whites and 10 percent of blacks rated themselves as prejudiced toward other racial groups, indicating that most feel they do not need Presidential exhortations about tolerance.
Today Mr. Clinton met with a group of black and Hispanic civil rights leaders to discuss racial issues and his coming speech.
To produce its findings, Gallup interviewed 3,036 adults over the age of 17 from Jan. 4 through Feb. 28. To make sure it accurately gauged black attitudes, the poll surveyed 1,269 African-Americans, a far larger proportion of the total number of people surveyed than is usually included in such a poll.
Among the more intriguing findings of the survey was the amount of pessimism among African-Americans. The poll indicated that 76 percent of black college graduates said race relations would always be troublesome for the country, while 56 percent of blacks who have not earned a college degree felt that way. Blacks under 25 years old also felt that race relations would always be a problem while those over 65 were more likely to say things would be worked out.
Conversely, 48 percent of white college graduates voiced such a pessimistic view, while 56 percent of whites without a college degree felt no solution to animus between the races would ever be found.
Gallup researchers said the object of the poll was to measure attitudes among blacks and whites. As a result, Hispanics were not broken out into a separate group and anyone who said he or she was Latino was asked to place himself or herself in a racial grouping instead.

HEADLINE: Joining NATO: Central Europe Sees a Cure-All

SERIES: EXPANDING ALLIANCE: European Voices

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW, June 7

 BODY:
As Krzysztof Bertram rushes through the hectic pace of his daily life, balancing studies in business with work at an insurance company, he has little doubt where his country should be headed.
"For sure Poland has to join NATO," said the crisply dressed Mr. Bertram, 27, as he checked out courses at the Warsaw Polytechnic that might further his career. "The balance of power has changed. The Soviet Union is not around anymore, and I think NATO will be the organization to provide security for the world." 
 Mr. Bertram is enjoying the increased material well-being that has come to Poland as it progresses toward a market economy. Poles want to secure that new prosperity, but their overwhelming support for admission into NATO also suggests their almost reflexive fear of Russia, and a desire to be enveloped in a Western security blanket.
Three Central European countries are lined up for admission in July: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Poland is the most enthusiastic, but for all three, joining NATO is seen as a long-term economic advantage, because it brings them closer to Western Europe. Still, there is nervousness over how the costs of military upgrading will be met, particularly in the Governments of Hungary and the Czech Republic.
The alliance is also considering membership for Romania and Slovenia, where popular sentiment for joining is overwhelming. The United States has shown lukewarm interest in expanding the list of newcomers to five, but with nine of the 16 NATO members in favor of admitting Romania and Slovenia, the possibility is being discussed in Washington.
The leaders of the three likeliest new members -- from the Czech President, Vaclav Havel, and the former Polish President, Lech Walesa, who initially pressed the NATO case with President Clinton, to the Hungarian Prime Minister, Gyula Horn, and the current Polish President, Aleksander Kwasniewski -- have campaigned in the halls of Washington and Brussels to join NATO.
On the home front, too, they have pushed the idea of joining NATO -- though with little explanation of costs or responsibilities -- as a panacea to all kinds of problems, a golden bridge to the West.
One of the most enduring, almost interchangeable, television images in these three nations, the most economically advanced of Central Europe, has been of Presidents and Prime Ministers boarding planes to Western capitals with a wave, and returning days later with the solemn pledge that entry into NATO headquarters is all but certain.
But their nations, often lumped together in the American psyche as former Warsaw pact allies, have their own histories, military traditions and world outlooks.
In Poland, where there is an almost visceral fear of Russia based on more than a century of Russian rule and about 75 years of Soviet Communism, support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been consistently strong; it was at 79 percent five years ago and climbed to 88 percent in March, according to OBOP, a polling firm. Those against joining NATO have not exceeded more than 14 percent and now number 3 percent, OBOP surveys show.
This popular support stems largely from the geographic difficulty of being sandwiched between Germany and Russia, and from serving as a stamping ground for both.
Despite its many setbacks, which include the Nazis' rapid conquest of the country in 1939, Poland's military has always been held in high regard among its citizens, in contrast to the armies in the rest of Central Europe. Today, the Polish military is impoverished and poorly equipped compared with its standing in the Communist era, but the army continues to rank as the most esteemed institution in the country, above state and church.
Most Poles reckon that whatever is good for the army is good for the country. Being in NATO has to be good for the army, goes the argument.
Another ingredient in the Polish zest for NATO, say analysts, is the strong link with the United States. Many Polish families have a relative in the United States, and a pro-American sentiment reinforces the acclaim for NATO.
In contrast to Poland, support in the Czech Republic for NATO ranges from 28 percent to 42 percent, depending on how the question is phrased, according to Zdenek Borkovec, the director for the department for NATO cooperation in the Ministry of Defense. Mr. Borkovec said he discounted a recent poll commissioned by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs that showed a level of support exceeding 50 percent.
"Czechs feel secure," said Mr. Borkovec, as a way of explaining the thinness of support. "They are occupied by private problems. And Czechs are not informed about NATO; they need more information."
Historically, Czechs have held a low opinion of their army, he said, adding, "People say our army never fought for our country." Indeed, a favorite aphorism of the Czechs is that their army has not fought since the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 when the Bohemian Army lost badly. In modern times -- in 1938, when the Germans marched in; in 1948, when the Communists took over; and in 1968, when the Warsaw Pact invaded -- the army stood by.
The prestige of the Czech Army was not helped in March when the Government determined that not one brigade was ready for combat. The ability of the army to "fulfill its tasks continues to decline," the Government said.
In Hungary, eagerness to join NATO is also subdued. Ferenc Petroczki, the Mayor of Nyirbator, which is on the eastern flank of Hungary, not far from where the Russians marched in more than 50 years ago, said his constituents were more interested in jobs than NATO.
"Even with the military base nearby, people don't bother with it," said Mr. Petroczki. "The least of their bothers is which military organization they should belong to." When the Hungarian Defense Minister, Gyorgy Keleti, came to the area recently for a meeting with citizens, NATO was mentioned just once, in passing.
In Hungary, a small country of 10 million people, which once was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, there is some readiness for a kind of Austrian neutrality. There is also concern about the costs of updating the armed forces, and resistance, particularly among older people, to the possibility of another set of foreign troops being stationed on Hungarian soil after 50 years of enduring Soviet bases.
The most recent of many Gallup polls commissioned by the Hungarian Ministry of Defense showed the strongest support for NATO so far. In March, 47 percent of the respondents were in favor of joining, 27 percent were against, and 26 percent indifferent. Most respondents said they felt no particular external threat to their security, said Gyorgy Fischer, project director for Gallup.
"Those who are in favor of NATO often say that as a small country we can't manage our business alone," Mr. Fischer said. They look to NATO in the way a "child does when it cuddles a mother, for no particular reason but to generally feel safer."
In none of the three countries have politicians posed the question of how the population feels about Article 5 of the North Atlantic Charter, which states that an attack on one country in the alliance is considered an attack on all and obliges other members to come to its defense.
Mr. Fischer said this was a little-understood obligation. "Article 5 is not yet a factor in public opinion," he said. "You cross your bridges when you come to them. The first task is to win public opinion in joining NATO."
Romania and Slovenia have their own reasons for wanting membership. With economic survival uppermost in most Romanian minds, fear of national security is not the sole factor. There is a kind of NATO-mania in Romania, with radio and newspapers devoting large amounts of time and space to the topic. NATO membership is seen as emblematic of being accepted in the West, of having grown out of the Communist past.
And in Slovenia, a survey in March indicated that 70 percent of the population of two million favored membership, a move that is interpreted as finally breaking from the past and severing the country's connection with Yugoslavia, of which it once was a part.
From Central Europe's military bases to university campuses, and from parks and pubs, a visitor can hear a variety of opinions on the topic. "It is impossible for Hungary to evolve its own independent foreign policy, so the best is to coordinate our common issues with Europe within NATO," said Zoltan Nemeth, 23, a history instructor at the Kossuth University at Debrecen, Hungary. "And the possibility of Chapter 5 being put into effect is as unlikely as the use of nuclear weapons."
The most enthusiastic supporters seem to sense that joining will not come cheap. For others, the cost seems to outweigh the gain. "The problem is how much we have to pay," said Jan Riha, a 50-year-old horticulturist, as he ate lunch at the U Kloubku, a pub in the village of Lysa nad Labem, 40 miles north of Prague, where the Russians kept a base during the Communist era. "I don't see a very strong reason to join, and why should I pay for it?"
But Mr. Riha had no doubt where his allegiance stood in a test of East versus West. "We're part of the West," he said, suggesting that NATO was not needed to confirm that status.
But in the leafy park outside, Helena Kopecka, 37, a mother of three young children, said she saw NATO as a plus after "too many years allied to the East."
"Freedom was such a joy," she said as she pushed a stroller with her new baby. "It would be good if we could be connected to something. Our army is in bad shape, and we don't have a chance if something happens."

Romario and Ronaldo: Brazil's Thrilling Strikers

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 10

 BODY:
"Ronaldo, Romario." "Romario, Ronaldo." Either way, it rolls off the tongue, and either way, it has become a mantra from Porto Alegre in the south of Brazil to Rio De Janeiro and Belem further north.
Exactly one year before they begin defending their World Cup title in France, the Brazilians again appear to possess the most dangerous striker tandem in international soccer. 
 In the United States in 1994, Bebeto was Romario's sidekick, and even though the team that backed them up was busier defending than channeling the bulk of its energy into encouraging offensive artistry, the two strikers' individual talents were decisive.
Ronaldo, then 17, watched every memorable minute from the bench.
"It was difficult not to play," he said. "But I learned a lot from Romario and Bebeto. They were on top of their games."
Three years later, Bebeto has moved on, Ronaldo has emerged as the sport's biggest star, and Romario, the consensus 1994 world player of the year, has returned to the blue-green-and-yellow fold after a prolonged and well-documented fall from grace.
The English have Alan Shearer, the Germans Jurgen Klinsmann, the Croats Davor Suker and Alen Boksic. But no team currently has the blend of youthful explosiveness and mature guile up front that the 20-year-old Ronaldo Luis Nazario de Lima and the 31-year-old Romario de Souza Faria represent.
In the seven games since Romario returned to the national team after two years of a very public separation and often uninspired play, he and Ronaldo have combined for 11 goals on a team that looks considerably more committed to the attack than in 1994. Romario has scored eight goals, including the game-winner in tonight's 1-0 victory over England in the Tournoi de France, a friendly four-team tournament organized as an aperitif before next summer's 64-course meal: the World Cup finals.
England had already clinched the tournament title with victories over Italy and France. Brazil finished with one victory and two ties, but Romario, his teammates and the venerable coach Mario Zagallo are more interested in what happens next June than this June.
"I am looking for a second world championship, and I am counting very much on Ronaldinho," Romario said recently, using Ronaldo's nickname in Brazil. "You will see. The two of us will finish on top of the scoring tables in 1998."
That would be nothing new for either of these men who share the same home city (Rio de Janeiro), the same modest economic backgrounds and the same ability to go from first to fourth gear in a big hurry. Both have led the Brazilian, Dutch and Spanish leagues in scoring. Like Romario, Ronaldo left Brazil for P.S.V. Eindhoven in the Netherlands; like Romario he was then sold to Spain's high-profile F.C. Barcelona where he promptly became the role model of choice on playgrounds around the world by ramming home spectacular goal after spectacular goal. Like Romario, who left Barcelona in a hurry in December 1994 after two tempestuous seasons, Ronaldo's stay in the Catalan capital looks likely to end quickly.
For the last seven months, he and his many advisers have been involved in an increasingly acrimonious contract dispute with Barca that has had more twists and turns than the Amazon and created nearly countless headlines in Spain. Though it appears that he will ultimately sign with Inter Milan for a world-record transfer fee of about $30 million, appearances have been deceptive in the past.
Romario's future is more uncertain. After two and a half years with the Brazilian club Flamengo, he signed with the Spanish club Valencia last August, but after less than three months in Spain, only four goals and at least twice that many round trips to Rio de Janeiro, Valencia agreed to loan the unhappy striker back to Flamengo after he agreed to take a 50 percent salary cut.
He has played brilliantly ever since. Zagallo welcomed him back to the national team in February. Valencia wants him back in August, as do a number of other European clubs with money to match their desire. The Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella is reportedly mulling making a documentary of his life. But for now, all that looks like a sure bet is that Romario and Ronaldo will be complicating defenders' lives considerably in France next summer.

Rightly or Not, Tax Writers See Deep Pockets in Airlines

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The airline industry, which only a few years ago was in dire financial straits, now has the reverse problem: Many people seem to think it makes too much money.
That was evident this week when the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Bill Archer, proposed increasing the fees and taxes on airlines and their passengers to help offset $135 billion in tax cuts. 
 Others also see the airlines as a convenient source of new Government revenue. Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, has proposed using fuel taxes to subsidize passenger rail service, in effect asking airlines to pay tens of millions of dollars a year to help a competitor. Representative Bill Barrett, Republican of Nebraska, wants to allow states to impose a fee of up to $3 a passenger to subsidize air service to smaller communities. A state legislator in Texas recently proposed a tax of 4 cents a gallon on aviation fuel to help offset a cut in property taxes.
Mr. Archer's proposal, in particular, has unnerved investors, contributing to yesterday's sharp selloff in airline stocks.
While such proposals often remain just that -- proposals -- they nevertheless reflect a growing perception that the airlines and their customers can readily afford the increases. The airline industry, after all, is more stable and financially strong than it has been since it was deregulated in 1978. That new-found prosperity has even prompted sharp debate over whether the industry is charging unfairly high prices to travelers and competing too roughly against some smaller low-fare carriers.
"It's getting to the point where it's cheaper to fly to Europe than from Albany to Buffalo," said Catherine M. Abate, a State Senator who held hearings yesterday on the cost of air travel within New York. "It's getting worse."
The airlines counter that it is the degree to which they are singled out for taxes that is getting worse. In part because of problems of their own making, United States airlines have a terrible financial record, losing some $13 billion from 1990 to 1994, and consistently trailing the average profit margin of corporate America. Last year was the strongest performance by the industry since 1978; still, it earned only $2.8 billion on $100 billion in revenue.
Only four years ago, a Presidential commission formed to study the financial ills of the industry concluded that the airlines bore a disproportionate tax burden. Representative Archer did not agree with that finding, said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee. "Every transportation sector in the economy points at somebody else, stating, 'They should pay, not us,' " he said. "Our provisions are fair and they are equitable."
The airline industry disagrees. "The Government is trying to pick the airlines' pockets," Carol B. Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group, said in a recent interview. "We're not the cash cows, and our passengers won't pay inflated prices for air service."
To a degree, the industry is right. Several studies have shown that for every 1 percent increase in the price of air travel, there is a corresponding percentage decrease in the number of people who fly.
Such thinking is also behind the Federal Aviation Administration's position that it will not require parents to buy a seat for babies. The agency calculated that the higher cost of air travel for families with young children would force more of them to take to the highways, where statistics suggest they are more likely to be killed than in a plane crash.
But Mr. Archer's proposal is likely to add to the travel costs of passengers, even though some of the fees and taxes would probably be absorbed by the airlines, cutting into their profits. Mr. Archer would revamp the existing tax on airline tickets, which was to have expired at the end of the year, lowering it to 7.5 percent from 10 percent but imposing new fees on new flight segments. In addition, it would raise fees on round-trip international flights to $20 a person from the current $6.
The airlines have calculated that Mr. Archer's proposal will cost the industry and its passengers an additional $4 billion to $4.5 billion over the next five years.
Concerns about this proposal, as well as projections of weaker passenger traffic and airline earnings, depressed airline stocks yesterday, even as much of the stock market was rising to record highs. For example, shares of the AMR Corporation, the parent of American, fell $4.625, to $94.50, and shares of Delta Air Lines dropped $3.75, to $88.
There are many reasons the airlines, for all their protests about thin profits and an unfair tax burden, are being viewed as an easy target. For one, air fares, particularly for travel on short notice, are hovering at record highs. With round-trip fares exceeding $1,500 for many last-minute flights within the United States, it is hard for many travelers not to think that the industry is making extraordinary profits on tickets, particularly when advance-purchase fares on the same flight sell at a fraction of the cost of the full fare.
In many ways, airline passengers are also a largely faceless group, without a powerful lobbying group to rise up against any increased taxes that would be shared by both the industry and travelers.
The largest airlines have also been facing criticism about the way they have made life difficult for smaller carriers.
Several smaller airlines have complained to the Transportation Department and the Justice Department about what they say is predatory behavior by the major airlines.
Although the details change from case to case, their complaints follow the same pattern. The smaller carriers say that when they start service on a route, offering competition to a major carrier, the bigger airline retaliates by flooding the route with more flights and matching, even undercutting, the low fares offered by the smaller carrier.
Given the advantages held by a major airline, like popular frequent- flier programs, the smaller carrier finds itself with too few passengers to justify the service, and often pulls out. With no more competition, the fares often rebound to their previous levels.
Officials at the Transportation Department appear sympathetic. Charles A. Hunnicutt, Assistant Secretary for Aviation, said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing that the agency was increasingly concerned about the "overly aggressive exclusionary behavior of major airlines toward new entrants."
At a minimum, the department has said it will start to publicize average fares in big cities -- similar to its publicizing of statistics on complaints, lost bags and on-time performance -- with the hope that the airlines will feel some public pressure to put a lid on fares.
But many people who have studied the airlines say that for all the pressure from consumers, government agencies and legislators, the industry may need high fares to restore long-battered balance sheets.
"They are not out of the woods yet," said Gerald Baliles, a former Governor of Virgia who led the Presidential commission on the industry in 1993. "Even the healthiest airlines have high debt-to-equity ratios that would make most companies in other industries shudder"

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo;
Cutting Taxes a Luxury Now With Consequences Deferred

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
For all the anguish they say they went through to get an agreement to balance the budget within five years, what members of Congress are really doing now is what they enjoy most: cutting taxes and increasing spending.
This is the first time in 15 years that they have allowed themselves this luxury. Ever since economists and politicians discovered in 1982 that the tax cuts enacted the year before would lead to an explosion in the budget deficit, the main item of business in Congress has been to decide who would pay higher taxes and who would be pinched by the belt-tightening needed to bring the deficit under control. 
 But next year, if the budget agreement is followed, the deficit will actually rise -- to $90 billion from $67 billion this year, according to the estimates made by the Congressional Budget Office. The deficit is not scheduled to fall below this year's level until 2001.
The House Ways and Means Committee will take the first step on Wednesday toward parceling out tax reductions to families and investors. Many of the new tax breaks under consideration, including a lower capital gains tax rate, are being structured so that the revenue loss will be small in the next few years but will mushroom in the next century -- when some future Congress can worry about the problem.
In addition, a spending freeze in effect since 1990, under Democratic and Republican Presidents and Democratic and Republican Congresses, has been lifted, and additional money will be approved this year for popular education and health programs.
True, the lawmakers have begun writing legislation this week that would pare $115 billion from what would otherwise be spent on Medicare in the next five years. But except for an increase in premiums of less than $10 per month, the savings would not come from retirees, who are the main beneficiaries of the program. In fact, retirees would get new coverage for mammograms, Pap smears and screenings for prostate and colon cancer.
The savings in Medicare would be extracted from doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and other providers of medical care. Their lobbyists will complain, of course, but they may get less of a hearing than they usually do. Studies show that in the main, the Federal Government is paying more for the providers' services under Medicare than the providers are getting from patients who have private insurance coverage.
Many experts in budget policy defend this year's agreement as better than nothing. "This is not the deal we wanted," said Martha Phillips, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that lobbies for a balanced budget. "But it is absolutely better than no deal at all, and there's very little chance of replacing it with anything better."
White House officials brag, with some justification, that under President Clinton, the deficit has been cut by more than 75 percent, from $290 billion in 1992. There is no reason to believe, they say, that the final decisions will not be made to wipe out the deficit completely -- in 2001 and 2002, when Mr. Clinton is no longer in the White House.
But other budget specialists are skeptical. Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, put it this way: "This was an agreement between the 105th Congress and President Clinton to have the 107th Congress and -- who? President Gore? -- engage in fiscal restraint. One has reason to doubt that the political system will deliver in 2002 on a promise made in 1997."
This is Mr. Reischauer's point: The politicians can always renege on their promise to cut spending in 2001 and 2002. They have carefully avoided suggesting which Government programs they intend to take the hit, and they probably have not thought much about it.
Furthermore, if effects of the Medicare savings turn out to be more severe than expected, and retirees begin experiencing reduced medical services, it is a safe bet that the lawmakers will leap in and fix the problem.
But once a tax break is on the books, it is almost impossible to get it removed.
The President and Congress agreed that the net tax cuts would be no more than $85 billion in the next 5 years and no more than $250 billion in the next 10 years. But the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research institute whose budget projections have often been reliable, has calculated that in the following 10 years, from 2008 through 2017, the revenue loss could exceed $650 billion.
It is impossible to make such calculations with any precision. But there is little doubt, Mr. Reischauer said, that the cost of the tax breaks would "continue to grow at a rapid rate in the future and could cause serious hemorrhaging just at the time when the nation is trying to cope with the huge fiscal problem of the baby boom retirement."
One of the most expensive of these tax breaks in the early years of the next century would be the reduction in the rate of tax on capital gains, which are the profits from the sale of investments.
The Republican tax plan, offered this week by Representative Bill Archer of Texas, Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is written in such a way that the eventual cost of this tax cut is concealed. Taxpayers would be induced to sell stock and pay the capital gains tax in the early years after the lower rate was in effect. As a result, this part of the tax cut would actually lead to a $3 billion increase in revenue in the first five years, the Congressional tax staff estimates.
But in the next five years, the revenue loss from the capital gains break would be $38 billion, and it would be even steeper in the years that followed.
Similarly, the new rules on individual retirement accounts would cost only $33 million in lost revenue in the first five years but $13 billion in the next five.
But such long-term imbalances seem to be of little matter to the senators and representatives nowadays as they crack the tax and spending pinata, many for the first time in their political careers.
The consequences can always be dealt with manana.

HEADLINE: In Rockaways, a Plan Draws Mixed Reviews

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
George Williams was washing his 1985 Oldsmobile yesterday morning on an abandoned road in the Arverne area of the Rockaways, Queens, his back to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by blown-out tires and jettisoned car parts. Mr. Williams, 53, a letter carrier, moved to the area 30 years ago and remembered Arverne before the bulldozers cleared it of 4,000 bungalows in the late 1960's, leaving only rubble and the distinction of being one of the nation's most notorious examples of failed urban renewal.
And yet, a day after a tantalizing plan was unveiled to build a $1 billion entertainment, sports and hotel complex there, Mr. Williams was hesitant. Should public funds be used to pay for new roads leading to an entertainment center in one of the poorest corners of Queens? he asked. Or should the city instead be encouraging the construction of decent housing in an area where many live in towering housing projects? 
 "Anyway, we might not even get to that," Mr. Williams said. "We've seen a lot of plans come and go over the years. I'll believe it when I see it."
Like Mr. Williams, many residents of the Rockaways sounded skeptical yesterday about the most recent plan to redevelop Arverne, though many could not help feeling a twinge of excitement that maybe, just maybe, this plan would move beyond architectural blueprints. It was perhaps no surprise that the level of skepticism seemed commensurate with how long the people had lived in the area, and how many times they had been disappointed by past plans.
"It's a great idea," said Joshua Rodriguez, 19, whose family moved to Arverne eight years ago. "I'll be the first one to apply for a job."
On Monday, the Queens Borough President's office announced that a Canadian company proposed to build a complex that would include a hotel, convention center, movie theaters, an indoor ski slope and a whitewater rafting facility. The company, Heathmount Arts and Entertainment Corporation, is headed by two members of the Reichmann family of Toronto, whose vast real estate empire, Olympia & York, collapsed in the early 1990's. A company spokesman said that the Reichmanns wanted to complete the project in 2002, creating more than 10,500 permanent jobs.
Yesterday, on the beach season's first hot day, seagulls circled over the vast wasteland of the Arverne urban renewal area, looking for scraps amid the bald dirt patches and weeds. The elevated A train rattled along the northern boundary of the area, which stretches about two miles from Beach 32d Street to Beach 73d Street. A young couple rose from a grassy area, where they had been hidden, as the man put on his shirt.
Arverne, like other neighborhoods on the Rockaway peninsula, was once dotted with bungalows that working-class families rented for the summer. But after World War II, as the vacationers went elsewhere, bungalows were converted to fulltime residences and occupied by the poor, who also were moved into several housing projects the city erected on the peninsula. Mayor John V. Lindsay razed Arverne in 1968, but his urban renewal project went nowhere, in part because of the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's.
Even though a developer recently won the city's approval to build 161 nonsubsidized houses on 15 acres of the urban renewal area's 307 acres of city-owned land, the area's social and economic problems have also been an obstacle to the construction of private homes. According to the 1990 Census, Arverne had a median household income of $22,701, compared with $34,186 for the whole of Queens.
In the early 1990's, Oceanview Associates of Manhattan, a partnership led by Forest City Ratner Companies, proposed a $1.5 billion complex of 7,500 apartments, stores and movie theaters. But the project was abandoned because of the souring real estate market and an agreement whereby the developers were to pay for about $300 million in new roads and sewers needed in the urban renewal area.
Neither Heathmount nor city officials estimated the cost of the infrastructure improvements the Reichmanns' project would require. But the costs, which the city and state would have to pay, are expected to be enormous.
"If the cost was $300 million eight years ago," said Jonathan L. Gaska, the manager of the local community board, "it's at least half a billion, if not $700 million now, which is a really big amount."
Mr. Gaska added: "But it's the board's contention that the Government owes us because for the last 30 years, they've done nothing but give us the problems of the city and state. We have loads of adult and nursing homes."
But like Mr. Gaska, Louis Caucig, president of the Rockaway Chamber of Commerce, said the peninsula's small businesses were excited by the new plan.
"There's always skepticism," Mr. Caucig said. "But we're pretty ecstatic about it. We needed a shot of adrenalin in the arms, and this might be it."

HEADLINE: A Prophecy Both False and Successful

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
The report was a dramatic call to arms that shaped the nation's view of its schools like few documents in history.
"A Nation at Risk" warned in 1983 that the nation's educational system was an escalating disaster that amounted to "an act of unthinking, unilateral educational disarmament imperiling the nation's economic health." 
 Now, as if tagging along on the good-news trends of lower crime, more jobs and low inflation, comes the Third International Mathematics and Science Study showing the nation's fourth graders near the top of achievement in science and above average in mathematics compared with their peers in 26 countries.
So, was "A Nation at Risk" wildly overblown? Have the schools improved so much since then? Or are these most recent findings less than meet the eye?
It's a bit of all three.
The latest math and science findings are undoubtedly positive news. Fourth graders in only one country, South Korea, score statistically higher than American fourth graders in science. Five countries are similar to the United States and 19 below it. In mathematics, 7 countries score above the United States, 6 countries are similar, and 12 are below.
While the findings are striking in a population accustomed to thinking the worst of its schools, they are consistent with generally positive trends in many test scores and a 1992 international reading comparison that found American fourth graders second only to those in Finland.
Those skeptical about the conclusion of "A Nation at Risk" say the remarkably robust economy now does not bear out the warning that schools in the 1970's and 1980's were so bad that they were turning out barely educated dolts who were putting the nation's economic future in jeopardy.
Most experts now regard "A Nation at Risk" as brilliant propaganda: it almost singlehandedly saved the United States Education Department from a Congressional plan to scuttle it. And it is seen as an effective call to action at a time of lagging achievement. But it is also seen as incendiary rhetoric that outstripped the reality of educational decline.
"There's no question the sense of doom was overdone, but a wake-up call was necessary, so I don't fault the report," said Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, an independent research and advocacy organization. "But what bothers me is that we still have people getting up and saying the schools have gone to hell, we've got to so something. Well, we are doing something. We've done a lot."
Most experts agree that current fourth-grade scores reflect the educational progress over the past few years. They note that voluntary national standards were agreed upon for math and science well ahead of those for other disciplines.
Many of the math and science recommendations are now in place in elementary schools, a sharp contrast to the American history and English standards, where reaching a consensus on what should be taught, and how, took longer. As a result, experts say it is likely that at least some of the gap between the good fourth-grade performance and a largely mediocre performance by eighth graders reflects better preparation of the younger pupils.
To some, the real story of the test is not what it shows about how well fourth graders do, but how poorly eighth graders do. Experts say they are extremely doubtful that the third part of the study, the analysis of 12-grade performance due out next spring, will match the good news of the recent test.
"The fourth-grade results show us that our children didn't start out behind all these other countries, but actually we fall behind them along the way," said William Schmidt, an education professor at Michigan State University and executive director of Third International Math and Science Study's national research center, at Boston College.
Still, Dr. Schmidt and others say that the most positive element of the research is not the results but the way its rigorous attention to teaching practices and curriculum in industrialized countries provides international benchmarks. For instance, he said, the fourth-grade math and science curriculum in the United States is much more advanced and challenging compared with those in the rest of the world than is the eighth-grade curriculum.
The research also highlights the complexities of teaching, curriculum and cultural factors that go into addressing the problems. Many say the kind of data that the study is producing is an argument for the kind of regular national tests being advocated by President Clinton.
To some, the whole process of international comparisons, and the resulting alarms about the state of schools, miss the main point of the United States' radically decentralized education system: that it includes both many of the best and many of the worst schools in the world and that they vary to a degree that schools in South Korea, Singapore or Japan do not.
Still, even those skeptical of its tone say "A Nation at Risk" did set the country on the road to a sustained level of concern about education unusual in the nation's history, even if its end result remains very much in doubt.
"We've had periods of concern, like after Sputnik in the 1950's, but this may be the most sustained discussion we've had about education across the board in the nation's history," said acting Deputy Education Secretary Michael Smith. "That's the kind of commitment you need to really make progress."

HEADLINE: Clinton Rejects G.O.P. Tax Cuts as Unfair to Middle Class

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10

 BODY:
President Clinton today rejected the Republican blueprint for apportioning proposed Federal tax cuts, saying it would shortchange the middle class and violate the terms of the balanced budget package agreed to by both parties last month.
The Republican plan "does not meet the standards of fairness to families and promotion of education," Mr. Clinton said. "Nor do I believe it is consistent with the budget agreement." 
 One day after the chief Republican tax writer laid out his proposal to reduce taxes for families, investors and many corporations, Democrats in the House today drafted a plan that was intended less as a serious alternative than as a vehicle for highlighting the Democrats' desire to direct more of the reductions to lower- and middle-income people.
The maneuvering came as Democrats and Republicans prepared for several weeks of give and take over both broad ideological approaches to tax cutting and the nitty-gritty legislative details that determine winners and losers. The process will formally begin on Wednesday, when the House Ways and Means Committee takes up the proposal unveiled on Monday by Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is the committee's chairman.
Watched and prodded by lobbyists, lawmakers will try to come up with a compromise that will give the Republicans who control Congress much of what they want but will be acceptable to Mr. Clinton, who must sign it if it is to be enacted without a veto override.
Mr. Archer is facing a torrent of criticism from Democrats who say his plan would be unfair to many moderate-income families, particularly because it would deny some families with low tax bills the full benefit of credits that higher-income families would enjoy. He defended his plan as the best way to deliver tax relief to the middle class.
"To protect middle-income taxpayers," Mr. Archer said, "I will strongly oppose any effort to take money away from the taxpaying public, notably parents with teen-age children, so people who pay no taxes can receive a government check."
Mr. Archer said that of the $116.4 billion in tax cuts his bill would grant to individuals in the plan's first five years, $83.5 billion, or nearly 72 percent, would go to people with incomes between $20,000 and $75,000.
Mr. Archer did not release figures for the second five years of the plan, when wealthier people would reap most of the benefits of his proposed reduction in taxes on capital gains from the sale of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets.
Mr. Archer's plan would cut the top rate on capital gains for most individuals with such income to 20 percent from 28 percent, and, starting in 2001, would allow investors to factor out the effects of inflation in calculating gains on assets held more than three years. The plan would also grant tax credits of up to $500 per child for many families, provide a scaled-back version of Mr. Clinton's proposed breaks for college expenses, expand the Individual Retirement Account program and provide other tax reductions.
After getting more details of Mr. Archer's plan today, Democrats and some liberal research organizations said the Republican proposal relied on gimmicks to hold down the cost of its tax cuts in the early years. They said that its costs would accelerate sharply in the second five years and that the Republican plan could ultimately send the budget deficit sharply higher again.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group, calculated that the Republican package, which values the tax cuts at $250 billion over the first 10 years, would cost as much as $750 billion in the second decade.
The group's analysis said, "This is the period when the baby boom generation begins to retire and deficits are forecast to rise to alarming levels that will damage the economy unless unprecedented austerity measures are instituted."
Despite the back-and-forth partisan criticism today, both Administration officials and Republican leaders said they believed that compromises could be worked out, especially when the Senate Finance Committee took up its tax bill next week.
"We'll work with the Administration," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader.
White House officials said they would not support any single alternative to Mr. Archer's bill but would back individual proposals emerging from both House and Senate Democrats and perhaps from the Republican bill in the Senate. Administration officials said they were particularly intent on restoring more of Mr. Clinton's college-tuition tax breaks.
Mr. Clinton met today with the Democratic leader in the House, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and with Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, his party's ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, plans to introduce an alternative tax-cut bill in the committee on Wednesday.
Mr. Rangel's plan, which will get no more than a cursory hearing from the Republican majority, would have a far more limited capital-gains tax cut than Mr. Archer's bill, a bigger package of education incentives and breaks, and a per-child credit program of roughly the same size as the Republican bill but with more generous provisions for low- and moderate-income taxpayers.

HEADLINE: For Poorest Indians, Casinos Aren't Enough

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: PINE RIDGE, S.D.

 BODY:
The image of the Indian gambling casino as money machine evaporates among the destitute Oglala Sioux of the Pine Ridge Reservation. The casino here consists of three double-wide trailers stuck together on cinder blocks in a rutted lot with two rusty oil drums outside for trash.
The Oglalas earn $1 million a year from gambling, about what the Pequot tribe in Connecticut earns in half a day at Foxwoods, which is considered the nation's most profitable casino. The Oglalas tried to build a bigger, permanent casino, but construction stopped in December with just the foundation laid because the contractor wanted more money. The dispute could take years to resolve, and fissures have formed in the foundation's concrete walls. 
 This two-million-acre reservation is a pit of fissured dreams. It is the site of the Wounded Knee massacre, where the Army killed some 200 braves, women and children in 1890, and was the home of the Oglala band of Red Cloud and Crazy Horse.
It is as poor as America gets.
"It's very bleak," said John Yellow Bird Steele, 51, president of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council.
In recent years, with casinos going up on one reservation after another, many Americans have come to believe that Indian reservations are boom towns. Indeed, with Indian casinos bringing in about $6 billion last year, compared with $100 million in 1988, a few tribes are doing well.
A visit to Pine Ridge is a striking reminder that most reservations remain places of bone-crushing poverty. And things are likely to get worse as the Government cuts some of the welfare payments that are crucial to their economies.
At least half of the 1.3 million American Indians who live on reservations are poor, the Bureau of Indian Affairs says, and 49 percent of the reservations' labor force is unemployed -- 10 times the national unemployment rate. The sickest economy is in Pine Ridge, the second-largest reservation, after the Navajo reservation in the Southwest.
Here, just 1 in 4 adults has a job. People subsist almost entirely on Federal, state and tribal government checks: paychecks and welfare checks, retirement and disability checks. Now welfare and housing aid is being cut.
The casino, for all its travails, sets the standard for success. Alone among the businesses sponsored by the tribe, it makes a little money.
Nature has wrought a topographical masterpiece here, with expanses of butte-broken prairie and the Badlands' sinister white spires and menacing cliffs. But this immense terrain yields no oil or gas, coal or gold, crops or lumber.
Its one readily exploitable natural resource is grass. The Bureau of Indian Affairs says 20,205 cattle, 753 bison and about 5,000 horses are grazing reservation lands. But that business, too, has stalled. Cattle prices have dropped to 60 cents a pound, compared with 90 cents four years ago.
About 25,000 people -- no one has a reliable count -- live on the reservation in shacks, trailers and small, shoebox-like ranch houses subsidized by the Government, the lots of many cluttered with the hulks of dead cars. No car here usually means no job because of the vast distances between home and work.
Five years ago, Mr. Steele aspired to build three casinos with adjoining motels and restaurants. But that idea has faltered, as have all other missions to rescue the economy -- a ranch, a moccasin factory and a beef-packing plant. The prospects for yet another venture, a herd of choice cows to produce beef for Pequot casino restaurants, dimmed in May when the council suspended from his post as treasurer the man who had conceived it.
The Census Bureau found eight years ago that Shannon County, S.D., which includes most of the reservation, was the poorest of the nation's 3,143 counties. Using different criteria in its latest survey, done four years ago, the bureau said Shannon County was the fourth-poorest.
"It's like living at the bottom of a well," said Milo Yellow Hair, vice president of the tribe. "The great white father looks down and says, 'Here's a few dollars.' "
Now those dollars are dwindling. One new blow is the demise of the old welfare system. Wilbur Campbell, manager of the local office of the South Dakota Department of Social Services, said that through April, 128 of the 896 reservation mothers on welfare had lost a portion of their cash assistance because they had not gone to work. For a mother with one child, he said, that meant the check was cut to $78 a month, from $250.
Another group of welfare recipients could begin losing out soon. The Bureau of Indian Affairs allots $38 a month in general assistance to the poor who do not qualify for family assistance. Robert D. Ecoffey, superintendent of the bureau's Pine Ridge agency, said that in the last couple of years, Congress had chopped his general-assistance budget to $714,000, from $1.7 million. He has not cut anyone off yet, he said, because he has been scrounging up the money from other accounts.
Housing, primitive as it is, is also being squeezed. Paul Iron Cloud, director of the tribe's housing authority, said Federal money for home renovation had been cut by 20 percent last year. The wait for Government-subsidized homes, about the only kind built here, stretches for four to five years.
Families double and triple up; Mr. Steele has 4 adults and 18 children in his house. Now, Mr. Iron Cloud said, changes in Federal policy could freeze out the the poorest families, who pay no rent and get free utilities.
Poverty is taking an ever-bigger toll on health. Pine Ridge's infant mortality rate is almost three times the national average. Alcoholism, the scourge of indigent Indians, is as entrenched as ever. Doctors say that for the first time, they are spotting adult-onset diabetes, which usually strikes people past 40, in much younger patients.
"I just saw a 12-year-old who has it," said Dr. David Mulder, the reservation hospital's chief of staff. Young people were not getting that five years ago, Dr. Mulder said.
"That's really frightening -- they're already insulin-resistant," he said.
Mr. Yellow Hair explained: "A six-pack of soda costs less than a gallon of milk. So mothers get the soda and put it in their babies' bottles and shake it up to get the fizz out. It starts there."
Kibbe Conti, the hospital's nutritionist, said that for these Northern Plains Indians, who have a genetic predisposition for diabetes, "pop is poison."
The blame for these conditions goes all around. The roots of the troubles lie in political pandering among tribal leaders, who must run for election every two years, and in corruption, the 19th-century treaties that shunted the Oglalas off richer lands, the cuts in state and Federal support, and discrimination.
In early May, the Justice Department penalized the nearby First National Bank of Gordon, Neb., for charging the Pine Ridge Sioux interest rates that were five percentage points higher than the rate paid by white customers off the reservation.
But the Indians also blame themselves for their problems.
Baptiste Poirier, 45, is an anomaly here. A tribe member and, like his wife, Pat, 39, a recovering alcoholic, he owns Big Bat's, a bustling convenience store, restaurant and Texaco gasoline station at the four-way stop in the center of the village of Pine Ridge.
Mr. Poirier and his family also own a propane distribution business, a small, 150-head herd of cattle and, over the Nebraska line in Chadron, another convenience store. The Poiriers and their two sons, both students at an Indian college, live in a 16-by-55-foot trailer with a single concession to conspicuous consumption, a hot tub.
"It's so hard to do business here," he said. "For every one Indian trying to get ahead, there's 20 trying to pull him down."
In the nine years since he opened Big Bat's, Mr. Poirier said, last year was his worst. The store lost money. "You know what it was over?" he asked. "Employee theft. Merchandise and cash." Nationally, stores lose about 3 percent to employee theft, he said. "For me, it was well over 10 percent," he said.
Scarce as jobs are here, Mr. Poirier said his employee turnover rate was 50 percent a year; a typical worker stays only six months. "Most of it is alcohol-related," he said. "There's so much hopelessness. They get drunk. They don't show up for work. I've got to let them go.
"We don't have a business class, a middle class," Mr. Poirier said. "We have a political class. It's a welfare government. When you've got political people in charge, they're going to take care of the voters."
The tribe is the biggest employer, through services and business ventures. Among the ventures that have not panned out is the tribe's own ranching operation, Farm and Ranch Enterprise, which once received a Federal development grant of $5.5 million. "That money was lost," Mr. Yellow Hair said.
The ranch, with a herd of only 340 cattle, has little water, so the tribe installed a windmill-powered water pump. "But they put the windmill in a gulley, a place where there's no wind," said Melvin Lee Houston, an Oglala official.
The farm survives on a $100,000 annual tribal subsidy.
The three-year-old casino is off to a happier start. Its $1 million in profits, although only $38 per capita and far from enough to offset the decline in the Government's aid, is distributed across the reservation, mostly to the elderly.
It has also created jobs, including 129 for residents of the reservation. Thirty-four-year-old Amy Rodriquez, a pit boss who oversees the casino's four blackjack tables, earns $10.92 an hour, a very high wage around here. "I'm doing a lot better," she said. "I have a steady job. I have a car now."
But the tribe's great expectations for casino gambling, like those of many tribes, are withering.
Here, one obstacle is the construction dispute. A bigger obstacle is the reservation's isolation. The nearest sizeable source of customers is Rapid City, S.D., 80 miles to the north. "The reality is," Mr. Yellow Hair said, "there is no population."
For a short time recently, the reservation's hopes shifted to a newer enterprise.
The tribe's treasurer, Chuck Jacobs, 41, proposed buying a herd of cattle that were not only free of growth hormones and other additives but also had an impressive genetic record of yielding choice beef. He would lease the bulls to reservation ranchers and, bypassing most middlemen, sell the beef to the Pequots and other wealthy tribes for their restaurants.
A former all-Indian rodeo champion, Mr. Jacobs has a degree in regional planning from the University of Massachusetts and was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship 10 years ago for analyses of reservation economies.
Mr. Jacobs prepared an inch-thick plan including reams of correspondence showing the support of potential customers. In a close vote last December, the tribal council authorized Mr. Jacobs to proceed. He bought a foundation herd of 70 cows and 17 bulls for $187,000.
Today, the cattle are grazing at the Farm and Ranch Enterprise site, but what will become of them is unclear. Some tribal leaders, alarmed at the cost and the realization that the cattle would not be yielding much beef for some years, now deride the purchase as the "golden cows."
The tribal council voted 8 to 8 earlier this month to suspend Mr. Jacobs. Mr. Steele, who defeated Mr. Jacobs among other candidates in the race for the presidency last year, broke the tie by voting against him.
"People have a lot of questions about the viability of the whole project," Mr. Steele said. Mr. Ecoffey, of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, said, "He was the kind of guy we need to be leaning on."

HEADLINE: THE RENT BATTLE: THE REACTION;
RENT REGULATIONS FIRMLY SUPPORTED IN NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
With the tenacity of a New Yorker refusing to surrender a hard-won parking spot, city residents by an overwhelming margin support regulations that keep rents below what the market will bear, and therefore do not want state rent ceilings to expire on Sunday, according to the latest New York Times poll.
At least 70 percent of those polled by The Times -- including homeowners and tenants -- said rent regulations were necessary to provide affordable housing and to prevent rents from soaring. 
 That does not necessarily mean, however, that the public is unwilling to consider substantial changes in the laws. Opinions were closely divided, in fact, when residents were asked about some of the proposals being debated in Albany for replacing the current laws. For instance, nearly half voiced support for lifting the ceilings when apartments become vacant, a proposal, known as vacancy decontrol, recently made by Gov. George E. Pataki.
Nonetheless, virtually every cross section of the city -- homeowners, tenants, Republicans, Democrats -- clings to the concept of rent protections as if they were some kind of natural law in New York. Nearly 80 percent, an extraordinary majority for any question in New York City, said they did not want the laws to expire, as the state's top political opponent of rent regulations predicted yesterday would happen on Sunday.
Despite the support that seems to exist for the Governor's vacancy decontrol plan, he appears to be bearing the brunt of the public anger over the rent debate. According to the poll, Mr. Pataki's approval rating has plummeted 10 percentage points in just three months, to 31 percent, an enormous drop for someone whose popularity in the city had been growing. Although there could be other reasons for the change, there have been no other issues in the last three months that would seem to explain it.
Asked which politician or group of people they will hold most responsible if the rent laws expire, 31 percent of those polled cited Mr. Pataki, the largest number for any public official. Only 10 percent cited the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who began the current turmoil with his call for the end of rent regulation, and 9 percent named Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who supports the rent laws. And while Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato has shown he can exercise great political influence in Albany, he was blamed by only 1 percent of those polled.
An unrelated statewide poll, released yesterday by John Zogby, a Utica pollster, found that Mr. Pataki's job approval rating had declined only three percentage points since March, a statstically insignificant shift, indicating that the rent issue has far less impact upstate.
The Times poll, conducted by telephone between June 5 and 8, surveyed 913 adult New York City residents on their attitudes on rent laws, achieving a mix of homeowners and renters in rough proportion to their numbers in the city. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The poll's findings demonstrate many of the inconsistencies that can arise in public opinion on a complex, politically charged issue. For instance, residents were evenly split on the vacancy decontrol plan, which would lift rent ceilings when a tenant moved out or died, effectively phasing out controls over a long period of time. At the same time, two-thirds of the people polled said that "a lot" of landlords would unscrupulously try to pressure tenants to move out if vacancy control is approved -- the usual argument against the idea.
Democrats and tenant advocates, in other words, may have succeeded in their political efforts to focus public discontent on the Governor and on landlords, but they seem to have been less convincing in branding vacancy decontrol the equivalent to an end to all rent protections.
Zenia Mucha, the Governor's communications director, said Mr. Pataki's drop in the poll was the result of a "multimillion-dollar campaign to terrorize tenants" waged by tenant advocates and Democrats for political purposes. That 69 percent of city residents do not blame the Governor, she said, shows that the majority of the city supports his plan.
But one theme remains quite clear throughout: the virtual citywide consensus on rent protections shows how thoroughly the laws have been woven into the city's fabric. Like the subways or the water system, rent controls for many people seem a fundamental entitlement of city life. In follow-up interviews, many residents polled in the survey said they could not imagine life in the city being the same without the laws.
"The reason we have all this diversity in the city, with all the different ethnic groups and different kinds of people, is that people can still afford to live here, and I think this would be lost if we didn't have rent controls," said John Rasile, an architect who owns the Ozone Park, Queens, home he grew up in. "Otherwise, we're just going to have wealthy people living here, because it's just going to be so expensive."
For decades, the elected officials in the city who set the terms of local debate have been unvarying in their support for rent protections, no matter their political stripe, and the poll showed that such support among residents continues to cross all the usual partisan and ideological lines. More than 80 percent of Democrats want to keep rent regulations, as do 71 percent of Republicans. Even two-thirds of homeowners, who would not be affected by rent protections unless their property values rise with decontrol, say they support the laws.
The unanimity apparently stems from a collective understanding within the city of how difficult it is to find adequate, affordable housing in New York City. Many homeowners used to be renters, and nearly everyone knows or carries with them the scars from a desperate apartment search, an endless battle in Housing Court, or the sticker shock when first pricing real estate. In the poll, 77 percent said the end of rent regulations would mean the city would become too expensive for people like themselves, and 69 percent said many people would be forced from their apartments.
"Being a former renter I know how hard it is and how expensive it is," said Maureen Thomas, an accountant who owns a co-op in Manhattan. "It's a lack of space. There aren't enough apartments for everyone. Even though I know it's to my advantage if we didn't have rent control, I just don't think you should have the rents skyrocket."
Advocates of decontrol, of course, say it is precisely because the city does not have a free market in rents that it has experienced such a severe shortage of affordable housing. But that argument is apparently not persuasive to many residents, who say they prefer a more comforting government restriction to an economic theory. Ms. Thomas said that landlords were making enough money already and that she did not believe that they would build new housing if rents were allowed to rise. Others in the survey said they agreed.
"People are a little tired of the whole greed factor," said Brian Bilcher, a firefighter who rents an uncontrolled apartment in Staten Island. "You see it every place, from sports and movies to being a landlord. I don't think it's right that some people are living in great apartments in the Village for just $200 a month, but there's a lot of people who make half of what I make or less and they need access to a living place, too. To me, it's a moral issue."
 
How the Poll Was Done
The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews with 913 adults conducted from June 5 to 8 in all parts of New York City. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into a residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Yorkers.
For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus five percentage points for those living in rent-regulated apartments, eight points for those living in unregulated apartments, and six points for those who own their home.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

Graph: In a New York Times Poll of New York City residents, most feel rent control and rent stabilization are necessary for affordable housing . . . but they are divided on whether regulations should be eliminated when apartments become vacant. As the rent issue has grown hotter, the Governor's approval rating has fallen among city residents. Graph shows responses to the poll with regard to the necessity of rent control and rent stabilization and with regard to the issue of whether regulations should be eliminated when apartments become vacant. Graph also shows the Governor's approval ratings both in March 1997 and in June 1997. (pg. A1)

Pension Bonds Pass a Test

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A new law allowing the state to sell $2.75 billion in pension bonds cleared a judicial hurdle yesterday when a Superior Court judge ruled that it was constitutional. 
 Judge Philip S. Carchman of Mercer County dismissed a lawsuit filed by a Democrat, Mayor George A. Spadoro of Edison, who contended that any measure that increases the state's indebtedness must be approved by the voters. The judge said that because the bonds would be issued by the State Economic Development Authority, and not by the state itself, the sale would not require a referendum.

Dollar Falls vs. Yen as U.S. Warns About Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched a nine-month low against the yen yesterday after Japan reported a sharply higher trade surplus and a top Treasury official warned the Japanese not to try to export their way out of a long economic slump.
The admonition on Japan's trade surplus came from Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers as the United States prepared for a meeting of leading industrial nations in Denver next week. 
 In a speech to Denver business executives on Tuesday night, Mr. Summers said the United States wanted the Japanese to stimulate their economy through domestic-led demand and avoid an increase in the trade surplus "on a scale that could hurt global growth and fuel protectionism."
His remarks coincided with trade data from the Japanese Finance Ministry that showed the April surplus rose 92.7 percent, to 1.1 trillion yen in April compared with the year earlier. It was the second consecutive monthly increase.
The official's remarks reinforced the possibility of renewed trade friction between Washington and Tokyo as a result of the protracted weakness in the yen, which has made Japanese products more affordable abroad and American products more expensive in Japan.
It was the fifth consecutive day the dollar declined against the yen, and the selling helped pull the dollar lower in most other foreign-exchange dealings. "The dollar-yen was the story du jour," said Susan Stearns, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Bank of Montreal in New York.
The dollar fell to an intraday low of 110.52 yen, the weakest since Sept. 11, before recovering somewhat to settle in New York at 111.20 yen, down from 112.25 yen on Tuesday. With the latest decline, the dollar has retreated more than 5 yen, or 4.3 percent, in a week. The dollar fell to 1.7160 marks from 1.7185 marks. The pound fell to $1.6377 from $1.6385.
The dollar's weakness against most European currencies partly reflected the uncertainty over the future of the euro, the single currency scheduled for January 1999.
Traders were waiting to see whether France and Germany could agree on a compromise on a stability pact designed to assure fiscal discipline among participating countries.

Prices for Crude Oil Tumble On Report of Rise in Inventory

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday after a report showed that inventories in the United States were rising even as refiners operated at close to maximum rates.
On other markets, coffee prices fell. 
 After the market closed on Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil inventories rose 336,000 barrels last week, to 324.0 million barrels, the most since June 1995, even as refiners ran at 98.3 percent of their capacity.
While prices rose in early trading after Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations said Iraqi exports would be suspended this month, traders deemed the inventories sufficient to make up for any shortfall.
Iraq is allowed to export as much as $2 billion of oil over a six-month period to purchase food and medicine. The Ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Iraq halted exports to protest what he called late shipments of the humanitarian aid.
"People view the oil market as oversupplied and the A.P.I. report was pretty bearish," said Al Lindseth, an analyst with the GSC Energy Corporation in Atlanta. "Although the Iraqi Ambassador said oil sales will be delayed for a month, it's just a delay. It's ridiculous to think they won't export."
Crude oil for July delivery sank 14 cents, to $18.53 a barrel, its lowest since Feb. 12, 1996.
Coffee fell for a third day, reaching a two-month low, as warmer weather in Brazil ended the immediate threat of frost damage to the world's largest crop.
Overnight temperatures in Brazil stayed in the mid-40's, the Weather Services Corporation said, with normal or above-normal temperatures forecast for the coming week. Frost, which struck close to coffee-growing areas Monday night, damages coffee trees, reducing future crops.
At the same time, higher retail prices are expected to cut demand. Best Coffee of Seattle, which roasts between 3.5 million and 4 million pounds a year, will raise prices on average by 90 cents a pound next week, a company spokesman said.
Coffee for July delivery slid 10.30 cents, to $2.0765 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the lowest for a contract closest to delivery since April 15.

HEADLINE: Congo's Dire Need for Help Will Test Mettle of Its New Leaders

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Congo, June 10

 BODY:
The garbage has not been collected in most neighborhoods here in the capital in seven years. It has been that long since schoolteachers, police officers, firefighters, soldiers, nurses -- indeed, Government workers of any kind -- have been paid on a regular basis. And when they are paid now, a month's salary is just about enough to buy a loaf of bread.
The ill die because they cannot afford surgical gloves or medicine, which hospitals do not have. A journey from Lubumbashi, the country's second-largest city, to the copper mines, a major source of revenue, used to take three days; it now takes nine, the bridges having crumbled and the roads having been consumed by jungle. 
 "How can they possibly do it?" said Frederick Racke, the Dutch Ambassador, staggered by the magnitude of what the new Government faces. "The country is in total ruin. It is an unprecedented challenge."
But many people gave up comfortable lives in the United States, Europe and South Africa to return to the country they had fled during Mobutu Sese Seko's reign, when it was called Zaire, to try to rebuild it.
The policies and politics of this country's new President, Laurent Kabila, are still largely unknown, and there are disturbing signs that the 56-year-old leader may create a one-party state. But the new ministers seem to be driven by a genuine desire to do something for their country, not to steal from it.
The looming question is whether their dedication and enthusiasm will be enough to compensate for their striking lack of experience.
The Foreign Minister, Bizima Karaha, is a pediatrician educated in South Africa; asked if he is 30 yet, he said sheepishly, "I am 29." He will try to conduct foreign affairs without so much as a fax machine in his offices.
The Minister of Mines, Mututolo Kambale, taught English at a teachers college and was a human rights advocate in the last years of Mr. Mobutu's rule.
"I will absolutely vouch he's as honest a man as you're ever going to meet," said Anthony Gambino, who works for the United States Agency for International Development and has known Mr. Kambale since Mr. Gambino was in the Peace Corps here 20 years ago. "He's smart. But will he be able to do it? Who knows."
At the Interior Ministry, the new occupant of the crumbling headquarters, Mwenze Kongolo, studied to be a Bible translator and was working as an investigator with the warrants division of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office when he signed on with Mr. Kabila.
Now, Mr. Kongolo is in charge of a police force for a country as large as the United States east of the Mississippi. First he has to build one. What are the most pressing needs at the police academy? Electricity, clean water and shoes for the cadets, he said.
"This is the time in the history of this county when there should be great faith," said Mr. Kongolo, who has a master's degree in criminal justice from Temple University in Philadelphia.
He will need it. His responsibilities include immigration. The Interior Ministry has no computers.
"It's going to be better," said Mr. Kongolo, who hopes to be joined soon by his wife and their three children. "It's going to get worse before it gets better. But it's going to get better."

HEADLINE: F.A.A. Caught in an Urban Policy Battle

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
A Federal Aviation Administration plan for a suburban-style office building near Kennedy International Airport is emerging as the center of a dispute over a little-known Presidential order that says Federal agencies should consider downtown areas when moving employees.
The proposal is unremarkable in Government real estate planning: 840 administrative workers would move to a new building just north of the airport where almost everyone would have a parking space with access to Long Island highways. 
 But opponents say the plan defies an executive order that says Government agencies must give "first consideration" to declining commercial cores of big cities. They point to one such area five miles from the airport, downtown Jamaica, arguing that it provides a textbook example of where a new Federal office building would do the most good.
Although a final decision is not expected until late summer, Congress has already approved a version of the Federal proposal that excludes downtown Jamaica from consideration. The plan has also won the tacit approval of the Giuliani administration, which wants to steer the agency to city-owned property near the border of Nassau County. One possible site in Jamaica, near a Social Security Administration regional office with 1,000 employees, is also owned by the city.
The F.A.A.'s plan is opposed by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, some elective officials in Queens and a coalition of urban policy advocates. Similar conflicts have erupted in other cities, including Fresno, Calif., and Columbia, S.C., where officials have invoked the same Presidential mandate in unsuccessful attempts to block Government real estate investments. But several experts said the dispute in Queens provided the clearest test of Federal policy.
Opponents of the F.A.A. plan say the criteria laid out in the Presidential order point directly to downtown Jamaica, the once-vibrant commercial hub of central Queens, which remains one of New York City's business and public transportation hubs.
City, state and Federal agencies have focused on downtown Jamaica as a center for urban renewal. The latest government project in the neighborhood involves the F.A.A. itself: the long-delayed $1.3 billion light rail system that is to be built by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey over the next five years, connecting Kennedy Airport's terminals to the Long Island Rail Road and New York City subway system.
Mr. Moynihan brought the debate to a critical point when he persuaded Rodney E. Slater, the Secretary of Transportation, to meet privately on May 2 in Manhattan with several advocates of downtown Jamaica, including Archie Spigner, City Councilman from Queens, and officials of the Regional Plan Association.
"We knew that air pollution and mass transit are top priorities for Secretary Slater," said Tony Bullock, Mr. Moynihan's chief of staff, "and here we had a test of his own convictions, as well as those of the President."
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Slater said that he did not intend to intervene publicly, but gave no indication about his own preferences.
The plan's critics say they do not plan to challenge it in court, because the President's executive order is a guideline, not a law. And since the F.A.A. excluded downtown Jamaica from consideration in 1994, the relevance of the executive order was murky: President Clinton had not yet revived it from the dustbins of two previous Administrations.
"When you look back, the question of timing is very important," said Renee Miscione, a spokeswoman for the General Services Administration, which is representing the F.A.A. in its office development. The agency itself, through a spokesman, Jim Peters, declined to comment.
But urban planners and advocates of downtown revitalization elsewhere say the dispute has added fuel to the debate over the President's urban policy. "There are other cases, but Queens is the atrocity," said Jeffrey A. Finkel, executive director of the Counsel for Urban Economic Development, an advocacy group.
Although only sites in Queens are now being considered, the agency also looked at suburban locations. Officials close to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, including the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, now say they will endorse any Queens site.
"The people who are stirring this pot do so at the risk that over 800 jobs will be lost to the suburbs," said Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which has not only endorsed the Federal agency's current plan but also offered a development site. That site consists of eight acres of undeveloped city-owned marshland, surrounded by residential streets, in the Springfield Gardens section, north of the airport.
Mr. Millard said the city had reached an agreement with Edward J. Minskoff, a large-scale developer, to develop the site, if it is selected for the aviation agency. But advocates of downtown Jamaica say they will not accept defeat quietly.
"This is a critical issue for the region, if not the nation," said Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, a nongovernment planning group that has long recommended increased investment in downtown Jamaica. "Downtown Jamaica gives us a litmus test of whether there is any urban policy coming from Washington."

HEADLINE: U.S. Sues to Block Merger Plan of 2 Long Island Hospitals

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

 BODY:
The Justice Department filed suit yesterday to block the merger of two of Long Island's largest hospital networks, Long Island Jewish Medical Center and North Shore Health Systems. The lawsuit contends that the merger would violate antitrust laws, lead to higher hospital rates and inhibit the development of competing hospital systems.
"Unless this transaction is blocked, Long Island consumers will face higher prices," said Joel I. Klein, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. 
 He said the Government viewed the suit as precedent-setting as many hospitals across the country, faced with declining markets in economically troubled areas, are merging to cut costs. "But these are two giants in a thriving area where it's best to let them compete," he said.
The State Attorney General, Dennis C. Vacco, took the opposite view. He issued a statement yesterday endorsing the merger and he said a review by his office had concluded that it would save consumers $100 million or more a year.
"This will create a health care entity that will rival some of the biggest and best Manhattan hospitals," he said.
The Justice Department suit caught both nonprofit hospitals by surprise, and they said they would contest the Government's claims in court. "The Government's conclusions are entirely unwarranted and inaccurate," said James Rill, a lawyer for the hospitals who was Assistant Attorney General for antitrust during the Bush Administration.
"The merger is designed to create efficiency that will actually reduce prices and produce vigorous competition with the many other quality hospitals on Long Island and in New York City," said Mr. Rill, who is with the Washington law firm of Collier, Shannon, Rill & Scott. The merger would save $188 million in operating costs and capital expenditures over five years, the hospitals maintain.
Dr. David R. Dantzker, president of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, remarked: "We have been planning this for at least two years and never expected anything like this. For years now, the Government has been telling us to consolidate, rid ourselves of redundancy and make savings wherever possible, and now the Justice Department seems to be telling us the opposite."
But the Federal suit observes that Long Island Jewish and North Shore are "each other's principal competitor by virtue of their premier reputations, comparable full range of services and strategic location."
Mr. Klein said managed-care companies currently have the option of including either Long Island Jewish or North Shore in their plans, or they can use a favorable price negotiated with one hospital to get price concessions from the other and then offer both hospitals in their plans. In either case, he said competition between the two hospitals keeps prices low.
Two large health insurers, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield and the Health Insurance Plan, or HIP, joined Mr. Vacco in supporting the merger. "Based on information given to us by the hospitals, we believe that this alliance can achieve cost savings to benefit the consumer," said Michale A. Stocker, president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
North Shore is one of the largest hospital networks in the Northeast, consisting of nine hospitals with more than 3,400 beds. Its major complex in Manhasset is a 729-bed teaching hospital that the Federal complaint says competes vigorously with the Long Island Jewish Medical Center's 591-bed academic hospital in New Hyde Park.
In its complaint, the Justice Department also contends that the proposed merger would be contrary to New York State's policy of promoting competition among hospitals.
Mr. Vacco said he had concluded just the opposite. Chris McKenna, a spokesman for Mr. Vacco, said the Attorney General was considering joining the two hospitals in court to oppose the Justice Department.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries End Session Mostly Flat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mostly flat yesterday, as investors waited for what they hope will be favorable economic data for the bond market.
Prices rose early in the day, with gains underpinned by a steady dollar and the Federal Reserve's entry into the market to buy various coupons for its own account. The purchase of securities, called a "coupon pass," is used by the Fed to add money to the banking system. The Fed bought securities maturing between Dec. 15, 1997, and May 31, 1999. But those early advances were later erased by a heavy issuance of corporate and municipal debt, which competes for the dollars of investors. 
 The 30-year bond rose 1/32, to a price of 97 17/32, pushing its yield down to 6.83 percent, from 6.84 percent on Tuesday.
Investors are hoping that retail sales today and the Producer Price Index tomorrow will be favorable, meaning that they will show a sufficiently tepid economy, thus leading the Federal Reserve to take no action on interest rates in July.
Analysts said these hopes might have been bolstered because Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, did not hint of a change in monetary policy when he spoke recently in New York to the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars. He spoke, however, about the Russian economy, not the American one.
Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority came to the municipal bond market with a $565.7 million offering of governmental facilities revenue bonds through underwriters led by Smith Barney Inc.
Puerto Rican bonds are a favorite of investors because they are tax-exempt in most states, and because the island is a commonwealth associated with the United States Government, its debt carries an implicit Government backing. For a New York City resident these securities enjoy triple tax-exempt status.
Sylvan G. Feldstein, a municipal bond analyst at the Guardian Life Insurance Company, said he did not think the bonds were a bargain.
"But because of strong investor demand," Mr. Feldstein said, "they came at pretty steep prices, which enabled underwriters to push yields about 5 basis points lower." (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) Part of the reason they were able to do this, he added, was that it was a new issue where people could buy a sizable block of paper and get the structure they wanted, along with coupon and maturity.
"The underlying attraction to this issue is its tax-exempt status in most states throughout the country," Mr. Feldstein said. "And that is why it came in richer than we had expected." It is also a reflection of the new- issue market, where strong demand is outstripping supply at present.
Some analysts speculate that the strong demand results from investors shifting some money out of stocks into municipals. Others say it is redemption money, which has to be put to work.
The Puerto Rican issue was offered at a price to yield a maximum 5.65 percent for a long bond due in 2021, with another long bond due in 2027 priced to yield 5.50 percent.
For serial bonds with shorter maturities, yields range from 4.25 percent for an issue due in 1999 to 5.40 percent for one due in 2017. Of the bonds that are insured, most are insured by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, with the longest insured by Ambac Indemnity.
The Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, was also in the market. It priced $2.5 billion of asset-backed securities through underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company.
The issue was offered in three parts, with the bulk designated class A securities. The class A1 of $1.6 billion of securities with an average life of 2.42 years was priced to yield the equivalent of a three-month Treasury bill, plus 54 basis points, while the $808 million of class A2 securities with an average life of 6.72 years was priced to yield a three-month Treasury, plus 60 basis points. For $87.5 million of the class B securities with an 8.1-year average life, the yield was that of a three-month Treasury, plus 83 basis points.

HEADLINE: A Republican for Rent Regulation

BYLINE: By Frank Padavan; Frank Padavan, a Republican, represents northeastern Queens in the New York State Senate.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
When my wife and I married more than 30 years ago, we moved into an apartment in Glen Oaks, a sprawling complex on the eastern edge of Queens providing affordable housing for young families.
In time, like the countless New York families that preceded us, we left the apartment for the space and privacy of a house. 
 My experience has taught me that rent regulations help young families establish themselves in New York. Without rent-stabilized apartments, how many couples would be able to start families and their careers in New York City? Very few, I fear.
As a Republican, I agree that eliminating excessive government regulation and fostering private ownership of property are worthy fundamental beliefs of the party, both nationally and in New York State. So I understand why Gov. George Pataki and Joseph Bruno, the New York Senate majority leader, have proposed loosening rent regulations.
But I also believe that Republican principles must be tempered with reality in the case of New York City. Very simply, affordable housing is essential for the city's economic survival. If apartments were deregulated as they became vacant, there would be fewer and fewer apartments that middle-class families could afford.
Republicans in New York City recognize this above all else. That's why I and other Republican officeholders, including State Senator Roy Goodman, support Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's call for renewal of the 23-year-old Emergency Tenant Protection Act.
The facts back us up. In my own State Senate district in Queens, which is about as far from midtown Manhattan as you can get, the rent for an unregulated apartment in Bayside is 54 percent higher than the rent for a similar unit under stabilization.
A study released in April by the Rent Stabilization Association projected that if the laws are not renewed, rents in Bayside will rise immediately by 15 percent to 19 percent.
Tenants in stabilized apartments are far from wealthy. In fact, 27 percent of all households in rent-stabilized units have incomes below the poverty level, and the average income for a family in a rent-stabilized unit is less than $30,000. How many of these families could afford a huge jump in their rent?
Rent regulation was not foisted on many landlords unwillingly. Over the last two decades, many of them, including those who are now complaining bitterly, accepted rent regulation in exchange for tax abatements on their properties. These landlords initially offer apartments at market rates; the units then fall under rent regulation until the landlord's property tax abatement lapses -- usually in 15 or 20 years.
Rent stabilization may not be without flaws. But the fact is, it has kept the city alive. The state tried decontrolling the rents for vacant apartments in the early 1970's, and it didn't work.
Let's preserve New York's economy by keeping rent regulations intact. It's in the best interests of everyone, Republicans and Democrats alike.

HEADLINE: CAPITOL SKETCHBOOK;
Among the Not So Well Heeled of Gucci Gulch

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
The first benefits of the proposed 1997 tax cut began trickling down through the economy early this morning when the $10-an-hour professional standees arrived to hold places for the $300-an-hour lobbyists who would not show up until hours later for their seats in the big tax-pie hearing room.
"Welcome to Gucci Gulch," announced Gerald Brant, a 25-year-old entrepreneur in a baseball cap who held a prime spot for one of the power lobbyists stereotyped on Capitol Hill as the tasseled-loafer class of inside operators. 
 "We line-standers at the Ways and Means Committee are very much at the bottom of the food chain," said Mr. Brant, who was enriched by the minute as the committee's public session was delayed throughout the day and the buzz of anticipation over the city's ultimate political spectacle, enacting a tax cut, only grew. "The lobbyists pay us, and then the interest groups and corporations seeking tax breaks pay the lobbyists. We all squeeze a few dollars out of the Beltway."
Mr. Brant omitted mention of the middleman, the private broker services known as CSC and CVK, which are paid $25 or more to hire the $10 standees for the $300 lobbyists. And he did not note that many lobbyists even then will finally send an office gofer to audit the panel's sessions. But otherwise he had it right: It is growth time on the Hill. Fat crumbs are tumbling down from the groaning-board hearing rooms where the crucial details of a dozen major tax and spending revisions are being wrestled over.
"This is the beginning of the real action," boomed one well-tailored man, a trucking industry lobbyist who recognized Robin Tallon, a former Congressman from South Carolina. Mr. Tallon had been unable to resist stopping by the Ways and Means session to sample vicariously the politics of tax cutting -- a glory denied him in his decade of incumbency, which ended three years ago.
"There's a great deal of interest in what's going on in this room," Mr. Tallon said enviously amid the hubbub outside the closed doors of hearing room 1100 in the Longworth office building. Through the day, the room attracted a raft of conflicting special interest representatives ready to lobby the familiar spectrum, from corporate to social needs. They all knew that once the delays were weathered and a bill produced, the devil, not to mention Santa Claus, would be in the details.
"You have to be vigilant," Mr. Tallon said, grinning rather mischievously while his former colleagues met in private and reportedly fought long and spiritedly over the politics of munificence. "Yeah, you never know. As Will Rogers said, 'Those fellers bear watching.' "
As the day dragged on through serial delays, it became clear that the committee chairman, Bill Archer of Texas, was having troubles.
"We hear he's having problems rounding up his own Republicans," said one paid line-waiter, Andrew Eiva, a Bosnian-American volunteer at the Washington office of the Bosnian Government.
Other professional lingerers played games outside the hearing room, the most politically poetical on this day being poker and Monopoly. But Mr. Eiva was busy writing a letter to Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, seeking his help in some part of the Bosnian cause.
"I can use the money from waiting here," Mr. Eiva noted, "and sometimes I grab a legislator going by."
Down the corridor, Mark A. Bloomfield, president of the American Council for Capital Formation, a business group, was unfazed by the delays. He stayed busy making phone calls and chatting with Congressional staff and fellow lobbyists, looking particularly after the fate of the corporate alternative minimum tax.
"In some ways, the tax package is a debate about the Republican Party," Mr. Bloomfield said with a certain professional fascination as he waited to see how fragile Mr. Archer's "mark" -- his detailed tax proposal -- would prove once the committee went public. "That is to say, a debate between social conservatives focusing on the family tax credit, and others focusing on the economic provisions."
As Mr. Bloomfield delved into the macroeconomic possibilities of the day, John Likens, the president of the CSC company, moved down the long line of standees, checking on the fidelity of his 15 hired place-holders. All was well. Linda Morris, a housewife in his first client's spot, at the very head of the line, was a study in good posture and patience after seven hours, even as lobbyists passed conversing about "depreciation recapturing" and other arcana.
"All I know is it's something about taxes," Ms. Morris said of the richly important matters to be settled inside, sooner or later.
Her boss, Mr. Likens, had sugarplum thoughts of the profits of 1995, when he scrambled to place dozens on overnight waits, some as long as 40 hours. That year, the precious hearing spots for the huge telecommunications bill proved to be a bonanza for that industry and his own.
"This year was slow until they passed the budget resolution," Mr. Likens said. "But as each of its parts are taken up, we get busy -- over 30 people yesterday holding spots at the Medicare-Medicaid hearings, and now this big one, tax cuts, just beginning."
Down the line Mr. Brant, of the Gucci Gulch welcome, shared the bullish mood of the day as he sat on the floor and dreamt of larger schemes than waiting.
"I'm a refugee from the Dole campaign," he said, referring to political public relations work he did last year in hopes of landing a job with a new administration. "Now I've gone private sector, and I'm doing a telecommunications deal," he continued, sounding indomitable, smiling up from elaborate-looking sheets of paperwork.
"I'm sitting on a $50 million deal involving telecommunications in Brazil," the place-holder said, waiting ambitiously for whenever the lobbyists would finally show, as harbingers of the lawmakers. "In the meantime, we all have to keep busy, don't we?"
By 6 P.M., Mr. Brant was freed to wait no more. The lobbyists arrived, cell phones in hand, to take their protected spots.

HEADLINE: THE RENT BATTLE: THE LANDLORDS;
Strategist Helps Owners Lobby for Their Concerns

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
In the cacophonous battle over the future of rent controls, New York's largest landlord group, the Rent Stabilization Association, has long complained that its voice gets drowned out in a city of renters.
Even as it assembled many of its members on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday for a show of unity, its message sometimes seemed overwhelmed, as one of its most prominent landlords, Lewis Rudin, struggled to be heard over the Rev. Al Sharpton at a political news conference just feet away. 
 But perhaps at no other time in its 28-year history has the group -- which represents 25,000 landlords, ranging from working-class owners of small Brooklyn buildings to those with hundreds of luxury apartments -- found itself in such a pivotal and high-profile position.
As Republican state lawmakers wage the most serious campaign in decades to weaken laws that regulate apartment rents and leases, the group's leaders have become the prime spokesmen for a return to the free market in the city's rental business and are fixtures in newspapers and on television news talk shows.
Its members, many long content to pay their dues and remain anonymous, have come forward to complain about cumbersome rules and scant returns on their investments.
Most important, after years of being criticized for its lack of political acumen, the group has transformed itself into a major player in Albany. In the last five years, through its political action committee and another closely related one made up of the group's largest landlords, it has become one of the biggest contributors to the State Republican Party and to Republican state candidates.
Many within the real estate industry credit the group's increased profile to its president, Joseph Strasburg, hired in 1994 after spending eight years as the chief of staff to the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, of Queens. They say Mr. Strasburg, 45, has been more successful than his predecessors in unifying a membership with widely divergent economic interests and focusing them on a bottom line: scaling back rent protections.
The association was formed in 1969 when the state's rent stabilization laws were enacted, and until 1983, when the rent system was put under state control, it acted as a quasi-city agency, helping to draft and administer rules. Now, it serves primarily as a lobbying group and provides a wide range of services mostly to its small owners: those who own 60 or fewer units, who make up 70 percent of the membership.
It refuses to discuss its operating budget, generated through dues. (In the early 1980's, it charged members $5 per apartment. Its members now own about a million apartments in the city.)
A savvy and sometimes pugnacious political strategist with an ever-present cigar, Mr. Strasburg said the group had been largely responsible for pushing the Republican leadership to attack rent laws.
"The fact that this is being debated to the extent it's being debated -- the first time since 1974, really -- and the fact that we have been able to make people aware of the abuses of the system shows that to a large extent, I think we've moved the process forward dramatically," said Mr. Strasburg, who grew up in a rent-controlled apartment in the Bronx and lived in a rent-stabilized apartment in Stuyvesant Town before moving to Staten Island.
Others say the association was as shocked as everyone else when the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, vowed last December to do away with rent protections for all but the elderly, poor and disabled.
"They've really just gone along for the ride," said a city official familiar with the association.
The impact of the political contributions -- almost $750,000 to state candidates and party committees since 1992 -- is also unclear. Mr. Strasburg discounts the money, saying its only effect has been to keep doors open and calls returned. The association's members have heavily favored Republicans, he said, "because the Assembly will clearly take their money and never respond."
But tenant advocates and other observers contend that the money has been the prime motivator in the debate, underscoring the role of several large property owners in the association who have actively opposed rent laws, among them Leonard Litwin, whose company owns several thousand apartments on the Upper East Side; Jeffrey Manocherian, a partner in Manocherian Brothers, which owns several thousand Manhattan apartments, and Arnold Goldstein, a successful developer and the acting chairman of the landlord association.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Picks Republicans to Find Ways to Press China on Rights

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, has put together a group of prominent Republican legislators, some of whom favor continuing normal trading status for China and some of whom oppose it, and has asked them to come up with another approach to pushing the Chinese on human rights, their legal system and the general promotion of democracy, Congressional aides said today.
With Representatives John E. Porter of Illinois and David Dreier of California serving as co-chairmen, the informal task force is debating various policies that might have a stronger impact on China's direction than the empty threat of revoking China's trading status, which is currently the main instrument Congress has with which to show its displeasure with China and Clinton Administration policy toward it. 
 The threat has been raised repeatedly through the Bush and Clinton Administrations, but the United States has never actually revoked the status.
The ideas being considered for the legislation range from providing more money to Radio Free Asia, Voice of America and pro-democracy projects by non-governmental organizations, to selling missiles to Taiwan and restricting visas for Chinese officials who carry out a "forced abortion" policy.
The annual vote in the House on reversing President Clinton's decision to continue China's trading status -- which is formally known as "most favored nation" status but is given to nearly every country in the world except those deemed terrorist states -- is now expected on June 25, a week before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule. Many Congressional aides now think the House will not vote to overturn Mr. Clinton, but even if it does, the action would not survive a Presidential veto.
Mr. Porter said it was clear that, in the end, normal trade status would not be revoked.
"So that policy leads us nowhere," he said. "We need a policy that really does impact China and promote the values we hope to see grow in China, like democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
Mr. Gingrich, who favors normal trade status for China, is looking for alternatives that legislators and staff members say could be introduced quickly after the vote on China's trading status.
But Mr. Gingrich has not decided if he will support an alternate bill or bills if they are introduced. Mr. Porter said that the group had asked its staff to draft legislation hoping for Mr. Gingrich's support "and we'll proceed as soon as we have it."
Representative Christopher Cox, a Republican from California who is also on the task force and plans to vote to revoke China's trading status, said, "We all know that M.F.N. can't bear the weight of all the work to be done on the panoply of issues between the United States and China."
While some lawmakers favor new, more pinpointed economic or trade sanctions -- against products produced by factories owned by China's military, for instance -- the Dreier-Porter group has decided not to propose any trade sanctions.
"That was the precondition," a Congressional aide said. "That was what the Speaker said."

HEADLINE: Charleston Bounces Back After Closing of Base

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C.

 BODY:
When the United States Navy announced in 1993 that it was weighing anchor from Charleston and shutting down the naval base and shipyards that sprawled along the banks of the Cooper River, Mayor Joseph Riley worried that the news might amount to the city's obituary.
Charleston, Mayor Riley said, had prided itself for generations as a Navy town. 
 "It was like a death," he recalled recently. "No one had ever imagined Charleston without the Navy. The citizens loved the Navy, and the Navy loved our citizens, and the Navy's presence here was so big that every citizen in Charleston was touched by it."
The 91-year-old, 1,600-acre base was the city's largest employer, responsible for 22,000 jobs, including about 8,000 civilian jobs, and more than a third of the local economy. With the Charleston Naval Base closed, the Mayor said, the city's economic prospects were "terrifying."
Yet today along Charleston's wisteria-perfumed streets -- as in dozens of other communities around the country where military bases have been shuttered in the aftermath of the cold war -- the fears about base closings have been replaced by something approaching optimism.
To the surprise of many Charlestonians, their city has survived. And according to some economic indicators, it has thrived as well.
Unemployment is less than 5 percent; more than 40 companies have moved to Charleston or expanded their operations since 1993, many taking over property on the former Navy base. The companies have committed more than $1.5 billion in new investment and have created nearly 6,000 jobs, equal to about three-quarters of the civilian jobs lost because of the base closing.
With the Pentagon's announcement last month that it will ask Congress to approve another round of base closings early in the next century, the story of Charleston's turnaround should offer comfort to communities facing the threat that they, too, will lose the military installations that dominate their economies.
"This community has responded well to what could have been a devastating situation," said Ben Cole, president of the Charleston Regional Development Alliance. "In the end, I actually think we're going to be a better city for having lost the base."
Recent studies suggest that communities have much less to fear from base closings than they might think. Of the 495 major military bases that existed across the United States in 1988, 97 have been ordered closed, and a study by the Congressional Budget Office last December found that "relatively few communities or regions have been affected severely" by the closings.
The study, citing figures from the Pentagon, said that the base closings would result in the loss of about 236,000 jobs over a decade across the country, representing only about two-tenths of 1 percent of the nation's total employment.
A separate Pentagon-financed report by the Rand Corporation last year found that, in California, communities around shut-down military bases had weathered the closings with far less economic damage than had been predicted, and that some had even experienced economic growth. (Nearly two-thirds of the jobs lost because of base closings since 1988 have been in California.)
Even many of the remote rural communities where bases were closed have managed to do well, usually with the help of the Federal Government, which has transferred the offices of civilian agencies to the former military installations to bolster employment.
The studies have done little to quiet critics on Capitol Hill who say that the Defense Department has already cut too far, and that the Pentagon will not save enough money from the base closings to justify the turmoil they create.
"I think we need to digest what we have done before we go any further," said Representative Joel Hefley, a Colorado Republican who is chairman of the National Security subcommittee on military installations. "It puts these communities through absolute torment."
There is no doubt that Charleston experienced that torment beginning in 1988, when Congress created an independent commission to oversee the closing of military bases deemed unessential as the Pentagon cut its budget at the end of the cold war.
Charleston's naval shipyards survived the first two rounds of closings, in 1988 and 1991. But in 1993, the base came into the commission's sights.
At first, city leaders struggled to persuade the commission to save the base, citing dire economic forecasts that suggested the city faced collapse without the Navy's presence.
They drew on the political muscle offered by South Carolina's Congressmen, especially Senator Strom Thurmond, who was then the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and is now its chairman.
But the commission had been designed to eliminate politics from the equation of base closings -- Congress was required to consider the panel's recommendations as a package instead of base by base -- and the battle for the Charleston Naval Base was lost.
"What happened immediately was this tremendous decrease in morale in the city," said Albert Parish, an economist at Charleston Southern University. "There was depression, especially among the businesses located close to the base: convenience stores, gas stations, little restaurants, mom-and-pop operations. They knew they were doomed."
Many small businesses around the base did close. Real estate values in parts of the city collapsed in the expectation of the exodus of Navy families, with land values falling more than 30 percent in some neighborhoods.
But the bad news for Charleston was remarkably short-lived, thanks to community leaders who decided that they had no time to lose in restoring the city's confidence.
Charleston County and two adjoining counties put aside years of rivalry in recruiting new business, declaring a truce and forming the Regional Development Alliance to seek investments on behalf of all three.
The alliance made an important early decision: no politicians would be allowed to serve on its board of directors.
"I don't have anything against politicians," said Mr. Cole, the president. "But it's a fact of life that when politicians get involved, things are done because of political interests."
Potential investors were impressed, not only with the commitment of the community but also with what the Navy had left behind: a well-maintained complex of 23 piers, 5 drydocks and 1.8 million square feet of warehousing along six miles of waterfront on the Cooper River.
At one end of the complex are the old officers' quarters along Navy Way, many of them stately turn-of-the-century houses shaded by canopies of oak trees draped in Spanish moss.
"It looks like Tara out there," said Jack Sprott, executive director of the group responsible for developing the Navy base, who hopes to turn the lawns around the officers' quarters into a public park and tourist destination.
Today, nearly 60 percent of the available space at the Navy base has been leased, including 70 percent of the piers and all of the drydocks.
Along the sun-bleached piers where generations of young sailors parted with their families and lifted anchor for the high seas, cargo ships were recently being loaded with Tyson Foods frozen chicken bound for Russia, the brand name printed in Cyrillic on each package.
Farther down the waterfront, a private ship-maintenance company was repairing the salvage ships used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to fish space shuttle rocket boosters out of the ocean. In the old Navy commissary, set designers prepared for filming of a CBS television movie, "Carriers."
Charleston is now so confident about the former base that the city and surrounding counties expect to open negotiations with the Navy next year to buy the land outright, ending the Government's claim to the base.
"This base closing could have been absolutely horrible, but we've made it work," Mr. Sprott said. "This has opened doors for us."

HEADLINE: The Long Arm Of Small Business;
Delivering a Big Blow to the Death Tax

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Daisy Crowder says she is not a rich person, but she is angry that the Federal Government might treat her like one when she dies, by levying a hefty inheritance tax on the small stoneworking and construction company that she and her husband have built from scratch in Newport, Tenn.
She has complained about the tax to the people who represent her in Congress. But if she and other small-business owners across the country who oppose the tax persuade Congress to pare it back -- and the odds are that they will win at least a partial victory this year -- they will owe their success not just to their own passionately expressed feelings on the issue, but to the power and skill of their lobbying organizations in Washington. 
 Change in Washington can come from the grass roots. But it is most likely to come about when it is pushed by lobbyists who know how to work the system, combining appeals from constituents with the ability to mobilize an army of interest groups, and the votes and campaign contributions they represent.
In the case of the Federal estate tax, the formidable small-business lobby, led by the National Federation of Independent Business, has taken an issue that touches relatively few -- and relatively wealthy -- people and pushed it to the top of the nation's economic agenda.
In just a few years, the issue has gone from a quixotic quest by a few die-hard tax cutters in Congress to one that enjoys almost unanimous support from Republicans and backing from a considerable number of Democrats as well and is mentioned in the same breath as capital gains in the list of the Republican leadership's tax-cutting priorities.
"When you're in this business long enough you can smell momentum, and this issue has momentum," said Bob Packwood, the former Republican Senator from Oregon who was once his party's chief tax writer. Mr. Packwood is now lobbying for estate-tax reduction on behalf of family-owned timber and other natural-resource companies.
Still, the small-business lobby has had to put its influence to the test the last several days as it has battled to increase the amount of estate-tax relief in the Republican tax-cutting bill taken up by the House today.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, included only a minimal amount of estate-tax relief in his original proposal, which was announced on Monday. That proposal would have increased the amount of an estate that is exempted from Federal taxation to $1 million, from the current $600,000, but do it gradually over 17 years. The change would have cost the Government $18.9 billion over 10 years.
Furious because they felt they had been promised more generous provisions, the National Federation of Independent Business and the other lobbying groups working on the issue held an emergency meeting on Tuesday, and drafted a letter to the Republican leadership demanding changes.
Separately, they worked with a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee, John S. Tanner of Tennessee, on an amendment to Mr. Archer's proposal that would increase the exemption within seven years and provide an additional $1.5 million exemption for family-owned businesses.
By midday today, the small-business lobby had made its influence felt. Under pressure from Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who earlier this year said he favored repeal of the tax, Mr. Archer agreed today to increase the size of the estate-tax reduction by $10 billion, allowing the increase to the $1 million exemption to be phased in by 2007. In a sign of how the influence of small businesses can be greater even than that of corporate America, most of the money to pay for the bigger cut would come from scaling back Mr. Archer's proposal to eliminate the alternative minimum tax on corporations.
"Things are getting better," said Jamie Wickett, a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business.
It is unclear what action the Senate will take on the issue, and the newest House proposal could still be scaled back as lawmakers try to satisfy conflicting demands for tax cuts from a swarm of special interests.
To be sure, there are still some defenders of the tax, which has been levied in various forms since 1916, both as a means of raising revenue and as a way to limit the concentration of wealth. They say the tax is a fair method of maintaining the tax code's progressivity and that it touches only a tiny minority of wealthy people.
"The estate-tax cuts only go to help the top 1 or 2 percent of the population," said Bob McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group. "They're using these noble yeomen of American small business as a stalking horse for the very rich."
For its part, the Clinton Administration has been cool to any big estate-tax reduction. But it has not been outspoken on the issue since Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers last month termed the repeal effort "selfishness" -- a statement that generated such a firestorm of criticism that Mr. Summers quickly apologized.
The tax raised $17 billion last year, just 1.2 percent of Federal revenues, and was levied on the estates of only 37,000 people, or about 1.6 percent of those who died. It should generate far bigger revenues in coming decades because of demographic changes -- more people will be dying -- and because of the soaring values of stocks and other assets, including farmland and small businesses.
So far, though, small-business owners and farmers account for a relatively small portion of taxable estates, even though those are the groups that have made the most vociferous case for repeal or reduction.
But as Mrs. Crowder's case suggests, the issue is as much emotional as economic. Mrs. Crowder, 58, and her ailing husband, Charles, 67, have plowed the earnings from their business for years into equipment, buildings, land and other assets to help expand. As a result, she said, they do not have much cash or other liquid wealth but will leave an estate worth well above the level at which the Federal tax kicks in.
Since the tax bite on every dollar above the $600,000 exemption -- $1.2 million for couples -- starts at 37 percent and rises to 55 percent on every dollar above $3 million, Mrs. Crowder said she was fearful that her four children would be forced to sell some or all of the business to pay the bill when she and her husband died.
"I started out living in little two-room shacks," she said. "We work long hours still -- 12 or 13 hours is nothing around here -- and we still struggle every day to pay our bills. It's not fair in the least to subject to estate taxes what's already been taxed in my lifetime."
Opponents of the levy also make an economic argument against it. They say the inheritance tax -- or the "death tax," as they call it -- no longer captures the assets of the very wealthy, most of whom manage to evade it through sophisticated estate planning.
Moreover, they argue, the tax discourages investment in small businesses and farms and not only leads to the breakup of small companies, but also to the loss of the jobs they support. And they contend that the tax is so expensive for the Internal Revenue Service to administer and generates so many legal conflicts over the valuations assigned to the estates that there is little justification for retaining it. (Critics make the same arguments against the separate inheritance taxes imposed by many states.)
"If Uncle Sam is going to do this to me, why should I go on," said Kennard W. Campbell, 57, who runs a 20-employee plumbing and real estate company in Stuarts Draft, Va. "I have a son who's 37 and who I want to see continue doing what we're doing today."
Those arguments have been made forcefully over the last several years by the small-business lobby, which represents the people members of Congress tend to meet when they go home to their districts: active and often prominent in their communities -- and overwhelmingly conservative. And there are a lot of them: an average of 1,200 members of the National Federation of Independent Business in each district.
Jack Faris, the federation's president, last exhibited his influence when he played a key role in blocking President Clinton's health care plan in 1993. And the small-business lobby's influence increased substantially when the Republicans took control of Congress in the 1994 elections.
The Democratic committee chairmen in Congress before that election voted to support positions backed by the federation only 20 percent of the time. The Republican chairmen who replaced them voted with the federation 97 percent of the time.
"We no longer needed to take a defensive posture," Mr. Faris said.
As it went on the offensive in 1995, the small-business lobby quickly put the estate tax at the top of its list.
"This is a huge, emotional issue with our members," Mr. Faris said.
Indeed, the entire inheritance-tax issue fits neatly into the anti-Washington, anti-tax movement that has come to characterize the way many small-business owners feel about the Government, and lobbyists like Mr. Faris are quick to push those hot buttons in describing the tax's effects.
"People are dealing with the death of a loved one, and now they have the I.R.S. coming in and trying to rip what's left out of the heart of the family," Mr. Faris said.
Starting three years ago, Mr. Faris's group began putting together a coalition of other lobbying groups whose constituencies had similar concerns. An early recruit was the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, which represents ranchers who face the same problems with inheritance taxes as entrepreneurs.
The coalition grew steadily. The American Farm Bureau joined, as did groups representing florists, vintners, auto dealers, wholesalers, retailers, bakers, dentists, plumbers, restaurant owners and the Amway Corporation, among scores of others -- 105 lobbying groups in all.
By bringing so many groups together, the coalition has been able to unleash waves of constituents on members of Congress at regular intervals. A few weeks ago the National Retail Federation brought a group of its members here to knock on doors. Beer wholesalers did the same thing that week, and restaurant owners were in a few weeks earlier.
H. James Baum, 59, an opponent of the tax who owns a retailing company in Illinois that has been in his family since 1874, stopped in to see Representative Gerald C. Weller, a second-term Republican who represents his district. Mr. Baum said he has known and supported Mr. Weller for years and that he was supportive of reducing the tax.
"Our influence in Washington," Mr. Baum said, "is almost disproportionate."

HEADLINE: Some Odd Assumptions on Capital Gains

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
As the next millennium begins, American investors will voluntarily pay more than $6 billion in taxes that they do not owe to the Federal Government -- even though they will not have taken in any cash to pay the taxes.
At the same time, inflation will be widely feared, and the bull market in stocks will be roaring on. 
 If those forecasts strike you as unrealistic, perhaps you do not work for the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. They appear to be crucial to the revenue estimates relating to capital gains taxes in the tax bill proposed by Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Archer's proposal is to cut the top rate on capital gains to 20 percent from 28 percent, effective for sales made on May 7 or later. That, it is assumed, will provoke a rush of selling, enough so that the Government will take in $1.7 billion more during the current fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, and $6.3 billion more in the next fiscal year, than it would have without the changes.
To take in that extra $8 billion, with the capital gains tax rate being eight percentage points lower, one must assume that taxpayers will realize much more in capital gains over the period than they would otherwise have realized.
There may be some optimism there. But it is in later years that the figures are truly impressive. By the fiscal year 2001, the revenue estimate numbers assume that the lower rates will be costing the Government $3.6 billion in comparison with current tax law. In other words, because rates are lower, those taking capital gains will be paying less.
Then, in the fiscal year 2002, the official revenue estimates once again show the Government doing better than it would have done. In that year, it takes in an extra $2.5 billion -- a swing of $6.1 billion compared with the year earlier.
What produces that swing? In that year, Mr. Archer proposes indexing capital gains for inflation. Any assets acquired after Jan. 1, 2001, will, if held for at least three years, be subject to capital gains tax only to the extent the gain outpaces inflation over the period. That provision will, of course, start to cost the Government money a few years later.
But the immediate effect is said to be quite different. Anyone can elect on Jan. 1, 2001, to treat stock as sold at the closing price of the next day's trading, and then reacquired at the same price.
The taxpayer would then pay a capital gains tax on the profit from that phantom transaction. And, if the stock is then held for at least three more years, its sale would qualify for the indexation break.
To make the revenue numbers work, assuming the 20 percent rate, taxpayers will have to elect to pay that tax on more than $30 billion of profits. This would be on assets held for at least a year (to get the long-term treatment) and which the taxpayer intends to hold for at least three more years.
Would that be a good idea? Let's assume, for argument's sake, that you own a stock position worth$10,000 on Jan. 1, 2001, and let's assume that it cost $5,000. And let's assume that inflation will then be running around 3 percent a year, for a three-year cumulative growth of 10 percent. (That assumes, by the way, a substantial pickup in inflation. The indexing is based on the deflator for the gross domestic product, which is now rising at a rate of less than 2 percent a year.)
To qualify for indexing, you pay $1,000 tax, that is a 20 percent tax on the $5,000 in profits.
Let us assume the stock doubles again over the next three years. In that case, you would owe tax on $9,000 of profits, because your cost basis would be adjusted by the 10 percent rise in inflation over the period. So you would owe $1,800 in taxes, in addition to the $1,000 you paid three years earlier.
Or, you could do nothing in 2001, and if the same events unfolded, sell at $20,000 and pay $3,000 in taxes.
The net effect? You have saved $200. To get that savings, you paid $1,000 three years earlier. One way to look at that is as a 20 percent profit on that $1,000 over those three years. But that came during a period when your stock doubled. Clearly, you would have been a lot better off to have invested that $1,000 in 2001 in more stock.
"I've known a lot of taxpayers," said Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers, when asked yesterday if the revenue estimates seemed reasonable to him. "They don't pay what they don't have to. I have a hard time believing people are going to sign up for that."
Of course, if inflation was expected to be much higher, it would make more sense to pay the taxes earlier. If you assume that inflation over those three years will amount to 20 percent, instead of 10 percent, then the tax savings would be $400 instead of $200.
In other words, to get this kind of extra tax revenue, one has to assume that there will be a lot of profits available to be taken -- that the bull market is still raging -- and that people will be willing to sign up for the indexing because they think inflation will be running fairly high. Most market analysts would not forecast a strong bull market to continue if inflation was indeed a major concern of investors.
Under the rules established by the budget accord, the new tax bill is supposed to have net tax cuts of $85 billion between 1997 and 2002. By assuming that $6.1 billion in additional revenues, the bill can have that much more in other goodies during that period without going over the limits. It is probably nonsense, but there are times when assuming nonsense can make life much more pleasant.

Report on Mortgages Gives Mixed Signals

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Mortgage delinquencies are lower in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut than in the nation, but the proportion of the region's homes that are in foreclosure is far higher, a banking group reported yesterday.
"It shows that your region is spotty, with a level of foreclosure that continues to be huge," said David Lereah, chief economist for the group, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. 
 In New York City, Rae Rosen, a senior economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the data reflected the sharp division in economic strength between the city and its nearby suburbs, with strong income gains and steady home values, and the more rural and industrialized sections of the region.
The report found that the percentage of mortgage loans that were delinquent in the first three months of the year was 4.31 percent in New York, 4.25 percent in New Jersey and 3.6 percent in Connecticut, compared with 4.36 percent in the nation.
It said the percentage of homes in foreclosure during the same period was 1.67 percent in New York, 1.82 percent in New Jersey and 1.75 percent in Connecticut, compared with 1.08 percent in the nation.

Bosnian City Is Cited In Voter Registration Fraud
International election monitors said that all voter registration centers in the Bosnian city of Brcko would be closed, the local staff fired, and the process begun again. Fraud was widespread, they said, with Bosnian Serb officials trying to maintain control of the town, once predominantly Muslim, by issuing fraudulent identity papers to Serbian refugees, some of them bused in from Serbia. Elections were set for September. A12

American U.N. Plan Criticized
Diplomats and United Nations officials were less than enthusiastic about the strings attached to a deal worked out between the Clinton Administration and the Senate that would allow repayment of a large part of the American debt to the organization. Several envoys said that not all the demands made by Senators would be accepted by all 184 member countries. A9

HEADLINE: After Foxwoods, Pequots Turn to Building Ferries

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The Mashantucket Pequot Indians of Connecticut do not do things halfway. The tribe has made millions as owners of Foxwoods Casino, building and rebuilding their resort in the eastern Connecticut woods until today Foxwoods is considered one of the most profitable gambling halls in the world.
But will the Pequot touch work for ferryboats? 
 The first Pequot-built ferry, a 148.5-foot catamaran launched yesterday at a ceremony on the Thames River near the tribe's one-year-old shipyard in New London, Conn., is probably the most expensive ferry ever built in the United States for its size, at $11.5 million. It may well also be the fastest, at 47 knots, about 54 miles per hour. And it is almost certainly the first ever to be marketed with its own interactive computer CD.
"Nobody in the ferryboat business has the resources to go out and build a $10 million ferryboat except for them," said one of the tribe's competitors, Peter Duclos, a vice president at Gladding-Hearn Shipbuilding in Somerset, Mass., which is one of only a handful of builders of a new generation of fast ferryboats. "That boat is not a 747, it's a Concorde."
The Pequots opened their boatyard, called Pequot River Shipworks, with twinned goals of building boats to carry gamblers from New York City to Foxwoods and also for the commercial ferry markets in North and South America. Tribal officials said they believed those markets were ripe for an advanced trihulled turbine catamaran seating 302 passengers.
They said yesterday that their first completed boat, called the Sassacus, would begin running as early as September between an undetermined site in New York and the casino -- about two and a half hours total, or about one hour less than the current drive.
Tribal officials also announced the first commercial ferry sale, to an Argentinian company, Buquebus, which plans to begin a three-hour run early next year between Key West and Fort Myers, Fla. That trip now takes about eight hours by car.
"We believe these boats will play crucial roles in the marine superhighways of the future, just as our ancestors' first boats played a key role on the first marine highways on the East Coast," said Richard A. Hayward, the tribal chairman.
Local officials in New London, which grew up as a shipbuilding center for the whaling fleets of the 1800's and later prospered building submarine fleets for the United States Navy, credited the Pequots with helping keep a piece of the local culture and identity alive as military needs wound down at the end of the cold war.
Jane L. Glover, the Mayor of New London, said that the boatyard had pumped about $6 million into the local economy and kept the roughly 80 boatyard employees -- most of whom are laid-off former submarine workers from the nearby Electric Boat shipyard in Groton -- working in their craft. "Otherwise, they might have had to go to work for the casino," she said.
Ms. Glover said that what really drove that point home to her yesterday was her meeting a local contractor who had just landed a contract for refrigeration work on the Pequots' next boat. "It made a difference to someone locally," she said.
But ferry industry experts and operators said that the Pequots would have to fight a lot of economic currents to build a broader commercial application for their ferries. The tribe's boats -- a design licensed from a British company, FBM Marine Group -- may simply be too specialized: too fast, too expensive and too plush, with first-class seating patterned after British Airways, to make much sense commercially in the real workaday ferryboat world.
"It is difficult to conceive of a commercial setting without a subsidy in which the boat could make money," said Mark Stanisci, the president of Express Navigation Inc., which runs two ferries between Wall Street and Atlantic Highlands, N.J. The company's nine-year-old boats only go two-thirds as fast as the Pequot boats -- about 30 knots -- but they cost only $2.25 million back then and can be replaced today, Mr. Stanisci said, for a next-generation design that still costs only about $3.5 million.
But there is also little doubt that demand for new high-speed ferries stands to increase. NY Waterway, which operates 14 boats in the New York City metropolitan area, plans to expand to about 25 by 2000, including 5-to-10 high-speed boats needed for a new route beween LaGuardia Airport and Manhattan.
Juan Carlos Lopez Mena, the chairman of the Argentine ferry company that made the first Pequot purchase, said through an interpreter that part of the attraction of the new ferries, in addition to their speed, was that their turbine engines polluted less than other less-efficient designs. They were also built to international maritime specifications, unlike most American-built vessels. He said his company had an option to buy three more boats, all for planned use in United States waters.
Mr. Duclos of the Gladding-Hearn shipyard said he thought that Pequots had in fact carved out such a different market that they could only help competitors like his company by aggressively marketing to the world in a way that his 42-year-old family-owned business could simply never afford.
"All the efforts of the Pequots are going to help us out," he said. "They're going to bring to the attention of a lot of people the high-speed ferry business -- we might even pass leads back and forth."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Interleague Play Marks Its Place in Baseball History Books

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
On the eve of baseball's historic entry into interleague play, Don Zimmer, who has worn a baseball uniform so long that some people swear he was born in it, was recalling what made the sport in New York so unique four decades ago.
"It was fun going from Brooklyn to the Polo Grounds to play the Giants," said the Yankees' bench coach, who played for the Dodgers in the mid-1950's. "When the Dodgers played the Giants, it was a tremendous rivalry. To think that you had three clubs in one city, that was something that was very special." 
 Zimmer and the Yankees will not be traveling anywhere next Monday, but the Mets will travel from Queens to Yankee Stadium to play the other team in town.
Interleague play has arrived, and the Mets and the Yankees will play for the first time in the regular season next week as Major League Baseball takes a radical turn in its history, beginning tonight.
Beginning with the game between the Texas Rangers and the San Francisco Giants in Arlington, Tex., and three other games on the West Coast, teams from the National League will play teams from the American League during the regular season for the first time. They will play a total of 214 games spread over three periods, the last ending Sept. 3.
"I would think it has to be exciting," Zimmer said. "You've got 55,000, 56,000 people. I'd imagine 35,000 would be for the Yankees and 20,000 for the Mets. Any time you play in front of a full house, that's exciting. The players will have to be pumped up."
Interleague games have long been routine in the other major professional sports, but baseball has held out for nearly a century in the interest of post-season purity -- that is, that the teams that play in the World Series will not have played each other during the regular season. But the sport's landscape has undergone major changes in the past few years.
Officials and club owners have acted to give the majority of fans what they say they want, trying to generate greater interest and higher revenues and return baseball to the lush green look it had before other sports began making inroads into its popularity and pocketbook.
The advent of interleague play follows several other innovations in what has long been considered the most tradition-bound sport: wild-card teams, expanded playoffs, divisional realignment and revenue sharing. Further realignment of some teams may follow. Owners are debating the possibility of moving Kansas City to the National League and Arizona, which does not start play until next year, to the American, as well as switching divisions for other teams.
Traditionalists have opposed all of these moves, but none more than interleague play. Such games, the opponents complain, will shatter the sanctity of statistics and history. But club owners say they cannot pay players like Albert Belle $11 million a year on statistics and history.
So Tony Gwynn of San Diego could reel off a consecutive-game hitting streak and reach Joe DiMaggio's record of 56 with hits against the Rangers and the Oakland Athletics. Roger Clemens of Toronto could beat the Mets on Sept. 3 for his 20th victory, win no more games and be listed among the American League's 20-game winners.
Those fans who are not so-called purists will welcome the games, at least some of them. Tired of waiting 35 years for a Subway Series between the Yankees and the Mets, New York baseball fans will see them play next week at Yankee Stadium. It will be the first time New York teams play meaningful games against each other since the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers played in the 1957 season, their last in New York before they defected to the West Coast. And it will be the first such game at Yankee Stadium since Don Larsen pitched a perfect game to beat the Dodgers in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series.
The introduction of interleague play has created an instant windfall for some teams. The Yankees, for example, have averaged 26,320 fans a game this season, but they will have capacity crowds of 57,500 for each of the three games with the Mets next week. Not everyone will feel that rush of revenue, however. The Detroit Tigers have sold fewer than 40,000 tickets total for their three games with the Florida Marlins next week.
Baseball officials project an attendance increase of about 32 percent for interleague games over the traditional segment of the schedule.
Whatever this means economically for teams, interleague play is a fact for at least this season and next and will give fans series between geographical rivals: Mets-Yankees, Cubs-White Sox, Giants-Athletics, Angels-Dodgers, Reds-Indians, Cardinals-Royals and the all-Canadian matchup of Expos-Blue Jays.
"That will be for national bragging rights," said Gord Ash, the Blue Jays' general manager.
But in one fan's view, bragging rights in New York aren't worth breaking with baseball history.
"It's just another manifestation of the greedy owners trying to make a buck," Dr. William Homan of White Plains, a Yankee fan, said of interleague play. "The modern owners have no sense of tradition, and tradition is what makes baseball."
Like fans, people in baseball have mixed views of interleague play. Ash said he did not initially like the idea but added, "I'll sacrifice it to the interest in the games."
Herk Robinson, the Kansas City general manager, said: "I'm a traditionalist, but we need to look for ways to get more people into the ball park. We're in the entertainment business."
Interleague play, said Bob Gebhard, the Colorado Rockies' general manager, is "another step to try to meet the demands of the fans."
And Fred Claire, his counterpart with the Los Angeles Dodgers, said, "It's not only the competition of the games and what they mean to each club, but league pride is at stake."
To be sure, teams are not taking these games lightly. They have prepared for them the same way they do for their intraleague games. That is, they have had their advance scouts watching their opponents or they have taped and studied the tapes of their opponents' games.
When asked if the Dodgers had been scouting the A.L. West teams, Claire said, "You bet we have."
He added: "We can usually use one scout with just a little bit of help to cover our advancing. This year we have our regular scout and we have three other people in the mix. One guy couldn't move around quickly enough to do all of that advancing."
The Blue Jays didn't wait until this season to scout N.L. East teams. Ash said Toronto's advance scout, Sal Butera, spent much of last September watching them.
Woody Woodward, the Seattle general manager, said the Mariners were doing advance work but added: "We're not going to go overboard as we might in a playoff situation. We don't think that's necessary."
In many instances, intensive scouting isn't necessary at all. Teams play each other in spring training, and players float freely from one league to the other through free agency and trades.
Knowing their new opponents, though, is only one problem for A.L. managers. They also have to decide what to do with their designated hitters when they play in N.L. parks, where the d.h. will not be used. The d.h. rule for interleague games is the same as it is for the World Series.
That leaves A.L. managers with a dilemma: bench their d.h., or use him and bench someone else. In last year's World Series, when the Yankees played in Atlanta, Joe Torre was faced with keeping Tino Martinez at first base and not playing Cecil Fielder, or putting Fielder, his d.h., at first.
In Minnesota, Manager Tom Kelly wrestled with his problem involving Paul Molitor. Molitor, his d.h., leads the team in hitting (.339) and in runs batted in (34), but Kelly wasn't certain he could use Molitor at first base in Houston this weekend.
"If he's healthy enough to play, I think he'll play," Kelly said of the veteran, who has remnants of a stomach pull. "But as of today, it would be very questionable."
If Molitor can't play first, Kelly said, Houston fans could feel cheated. "I feel it's what the thing is all about, letting the fans see these guys play," Kelly said. "We're defeating the purpose."
Worse for the Twins, Kelly said, "I hate the thought of losing my best hitter and replacing him with a pitcher."

Charts: "New Song for the Old Ball Game"
This scouting report on interleague play was prepared by Murray Chass.
 
WHAT: For the first time in Major League Baseball history, teams from the American League will play teams from the National League during the regular season. Until now, teams from both leagues played only in the World Series or in exhibition games.
 
WHY: Owners hope to generate greater interest and revenue. Some series have very good advance sales, some no better than usual. Some, involving geographical rivals, have surprisingly light advances.
 
HOW: Teams in the corresponding divisions of the two leagues play each other. Teams in the East and Central divisions play each team in the other league's corresponding division three times each for a total of 15 games. West Division teams play each other four times for a total of 16 games.
 
STATISTICS: A victory is a victory and a loss a loss no matter where they are achieved, meaning the games will count in the regular league standings. Individual player statistics will count in the player's record without differentiation between interleague and intraleague games.
 
DESIGNATED HITTER: As in the World Series, the d.h. will be used in games played in A.L. parks and pitchers will bat (not necessarily hit) in N.L. parks.
 
UMPIRES: The league of the home team will provide the umpiring crew.
 
FUTURE: Interleague play will continue next year as the second year of a two-year experiment, using the same format as this season, with teams from corresponding divisions playing each other. The number of games has not been determined, but it very likely will be 16 for each team. One idea under consideration is expanding the number of games from three to four between close geographic rivals such as the Yankees and the Mets. Owners and players will have to negotiate to continue interleague games beyond 1998. (pg. 22)
 
A.L. vs. N.L.: Are You Ready?"
For the first time in Major League history teams from the American and National leagues will match up aainst each other.
 
FIRST GAME: San Francisco at Texas Thursday night, June 12. It will be the first, barring rain, because it is scheduled to start two hours earlier than the other three games scheduled that night.
 
NUMBER OF GAMES: In three separate periods, the schedule calls for 214 interleague games: 84 June 12-18, 46 June 30-July 3, 84 Aug. 28-Sept. 3.
 
INTRIGUING MATCHUPS: Geographic rivals, such as Yankees and Mets, White Sox and Cubs, Expos and Blue Jays. Also series pairing teams that played memorable World Series, like Mets and Red Sox. One of the first series has the Orioles playing the Braves in a matchup of the teams with the best record in each league.
 
DRAWBACKS: People who are called traditionalists don't like the possibility of teams meeting in the World Series after having played during the regular season.
 
METS VS. YANKEES: They have played 103 exhibition games, the last during spring training 1996. The Yankees have won 59 games, the Mets 43; one game ended in a tie. (pg. 19)

HEADLINE: LIVES ON FILE: The Erosion of Privacy -- A special report.;
Personal Files Via Computer Offer Money and Pose Threat

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
It was past midnight when Beverly Dennis came home, weary from her second-shift factory job, and found a letter with a Texas postmark among the bills and circulars in the day's mail. As she read it in her small house in Massillon, Ohio, alone in the dark stare of the sliding glass doors, her curiosity turned to fear.
The letter was from a stranger who seemed to know all about her, from her birthday to the names of her favorite magazines, from the fact that she was divorced to the kind of soap she used in the shower. And he had woven these details of her private life into 12 handwritten pages of intimately threatening sexual fantasy. 
 "It can only be in letters at the moment," the man wrote after describing the sexual acts he planned. "Maybe later, I can get over to see you."
The explanation that eventually emerged deepened Ms. Dennis's sense of violation -- and places her experience at the heart of a far-reaching national debate over legal protection for privacy in a world where personal information is ever easier to mine and market.
The letter writer was a convicted rapist and burglar serving time in a Texas state prison. He had learned Ms. Dennis's name, address and other personal information from one of the product questionnaires that she and millions of other consumers had received in the mail, innocently completed and sent back to post office boxes in Nebraska and New York on the promise of coupons and free samples. Their answers were delivered by the truckload to the Texas prison system, which was under contract to handle the surveys for the Metromail Corporation, a leading seller of direct marketing information. Hundreds of unpaid inmates, many of them sex offenders, entered the information on computer tapes for Metromail, which has a detailed data base on more than 90 percent of American households.
To Ms. Dennis, a woman in her 50's who grew up in the coal country of southern Ohio, it was as though her privacy had been strip mined by the dark side of the information economy.
Indeed, as the free-flowing exchange and exploitation of information is being celebrated as the main engine of economic prosperity into the next century, individual privacy is looking more and more like an endangered natural resource.
Hunger for personal information is now growing explosively in almost every sector of the nation's economy and everyday life: health care, entertainment, banking and supermarket sales. It is being spurred and sharpened by powerful market forces and ever more pervasive computer technology, including digital mapping tools and so-called "data-mining" software that blast commercial value from newly linked data bases of unprecedented size.
Yet like the people whose private lives and public records passed through the fingers of Texas felons, most Americans have no idea what is happening to the stream of personal data that they shed just by living in the modern world. And most businesses that make money on the collection, recombination and sale of shards of personal information maintain that people need no legal right to know, and have no good reason to object.
The electronic deposits keep growing with the pulse of daily life: telephone calls, checkout counters, A.T.M.'s, and electronic bridge tolls, the street gaze of security cameras, plastic insurance cards imprinted with the Social Security numbers that have become identity's common currency, and its easy counterfeit.
The Internet, where every keystroke can be archived, is now the most dramatic embodiment of what technology and commerce afford in the real world: the pooling of ever more vast stores of data and the easy retrieval of individual specks with no one's say-so.
This networked world of information is an economic powerhouse that creates new jobs, new services and astonishing efficiencies. It offers a wide range of consumer benefits, including easy credit, shopping convenience and customized goods and services. It also turns commonplace transactions into little revelations.
When a clerk puts a supermarket discount card through the scanner, for example, a data base links the shopper's identity with the bar code on every item bought. A love of rich chocolate cookies not only can be tracked over time, but matched with an individual's address, age, weight and ethnicity, with marital status and credit standing and even with religious ties, to name just a few of the personal facts being bought and sold wholesale in today's booming information market.
A class-action lawsuit that Ms. Dennis filed last year against Metromail and its subcontractors is emblematic of the growing conflict over privacy as people learn how little they control the use of personal information that is an increasingly valuable corporate asset.
"Privacy will be to the information economy what consumer protection and product safety were to the industrial age," Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, warned at Federal Trade Commission hearings on electronic consumer privacy last year. This week, the F.T.C. is holding another round of hearings on the issue.
But as Ms. Dennis has learned during a three-year struggle for redress, any battle for privacy today is an uphill fight, and individuals have an inherent disadvantage.
Ms. Dennis spent sleepless nights trying to figure out the stranger's identity. She finally turned to local television news reporters for investigative help and searched for more than a year before she found a lawyer willing to take on a novel and demanding case without pay.
But when Metromail executives wanted to know more about the woman suing the company, their task was simple: They turned to the company's own massive consumer data base, and retrieved more than 900 tidbits of Ms. Dennis's life going back to 1987. Laid out on 25 closely printed pages of spreadsheets were not only her income, marital status, hobbies and ailments, but whether she had dentures, the brands of antacid tablets she had taken, how often she had used room deodorizers, sleeping aids and hemorrhoid remedies.
"Attached is all we know concerning Beverly Dennis," Dave Hansen, an information technology systems analyst, wrote in a May 3, 1996, memorandum circulated to top executives and the chief lawyer for Metromail, which had $281 million in revenues last year and has budgeted $1.5 million to fight the case. The memo was one of the internal documents the company was recently required to turn over to the plaintiffs under discovery rulings by a state court in Travis County, Tex.
The company dossier on Ms. Dennis illustrates a central issue in the privacy debate: Information collected in one context can be reused in entirely unanticipated and even hostile ways without the knowledge or consent of the individuals involved. United States law offers them little recourse.
The Supreme Court has recognized an unwritten right to privacy in the Constitution, but has essentially limited this right to the individual's "reasonable expectation" of privacy. That approach, privacy experts say, means the steep but silent erosion of privacy by technological and economic change keeps narrowing the right to protection that an individual can successfully claim in court as "reasonable," especially since privacy is weighed against competing interests, like law enforcement or freedom of the press. And like the unwritten constitutional right to privacy, most of the nation's patchwork of privacy legislation aims to protect individuals from government, not from the actions of private industry.
Metromail maintains in court that it did nothing wrong and that Ms. Dennis has no reasonable claim to privacy because she disclosed the information herself in consumer surveys. The company, a leading member of the Direct Marketing Association that champions industry self-regulation, calls the case an aberration and adds that it no longer uses prison labor.
Because of the case, Texas is considering a ban on data entry by prisoners, but inmates in at least 27 other states handle public records like motor vehicle registrations, and Federal prisoners do such work for the Internal Revenue Service, among other public agencies. Prisons in at least five states reported contracts to process information for private businesses.
Public records are part of Metromail's information products. Its offerings include a "Behaviorbank" line that, for 4 cents to a quarter a piece, sells names, addresses and personal characteristics of respondents like Ms. Dennis to a wide assortment of clients, whether direct marketers, bill collectors, reporters and politicians. Metromail customers include the marketing departments of major magazines and newspapers, including The New York Times.
Four new plaintiffs recently joined the class action by name after their information showed up in records that the lawsuit forced from Metromail and its subcontractor, Computerized Image and Data Systems in Roslyn Heights, N.Y., which sent the work to the prisoners. Like Ms. Dennis, the new plaintiffs said they felt tricked by surveys headlined, "Spending Too Much. You Can Save Money at the Supermarket," or "No sweepstakes, no promises, no gimmicks. Just FREE coupons, samples and other special offers." The outrage they expressed goes well beyond the prisoners' access to such data.
One, Edward Boslet, a 36-year-old meat-cutter turned home health care technician in Plattsburgh, N.Y., summarized what to him is the heart of the matter.
"It's my information, it's not theirs," Mr. Boslet, a father of three, said in a telephone interview. "The bottom line is, I should have a right to know. I should have a right to choose who they're going to sell it to and what list I'm going to be on. There should be some way to govern what they do."
His convictions are not so far from the principles of fair information practice adopted by the European Union. But they are far from policy or practice in the United States.
Many people, especially in business, feel that is all to the good. They credit an unrestrained market in personal information as one reason for the United States' lead in the information economy.
"It's beneficial to the economy, it's beneficial to consumers," said Chet Dalzell, a spokesman for the Direct Marketing Association, the main trade group that is a longtime proponent of letting the industry regulate itself on privacy issues. Because the market can decide how to use personal information, he said, consumers get competitive offers of goods and services that are timely and relevant to their own lives, while businesses save on marketing costs.
"This isn't a war," Mr. Dalzell added. "This is the marketplace just trying to be intelligent." A recent study that the association commissioned from Ciemax-WEFA, an economics consulting company, said one of every 13 jobs in the United States was the result of direct marketing sales activity, including jobs designing and selling advertising, supplying or delivering goods, and selling other support services, like customer lists and profiles, to direct-response businesses. Direct-marketing sales to consumers reached $630 billion last year, up from $458 billion in 1991. Business-to-business sales were $540 billion in 1996, up from $349 billion in 1991, according to the Ciemax-WEFA report.
In other sectors, from health care to welfare, the ever more intensive use of personal information is being embraced as a way to cut costs and improve outcome, whether through employee "wellness" plans that discourage unhealthy life styles or through child-support enforcement programs that combine public and private sector data bases to find parents who are delinquent in child support payments.
But incidents like these across the country offer glimpses of the less visible trade-offs:
*At a car dealership in northern New Jersey, 15 employees used the company's access to the Big Three credit bureaus -- Equifax Inc., Trans Union and TRW Inc. -- to find strangers with good credit histories, living as far away as Alaska and Washington. They opened credit accounts in the customers' names, ordered thousands of dollars in products and left the victims to struggle to restore their credit ratings. What made the 1993 case unusual was that the culprits were caught. Quick credit and ready access to Social Security numbers have made "theft of identity" one of the fastest growing forms of credit fraud, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization. Officials at Trans Union said the credit bureau gets 45,000 to 50,000 calls a month from people complaining that their accounts have been taken over.
*A convicted child rapist working at a Boston area hospital in 1995 was accused of using a former employee's computer password to rifle through nearly 1,000 confidential files of patients for telephone numbers he used to make obscene calls to girls as young as 8 years old. Like many hospital systems, this one neither locked out defunct passwords nor triggered a warning when one person called up an unusual number of files. In an even more startling case, reported by The New York Times last year, a convicted pedophile in a Minnesota prison was accused of compiling a computerized data base of more than 5,000 children and babies, annotated with descriptions like "cute," "latchkey kids" and "Little Miss pageant winner." The lists, apparently pieced together from items in small-town newspapers, were stored with child pornography obtained over the Internet.
*Earlier this year, the Sara Lee Corporation asked a health maintenance company to survey and screen all 500 employees in its Mesilla Park, N.M., hosiery factory, for signs of depression that might underlie sick days and affect job performance. The plan was for the employees' personal physicians to consider prescribing antidepressants, according to an account in Fortune magazine that stressed the potential medical cost savings of the pilot project by Lovelace Health Systems, a subsidiary of the Cigna Corporation. Later, Anne Munsen, a spokeswoman for Lovelace, said the magazine account caused the project to be put on hold: the employees at the nonunion factory were not supposed to know the true purpose of the survey. "They didn't want it to be seen as a depression screening," she said, "they wanted it to be seen as a health-risk screening."
According to successive polls conducted by Louis Harris for Equifax in 1994 and 1995, 4 out of 5 Americans are concerned about threats to their personal privacy. This is a growing public relations problem for business, which has its own brand of privacy concerns: the ability to keep proprietary information "private" in a networked world competing for a data edge.
But a strong undercurrent dismisses privacy as "the ultimate subjective, touchy-feely issue," as Robert J. Posch Jr., a vice president at Doubleday and marketing law specialist, put it. In the trade magazine Direct Marketing, he scoffed that privacy was "just some notion of the right to be left alone. Spare me."
Both legal scholars and computer scientists who advocate more privacy rights for individuals contend that in the information economy, privacy is less about seclusion than about power and the personal autonomy necessary to democracy.
"Through the use of data banks, the state and private organizations can transform themselves into omnipotent parents and the rest of society into helpless children," wrote Paul M. Schwartz and Joel R. Reidenberg, two American lawyers who were commissioned by the European Union to study American data privacy law and who published their critical findings in a book last year. "Companies take the position that the use of personal information is in the best interests of customers. Yet these companies deny consumers the opportunity to judge for themselves."
The Clinton Administration has called for a balance between individual privacy and the needs of an increasingly information-driven economy, but like the two previous administrations it has made industry self-regulation the centerpiece of its privacy policy.
Critics contend that self-regulation amounts to little more than public relations and that the titans of information are despoiling democracy's inner landscape with as little restraint as the coal barons and oil trusts showed during laissez-faire industrial growth.
Ms. Dennis's case offers a rare look at the human dimension of the conflict and provides a road map to the hidden places along the way where gold is spun from the raw data of people's lives.
 
A Prison
In a Growth Industry, Inmates Process Data
In the heat-soaked shimmer of an August noon in 1996, in a field outside a Texas penitentiary, prisoners with hoes stood double file, before a lone guard on horseback. It was a tableau from an earlier era.
Okra and cotton are still raised by some of the 136,000 inmates serving time in the fifty-two prisons within the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. License plates still clatter from noisy machines manned by convicts inside the big Huntsville prison, southeast of Dallas, where visitors are given a bumper sticker that reads "Texas -- It's Like Another Country." But since 1968, when a Records Conversion Facility opened at the Wynne prison unit in Huntsville, information has been part of Texas prison industries.
On this day, thousands of boxes of public records were passing through the vast, low-slung steel-frame building, one of five such prison operations in the state, and one of dozens across the country. Under hanging fluorescent lights, an acre of men in dingy prison whites turned documents from public agencies into microfilm images and computer bytes.
"Anything and everything could be in here," said DeeWayne Beckham, the assistant plant manager. At random, he picked up a record from the Bexar County courts in San Antonio. It was a petition in a 1991 divorce case asking for child support for a girl named Megan.
There were patient progress reports from the Brenham State School for the mentally disabled in Brenham, motor vehicle titles from the Texas Department of Transportation, criminal investigation records from police and the state Attorney General's office. The last were stacked high behind a special wire mesh cage, for fear, Mr. Beckham said, that inmates would steal crime scene photographs and sell them.
"I've got murderers, and whatever else you can imagine," Mr. Beckham said cheerfully, passing a man with tattoos on three fingers in a group unstapling and sorting documents at a long table. Other prisoners fed the pages into microfilm machines that capture as many as 17,000 pages a day.
Nearby, inmates typed at computer keyboards, producing tapes from 30,000 applications for the government's Women, Infants and Children nutrition program for low-income pregnant women and young children.
This was the data-entry section where, under the unit's first and only private sector contract, inmates in three shifts handled thousands of Metromail's Shoppermail questionnaires each day in 1993 and 1994, as well as other Metromail surveys commissioned by Seventeen magazine, L'Oreal, Six Flags, Days Inns, R. J. Reynolds and Time-Life. The prison was paid $150,000 for the work.
Hal Parfait, the inmate serving seven years for breaking into a woman's house and raping her after threatening to kill her children, was transferred elsewhere after he wrote letters to at least two women whose identities and habits he had learned from the surveys.
But for about three months after his letter to Beverly Dennis came to light in 1994, the work continued pretty much the same way, records show. Then the Texas Legislature, responding to news accounts, barred sex offenders from record-entry work in prison. Overnight, Mr. Beckham lost 167 of his 430 inmate employees and eventually 187 of them.
It was the same in the other Texas prisons, said John Benestante, director of state prison industries. "We lost some damn good programmers -- pedophiles," he said. "Some of our best computer operatives were sex offenders."
But now Ms. Dennis was suing the Texas prison, and Mr. Benestante, a 6-foot-3 former air traffic controller, was deep in a review of all prison industry operations, especially those handling information for other public agencies, which pay by shifting public money to the Department of Corrections.
Problems in the past had included obscene "nasty-grams," inserted at random by prisoners stuffing envelopes for the Texas tourism department, and a ring accused of supplying car thieves with motor vehicle titles on commission. Well before the Dennis case, an inmate had used information on a motor vehicle title to contact a woman, and in a different department, an inmate managed to memorize a supervisor's Social Security number from a time sheet and ruin his credit rating.
Aside from the risks, he said, there were signs of shrinking demand, as more public agencies kept their records computerized from the start. But private companies were still eager to extract and compile valuable information from public records.
So Mr. Benestante had found a new high-tech information field with a promising commercial market, and had put the Ferguson prison, near Midway, Tex., ahead of the curve. Its former boot factory was a site for work in Geographic Information Systems, or G.I.S., a cutting-edge technology putting detailed maps and high resolution aerial photographs into computerized form.
How detailed? Plat records for Dallas show the position of the gas meter on each parcel. Aerial photographs of the city of Bryan, Tex., show the exact footprint of each house.
After the computer maps leave the prison, explained Robert Laake, the assistant administrator of the Ferguson "automated mapping-G.I.S." operation, "the Dallas planning and development department will place unique identifiers in each lot that will give them all the information they need: who lives there, what that block is worth."
The Ferguson prison has floor-to-ceiling crash gates and tiers of two-man, 5-by-9-foot cells. The work site can be reached only by passing through a shower area lined with urinals, and walking across a yard where the men are routinely strip-searched on their way to and from the job. On the day of the visit, no inmates were at work because of a "lock-down" imposed after a rash of stabbings.
But inside the building, one could have been in any office. Supervisors demonstrated the simple computer tasks performed by the inmates, 120 men with an average sentence of 32 years. The price of their work was right. The unit was digitizing Van Zandt County's maps for $19,880, compared with a private sector bid of $60,000.
"If you don't send this here, the next stop is India," said Marilyn Beckham, the plant manager, referring to "information sweatshops" in Asia, Mexico and the Caribbean where much data entry is now done.
The strong privacy concerns raised about G.I.S. have little to do with using prisoners for the grunt work. This technology is proving an astonishingly powerful and lucrative commercial tool to crunch information from public records and private sector data banks and to spit out house-by-house information that can include the tax assessment, the occupant's driver's license photograph and details of consumer behavior collected by the likes of Metromail.
But Angela Pugh, a supervisor for the G.I.S. project at Ferguson, shrugged off the issue.
"Is the government going to sacrifice the money that can be made for a little bit of privacy?" Ms. Pugh asked.
 
A Business Technology
Using Compiled Data To Map Out Profiles
On an idyllic campus in Orono, Me., a professor who helped nurture the technology known as G.I.S. now wrestles with its dangers.
As Harlan Onsrud tells it, G.I.S. is a case study on the way new technology can change old stores of information into commercial gold and social dynamite. The story of its success, he said, underscores that both technological advances and sweeping business mergers have exploded old boundaries, leaving in the dust the sector-by-sector privacy legislation of the last three decades.
G.I.S. started as a way to map land, sea and sky across space and time. It has had enormously beneficial social uses, from pinpointing the origin of Legionnaire's disease to helping South Florida communities coordinate emergency relief after Hurricane Andrew.
But "there is no doubt that some uses, although currently legal, would be considered by most citizens in the U.S. to be highly intrusive and inappropriate," contended Mr. Onsrud, chairman of the University of Maine's department of Spatial Information Science and Engineering, part of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis.
In one G.I.S. application, businesses can feed car license numbers from a parking lot into a program and retrieve a customer's name, address, census tract information and demographic characterizations like "Hardscrabble," "Sharecroppers," and "Furs and Station Wagons." Another program transforms a telephone number into a detailed profile of each prospective customer who calls an 800 number.
Public spaces are increasingly monitored electronically -- for convenience, safety and traffic planning. But G.I.S. allows the results of this surveillance to be mapped with precision, identified by an individual's name or vehicle number without their knowledge, and correlated to a wealth of other information, including data culled from computerized public records of the kind the Texas prisoners have processed for 30 years.
Increasingly, cash-strapped government agencies are selling packaged public information to businesses or entering joint ventures to make the information more attractive to marketers.
Only a decade ago, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation sought clearance to enter all national databases, Congress said no.
"Now the commercial market has done it for them," Mr. Onsrud said. Government agencies like the F.B.I. "just have to pay like anybody else."
In the last three years or so, G.I.S. has spawned a booming "Geo Business" industry that applies its power to profile people and households for data-based marketing, health care, insurance, real estate and financial services. All three major credit bureaus and other giants in the information field have acquired or merged with G.I.S. mapping companies. They have forged new partnerships with big suppliers of data and data-mining software, and bought companies that deliver information to desktop computers on CD's or over the Internet. Their products include data bases that are continuously updated and parsed to yield an unprecedented level of detail on nearly everyone in the nation.
If information is like money, a company called the Acxiom Corporation is one of the merchant bankers of the age. Set in an industrial park in Conway, Ark., north of Little Rock, the corporate headquarters has a cathedral lobby with a facade of glass. But its heart is behind the locked doors of what a guide calls "the production war rooms," low-ceilinged bunkers where six robots inside small linked silos match data tapes at 60 miles an hour, while 20 mainframe computers swallow 1.3 billion bytes of data a second. G.I.S. is just part of the information infrastructure.
Acxiom's revenue grew by almost 50 percent in fiscal 1997, to $402 million. Its top customers include data kings like the AT&T Corporation, Wal-Mart Stores, Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, I.B.M., the Allstate Corporation and Automatic Data Processing Inc., which handles half the payrolls in America. The company now crunches all data for Trans Union. And last year R. R. Polk and Company, which says it collects and markets automotive and consumer information on 95 percent of the nation's households, used eight tractor-trailers to move its mother lode of data tapes from Michigan to a special warehouse in Conway.
This is a place where visitors are issued badges that turn purple if they leave the building -- part of the aura of security Acxiom wants to convey to customers nervous about leaving their treasured customer data bases where their competitors also come to buy and barter for more data on their own customers, more names to "populate" computer models of their best prospects.
Many members of the information industry say technology is simply recreating the intimacy of small-town America in the days when the storekeeper knew all his customers by name, habit and history. But Mr. Onsrud, whose village in coastal Maine actually embodies that small-town ideal, flatly rejects the analogy.
"It's not an equal or mutual relationship,' he said. "We have information insiders and outsiders."
 
A Life and a Lawsuit
A Woman's Privacy Invaded By Industry
Beverly Dennis grew up in almost pre-industrial scarcity in a house her grandfather built himself. It had no electricity, no running water, and no indoor toilet to the day he died at 99. He never owned a car.
"I was raised very poor," Ms. Dennis said, sitting at the dining table in her carefully tended home. "My grandma used to boil her clothes on a stove, scrub on a washboard in the cold of winter. We didn't have much, but there was so much love."
Now Ms. Dennis has all the creature comforts of the industrial revolution, but she works standing at a noisy machine, stamping out 1,500 plastic bobbins an hour for less than $80 a day. "It's fast-paced work," said Ms. Dennis whose finger was recently mangled on the job. "I don't know how long I'll be able to do it."
For a few months several years ago, she had happily joined the brave new information economy at the Canton, Ohio, office of a national collection agency, G.E. Capital, owned by the General Electric Company. Computers automatically dialed telephone numbers from a disk, and each debtor's name, address, and payment history appeared on her computer screen. Ms. Dennis was monitored electronically as she followed a script demanding payment for things as diverse as Apple Macintosh computers and children's shoes.
She failed to pass probation. "They told me I was too nice to be a collector," said Ms. Dennis, who raised two daughters on her own.
But this soft-spoken woman has a stubborn sense of justice, and it has carried her through tough times in a lawsuit that is trying to break new ground.
Last August, two of Metromail's lawyers questioned her for almost seven hours during a deposition in Austin, Tex. They wanted to know her Social Security number, her unlisted telephone number, when she had last dated and whether she drank. They probed into her health care and medication history, and had her name all her fellow employees. One of the Catch-22's of privacy litigation is its sacrifice of privacy.
Ms. Dennis, who earns less than $16,000 a year, said after she learned the identity of the inmate, she borrowed money to put in security lights, deadbolt locks, new windows and an alarm system in an unsuccessful effort to allay her pervasive sense of fear. Mr. Parfait, originally due to be released in 1995, is now to be freed next year.
"It's made me a different person," she said, describing sleepless nights, more frequent migraines and lost wages. "I can only tell you that I would give everything that I have if this would never have happened to me, because I am scared each and every day of everything, and I trust nobody after this."
Ms. Dennis said she wanted to warn other people so they would not make her mistake. But Shannon H. Ratliff, a lawyer for Metromail, suggested she had shown indifference to her privacy by giving her unlisted telephone number to Mark DeMarino, an investigative reporter at the Cleveland television station WJW-TV who helped her uncover the Metromail link, and by appearing with him on Geraldo Rivera's television show. The lawyer even asked why she had not sued the local station, since information from its reporter had upset her.
This was a line of attack rooted in the weaknesses of privacy case law, which has tended to see privacy as a "right to be left alone," in Justice Louis D. Brandeis's famous phrase, and to let that right collapse the moment personal information is surrendered for any reason.
But the critical issue today, privacy law experts agree, is usually not whether personal data should be collected and processed, but how data should and should not be used. Preserving privacy in this context is about the autonomy necessary to make decisions. That, too, has been recognized as a privacy interest by the Supreme Court -- most notably in its decisions on abortion and contraception -- but has not been developed much beyond decisions involving family and sex.
Privacy laws have been so narrow and spotty that the names of the movies rented at the video store where Ms. Dennis works on weekends are legally protected, but pay-per-view movies ordered at home are not. Medical andor pharmacy records are also not protected either and though the privacy of credit reports has been a matter of Federal law since 1970, a huge market in the information they contain has grown through its loopholes.
"The law of privacy has not kept up with the modern advances in technology, the modern rise of data transfer and information collection," Michael Lenett, Ms. Dennis's lawyer at the Cuneo Law Group in Washington, argued when the suit was filed last year. "This is the first case squarely to present the issue, who owns your personal and private information? Who controls it?"
But in April, when Mr. Lenett was still battling to get internal company documents, a judge in Travis County threw out the case's claim against the prison; an appeal is planned. The court ruled in part that misuse of information did not constitute misuse of property under the Texas Tort Claims Act, which makes the state immune from most damage suits.
"She's not complaining that somebody took a data-entry machine and whacked her on the head with it," explained Lin Hughes of Austin, Tex., a lawyer for Metromail.
The ruling leaves the claims against Metromail and its former parent, R. R Donnelley & Sons: that the company unjustly enriched itself, and violated the privacy interests of the members of the class by fraudulently inducing them to provide personal information without disclosing how it would be processed and sold, and that it recklessly endangered their safety and inflicted emotional distress by negligently allowing felons to handle the information. The lawsuit seeks damages to be determined later and injunctive relief, including notification to all whose surveys went through the prison.
The company insisted in an unsuccessful motion to dismiss the case that it had no legal duty to tell consumers that the surveys would be processed by inmates. The facts consumers disclosed were not "highly intimate or embarrassing," the company argued, nor were they disclosed to the public at large.
Another cause of action recognized in Texas is conduct so "extreme and outrageous" that it is intolerable, and inflicts severe emotional distress. But, the company argued, "The mere receipt of a letter in the mail from an incarcerated inmate is not so extreme as to satisfy this standard."
Outside the courtroom, the company said its subcontractor was responsible for the prison work, and said that the job was stopped the same day Metromail learned of it. Internal documents tell a different story: Data tapes and surveys at the Texas prison were among the assets Metromail bought in 1993 when it acquired CMT, a marketing list company, and shipments and letters between the prison plant and Metromail continued until the work was finished, about three months after the letter came to light.
Documents gained through discovery also brought the four additional named plaintiffs to the case.
"I know the potential is out there to abuse people's information, but I really never gave it too much thought until I realized that my own information passed through the hands of a rapist or murderer," said one plaintiff, Patricia Mendiola, a part-time hospital lab technician in Wheaton, Ill., who is married to a systems analyst and has two children. "It made me so mad, the realization that all of this information ends up in a big data bank."
Robert DeSantis, who lives in Silicon Valley and was a civilian employee of two California military bases that closed, said that as a gay man, he worried about hate groups that could use such data bases to harass minorities.
Frenchie Holmes, a former fraud investigator for Pacific Bell in San Jose, Calif., who is now on disability, said she had been gullible. "You think they're going to send you products and trash that information, but they sell it. You fill out just one questionnaire and all of a sudden the whole world knows who you are."
Tim Fitzpatrick, a Metromail spokesman, said such sentiments were not common. "We certainly do not feel there's a class of people harmed as a result of this," he said. "Millions of people every year utilize direct marketing as a way to get things done. Millions of people are benefiting from it."
Indeed, Ms. Dennis counts herself as one of them. With two jobs, she shops by mail. "A new pair of curtains can make me so happy," she said. She does not know why the price should include her privacy.
"They are making millions of dollars off other people's lives who don't even know what they're doing," Ms. Dennis said. "They have turned my whole life upside down."

BYLINE: By Ruth Reichl 

 BODY:
Truly great restaurateurs share an essential quality: generosity.
Maurizio de Rosa is a generous man. He showers his customers with attention and tidbits, willing them to love the food and wines of his native Naples. "Taste this!" he urges, pressing pizzette frolle upon you. He stands watching as the warm, crusty turnovers spill fresh, creamy cheese into your mouth. "Good?" he asks, as you savor the slight sourness of real ricotta. Very good. 
 No wonder: Mr. de Rosa has a secret weapon. His mother, Rita de Rosa, is in the kitchen, and she is an awesome cook. "Oh, my mother makes those," Mr. de Rosa says offhandedly when you ask where the wonderful anchovies come from. "She peels and marinates them herself." The result is something very fine: a clean, clear flavor that whets your appetite for the rest of the meal.
Mr. de Rosa's wife, Nena, helps out in the dining room, and his brother Bruno shares the kitchen with their mother. The entire family seems intent on changing our notions of Neapolitan food. When Americans discovered the cooking of northern Italy the word "Tuscan" became shorthand for "not made with heavy red sauce." At the same time we began to disdain the food of the south and "southern Italian" came to mean the old-fashioned garlic-laden meatballs-and-spaghetti fare served in Italian-American restaurants.
But there are no red-checked tablecloths at De Rosa. No Chianti bottles swing from the elegant beamed ceilings. The tiled floors and mosaic trim are as spare and attractive as the food, which is characterized by restraint instead of excess. Naples has a proud culinary history, and real Neapolitan cooking depends upon fresh ingredients used with economy. Mrs. de Rosa tends to surround the main element with a few sharp flavors to bring out its essential nature. Nothing is ever overblown.
Her cozze al gratte, six small sweet mussels anchored in a bed of salt and topped with nothing more than herb-flavored bread crumbs, are a far cry from anything you would find on Mulberry Street. Her roasted pepper looks small and unassuming, a pretty little red pillow. But the filling is made of eggplant, capers and black olives, and it creates a flavor explosion in the mouth. Seafood salad is a simple toss of shellfish dressed in lemon, but each clam, each slice of squid, is impeccably cooked. Fegatini di pollo tastes unapologetically of what it is: chicken livers. Sauteed with a bit of vinegar, they arrive piled onto thick slices of toasted bread. It is extremely satisfying.
Pastas are similarly understated. One is topped with a reserved onion ragu and mixed with pecorino cheese. The pale still life is sweet and delicious. So is ziti cacio e ova, a mixture of small tubular pasta with cheese and eggs, which resonates with flavor. Ravioli come filled with mozzarella in a clear butter sauce speckled with sage. And strangolapreti (priest stranglers) are fluffy little bits of handmade pasta tossed with broccoli and cheese. Note that none of these pastas have anything to do with tomatoes.
You will find a bit of tomato cooked into the shrimp ragu served with the gnocchi di piselli. The red fruit and rosy seafood create an attractive backdrop for the pale green gnocchi.
Italians tend to eat slowly and discuss their food; each time I have eaten at De Rosa the sound of Italian voices has filled the dining room. As the conversation turned to wine, Mr. de Rosa's voice was added to the mix: he is a passionate advocate of the wines of Campania, and his eyes flash when he speaks of the aglianico, fiano and falanghina grapes unique to the region. When I asked him to choose the wines for our meals, I discovered a whole new range of flavors. Did I really taste the minerals in the soil, or did his enthusiasm make me imagine that I did?
In many Italian restaurants pasta is the centerpiece of each meal. Here, too, De Rosa surprised me; I loved the main courses. Rack of lamb with rosemary and potatoes was impressively delicious. Medallions of veal were sauteed in a sweet lemon liquor and sprinkled with capers, which created an interestingly sour contrast. A thick slice of tuna arrived in a different sweet-and-sour sauce while trout was allowed to stand on its own with nothing but a plate of zucchini and carrots on the side.
But the best of the main courses was extraordinarily tender octopus served in a tomato broth. The octopus-eaters were so taken with the dish that friends who do not normally dine on tentacles dared to try it; more important, they liked it.
I can't say I was similarly impressed with dessert. Neapolitan desserts tend to be very sweet, and they are often perfumed with orange water. The cheesecake and cassata were true to form. But Mr. de Rosa is not about to let you leave his restaurant without something sweet. "Try these," he says, setting down a plate of his mother's sugar cookies.
But that is not the end. Now Mr. de Rosa offers the family's own brightly colored liqueurs. The lemon is lovely, and the one made of spinach and mint is curiously refreshing. "Just a little," he entreats, holding out the bottle.
How can you possibly refuse such generosity?

Pre-Broadway Runs in London
It's been a week for tinkering with the old Broadway formulas. In a bold move, the Jujamcyn theater chain signed a production and distribution alliance with the Pace Theatrical Group with the aim of creating a theatrical studio system to rival Disney and Livent. The new team will focus its attention on musicals.
On a much smaller scale, the veteran producer Alexander H. Cohen and his partner, Max Cooper, have devised an intriguing little alliance intended to bring more straight plays to Broadway. 
 Mr. Cohen and Mr. Cooper have entered into a partnership with Duncan C. Weldon, one of London's most prolific producers. It gives them first look at the 20 or so plays that Mr. Weldon produces through the Chichester Festival, of which he is director, and through his production company, Triumph Productions.
When Mr. Weldon decides to move a play from a regional theater to London, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Cooper will move with it as co-producers. If the London run works out, the entire package becomes eligible for a trans-Atlantic crossing.
"What Alex is doing is taking advantage of my quantity of product, and the fact that costs in London are a fraction of those in New York," said Mr. Weldon. London, and the English hinterlands even more so, are cheap enough to make England a tempting place to start a pre-Broadway tour.
Mr. Cohen said: "You can open in Guildford for $75,000, go on tour and bring it into the West End for $150,000 to $200,000." The Broadway price would be about $1.5 million, and even the cut-rate package known as the Broadway Alliance costs $850,000.
At the moment, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Cooper have three co-productions up and running. The first is Peter Whelan's "Herbal Bed," a fact-based drama about a slander trial involving Shakespeare's daughter. The play, originally produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company, is now playing at the Duchess Theater in the West End. The partners plan to bring it to Broadway early in 1998.
On Tuesday, Simon Gray's new play, "Life Support," opened at the Yvonne Arnaud Theater in Guildford for a pre-London run, with Alan Bates in the lead role and Harold Pinter directing. In early September, the partners will present a new play by Hugh Whitemore, "A Letter of Resignation," at the same theater. Edward Fox will star and Christopher Morahan will direct.
Another peculiarity of the arrangement is the use of a blind pool. Investors who sign up for the Broadway leg of the journey will not know what play they are investing in. Essentially, they will be pledging their faith that the partners can pick a winner. Broadway economics make it a gamble. "Skylight" made money this season, but Mr. Cohen and Mr. Cooper's two most recent outings, "Sacrilege" and "Taking Sides," got lost along the treacherous road to profitability.
"Who knows whether this will work?" said Mr. Weldon. "But with costs rising the way they are, the straight play is becoming endangered. The only alternative to trying something like this is not to produce at all."
 
Betty Buckley as a Motherly Ascetic
 "Triumph of Love," the first musical of the new season, is a small production with some big names. Betty Buckley's leads the list. Ms. Buckley, fully recovered from her labors in "Sunset Boulevard," will join F. Murray Abraham, Susan Egan and Elayne Boosler in a musical version of the play by Marivaux. "Murray Abraham and I are brother and sister," she said. "We're philosophes and ascetics who raise a young prince in a very intellectual way to deny his emotions." Ms. Egan, who played Belle in "Beauty and the Beast" and Meg in "Hercules," puts the teachings to the test. "Triumph" begins performances in mid-September at the Walter Kerr Theater.
Since stepping down as Norma Desmond, Ms. Buckley has been busy doing concerts, and recording an as-yet-untitled CD with orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick, who recently won a Tony for his work on "Titanic." Yesterday she headed off to Bozeman, Mont., for a cameo role in the new Robert Redford film, "The Horse Whisperer." This may sound like odd casting, but it isn't.
"I'm a cowgirl from Texas," Ms. Buckley said. "My dream was to be a world-champion barrel-racer." Broadway interrupted that plan, but "The Horse Whisperer" is a kind of consolation prize. "I get to wear a pair of cool chaps," Ms. Buckley said. "Then I come back and don my 18th-century garb for 'Triumph of Love.' "
 
10 New Members of the Tony Panel
 There are 10 new faces on the 28-member Tony nominating committee. They are Billie Allen, an actress and director; Maureen Anderman, an actress; the producer Morton Gottlieb; Allen Lee Hughes, a lighting designer; Betty Jacobs, a script consultant; Jack Lee, a musical director; the playwright Romulus Linney; Jon Nakagawa, a managing director; the author and composer Polly Pen, and the playwright Lanford Wilson. The 28 members serve three-year terms.
 
Unsung Before, Unsung Again
 Ring down the curtain on "Lost in Boston" and "Unsung Musicals," the CD series on Varese Sarabande devoted to songs that cannot be described as has-beens because they never were. In a labor of love, the four volumes of "Lost in Boston" have presented songs that were cut from hit musicals en route to Broadway. "Unsung Musicals" has offered songs from flops.
Bruce Kimmel, the producer of both series, decided to leave 'em wanting more. Or maybe less, since the final installment of "Lost in Boston" includes outtakes from "Big," "Drat! The Cat!" and "Goldilocks."
"The original concept for this series was to do only cut songs from hit shows," Mr. Kimmel said. "However, for this volume, we've delved into some marginal hits and some that were, to be kind, not even marginal hits."
The sound of barrel scraping is unmistakable on "Unsung Musicals III," which perpetrates a selection of tunes from box-office uglies like "Freaky Friday," 'Smile" and "Brownstone."
Mr. Kimmel leaves with one regret. He was been unable to obtain the rights to "Carrie."
"Those people still think they will rewrite the thing and present it again," Mr. Kimmel said. "It's sort of frightening."
 
New Play by A. R. Gurney
 "The Guest Lecturer," a new play by A. R. Gurney, will have its first public presentation on Monday at 8 P.M. at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, as part of the library's Reading Room Readings series. Mr. Gurney said the play was about a graduate drama student who visits a successful regional theater and "gets enmeshed in a primitive tribal ritual."

HEADLINE: COMEDY REVIEW;
When One-Liners Get Help From the Acoustics

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
Comedy doesn't go to Carnegie Hall very often. In large part, that's because there are few comics who can sell out a place that big, as Steven Wright and Paula Poundstone did on Wednesday night in one of the headline performances of the Toyota Comedy Festival. It's a shame there isn't more comedy at Carnegie Hall, because the acoustics are perfect for it. When only a few people are laughing, it sounds as if the entire place is in hysterics.
Ms. Poundstone and Mr. Wright are both strong performers, but where Ms. Poundstone is a great conversationalist, Mr. Wright is a great writer. He may be known and loved as the deadpan comedian, but what is more interesting is his surreal bent, his wordplay and his economy of language. One sits there wondering how he can come up with so many jokes that are just five words: "I have a half-twin." "I'm writing an unauthorized autobiography." "What's another word for thesaurus?" "Hermits have no peer pressure." 
 In concert, he mixes one-liners like Henny Youngman's, the jaded tone of a Phillip Marlowe, the linguistic deconstruction of Ludwig Wittgenstein and the surreal provocation of Luis Bunuel. Since there are no references in his routine to any current events, he could be doing the exact same act 20 years from now. Fortunately, he keeps adding newer and stranger jokes.
In contrast, Ms. Poundstone rarely performs the same act twice. She spent half her show interacting with the audience and commenting on the building. "They have vents in the ceiling," she said. "That's in case the building flips over and floods."
In a highlight of her set, she noticed a woman in the sixth row staring at her through binoculars and gave her a close-up by walking to the woman's seat and rifling through the woman's bag, which, with three containers of hair spray made for ample comedy. Her set ran smoothly until the end, when stagehands were very unsubtly trying to signal her that her time was up as she was trying to think of a joke that would leave the audience laughing. After some fumbling, she found one.
Unlike comedy's two major annual events, the HBO Comedy Festival in Aspen, Colo., and Just for Laughs in Montreal, the Toyota Comedy Festival is geared for general audiences, not for the entertainment industry. Instead of presenting a cavalcade of showcases and panels, it offers 10 days of straightforward performances, as many as 18 a day.
Some of tonight's highlights include: Jackie (the Joke Man) Martling at Town Hall; Live on Tape at Catch a Rising Star, 235 West 28th Street, Manhattan; David Sedaris at Barnes & Noble, 1972 Broadway, at 66th Street, and Eddie Brill, Dave Attell, Greg Fitzsimmons and Greg Giraldo at the South Street Seaport. Tomorrow's programs include: Janeane Garofalo and Friends at Irving Plaza, 15th Street at Irving Place, Manhattan; the Sklar Twins at Catch a Rising Star, and, for those who like seeing the envelope pushed, the Serious Pratfalls Variety Show at Surf Reality, 172 Allen Street, Lower East Side. Richard Jeni and Paul Mooney are at Caroline's, 1626 Broadway, at 49th Street, tonight and tomorrow. Information: (800) 798-6968.

Dollar Surges as Yen Is Called Too Strong by Japan Official

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar snapped a weeklong decline yesterday with the biggest one-day jump against the yen in nearly two years after Japan's top foreign-exchange policy maker said the yen was too strong.
Traders who had bet on further dollar drops scrambled to buy the dollar instead as it rose on the comments by Eisuke Sakakibara, the influential director of the Finance Ministry's international finance bureau, early in the trading day. 
 The resulting surge in demand temporarily pushed the dollar up by more than 4 yen in what is known as a short-covering rally, and contributed to the dollar's advance in most other foreign-exchange dealings.
The dollar touched an intraday high of 115.70 yen before easing to settle in New York at 114.25 yen, up 3.05 yen, or 2.7 percent, from 111.20 yen on Wednesday. It was the biggest one-day rise in the dollar against the yen since a 4.15-yen advance Aug. 15, 1995, and erased much of the dollar's retreat over the last week from worries about United States-Japanese trade antagonism.
The dollar also traded at 1.7300 marks, up from 1.7160 Wednesday and the highest level since May 5. The pound cost $1.6316, down from $1.6377.
Traders attributed some of the dollar's rise to continued worry about Europe's single currency plan, toned-down rhetoric from United States officials about Japan's trade surplus and another record advance in the United States stock market on benign inflation data, which invigorated the global appetite for dollars.
But the main catalyst for the dollar's rally apparently was Mr. Sakakibara, who is widely viewed as the architect of Japan's foreign-exchange policy. At a Tokyo financial seminar on Thursday, Mr. Sakakibara said the currency market had been overemphasizing Japan's trade surplus in betting on a lower dollar and higher yen, which traders took to mean the yen was too strong. He also said Japan would take decisive steps to battle excessive currency moves.
"He was talking the dollar down a couple of weeks ago, and now he comes out and says he's afraid the yen's appreciating too quickly," said Lee Kassler at the Israel Discount Bank in New York. "That put the brakes on the dollar's decline very quickly."

Maya Dress Tells a New Story, and It's Not Pretty

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAN PEDRO SACATEPEQUEZ, Guatemala

 BODY:
For centuries, beginning long before the Spanish arrived here, the Maya women of Guatemala have worn the colorful embroidered blouses called huipiles as a badge of identity.
With their bright patterns and ornate, hand-sewn images of quetzals, jaguars and other beasts, the garments have even acquired a noticeable cachet among European and American collectors in recent years. 
 But in towns like this one, where Maya weavers exalted by their people and critics as "artists of the loom" still ply their age-old craft, that tradition is in jeopardy -- a result of three decades of civil war, which ended last December with a peace accord between the Government and left-wing guerrillas, and the economic, social and religious changes that the war brought.
"It saddens me to think that this tradition of our people, which I learned from my grandmother when I was a girl of 8, is now dying out," said Florencia Apixola Chuquiej, 55, a venerated weaver here who earns up to $400 for one of her brilliantly hued tunics. "Before the violence, we used to make huipiles for everyone, but now, not all of them want to dress this way."
Curiously, the threat to tradition comes as the 21 Maya ethnic groups that constitute two-thirds of Guatemala's population of 10.5 million are experiencing a reassertion of racial identity and pride. Those seeking to preserve and revitalize weaving as an essential custom, though, worry that the havoc and suffering the country has endured may make their task impossible.
"The peace process has helped us, because it has fomented a cultural analysis and re-evaluation" among Maya groups, said Rosario Miralbes de Polanco, curator of the Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Dress in Guatemala City. "But more changes have occurred since 1980 than during the previous century, and it would be excessively optimistic to think that everything can be recovered."
The greatest of those traumas, of course, was the war itself, which was largely fought in rural areas where Maya groups lived, leaving more than 100,000 dead and 40,000 more missing.
At the height of the conflict, in the early 1980's, the Guatemalan military mounted a scorched-earth campaign intended to annihilate Indian villages seen as sympathetic to the guerrillas, who had made indigenous rights part of their platform.
To the Maya, huipiles (pronounced wee-PEEL-es) include an easily understood visual code, conveying vital information about the wealth, age and ethnicity of the wearer. And because each village takes pride in evolving its own distinctive design for blouses produced there, soldiers who were themselves of Maya descent could readily identify, and detain or kill, women from areas designated for assault.
"Many people had to change their dress so as to say they were not from a particular place," said Otilia Lux de Coti, a prominent Maya educator and indigenous rights advocate who continues to wear traditional dress and is a leader of what is being called the Maya Renaissance. "Not to do so would have put their lives in grave danger."
The brutality of the war also displaced as many as a million Maya from their ancestral lands. Many young Indian women ended up in the capital, where they were exposed to the broader Spanish-speaking culture, including the wildly popular Mexican soap operas that are an important source of standards of beauty and fashion, and abandoned their traditional dress.
Still others fled to refugee camps in southern Mexico. There, Maya from different parts of the country, with different languages and traditions, were thrown together, leading to an erosion of village-specific customs and the beginning of a type of hybrid style.
"Dress is one piece of the whole fabric of life, and when that fabric is torn, recreating the dress becomes difficult," said Carol Hendrickson, an expert on Maya society who teaches at Marlboro College in Vermont. "When your life has been shattered, when you're on the run and have very few materials to make new clothing, how do you carry on a tradition like that?"
More recently, thousands of young Maya women have flocked to South Korean-owned textile plants that have sprung up on the outskirts of the capital, with mass production lines that make T-shirts and underwear for the American market.
Three nieces of Ms. Apixola, for example, make a long daily commute to such a factory.
"They come home very tired from the long hours they work, and so they don't want to weave," she said. "A lot of these young girls don't even know how to weave at all, and are satisfied to put on any old machine-made blouse. Their mothers don't insist they learn, and it doesn't matter to them what they wear."
Uprooted from their historic milieu, large numbers of Maya have also embraced evangelical Protestant sects, which frown on the colorful displays and pagan symbolism characteristic of huipiles.
The wearing of traditional dress has been encouraged by the example of prominent Maya women like Rigoberta Menchu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992 and wore a huipil when she went to Oslo to receive the award. And Guatemala's National Assembly includes women who make a point of wearing their huipiles to all official functions.
Weavers in some Maya towns have been prodded to form cooperatives to export huipiles to Western Europe and the United States. They have also been urged to branch out and apply their traditional designs to items like pillowcases and napkins, again mostly for the delectation of non-Maya connoisseurs.
But that effort is likely to be blocked by a new regulation that is to go into effect this summer in Europe, restricting imports of textiles made with synthetic dyes. All huipiles were made with natural dyes until the late 1800's, when European manufacturers introduced brighter synthetic dyes, and now the knowledge of how to make and use natural dyes has largely been lost.
"I fear we are going to lose the richness and variety of huipiles," said Cherri M. Pancake, an ethnographer who teaches at Oregon State University. "That is not the same thing as saying they are dying out entirely. But it's becoming less a form of daily dress and more of a badge, and I don't see how a tradition can flourish when it is relegated to export and special occasions."

Bonds Rally on Report That Retail Sales Slipped in May

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
An unexpected decline in May retail sales eased bond traders' worries yesterday about the possibility that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates next month and pushed Treasury prices sharply higher.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 26/32 , to 98 5/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.77 percent, from 6.83 percent on Wednesday, matching last Friday's low yield following the May employment report. 
 The rise in prices meant that bondholders gained about $8.13 for every $1,000 invested.
Bond prices rose after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in May. Analysts had expected a gain of four-tenths of 1 percent.
The Commerce Department also revised its report of April retail sales, saying that sales in that month had fallen nine-tenths of 1 percent, not the three-tenths of 1 percent originally reported.
"Essentially, the last time retail sales were down three times in a row was the fourth quarter of 1981, in front of one of the worst recessions in 20 years," said Jack Ablin, executive vice president and head of fixed income at Barnett Capital Advisers Inc. "At the very least, it does signal a slowdown in the economy."
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that the weakness shown in recent retail sales reports "hardly exhibits the 'persisting strength in demand' that so concerned the Fed when it last tightened on March 25."
The latest weekly data on initial jobless claims did nothing to change the market's view of a slowing economy. As a result, the retail sales report suggested the likelihood of a significant slowdown in second-quarter economic growth.
Among bond market participants, expectations are growing that Federal Reserve policy makers, the Federal Open Market Committee, will not raise short-term interest rates for a second time this year when they meet on July 1 and 2.
"But despite the expectation of an unchanged Fed policy at the upcoming July F.O.M.C. meeting, the longevity of the current economic slowdown is still an open question," Mr. Fine said.
"The economy's strong foundation and tighter labor markets seem to be pointing to another round of Fed tightening at some point in the future. Thus, the bond market seems to be facing at least one more bullet in the chamber in its Russian roulette approach to Fed policy decisions."
Market participants now turn their attention to today's release of the Producer Price Index for May, which is expected to continue to show few inflationary pressures building. And the University of Michigan is scheduled to issue its survey of consumer sentiment in June.
"My guess on P.P.I. is that we're looking at a one-tenth of 1 percent gain in the core number, after being down last month," Mr. Ablin of Barnett Capital said, "so we expect it to be positive and not very strong.
"The long bond yield is being targeted at 6.50 percent toward year-end. I think we had more than a 50 percent chance of tightening. We are now down below 50 percent."
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a consulting and forecasting firm, said: "When the Fed raised the Federal funds rate in March, the Open Market Committee cited persisting strength in demand as the main reason.
"But at the very time they were raising rates, the demand was weakening. Today's retail sales report shows that the persisting strength was neither persistent nor strong."
Mr. McCarthy said that the Fed had tightened to slow down an economy that was already slowing on its own.
"The likelihood of further tightening in this environment," he said, "is virtually nil."

HEADLINE: E.P.A.'s New Air Standards Will Harm Cities

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your June 5 editorial endorsing the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed tightening of air quality standards treated objections to the new rules dismissively. But the rules lack adequate scientific basis, would come with unacceptably high costs in terms of jobs and urban economic development and would undermine the Clean Air Act. 
 Although you cite the E.P.A.'s independent board of scientists as backing the proposed standards, you fail to consider that the head of that panel, Dr. George Wolff, said in a February Senate hearing that there is "no known biological mechanism for the influence of fine particulate matter on human health."
To suggest, as you do, that the costs of the new rules can somehow be ignored because they are not mandated by legislation is ridiculous. In an era of fiscal constraint, where will hard-pressed cities get the money to replace Federal resources their noncompliance will deny them, especially given that many likely will never reach compliance at all? Alicia H. Munnell, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, has estimated that the overall cost of compliance with the new ozone standards alone could be as high as $60 billion annually -- many times greater than the E.P.A.'s own estimate.
The new regulations are a recipe for economic stagnation. Tens of thousands of American workers could find themselves on the unemployment line. About 800 counties would fall into immediate noncompliance with the new standards. And many major cities would lose Federal benefits by not being able to follow the excessively severe new regulations.

HEADLINE: Holding Our Breath

BYLINE: By George E. Pataki; George E. Pataki is Governor of New York.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration will soon make one of the most important environmental decisions of this decade: whether to support the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal for tough new rules on air pollution.
The E.P.A. is asking for stricter limits on ozone, or smog, and the dustlike particles known as particulates. Toughening these national standards for smog and soot is essential to protect the public health. 
 But opponents of the proposed rules have been lobbying the President to moderate them. He should resist. No one can deny that the standards will lead to cleaner air and fewer respiratory problems, particularly for the elderly and the young.
Government has few responsibilities more important than providing clean water and clean air. We must do whatever is reasonable to protect the quality of the air we breathe.
That's why New York is moving ahead to further reduce emissions from utility plants beyond the levels required by Federal law. This state is also taking aggressive measures to curb emissions from motor vehicles, including trucks and buses that spew soot, and we are eliminating polluting coal-fired boilers from New York City schools.
But while New York's air quality is steadily improving, there's a limit to what we can do on our own. We are at the end of the air pollution pipeline. Air entering New York from the Midwest already exceeds national standards for ozone. Under the E.P.A.'s proposed rules, Midwestern states would be forced to impose stricter pollution control measures already used in the Northeast, like requiring cleaner-burning power plants.
This is particularly important given the advent of competition in the electric power industry. Thanks to deregulation, large Midwestern coal-fired plants, which have lower costs for controlling air pollution, will be at a competitive advantage. If their sales of electricity increase, so will their downwind emissions to the Northeast. New national standards would not only protect the environment but also help insure more fairness in the market for electricity.
In addition to allowing all of us to breathe easier, the proposed rules offer other environmental benefits. For one thing, the standards would reduce acid rain, which continues to devastate New York's majestic Adirondack Park. The rules would also decrease the amount of nitrogen entering Long Island Sound, leading to cleaner water and healthier aquatic life. New York State is already spending $200 million, through the Clean Water-Clean Air Bond Act, to reduce nitrogen deposits in the Sound.
Although health considerations demand that we adopt these new air standards, economic factors are important, too. The E.P.A. should allow industry as much flexibility as possible to meet emission reduction goals in a cost-effective way. The success of the Federal program allowing companies to trade credits for emissions that produce acid rain suggests not only that industry can meet environmental protection standards, but also that market forces can drive down the cost of doing so.
In the end, the most important question in evaluating the proposed rules on pollution is whether they will provide cleaner and healthier air. Let's hope that when the Clinton Administration decides whether to stand by the E.P.A.'s air quality standards, concern for the health of our children and grandchildren leads the way and political considerations take a back seat.

HEADLINE: Bounced Commissioner Practices Her Rebound

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, June 10

 BODY:
Cardboard boxes clutter the floor of Dr. Mary Hibberd's office here, some filled with files to discard and others bulging with mementos to keep. Her desk is strewn with folders and a hammer and a screwdriver for removing photos from the wood-paneled wall.
Dr. Hibberd, the Suffolk County Health Commissioner, is making an abrupt and highly publicized career change in a life that has never worked out quite the way she planned. 
 Her pattern was set early, when hopes of becoming a naturalist were thwarted by a graduate program's males-only policy. Since then, her zigzag career as a scientist and pediatrician has taken her to a remote Montana Indian reservation, the squalor of Bangladesh and the poorest neighborhoods of Long Island.
None of it seemed to prepare Dr. Hibberd for the rough and tumble of politics in Suffolk County. She says she was ousted because she would not play patronage games; her detractors disputed her health policies and said she was a poor manager. In any case, by Friday, she will have vacated her office.
As Dr. Hibberd sorted through her things, she said, "Look -- here's something." It was the plaque commemorating her induction in March into the Suffolk County Women's Hall of Fame. Etched at the bottom is the name of County Executive Robert J. Gaffney -- who two months later, without warning, created a committee to search for her successor.
Dr. Hibberd was in Virginia picking up her daughter from college, and found out when she called her answering machine from a pay phone in a Wendy's and heard urgent messages from reporters.
"It was very painful," she recalled. "I was crying and saying it's not fair -- I'm not there to defend myself. We drove back home in this big line of violent thunderstorms. It seemed like the perfect metaphor."
Mr. Gaffney said his decision stemmed from a growing rift with Dr. Hibberd over health policies. He also questioned her management skills, saying that her agency had failed to get millions of dollars in state aid, that malpractice expenses were high and that its managed-care system was floundering.
Dr. Hibberd rebutted his complaints, saying, for example, that Suffolk would get all its state aid after the normal lags in claims, payments and budget cycles. But she also mounted a counterattack, saying that the real reason for her removal was that she blocked attempts at interference by Mr. Gaffney, his top aides, two legislators and others.
Over the years, she said, those officials had tried to foist unqualified but politically connected job candidates on her agency. She said they also tried to force her agency to spend money advertising in a politically connected newspaper and tried to strong-arm her into backing off on smoking regulations to help their business friends.
Dr. Hibberd, 50, a divorced mother of two who is given to quoting Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said she would not give in. "My duty is to protect the public health, not to engage in politics," she said.
Nor did she seem concerned about losing her job. "I always think God has a plan, even though we don't know it," she said.
Dr. Hibberd has a legion of admirers who see her as a Mother Teresa who championed suburbia's invisible needy, and, in the process, cut Suffolk's infant mortality rate by more than 40 percent.
"Mary is credible, and the rest of them aren't," said Maxine Postal, a Democrat and chairwoman of the County Legislature's Health Committee. "That slim woman has a backbone made of tempered steel. From the person who does the maintenance work right up to the top, they say she's the very best we've ever had."
Mr. Gaffney and the other officials denied the charges of interference. Mr. Gaffney declined to be interviewed for this article.
Although some people called for an investigation get to the bottom of the dispute, there appears little chance of that. Instead, Dr. Hibberd will start a new job Monday as a senior executive at Ipro, a health-care consulting firm in Lake Success.
Growing up in Upper Darby, Pa., Dr. Hibberd never envisioned that she would some day be at the helm of a $275 million-a-year health agency.
"It was actually a fluky thing," Dr. Hibberd said of her career. Her own requirement was to find something "that was work I wanted to do and that made a difference." After being shut out of the naturalists' program, she earned a master's degree in microbial genetics, then another in human genetics, which led her into medicine.
"I liked surgery best, but women rarely went into that," she said, so she shifted to pediatrics. In nearly five years practicing at the Flathead Indian reservation, she realized the medical toll of social and economic ills. "I saw a lot of unemployment, alcoholism, fetal alcohol syndrome."
Her career was transformed again by 10 months as a volunteer in the Care Medico program in Bangladesh. "People went blind from lack of vitamin A. There was scurvy, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, TB -- all preventable. You could save thousands."
She earned a master's degree in public health and took a residency in community and preventive health at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. A stint at the Suffolk Health Department prompted a job offer, and she became director of reproductive care for six years. County Executive Patrick Halpin named her acting health commissioner in 1991, and Mr. Gaffney made the appointment permanent.
Many trace her undoing to a dispute four years ago with Suffolk's District Attorney, James Catterson Jr.
She accused Mr. Catterson of threatening to investigate her agency unless she overturned the failing results of a psychological exam given to a son of a longtime associate of his. The son, an investigator in Mr. Catterson's office, needed to pass for authorization to carry a gun.
Perhaps emboldened by Dr. Hibberd, other Republican officials also began to speak out, saying that Mr. Catterson had improperly pressured them on various issues. But he denied all the complaints, and a state inquiry ended with no action taken against him.
"There's a pattern here of someone who sees things that other people don't," Mr. Catterson said in an interview. "I've never understood her agenda." He said Dr. Hibberd had been "canonized" by the news media, but he conceded, "She comes across in private as she does in public, as Mother Teresa, and it's very disarming."
Her tenacity, however, hardly ingratiated her with Mr. Gaffney. This year she went over his head to the County Legislature to win more funds for her department.
About the last thing to come down from Dr. Hibberd's office wall was a display of 13 color snapshots of beaming mothers and their babies from Project Hope, in which health workers monitor infants through their critical first year.
"This is one of the programs I started and one of the best things in the department," she said. "So I am definitely taking these pictures. It just makes you feel good."

HEADLINE: THE RENT BATTLE: THE IMPACT;
Although Meant to Create Fluidity, Decontrol Could Freeze the Market

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Living with her aunt in a rent-stabilized apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, has become just about untenable for Sheria G. McFadden, 29. She has a new baby and job at City College in Harlem, more than an hour's commute away by subway. She needs to move.
Under the Republican proposal to remove rent regulations from apartments when they become vacant, it would be impossible for Ms. McFadden to find a rent-stabilized home if she moved. So she is unpersuaded when she hears Gov. George E. Pataki and other advocates of the plan known as vacancy decontrol say repeatedly that it would protect 99 percent of tenants. 
 "How is he protecting me?" she asked. "By forcing me to live here for the rest of my life?"
The Republican plan would let renters remain under rent stabilization or rent control as long as they stay in their apartments. But the rents would rise to any level the market would bear when tenants move, die or are evicted. The Republicans would also remove rent ceilings for households earning $175,000 a year or more under a plan called luxury decontrol.
It is true that under that scheme, 99 percent of people living under rent regulation would continue to do so, but with one important condition: to keep their rent ceilings, they could not move. No one would ever again find a vacant rent-stabilized apartment, and that, renters say, is why the Pataki plan has evoked such ire.
New Yorkers, who have taken rent regulation for granted for generations, are a fairly transient lot. In a recent New York Times poll of New York City residents, half of all renters said they had moved in the last five years, and most likely a few hundred thousand of them are in the market for a new home right now. And it has dawned on many people that under vacancy decontrol, they would have to choose between staying put and taking their chances in an unregulated market.
Young adults would think twice before leaving their family homes. Two people living alone could be dissuaded from looking for a larger place to live together. Couples would have to consider the difficulty of moving when making family planning decisions.
Similar effects might also be seen from luxury decontrol: a woman might not be so eager to have her boyfriend move into her rent-stabilized unit if their combined income pushed them over the $175,000 limit and sent her rent soaring.
Critics of the current system of rent regulation argue that it ossifies the market by giving people incentives to stay where they are, leading to poor uses of space and exacerbating the housing shortage. For instance, an elderly person whose spouse has died and whose children have grown and moved away may be unwilling to give up a three-bedroom apartment if the rent is so low that it is not worthwhile to move to a smaller unit.
Paradoxically, many housing experts, including some who support deregulation, say that vacancy decontrol could make the market rigidity much worse. "Vacancy decontrol would give people fewer options, so they would stay in their units longer," said Elizabeth Roistacher, an economist at Queens College and the City University Graduate Center who has studied the city's housing market. "The turnover rate would fall. The number of vacancies at any one time would actually drop. And, ironically, that would make the shortage worse, and drive up rents."
In the long run, experts say, as more of the market became deregulated, such symptoms would ease, but the first several years could be difficult. Real-estate experts also point out that there are dozens of neighborhoods, most outside Manhattan, in which demand is so low that landlords will probably not be able to raise rents even if they are allowed to.
The essence of the Governor's plan, indeed the sole reason for changing the current law, is to gradually deregulate the state's 1.2 million rent-stabilized or rent-controlled units, nearly all of them in New York City and its suburbs. Yet Mr. Pataki avoids saying so, and will not say the words "vacancy decontrol."
When asked this week if his plan might pose a problem for anyone who needed to move, the Governor said, "I'm not going to talk about everybody, the possible thoughts of every individual," and quickly turned to another question.
Advocates of decontrol say it would encourage new housing construction, easing the shortage and, in the long run, driving down rents, and that it would encourage renovations. Skeptics counter that builders cite a number of other factors, including a labyrinthine city approval process, that hinder new construction.
They also note that developers have been free to build unregulated housing for more than two decades, but that that freedom has not resulted in a building boom. In fact, most builders have voluntarily submitted to rent regulation in return for tax breaks.
Critics of the Governor's plan also note that owners of unregulated apartments are not required to give their tenants leases, that they can raise rents at any time, and that they can evict renters at will. Supporters counter that about one third of the city's rental market is already unregulated, but that there has not been an epidemic of such abuses.
For Ms. McFadden, as for many others, the sum of the changes Mr. Pataki would make is a feeling of being trapped. "I can't afford more than $500 a month, and there's hardly any one-bedrooms that cheap in Harlem," she said. "Even if I did find something, without a lease, without any protections, it would be like walking on the edge. You're not secure, not stable. How can you live like that and raise a child?"

HEADLINE: For Now, U.S. Insists on Limiting New NATO Members to 3

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, June 12

 BODY:
The United States defied most of its NATO allies today and announced its determination to limit the first wave of the alliance's expansion to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
While those three countries had long been the leading candidates to join the alliance, 9 of the 16 NATO members had also favored including Romania and Slovenia. The Clinton Administration's announcement today means that a final decision on the number of new members will probably not be made until the meeting of NATO leaders in Madrid next month. 
 Defense Secretary William S. Cohen presented the American decision at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in the alliance's headquarters here and sought to reassure Romania and Slovenia -- and the nations backing their membership -- that "the door is still open" and that they would be "very prime candidates in the next round."
NATO decisions require consensus -- at least in principle, every member has a veto -- and the Clinton Administration tried to create at least the appearance that there was no room for compromise on the number of new members.
"The United States' position is firm," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman. "Our own military believes that NATO will better be able to absorb new members if we start with three, so there was a military reason to keep the number at three."
Mr. Cohen said that President Clinton had wanted to limit the first round of new members to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic because "those three countries have demonstrated the necessary level of progress on military, political, economic and social reform."
In Romania and Slovenia, he said, "a good deal of progress has been made in a short time, but it is still a short time, and there needs to be a longer-term commitment to the progress that has been made in terms of democracy, civilian control over the military and the emphasis on human rights."
Administration officials traveling with Mr. Cohen said that with an army of only 4,100 full-time troops and an arsenal largely made up of old Soviet-era arms, Slovenia was not militarily ready to join NATO, while Romania was still struggling to establish the sort of democratic government that would be compatible with the alliance.
The officials said the United States believed it had the needed diplomatic support within NATO to limit the expansion to the three countries.
Their optimism grew today, they said, after consultations with France, which had strongly supported the inclusion of Romania, and with Italy, which had just as strongly backed Slovenia, in which the two countries offered only muted protests to the American plan.
Mr. Cohen met today for the first time with his French counterpart, Defense Minister Alain Richard, and described the meeting as "very cordial" despite their disagreement over Romania's proposed admission.
France has longstanding cultural and political ties with Romania and had been lobbying aggressively among NATO's Mediterranean members for an expansion to the south to supplement the addition of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east.
A NATO decision to invite a larger group of new members would complicate what Clinton Administration officials acknowledge could be a difficult battle to win Senate approval for the expansion of the alliance; a Senate vote is required.
Many Senators say they are reluctant to spend the billions of dollars that would be needed over the next two decades to incorporate new members into NATO from Central and Eastern Europe. Some also question whether the United States wants to take responsibility for the defense of some of the nations now seeking admission.
Mr. Cohen said that by limiting the first wave of new members to three, the United States hoped to make clear that there would be further rounds. "A limited initial group will underscore that the process is a deliberate one, a small initial group underscores that there really are going to be additional rounds," he said.
"The prudent course is to defer invitations where the countries are on the right path but need more time," he continued. "This approach is all the more appropriate since the door to membership is going to remain open, so there will be ample opportunity to invite additional members."
In Washington, Mr. Clinton underscored the point, saying, "As I have repeatedly emphasized, the first new members should not and will not be the last."
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott began a round of meetings in Washington with ambassadors from Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to notify them formally of the American decision to support their membership.
The Hungarian charge d'affaires, Gabor Horvath, said after the meeting that his Government was delighted with the decision.
"It's a historic moment," he said. "The vision of having a unified, peaceful and stable Europe is making another very strong step. And it is also very important the process should and will remain open for making this Europe broader, even more stable, even more united."

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Drop Unexpectedly for Third Consecutive Month

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Retail sales dropped unexpectedly last month and have now declined for three months in a row, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, confirming that the economy is slowing from the rapid pace of growth over the previous six months.
The drop in automobile, building material and gasoline sales that pulled down the May total by one-tenth of 1 percent came as the Commerce Department also revised March and April data to show steeper declines than were reported earlier. 
 This is first three-month decline in retail sales since the fall of 1981.
In addition, the sales report comes on the heels of last Friday's employment report for May that showed a much lower increase in new nonfarm payroll jobs than forecast.
But among economists and investors, the debate is still raging over whether this slowdown is permanent or just a breather before another surge in consumer spending.
Investors seemed to favor the more permanent view yesterday as the bond market rallied, with the yield on the 30-year bond falling to 6.77 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 135.64 points, to 7,711.47, a new high. A sharp drop in short-term interest rates seems to imply that there is no longer much expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when its policy-making committee meets in early July.
"These data are the icing on the cake," said Richard Berner, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "The Fed will be on hold through its next meeting."
David Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said that the Fed's decision in May not to raise interest rates, followed by the weakish May jobs reports and yesterday's retail sales data had been a succession of "green lights" for the stock market. He expects that the Dow will easily pass 8,000.
Some economists, however, said that without any further rate increases by the Fed, consumer spending should rebound enough in the second half of the year to push economic growth higher again. And that could force the Fed to act.
These economists all think that the current slowdown is more an aberration than a trend because of seasonal factors, like the weather, special factors, like higher-than-expected income tax payments in April, and because the economic fundamentals that underlie the consumer are still strong. These fundamentals include the growth of jobs and the improving financial condition of Americans.
David Munro, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, argued that the healthy jumps in other sectors of retail sales, including clothing, which rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, and general merchandise, which rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, were more indicative of the attitude of consumers.
Mr. Munro said he thought the seven-tenths of 1 percent decline in the total value of gasoline sales at service stations was more a result of a fall in price rather than a drop in consumer demand. And he also wondered about the two-tenths of 1 percent decline in automobile sales, which he said did not fit with the industry's report of rising sales.
Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers, noted the same trend, adding that the declines in sales over the last three months were led by discretionary items, such as automobiles, televisions and computers.
Both warned about the tentative nature of the May data, a fact reflected in the report the Commerce Department puts out and in the steep revisions made in the April and March data. The nine-tenths of 1 percent drop in retail sales for April was revised down from an initial report of a three-tenths of 1 percent decline, while the March report changed to a three-tenths of 1 percent decline from unchanged. For May, the Wall Street forecast, according to Bloomberg News, had been for an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent.
If these economists are right, the volatility that has marked the economy in the last year and a half should continue, with little boomlets followed by small busts.
In the six months through March, the economy grew at a 4.8 percent annual rate, with a 5.8 percent surge in the first quarter, the strongest growth in almost a decade. Many economists are forecasting that growth will slow to about 1 percent this quarter. On retail sales alone, the 5 percent decline at an annual rate over the last three months followed a 15 percent surge over the previous three months.
Adding to the picture of a slowing economy was the additional report that initial jobless claims in the week ending June 7 were up by 1,000, to a seasonally adjusted 339,000. Analysts had been expecting a decline.

HEADLINE: U.S. Faces 'Real Challenge' in Selling U.N. Plan, Annan Says

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 12

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan said today that Clinton Administration officials had told him that their agreement with Senate leaders to attach conditions to the payment of overdue debts to the United Nations "was the best deal they could get under the circumstances."
But Mr. Annan added that selling the package to the 184 other members of the organization "is going to be a real challenge for U.S. diplomacy." 
 "One can discuss these things in Congress," Mr. Annan said at a news conference. "That does not mean it's going to become law in the U.N. It does not necessarily mean that the member states are going to accept it. My sense is that quite a lot of the issues the U.S. will have to come and negotiate."
The Secretary General welcomed an effort by Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, to amend a State Department authorization bill that went to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today. Mr. Lugar proposed settling all arrears, now at just over $1 billion, without conditions, or "benchmarks."
"Obviously as Secretary General of the U.N., like all the member states, we would have been happier if the totality of what we believe is owed were paid, and if the deck had been cleared and if we did not have to deal with benchmarks," Mr. Annan said.
"But of course the process is going on, and I don't know how we will come out of it at the end of the day. But as far as positions of principle are concerned, I'm 100 percent for Senator Lugar."
On Friday Mr. Annan is to meet here with Senator Rod Grams, a Minnesota Republican and member of the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Grams, who heads the subcommittee responsible for allocations to international organizations, is also the Congressional delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.
The Secretary General's remarks came at a time when envoys here are complaining that the United States Mission to the United Nations, which will have to do the tough negotiating, seems crippled by the frozen appointment process in Washington.
Among conditions the Senate attached to budget legislation are the opening of United Nations' books to inspection in Washington, and the reduction of American payments to both the regular United Nations budget and peacekeeping operations. Neither can be done without the agreement of other United Nations members.
At this critical moment, three of the four ambassadors assigned to the United States Mission are in a holding pattern awaiting new jobs for which they must be confirmed by the Senate.
American diplomats say there have been roadblocks in the Foreign Relations Committee, where the chairman, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, has held up confirmation hearings to extract concessions from the Administration. But American officials also say the White House has been very slow at announcing appointments. A number of large American embassies are without ambassadors.
At the United Nations, the deputy permanent representative, Edward W. Gnehm Jr., has been nominated as Foreign Service director general, but has yet to be confirmed. The third-ranking diplomat, Karl Inderfurth, has been nominated as Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia.
The United States Mission will also lose Ambassador Victor Marrero, who has been dealing with international economic and social issues, and Cameron Hume, a minister counselor for political affairs who has been involved in Security Council work.

HEADLINE: Electrolux to Cut 12,000 Workers and Shut Plants

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Electrolux A.B., the Swedish maker of Frigidaire appliances, said yesterday that it would lay off about 10 percent of its work force, or about 12,000 workers, and would close 24 factories and 50 warehouses in two years.
The cuts will mostly be in Europe, where Electrolux is the largest appliance maker, and in North America, but not in the United States. Electrolux will spend $321 million on the cost-cutting, which comes as global manufacturers are increasingly consolidating operations in Europe. Such companies face tough marketing conditions in the region as well as pressures to become more efficient as Europe moves toward greater economic unity. 
 Still, the area remains an important focus for Electrolux and other manufactures as they seek to expand their international reach, particularly by moving into the developing European markets.
"Europe is still a major marketplace, and it is also seen as a springboard to emerging consumer markets of Central and Eastern Europe," said Steven Gluckstein, an analyst who follows appliance manufacturing companies for the Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder investment firm in New York. "Look where investment has been going; it hasn't just been in traditional European countries. You're seeing investment in Poland and Hungry, and that will continue."
Such expansion, though, means companies must operate with more efficiency because of lower productivity in many of those regions as well as sluggish consumer confidence because of economic weakness. "As these major players, such as Whirlpool and Electrolux get more efficient, that is going to create much more pressure on smaller players," Mr. Gluckstein said. "That will push another wave of consolidation."
The competitive United States market has helped fuel the push into emerging markets. The United States appliance market is largely driven by replacement purchases. And since the introduction of the microwave, there have been few new products to excite consumers.
As a result, the domestic market has gone flat. "Over the last 20 years, shipments of core appliances have registered average growth of only 2.4 percent annually," said Jonathan L. Goldfarb, an analyst who follows appliance manufacturing companies for Merrill Lynch & Company.
"Appliances," he added, "have essentially saturated U.S. households. With each category of appliance performing efficiently and economically, there is little opportunity for truly significant product innovation."
Moreover, the proliferation of superstore retailers has resulted in a decrease in the number of appliance retailers. "These shifts have further intensified pricing pressures, and have somewhat moved market power away from the manufacturers and toward the customers," Mr. Goldfarb said.
And with four manufacturers now controlling more than 90 percent of the United States appliance market, opportunities to improve results through acquisitions are few.
Whirlpool has 35 percent of the domestic market followed by General Electric with 29.3 percent, according to Merrill Lynch. Maytag is third with 14.4 percent, and Electrolux is fourth with 13.5 percent.
Electrolux has had a particularly tough time operating in the the United States as competitors have been more successful with product innovation and marketing efforts. The company lost ground in the vacuum cleaner market, for instance, because its floor-care products only included canister models when consumers favored upright versions.
"G.E. is known for refrigeration and cooking, and laundry is Whirlpool's strength," said Lawrence J. Horan, an analyst who follows appliance companies for Prudential Securities. "Maytag is also really known for laundry, but they are also No, 1 in dishwashers."
As for Electrolux, he said, "in my opinion, they are strong in nothing."
But the cutbacks announced yesterday heartened investors. American depository shares of Electrolux, each representing one B share of the Swedish company, surged $9.50, or nearly 16 percent, to $69.50, in Nasdaq trading.
Electrolux, which has sales of about $16 billion, has reported a decline in profits for two years, which it attributed to a decline in demand for its industrial and commercial products as well as to the weak conditions in Europe.
"You reach a point where you have to do more," said Assa Mattsson Stenqvist, the company's vice president for investor relations. "The European market for white goods declined by 2 percent in 1996 in volume, and it continued into 1997. For the first quarter, the market was down 3 percent again."
Even so, the company, like many of its competitors, has continued to expand.
"During the 1980's they acquired a number of companies all over Europe, and they have been consolidating production since the beginning of the 1990's but at quite a slow pace," said Staffan Ostlin, an analyst who follows Electrolux for Enskilda Securities in New York. "A new chief executive came in with, I'd say, a fresh set of eyes."
Indeed, it took that executive, Michael Treschow, only two months on the job to announce the big overhaul. He said he expected the revamping to generate an operating margin of about 7 percent and to increase return on equity as high as 15 percent. The company reported only a 1.7 percent operating margin last year and a return on equity of 8.6 percent
Electrolux said it would not discontinue products as part of the streamlining initiative. Instead, the reorganization will result in a leaner, more competitive company, executives said.
Mr. Treschow, who is known for his cost-cutting plans, had been an executive with a European industrial machinery manufacturer before becoming chief executive of Electrolux in April. He replaced Leif Johansson, who became chief executive of the auto manufacturer Volvo A.B.
Electrolux manufactures household and commercial appliances such as refrigerators, ovens and washing machines. The company also makes outdoor products, including chain saws, mowers and weed trimmers.

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Stock Funds, Investors Can't Seem to Say No

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Six and a half years into a record-breaking bull market, American investors have crossed a threshold, committing more than half of their mutual fund assets to stocks, double the level at the beginning of the decade.
Americans, moreover, are not the only ones who have grown infatuated with seemingly ever-rising stock prices. Foreign investors, too, have significantly stepped up their investments in American stocks this year, to the highest level since 1990. Together, those trends have produced a rich fuel that this year has powered the stock market beyond the expectations of virtually everyone on Wall Street. 
 Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 135 points, or 1.8 percent, as a drop in retail sales in May signaled a slowdown in the growth of the economy and, thus, a reduced chance that inflation will revive. That put the gain in the Dow industrials, the market bellwether, at nearly 20 percent since the beginning of the year. [Page D1.]
Those gains have come in part because of the huge volumes of money pouring into mutual funds. The Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, estimated yesterday that $18.5 billion flowed into equity funds in May, the seventh-highest monthly total ever. So far this year, investors have added $92 billion to mutual funds that invest in stocks -- well behind last year's record pace, but 50 percent ahead of the next-best year.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that in the first quarter foreign investors bought shares of United States stocks at more than double the rate of last year. That increased foreign holdings of American equities to 6.5 percent of the total, the highest level since 1990, when the current run of the bull market began.
The long rise in stocks has also led mutual fund investors to place a bigger portion of their fund assets in the stock market than in two decades. At the end of April, according to the Investment Company Institute, stock funds contained $1.88 trillion in assets, just more than half the $3.73 trillion contained in stock, bond and money market funds.
At the end of 1990, stock funds accounted for only 23 percent of the $1.07 trillion in mutual fund assets -- far less than bond funds, which contained 30 percent of the total, and money market funds, which had 47 percent.
Still, the percentage of Americans' total financial assets that are invested in the equity market -- both through mutual funds and direct holdings of stocks -- remains well below the peak. About 28 percent of household financial assets are invested in stocks, said Melissa Brown, an analyst at Prudential Securities. That is double the portion in 1985, but well below the peak of 34.5 percent, reached in 1965.
The recent popularity of equity funds and the flow of money from overseas investors into the United States have contributed to greater demand this year for stocks, analysts say. But the supply of stocks for sale has been shrinking, as new public offerings of shares have not kept pace with corporate takeovers, which take shares of stock out of circulation.
"We're seeing close to 10 corporate takeovers being announced each week, most of them for cash," said Charles Biderman, president of Trim Tabs Financial Services, which tracks both mutual fund cash flows and stock market liquidity. "That gives investors money in their pockets, but with less shares to choose from, it drives up prices."
Add to that mix a growing number of companies announcing plans to repurchase shares of their own stock, Mr. Biderman said, and the result is an astounding run-up in stock prices.
The $18.5 billion that flowed into equity mutual funds in May -- the second-highest total this year, behind only January's record of $29.1 billion -- marked a resurgence in Americans' appetite for stock funds. Cash flows fell sharply in March and early April, as a sharp drop in the price of stocks of smaller companies was followed by a decline in the broader market, which chased investors to the sidelines.
But stock prices began to rise again last month as some of the country's biggest corporations reported favorable first-quarter earnings, attracting new cash through May and into this month.
In all likelihood, the market's rise and the May cash flows pushed stock fund assets past $2 trillion for the first time. That would mark a doubling of stock fund assets in just two years. Stock fund assets surpassed $1 trillion in May 1995, 55 years after the passage of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the statute that marked the formal beginning of the mutual fund industry.
Bond prices, too, have risen since mid-April, as investors began to anticipate, correctly, as it turned out, that the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates in May. That, too, has hastened the demand for bond mutual funds, which last month added $2.5 billion in new cash, the most in any month since January, according to the Investment Company Institute.
In some recent instances, the demand for mutual fund shares has taken on the look of a feeding frenzy. Last week, Aim Management Group, which manages the Aim Family of Funds, reopened the Aim Aggressive Growth fund, allowing new investors to buy shares for the first time in two years.
Aim had planned to keep the fund, which had $2.5 billion in assets, open until it attracted $500 million in new assets. That much was contributed in less than a day, and Aim closed the fund again after only two days, in which the fund added $688 million in new assets.
Last week marked the second time in two years that the Aim Aggressive Growth fund was flooded with money in a two-day span. In July 1995, when the fund last opened to new investors, $1 billion flowed in over two days. But at the time, aggressive growth funds, which invest in stocks of small, fast-growing companies, were much more in favor among fund investors.
In contrast, aggressive-growth funds as a category have been shunned by investors through much of this spring, after a downturn in small stocks. In March, for example, aggressive growth funds added only $144 million in new cash, the lowest monthly total in more than four years.
The growth in mutual fund investing has also created a bull market for the companies that manage the funds, an industry that is undergoing mergers and acquisitions at a rapid pace. Analysts expect what could be the biggest-ever fund company takeover to be announced any day now: Scudder, Stevens & Clark, parent of the Scudder family of mutual funds, is in talks to be acquired by Zurich Insurance Group, people close to the talks have said.
Analysts say the rapid consolidation among fund companies is being driven in part by a desire by foreign financial services companies -- like Zurich Insurance, which is based in Switzerland -- to gain access to American investors and markets. In that regard, the trend parallels the rise in sentiment that has occurred among foreign investors in their attitude toward United States equities.
After steadily building their holdings of American stocks through the 1980's, to a high of 7.2 percent of the total in 1989, foreign holdings slipped to less than 6 percent in 1994. The sharp jump in the first quarter of this year, reported yesterday in the Federal Reserve's report, took the percentage back up to 6.5 percent.
That could be a mixed blessing, said Ms. Brown, the analyst at Prudential Securities. "Historically, foreigners have not been the best market timers," she said, noting that several months after foreign holdings of United States stocks peaked in 1989, the Dow industrials suffered their steepest decline since the crash of 1987. That was also the last time the Dow industrials has fallen 10 percent from an all-time high.

HEADLINE: THE RENT BATTLE: THE OVERVIEW;
Behind the Lines in the Rent War, Cautious Motion Toward a Treaty

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 12

 BODY:
Beneath the deeply pessimistic tone of the rent debate, negotiators have actually begun serious deliberations on proposals that could prevent the rules from expiring on Sunday. Officials on both sides of the fight said today that Democrats are now privately displaying greater openness than in the past about helping landlords increase rents on some apartments.
The negotiators have been focusing their discussions on ways of allowing landlords to bring rents closer to market levels on regulated apartments that become vacant. Current laws place strict limits on rent increases for vacated units, but landlords contend those restrictions must be lifted to end huge price disparities in the market. 
 On the surface, the issue has seemed insoluble. Republicans, led by Gov. George E. Pataki, have advocated deregulating apartments once tenants move out or die, a policy known as vacancy decontrol. Democrats, led by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, have rejected vacancy decontrol out of hand, saying it would end all rent regulations over time as more and more units turned over.
But behind closed doors, negotiators for both sides have shown greater flexibility than has been expressed by their leaders in public. Democrats have floated ideas about mechanisms to enable landlords some increases on vacant apartments, but less than could be obtained on the open market. And Republicans have proposed a number of partial vacancy decontrol ideas, ranging from applying the policy only to small buildings or high-priced apartments, to spreading out market-rate rent increases over extended periods of time.
So far, none of those ideas has stuck. But officials in both parties say they believe that if vacancy decontrol can be resolved, the other outstanding issues -- such as lifting protections for wealthy tenants -- will fall into place. And there is a widespread sense among legislators in both parties that if Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican Senate majority leader who has been Albany's staunchest advocate for vacancy decontrol, plays a smaller role in the endgame talks -- as recent actions have suggested -- the way could be paved for a compromise.
But the negotiators still face a tall political hurdle: structuring a deal that allows all sides to declare victory. Democrats have so staunchly opposed vacancy decontrol that they would find it difficult to accept anything that even faintly smacks of the policy, lest they come under fierce attack by an important constituency, tenants groups. Republicans have been so adamant about bringing a gradual end to rent regulations that a complete retreat from vacancy decontrol would be widely viewed as a political embarrassment.
Still, negotiators have expressed very guarded optimism that a deal can be struck that would allow Republicans to contend that they had brought free-market reforms to New York City's rental system and Democrats to proclaim that they had kept tenant protections largely intact, thereby protecting the middle class.
The question is: can they do it by the end of the day on June 15, when the laws, which set rent ceilings for more than one million apartments, are to expire? "I don't know that anyone has found the answer yet, but I'm confident we will," said one Republican official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "I just don't think that it will be by the 15th."
Though aides to the Governor and legislative leaders met today, there were no major negotiations on rent because Mr. Silver was observing the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. The leaders were scheduled to resume their talks on Friday morning.
Both houses of the Legislature are to return to Albany on Sunday night just a few hours before the laws are set to expire, giving themselves enough time to pass a bill if Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders reach an agreement. The Legislature could also pass a short-term extension of the current laws to buy negotiators time to iron out their differences. But Mr. Bruno has said he will block any extensions of the existing law. If the Legislature does nothing, the laws will lapse.
Officials in both parties say that Mr. Silver's chief negotiator, Fred Jacobs, has rejected Republican proposals on vacancy decontrol during the closed-door negotiations. But that has not prevented discussion about other ideas that might achieve some of the goals of vacancy decontrol -- namely, providing ways for landlords with regulated units to increase their income -- without actually decontrolling large numbers of units.
One idea that Democrats have tentatively advanced would be to increase what is known as the vacancy bonus already allowed under law for regulated units that become vacant. But the two sides have been sharply divided over the size of the bonus, who would set it and how expansive the policy should be: Republicans want it applied to all regulated units; Democrats want it restricted to a small number of apartments.
Another idea that has been promoted by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during talks with Legislative leaders would be to allow vacancy decontrol for high-rent apartments. Current law allows units that rent for over $2000 a month to be decontrolled if vacated. The policy could be expanded by lowering that threshold to, say, $1750 a month or lower.
Democrats have been opposed to that idea on the grounds that, with time and inflation, the majority of apartments will fall into this category. To address that concern, they have discussed the idea of lowering the threshold, but then allowing it to rise again according to an index tied to the inflation rate. So far, Republicans have balked at that idea.
Republicans have floated proposals to apply vacancy decontrol only to small buildings, for example, those with 10 units or less, and to allow landlords to bring rents on vacated units to market levels, but only over long periods of time. So far, Democrats have been unwilling to accept either. But the fact that they continue to talk has kept Republican hopes for compromise alive.
Many Republicans also say that as the deadline approaches, Mr. Silver might soften out of concern that Democrats, too, will be blamed for the laws lapsing. "You won't see any meaningful dialogue until the final hours," Senator Nicholas Spano, a Westchester Republican, said.
Many Republicans contend that Mr. Silver, the state's most powerful Democrat, wants the laws to expire on the theory that frightened tenants will punish Mr. Pataki and other Republican officials at the polls for any pain, panic or problems that might ensue after June 15.
Aides to Mr. Silver, while acknowledging that they think Republicans will bear the brunt of voters' wrath if the laws lapse, deny any partisan motivations, saying the Democrats are simply fighting to protect the rent laws.

HEADLINE: Giddings & Lewis Accepts $675 Million Merger Bid From Thyssen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Escaping a hostile takeover bid, Giddings & Lewis Inc., a Wisconsin maker of machine tools and assembly line equipment, said yesterday that it had agreed to be bought by Thyssen A.G. for $675 million.
Thyssen, a diversified German steelmaker, offered $21 a share in a bid endorsed by Giddings's directors. Thyssen also will assume the debt of the company, which Giddings said was $25 million to $35 million. 
 The offer tops a $631 million bid made by Harnischfeger Industries, also a Wisconsin maker of machine tools, that was rejected last month.
The acquisition would give Thyssen a manufacturing base in the United States, while Giddings would benefit from the larger company's global presence and common ties to the automobile industry.
"The deal will allow Giddings management to continue their strategy of selling machine tools globally," Donald Liptak, an analyst with Barrington Research, said.
The Thyssen bid represents an 11 percent premium over yesterday's closing price for Giddings stock. Shares of Giddings rose $1.7344, to $20.7344, on the Nasdaq yesterday.
Harnischfeger will not pursue its tender offer "if Thyssen's bid for $21 per share proves bona fide to us," Harnischfeger's chief executive, Jeffrey Grade, said yesterday.
Harnischfeger began a $19-a-share hostile takeover bid on April 28, when Giddings shares were trading at $13.675.
Giddings and Thyssen began negotiating soon after, said Giddings's chief executive, Marvin Isles. While Giddings could still consider other offers, he added, it would have to pay a $23 million fee to cancel the agreement.
Directors unanimously accepted the Thyssen bid, Mr. Isles said.
The acquisition is part of Thyssen's strategy to expand internationally to offset Germany's sluggish economy. The transaction would give its Thyssen Industrie capital goods unit its first manufacturing plant in the United States, where labor costs are lower than in Germany.
Thyssen had sales of $26.2 billion last year, including $3.2 billion in the United States.
Giddings, with a 1996 loss of $12.5 million on sales of $700 million, makes assembly line machinery, primarily for auto makers including the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation.
The loss last year is not a concern because Giddings has a solid balance sheet, Ann-Pascale Wiedenroth, a Thyssen spokeswoman, said.
"G.& L. had some problems, but we believe these are largely behind them," she said. "We certainly expect them to be profitable this year."
Under the purchase agreement, Giddings will continue to operate under its own name although management control will rest with Thyssen Industrie.

 BODY:

Retail Sales Slow, Helping Markets Rise Again
Retail sales dropped unexpectedly last month and have now declined for three months in a row, the Government said. 
 Economists and investors are still debating whether this slowdown is permanent or just a breather before another surge in consumer spending. But investors took the view that the economy was slowing from a potentially inflationary pace of growth, pushing the stock and bond markets higher. [Page D3.]
 
The bull market has been driven in large part by the surge in the popularity of mutual funds. American investors have now committed more than half of their fund assets to stocks, double the level at the beginning of the decade. And foreign investors, too, have significantly raised their holdings of American stocks. [A1.]
 
The decline in retail sales eased bond traders' worries about the possibility that the Fed might raise interest rates next month. Treasury prices rose sharply, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to 6.77 percent from 6.83. [D18.]
 
Electrolux Plans Big Cutbacks
Electrolux of Sweden, the maker of Frigidaire appliances, said it would lay off about 12,000 workers and close 24 factories and 50 warehouses. The restructuring, which will focus on Europe, where the company is the largest appliance maker, reflects a trend in which global manufacturers are consolidating operations there. [D2.]
 
Dressed for the Street
Shares in Polo Ralph Lauren surged when trading began yesterday. The shares closed at $31.50, 21 percent higher than the initial public offering price of $26, and they were the most active issue on American markets. Market Place. [D8.]
 
Thyssen to Buy U.S. Tool Maker
Giddings & Lewis, a Wisconsin tool maker, agreed to be acquired by Thyssen of Germany for $675 million. The deal tops a hostile bid of $631 million from Harnischfeger Industries of Wisconsin. An acquisition would give Thyssen, a steelmaker, a manufacturing base in the United States. [D4.]
 
Support for a Tobacco Settlement
Four major public health organizations offered their strongest support yet for a legal settlement with the nation's cigarette manufacturers, creating further divisions in the already discordant body of anti-smoking advocates. [A12.]
 
Dollar Rebounds Against Yen
The dollar snapped a weeklong decline with the biggest one-day jump against the yen in nearly two years after Japan's top foreign-exchange policy maker said the yen was too strong. The dollar rose by 3.05 yen, or 2.7 percent. [D15.]
 
Wheat prices fell sharply after the Government said a late frost left the winter wheat crop largely undamaged. [D15.]
Drug Giants in Biotechnology Deals
Schering-Plough and Eli Lilly signed deals with small biotechnology companies -- Corvas International, in Schering's case, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, in Lilly's -- to co-develop drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C. [D6.]
 
Spanish Financier Is Acquitted
The former president of the Rumasa business empire of Spain was acquitted on two counts of forgery. The ruling could put to rest a long-running legal battle over the once-giant conglomerate, taken over 14 years ago by a Government that said the company was on the verge of failure. [D8.]
 
Health-Program Overhaul Advances
A Congressional committee approved major changes in Medicare and Medicaid, including new protections for the elderly and the poor who enroll in health maintenance organizations. [A22.]

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Says Huang Passed Secret Data

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
A Republican Congressman said today that intelligence information showed that while working at the Commerce Department, John Huang, who has become a central figure in the Democratic fund-raising scandal, passed classified Government data to his former employer, the Lippo Group of Indonesia.
The Congressman, Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon of New York, accused Mr. Huang of breaching the United States' national security and committing "economic espionage." 
 The accusation is the first in which a Government official has publicly alleged strong intelligence evidence that any figure in the fund-raising scandal passed along official secrets, an issue that is under investigation by the Justice Department and five Congressional committees, including the House Rules Committee, headed by Mr. Solomon.
The accusation was leveled by Mr. Solomon in a statement issued by his office.
"I have received reports from Government sources," the statement said, "that say there are electronic intercepts which provide evidence confirming what I suspected all along, that John Huang committed economic espionage and breached our national security by passing classified information to his former employer, the Lippo Group."
The statement did not give the sources of the electronic messages, when they were intercepted, the particular information Mr. Huang is suspected of disclosing or the identity of the "Government sources" cited by Mr. Solomon. "I can't go any farther than that," his statement said.
Bill Teator, an aide to Mr. Solomon, said that in fact the Congressman had not been told any more about the messages.
"That is the next phase" of the Rules Committee's investigation, Mr. Teator said. "We want to find out how much farther this went, and whom exactly did the information go to, and what precisely the information was."
Ty Cobb and John C. Keeney Jr., Mr. Huang's lawyers, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
Mr. Huang held a mid-level job atthe Commerce Department before becoming a leading fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee during the 1996 Presidential campaign. He left the committee last October, and, although he has denied through his lawyers that he is guilty of any wrongdoing, he has otherwise declined to comment about the mounting number of accusations against him, among them that he illegally funneled foreign money to the party.
Mr. Solomon's further accusation today took many investigators by surprise. Several senators declined to discuss it.
At her weekly news conference, Attorney General Janet Reno was asked whether the new development would bring either a heightened inquiry into Mr. Huang's activities or a new inquiry, into Mr. Solomon's disclosure of what the Congressman described as intelligence information.
"I have just heard about the Congressman's comments," Ms. Reno replied, "so I couldn't really say one way or the other. People should not comment about pending investigations and pending prosecutions."
While the new accusation by Mr. Solomon was something of a milestone, he had already been in hot pursuit of Mr. Huang for some time. He had previously said that phone logs and other records turned over to his committee showed that while at the Commerce Department, Mr. Huang often telephoned the Lippo Group's Los Angeles office within hours of receiving classified data.
And in a letter sent on Tuesday to Louis J. Freeh, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Solomon asked for a "damage assessment."
"Mr. Huang may have had even more exposure to classified information than we had previously known," the Congressman wrote. "Apparently, Mr. Huang not only had access to classified information at the White House, but also to State Department message traffic through a computer network of the Commerce Department because of his political appointment."
While working for 18 months as a Clinton Administration appointee at Commerce, Mr. Huang held a "top secret" security clearance. Officials of the department have told Mr. Solomon's committee that Mr. Huang attended 109 meetings at which classified information may have been discussed, including 37 intelligence briefings.
Mr. Solomon's aides said today that it was assumed Mr. Huang passed on classified information to Lippo during this time. Before joining the Commerce Department, Mr. Huang had been the chief of American operations for Lippo, a $12 billion financial conglomerate run by the Riady family of Indonesia, longtime political supporters of President Clinton.
In his job at Commerce, Mr. Huang was involved in developing commercial opportunities in his native Taiwan. But he was frustrated, colleagues say, because he had few dealings with the department's International Trade Administration on commercial relations with China, Indonesia and other major emerging markets.
Still, Mr. Huang frequently sat in on mid-level meetings on those markets, according to some records released by the department. He also regularly received classified briefings from the officers of the Central Intelligence Agency who were liaisons at Commerce. It is unclear whether the contents of some of those briefings are a subject of the current investigations.
Lippo has broad financial interests in Indonesia, Hong Kong and China, and may have been interested in information about major commercial ventures in any of those countries, although its own network of informers, many believe, was probably ahead of the Commerce Department.
"It's possible John was passing on something of value," one of his former colleagues said today. "Or it's possible he was simply trying to boast to Lippo about his access."

Twins Plan to Test The Marketplace

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, June 12

 BODY:
The Minnesota Twins, frustrated that the State Government has not approved a new park, received permission today from Major League Baseball to talk to buyers who might want to move the franchise after the 1998 season.
Calling the Metrodome an "economic albatross," the acting commissioner, Bud Selig, said new revenue-sharing rules had increased pressure to make more teams competitive. 
 "It's not possible to remain economically viable in the Metrodome," Selig said. "We can't sit and let a club sink into a morass of economic failure that dooms a franchise."
Carl Pohlad, the owner of the Twins, said he had not spoken with any buyers, and declined to say if he would keep the team and attempt to move it.
In the only significant action taken during the two-day meetings here, owners extended the contracts of the American League president, Gene Budig, and the National League president, Len Coleman, by three years, through 2002.

Cone, the Super Fan, Looking for a Playoff Atmosphere

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Appropriately and perhaps adeptly, David Cone will be the first Yankee to pitch in an interleague skirmish when New York opposes the Florida Marlins in Miami tonight. But if you listen to Cone discuss the event, he sounds more like a public relations director for the virtues of the American League against the National League than a pitcher in a historic game.
Over and over yesterday, Cone repeated his sermon about the tingly feelings he expects to experience and expects others to feel now that clubs from baseball's opposite leagues are playing games before the World Series for the first time. Cone sounded like a super flak who is a super fan. 
 "I think the fans are going to make it special," said Cone. "You're going to have a lot of electricity in the stands. The fans are going to be into it. To me, fans can dictate the atmosphere. They can make it a playoff-type atmosphere. They can pump up players."
Not every player shared Cone's sentiments.
"It's just another game," said Mariano Rivera. "It doesn't matter."
An unfazed Cecil Fielder added: "I'm not overjoyed about it. It's on the schedule so you go play."
But while several of Cone's teammates called the journey to Pro Player Stadium just another trip in a long season, the pitcher insisted there was something important about tonight's contest and something extraordinary about the three-game series with the Mets that begins Monday night at Yankee Stadium. Cone claimed fans will love the new matchups and he made an astounding 16 references to fans in a 10-minute interview. Such lavish attention to fans has not been voiced since an overzealous 12-year-old poked his glove over the right-field fence for a huge impact on last year's American League Championship Series.
"There's an element of excitement in the air," said Cone, who will oppose Al Leiter, a former Yankee. "I think the fans are into this experiment. I think the excitement will be up. I think the attendance will be up."
Cone has that right, for all three games in Miami this weekend and all three at Yankee Stadium next week are sold out. The Marlins have been averaging 28,229 fans a game, but the interleague contests will average 41,855, an inflation that was surely influenced by the Yankees' having trained in nearby Fort Lauderdale, Fla., from 1962 to 1995. The Yankees have averaged 25,369, but the encounters with the rival Mets in the Bronx will average 57,545.
"If you're a Yankee or a Met fan, you've been waiting for this for your whole life," said Joe Girardi, looking to Monday.
But before the Yankees tangle with the Mets in the series that George Steinbrenner -- and Steinbrenner alone -- probably considers the most pivotal of the season, they must tussle with Florida. The Marlins (37-26), who are in second place in the National League East, have a better record than the defending World Series champion Yankees (36-27), who are second in the American League East. But the records are not relevant.
"There are Yankee fans everywhere we go," said Cone. "You know there will be a lot of transplanted New Yorkers there."
Cone is the perfect pitcher in this spot because he has a National League background from six years with the Mets and because attention-grabbing games never bother him. But it might bother him to bat in a National League park; the last time he did that in a regular-season game was Aug. 23, 1992. Cone, who had 61 hits in 395 at-bats (.154 average) for the Mets, is not predicting miracles.
"The most important thing is getting down a bunt," Cone said. "The chances of our pitchers getting a hit is pretty remote."
There will be no designated hitter in the series, so Manager Joe Torre has the ticklish choice of picking between Fielder and Tino Martinez at first base. Since Leiter is the only left-hander starting for Florida, the right-handed Fielder (1 for 12 off Leiter) might start over Martinez (1 for 9) tonight.
"I'm not a fan of this," said Torre. "But I think it's going to be electric out there. I think the fans are going to be into it. As much against it as I am, I think this stuff is going to be fun."
 
INSIDE PITCH
General Manager BOB WATSON said DARRYL STRAWBERRY, who is testing his injured left knee at Class AAA Columbus, would not be activated this weekend. While Strawberry slugged a pair of homers in his first three games, he is still running cautiously because of inflamed cartilage and seems doubtful for the series with the Mets. . . . TIM RAINES (strained left hamstring) can be activated Tuesday and said he would join the Yankees on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Algeria's Vote Was Valid

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Algeria's Sham Election" (editorial, June 7) ignores the fact that Algerian voters courageously demonstrated their sovereign will. The international observers monitoring the June 5 legislative elections did not share your view, since they noted only a few minor shortcomings that did not affect the validity of the vote. 
 Contrary to what you recommend, the solution to the crisis in Algeria is the exclusive business of the Algerians themselves, and is now within reach. It stems naturally from advances made by the pluralistic democratic process, like the June 5 vote, from bold economic reforms and from maintaining the peace through the efforts of the state and the people. The Algeria of today and tomorrow has no room for terrorism and for those who use it as political leverage. It is regrettable that you again missed the opportunity to acknowledge the efforts and sacrifices that Algeria has made for democracy.

HEADLINE: Scots' Payoff in Labor's Victory Is Likely to Be Own Parliament

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: EDINBURGH

 BODY:
Are the Scots really different from the English? "You got a week to spend?" said Tim Russell, a 46-year-old construction worker in this city of wide avenues and deeply felt history, warming recently to one of his favorite subjects.
As he outlined his case against the English (they're cultural snobs and political bullies; they imposed the ill-fated poll tax on Scotland a year earlier than on the rest of Britain), he paused. 
 "It's bred deeply inside of us," he said, in a Scots accent so thick it all but proved his point. "Why are Americans American, and not English? It's the same principle."
For Scots like Mr. Russell, the resounding Labor victory in the general election last month did more than just sweep away a Conservative Government that was seen by many here as indifferent, if not hostile, to Scotland's singular culture and special needs. It also turned an old dream of a separate Scottish parliament into almost certain reality.
Many Scots argue that the current political system, in which Scotland is answerable to the national Parliament in London, puts them at a disadvantage. This feeling is compounded by the fact that in three successive elections the Scots voted overwhelmingly for the Labor Party, only to see the Conservatives return to power in London.
"The mistake the Tories made, and a grievous mistake it was, was to underestimate the Scots' desire for a change," said Magnus Linklater, a former editor of The Scotsman, a daily newspaper. "The more the Tories refused to bend, the more convinced the Scots became that they wanted their own parliament."
But Tony Blair, the new Labor Prime Minister, has made the issue one of his top priorities. Under Labor's plan, the Scots are to vote this fall in a referendum that poses two questions: Do you want a separate Scottish parliament? Should it have the power to tax?
Recent opinion polls show that a majority of people would vote yes on both counts, and that immediately raises a third, thornier question: how would power be divided between the new Scottish parliament and the Parliament in London?
"The worst mistake would be a timid wee Scottish parliament with no real powers and no ability to change anything," Mr. Linklater said. The new parliament, he said, must be strong enough to stand up to the arguments of Scottish nationalists, who favor a complete break from Britain.
Scottish nationalism has been on the increase in the last decade or so, gaining momentum as the period of Conservative rule wore on.
Scottish sports fans wear kilts, paint their faces in Scottish colors and sing "Flower of Scotland" instead of "God Save the Queen" at sports events. Artists and writers like James Kelman, who won the Booker Prize in 1994 for "How Late It Was, How Late," a novel written in dense Glaswegian dialect, have made the case for a separate Scottish culture, arguing that Scots are overlooked and condescended to by London's Anglocentric cultural elite.
Looming on a hill over Edinburgh is the Old Royal High School, renamed New Parliament House -- an empty building that awaits the convening of a Scottish parliament and stands as a stony, silent reminder of what many Scots aspire to. And the Scottish National Party, caught up in a tide that sees more and more Scots identifying themselves in polls as Scots first and Britons second, increased its presence in Parliament last month, winning six seats, up from four.
"We got very hostile treatment under the Thatcher Government," said John Swinney, one of the party's new members of Parliament. What separates the Scots from the English, he said, is their view that social justice is just as important as economic wealth.
"Now we're wrestling with the social problems created by the greedy society that Thatcher created, and there's a growing confidence in Scotland that we should be determining more of own own affairs," he said.
With a population of just 5.1 million people spread thinly over a land of rough terrain and harsh weather, Scotland has greater economic needs per capita than England, whose population is 48.9 million.
The British Government says the Scots receive more from the Treasury than they contribute. But the Scottish National Party, pointing to Scotland's expanding economy and rich natural resources, including gas and oil, says that is not true at all. In fact, argued Andrew Wilson, a party economist, from 1979 to 1995 Scotland paid some $43.2 billion more into the Treasury than it got back.
The nationalists' arguments play on Scotland and England's historical antagonism (after centuries of fighting, the two countries merged their crowns in 1603, and their parliaments a century later), and on some deeply held Scottish beliefs about the role of the state and political culture.
"Scots are somewhat more community oriented, more egalitarian and meritocratic," said Lindsay Patterson, a professor of educational policy at Heriot-Watt University here and the author of "The Autonomy of Modern Scotland." "In Scotland there is a greater skepticism of the state. Scots say that the state can be an agent to support volunteerism, in the tradition of Presbyterian democracy."
Members of the Scottish Conservative Party, still reeling from an election that cost them all of their seats in Parliament, play down the differences and emphasize the similarities between Scotland and England.
"The shared political institutions of the last 300 years have been more successful than perhaps in any other part of the world," said Malcolm Rifkind, who was the British Defense Secretary until the Tories were routed in last month's election. He also lost his seat in Parliament.
He and others say that a new parliament would actually strip Scotland of power, by inevitably bringing about a reduction in state financing. The Scottish Office, based in London, currently administers a budget of some $22.9 billion a year according to a population-based formula that was set in 1978 and that many feel is disproportionately generous to Scotland.
In addition, they say, Scotland might well lose some of its 72 seats in the British Parliament, and the Scottish Secretary, a powerful Cabinet minister who oversees the Scottish Office and is Scotland's most powerful champion in London, might see his authority pared down as well.
"Now, the Secretary of State for Scotland has a large civil service; he's got muscle," said Jackson Carlaw, deputy chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party. "Under these proposals, he'll sit there like an emperor without any clothes. He'll have no budget and no staff. Instead of a huge civil service, he'll have a chauffeur and company car."

HEADLINE: Bonds Surge for a Second Day As Producer Price Index Falls

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
An unexpected drop in the Producer Price Index for May sent bond prices surging yesterday for the second consecutive day. It also bolstered investor confidence that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates next month.
Treasury securities rallied from the drop in the price index, a measure of prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers. The overall number, and the core number, which excludes food and energy, fell three-tenths of 1 percent in May from April. Analysts had expected a more modest decline of one-tenth of 1 percent. It was the first time since 1952 that the index had declined for five consecutive months. 
 The 30-year bond rose 20/32 , to a price of 9825/32 , and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.72 percent, from 6.77 percent on Thursday.
The Government also reported yesterday that business inventories rose three-tenths of 1 percent in April, more than the two-tenths of 1 percent analysts had expected.
And in another report, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment preliminary June index, rose to 103.4, from 103.2 a month earlier. Some market participants are worried that bubbling consumer confidence and a tight labor market could keep the economy from slowing, which could lead to a Fed tightening in the near term.
But as for inflation, the picture remained rosy. Kenneth J. McCarthy, the founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, said: "The inflationary pressures continue to recede as declining energy prices reversed their modest increase of 1996. The inflation environment remains as good as it has been in 30-plus years."
The decline in the price index, he said, was broad based, indicating that manufacturers' efforts to reduce costs were continuing even as wage rates were edging higher.
"It points out the fallacy of focusing too much on wages as a driver of inflation," Mr. McCarthy said. "Clearly, this report taken with yesterday's decline in May retail sales and the increase in April inventories shows an economy with slowing demand and not a hint of inflationary pressures."
Short-term interest rates, the most sensitive to changes in Fed policy, have fallen the most in recent days, widening the spread between shorter maturities and longer maturies. The spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond was 69 basis points on Monday; yesterday that spread was 71 basis points. A basis points is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Traders say the spread widens when a growing number of market participants expect the Fed to stand pat or even reduce rates.
In the fixed-income market, South Africa and corporate issuers, including Pacalta Resources Ltd. and the Di Giorgio Corporation plan to sell a combined $1.4 billion in debt. Already in the last two weeks, $19 billion of corporate debt has been priced in the public market and even with the wave of new supply, corporate bonds have maintained their value, an indication of good demand.

HEADLINE: Election-Minded Republicans Try to Join Together

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 11

 BODY:
A national Republican political action committee that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman helped create and then led for five years has been refashioning itself in recent weeks, changing its name and its mission in an effort to broaden its appeal among Republicans.
Now known as the Republican Leadership Council, the organization is being reshaped in the image of the Democratic Leadership Council, the group started in 1985 by centrist Democrats who wanted to pull the party away from liberal influence toward the center of the political spectrum. The Republican council is trying to counter the conservative orthodoxies in its party and move it toward the center. 
 Organizers of the new council said that it was not set up to explore a potential Presidential bid for Mrs. Whitman or any other particular candidate. But they said they did hope that the group could duplicate the success of its Democratic counterpart, which helped to propel Bill Clinton into the White House.
"If we're successful, we'll be able to impact the selection of the next nominee and the election of a Presidential candidate," said Lewis M. Eisenberg, a financier who was appointed chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey by Governor Whitman and is now chairman of the new group.
A major part of the group's effort involves trying to unite party members despite their differing views on abortion -- the issue that has torn at the Republican Party's soul in recent years. The original organization, called the Committee for Responsible Government, supported a woman's right to choose an abortion. The new committee has recruited Republicans who oppose abortion, among them Gov. John Engler of Michigan and Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona.
The purpose, Mr. Engler said in a recent interview, is not to change any minds on the abortion issue, but to figure out how to win more elections. "Governor Whitman's position and Governor Engler's position are different" with regard to abortion, Mr. Engler said. "But I think we've moved beyond that. The goal now is to elect more Republicans."
Mr. Eisenberg agreed with Mr. Engler's analysis. "We're really trying to unite the Republican Party," he said. "The message that we're carrying is that the Republican Leadership Council consists of Republicans who are pro-life and pro-choice."
While trying to defuse the abortion issue, the council members say they want to emphasize that they stand for smaller and smarter government, lower taxes, environmental quality without onerous regulations, school vouchers and tough punishments for criminals.
The Republican organization, unlike its Democratic namesake, is a political action committee with the legal authority to raise money. Before it was reorganized, the group raised about $2 million over more than four years. In recent weeks, it raised about $1 million more as Mrs. Whitman and other political and financial leaders from around the country gathered for fund-raising events in Washington and New York.
The council intends, Mr. Eisenberg said, to give financial support -- both through direct contributions and campaign advertising -- to "common-sense conservatives." Given the party's rather tenuous hold on Congress, Mr. Eisenberg said he hoped the organization could have a major impact on elections in 1998, which he called "a major year in the House and Senate."
The organization's expansion also comes as the party's conservative wing is going through a transition. Ralph Reed, responsible for building the Christian Coalition from a fringe group into a powerful force in the Republican Party, has announced that he will leave as head of the group in September to start his own political consulting firm. He said his clientele would be Christian-oriented candidates who are "pro-family, pro-life, pro-free enterprise."
Because of her current re-election campaign and the potential for conflicts with New Jersey's campaign finance rules, Mrs. Whitman is not playing any official role in the new Republican Leadership Council. But along with Bob Dole, Mrs. Whitman was co-host at the organization's official inauguration in Washington in April. She also spoke to the 100 or so guests who attended the $1,000-a-ticket event, held at the home of Julie Finley, the chairwoman of the local Republican party.
Organizers of the group said that they expected Mrs. Whitman to become involved after this year's gubernatorial race. Asked about the new council and its potential to help Governor Whitman seek national office, a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, Pete McDonough, said it was too early to say whether she might want to be part of a Presidential ticket in 2000. "Only time will tell," Mr. McDonough said. "Right now she doesn't have the fire in the belly."
What both the Republican and Democratic leadership councils have in common is their formation when members of their parties felt they were in danger of being seen as out of touch with a majority of American voters. By the early 1990's, when the Democratic council picked up party support, Democrats had not been in the White House for longer than a decade. Although Republicans now control both houses of Congress, their strength in the House weakened in the last election. And they have been closed out of the White House since 1992.
The Republican Leadership Council has its roots in the Republican National Convention of 1992 in Houston. As the party's right wing waged war on the convention floor before a national television audience, a group of Republican leaders from the mostly moderate Northeast winced at the influence of the party's hard-core conservatives. Mr. Eisenberg recalled the reaction of his two daughters, teen-agers at the time. "They were ready to become Democrats," he said.
Soon thereafter, Mr. Eisenberg, who was a major fund-raiser for Mrs. Whitman in 1993 and Mr. Dole's New Jersey finance chairman in 1996, joined Mrs. Whitman and other politicians from the region, including Susan Molinari, a Congresswoman from New York, and Richard A. Zimmer, then a New Jersey Congressman, to start a political action committee called the Committee for Responsible Government. Mrs. Whitman was chairwoman of the group's board of governors. Also on the board were William F. Weld, Governor of Massachusetts, and Connecticut's Governor, John G. Rowland. The group raised about $2 million, much of it from a 1995 event in New York at which Mrs. Whitman delivered the keynote speech.
But that organization said in its mission statement that "freedom of choice for women" on abortion was one of its "guiding principles." Now, many of the party's moderates have decided that it may be more pragmatic for them to figure out a way to get along despite their disparate views. The new group's "statement of direction" says it "believes in the importance of protecting individual rights and of promoting strong families," and makes no mention of the issue of choice.
At a meeting last month at the Upper East Side home of Henry R. Kravis, the financier, about 50 Republican politicians and well-heeled business people from 16 states -- including Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, Edgar Bronfman Sr., chairman of the Seagram Corporation, and Georgette Mosbacher, the socialite and beauty-products entrepreneur -- talked about "bringing the party back together and more toward the center," Mr. Kravis said later in an interview.
Mr. Kravis -- he is co-chairman of the organization along with John A. Moran, Bob Dole's 1996 campaign finance chairman -- said he had personally grown "very concerned that the party was being split apart," adding, "We were starting to become, because of the pull to the right, the party in which, if you didn't believe with the far right, there was no room for you." As a first step toward building the organization, the guests at Mr. Kravis's home pulled out their checkbooks. More than $750,000 was raised through donations and pledges at the event, according to council officials.
Still, this reconfigured and redefined organization has a big task ahead. Many Republicans see its members as wolves in sheep's clothing, liberals masquerading as Republicans. "Most of these folks describe themselves as economic conservatives and cultural liberals," said Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, an antiabortion public policy group based in Washington. "The problem is, other than a few states in the Northeast, there's very little to show that that's a winning combination."
In addition to moving the Republican Party more toward the center, one of the council's other goals is to make the party more racially diverse. But so far only two of the 40 or so board and executive committee members are racial minorities. Gen. Colin L. Powell has refused an invitation. But Mr. Eisenberg said he planned to ask other members of minority groups to join. "Separate and apart from raising money," he said, "we have to reach out to women and minorities. In order to be a national party, we have to rid ourselves of the perceptions that scare away voters."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell Again in May

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom that low unemployment leads inexorably to rising prices took another hit yesterday as the Government reported that an important measure intended to detect early signs of inflation fell in May, the fifth consecutive month to show a decline.
It was the first time the measure -- the Producer Price Index for finished goods -- had registered a five-month drop since 1952. This year's performance comes despite more than six years of uninterrupted growth that has pushed the jobless rate down to 4.8 percent. 
 Coupled with data released earlier this week showing continued weakness in retail sales, analysts said yesterday's inflation report made it more likely that policy makers at the Federal Reserve Board would keep short-term interest rates steady at their next scheduled meeting in early July.
"The Fed will look at these numbers as encouraging signs that there is not much inflation in the pipeline," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "Inflation remains benign despite tight labor markets."
Led by steep decreases in the costs of automobiles and computers, prices paid to American manufacturers and other producers fell three-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
The drop, which pulled inflation at the producer level down to just three-tenths of 1 percent over the last 12 months, set off another day of sharp rallies in financial markets. The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 70 points to close at a record 7,782.04, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.72 percent, from 6.77 on Thursday. Most market analysts had been expecting the Producer Price Index to show a slight rise.
Even excluding food and energy prices, which can register sharp monthly fluctuations, the index still registered a drop of three-tenths of 1 percent.
So far this year, producer prices have declined at an annual rate of 3.9 percent, in contrast to an increase of 2.2 percent for the first five months of 1996.
The so-called core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, has fallen less sharply, but is still down seven-tenths of 1 percent at an annual rate. For the first five months of last year, the core rate rose at an annual rate of seven-tenths of 1 percent.
"This is a continuation of a pattern we have seen for some time, where finished-goods prices and the core rate are either very, very stable or slightly negative," said Kenneth Dalton, associate commissioner for prices and living conditions at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles and publishes the data on prices.
With producer prices down, the next report on consumer prices, scheduled to be released Tuesday, is also expected to be benign.
Before now, producer prices had not shown five months of decline since the period from August through December 1952.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said yesterday that stocks of unsold goods rose three-tenths of 1 percent in April, mainly because of a pileup of items on retailers' shelves that reflected the recently reported slowdown in sales at the nation's stores.
Even though economic growth is moderating from its torrid pace of 5.8 percent in the first quarter, analysts and traders in the financial markets have long been expecting inflation to start inching higher because very high levels of employment are putting pressure on wages. Higher wages, in turn, are supposed to lead to higher producer and consumer prices.
But to the surprise of many, if not most, economists, that has not happened so far.
"What business people have been saying appears to be true," said Richard Berner, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "They are saying they can't raise prices."
Yesterday's report did show some pockets of price strength. And while analysts said the last five months had to be characterized as a period of disinflation, in which the rate of inflation diminishes but prices do not fall in general, no one was willing to predict that the situation would continue.
For example, raw materials prices, including crude oil, increased by 1.3 percent in May, their first rise in four months. And wholesale food prices were up four-tenths of 1 percent, led by higher costs for fish, pork and beef.
"There is no question we are in a period of disinflation, but it may be ending," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "A number of items, like computers, are falling a lot. But prices aren't falling across the board."
The biggest contributors to the decline in the overall index last month were computer prices, which fell 4.6 percent; auto prices, down 1.6 percent, and energy prices, off 2.1 percent.
Although cheered by the continued good inflation news, Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said he remained convinced that at some point soon tight labor markets would result in stronger inflationary pressures.
"I don't think we have really had a test of the old rules," Mr. Roach said. "Inflation always lags, and the unemployment rate has only just breached the threshold of price stability, which is about 5.25 percent. In a rising-demand environment, that will take prices higher. It is only a question of when, not if."
But the performance of the economy over the last few years has generated challenges to that model.
A number of analysts argue that a strong dollar and global competition make it much easier to keep inflation well contained even as the economy continues to expand.
"The traditional inflation model can't explain how it can be that we have no producer price inflation and extremely strong manufacturing conditions," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. "I think it is time to junk those models."
Mr. Yardeni said the principal new element in the equation was "global competition, which has intensified sharply since the Berlin wall came down in 1989."
According to this view, the rise in global competition not only keeps a damper on the prices of goods and services, but also on the price of labor. While employment conditions are tight in the United States, they are quite soft in many other nations, crimping wage increases everywhere.
"Inflation seems deader than a doornail everywhere you look, and I see it in my travels," said Mr. Roach, who recently returned from a trip to Italy, a country where the inflation rate is less than 2 percent.
If the Producer Price Index was to fall again in June, it would be the first time the index had declined for six consecutive months since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began compiling the data in April 1947, the bureau said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Pacificorp in Biggest Deal Yet for a British Utility

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Pacificorp became the latest American utility company to move into the British market, announcing yesterday an expected deal to acquire the Energy Group, an electricity distribution company, for about $5.8 billion in cash.
The deal, the biggest one yet for a British utility, demonstrates the allure of these highly profitable companies in the deregulating British market, even though the new Labor Party Government is preparing to levy a windfall profits tax that could cost each utility $200 million or more. 
 To help pay for the deal, Pacificorp confirmed that it would sell its telecommunications subsidiary, Pacific Telecom, for $1.5 billion. The buyer is Century Telephone Enterprises Inc., a local telephone company that provides service in 14 states.
Pacificorp's acquisition of the Energy Group, if approved by British regulators, would create an electricity giant with plenty of low-cost power in Britain and the United States and the marketing muscle needed to sell that power as utilities are forced to open up their service areas to competitors.
Pacificorp, which is based in Portland, Ore., owns Pacific Power and Light and Utah Power and Light, which serve seven Western states, as well as several power plants that produce low-cost electricity. It has been aggressively seeking a major marketer of electricity and natural gas across the country as the industry is deregulated in the United States.
Utility industry analysts said Pacificorp was paying a premium price for the Energy Group, especially in light of the expected windfall profits tax on privatized British utilities. The company will assume $3.8 billion of the Energy Group's debt and other obligations, bringing the total value of the deal to about $9.6 billion.
Pacificorp will pay 6.955, or about $11.35, a share for the Energy Group. The Energy Group's American depository receipts, which represent four ordinary British shares, slipped 12.5 cents yesterday, to $42 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Pacificorp's shares also edged down 12.5 cents, to $22.
The analysts said the high price tag for the Energy Group demonstrated the pressure on Pacificorp to stay competitive with the other large American utilities that have already acquired seven British distribution companies over the last two years. The analysts note that the British market, which is already opening itself up to competition, provides a preview of how a deregulated American market is likely to operate.
"A lot of the U.S. companies are using this as a training ground," said Edward J. Tirello Jr., a utility analyst for NatWest Securities. "They can draw on the expertise."
The Energy Group owns the Eastern Group, a big utility in southeastern Britain serving 3.1 million customers including a part of the greater London area. It also owns Peabody Coal, one of the world's biggest coal producers, which has contracts with many power plants across the United States. Pacificorp is expected to use this relationship to get the plants to sell excess low-cost power to its marketing arm, which would then resell it in states that are opening up their utility markets to competition.
Dennis Steinberg, senior vice president for global sales, marketing and energy trading for Pacificorp, said the strategic benefits of owning the Energy Group far outweighed the cost of a British windfall profits tax.
Penelope Adelmann, an analyst at Gruntal & Company, who on Thursday decided to recommend the stock, said it remained to be seen how well the Energy Group would fit into Pacificorp's corporate strategy.
"I want to see how well they can make it work," she said. "It's not just taking something over; you have to get it working together."
The British windfall profits tax became a virtual certainty with the election of the Labor Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair in early May and it is expected to be included in the new British budget that will be introduced on July 2.
The goal of the tax is to raise about $8 billion to help the hard-core unemployed, many of whom lost their jobs when British companies were privatized by Conservative Party governments.
Some analysts estimated that the tax could take in on average $200 million to $300 million from each of the roughly 30 British utilities if all were included and equally taxed.
"It's a big hit," said Mark Spelman, a partner and head of utility strategy for Andersen Consulting in Chicago.
Fred D. Hafer, the president and chief executive of the General Public Utilities Corporation, a utility holding company with subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, said the windfall profits tax would have a significant impact on his company and others that bought British utilities, since it would divert profits that could otherwise go to pay off debt from the takeovers.
"Companies were expecting to have those additional earnings to help pay for the acquisitions," he said.
G.P.U., in a joint venture with the Cinergy Corporation, a utility holding company based in Cincinnati, agreed a year ago to buy Midlands Electricity P.L.C., a distribution company that serves 2.2 million customers.
But Mr. Hafer said G.P.U. remained committed to its investment in Britain and was looking to expand there. "The U.K. has fundamental strengths," he added. "We will look for more opportunities."
Pacificorp's sale of its subsidiary Pacific Telecom will enable the buyer, Century Telephone, to expand into seven more states in the West, including Alaska. Both companies offer similar services in their respective parts of the country. Century, which is based in Monroe, La., primarily serves rural areas in the central United States and offers wireless and Internet services.
Along with paying $1.5 billion for Pacific Telecom, Century Telephone will assume about $700 million of the company's debt. Century Telephone's shares gained 75 cents yesterday, closing at $32.50

HEADLINE: Dow Adds 70, And in Week Soars by 4.7%

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The good news keeps rolling in, and investors continue to see the stock market as the perfect outlet for their hopes and ambitions.
Yesterday, the market rallied after the Government said that producer prices fell for the fifth consecutive month, another indication that the economy was moderating and inflation under control.
The Dow Jones industrial average, now in the midst of one of its best runs in years, soared 70.57 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 7,782.04. It was the sixth consecutive record close for the Dow, and for the week, the blue-chip index gained 346 points, or about 4.7 percent.
"This is a market where bullishness is running rampant," said Larry Rice, the chief investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "The momentum players are playing and the foreign buyers are buying."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set a record, gaining 9.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to 893.27. For the year, the Dow and the S.& P. 500 are both up nearly 21 percent.
As the case for a strong but moderating economy grows, investors are rushing into the market, fearing they will miss out on a big gain, analysts said. Yesterday, volume on the New York Stock Exchange surpassed 570 million shares for the second consecutive day, making it one of the busiest trading days of the year.
"Among portfolio managers, there's a concerted effort to get rid of cash by the end of the quarter," said William LeFevre of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "There's also a lot of shifting out of money market funds and into stocks."
The stock rally is also helping the dollar, which rose again yesterday, as foreign investors try to get their share of the rally. Doubts about the outlook for Europe's single currency is also helping the dollar.
The dollar rose as high as 1.7407 marks before settling in New York at 1.7386 marks, up from 1.7300 marks on Thursday and the highest since February 1994. The dollar rose to 114.89 yen from 114.25 yen. The pound rose to $1.6363 from $1.6316.
Wall Street analysts continue to express astonishment at this year's gains, but there is also talk of a "new era," one exemplified by robust economic growth, soaring profits and low inflation -- all of which have served to bolster stocks.
Even with unemployment at a 24-year low, analysts see few signs of inflationary pressure, and that view has led to falling interest rates and rising stock prices.
"There is this traditional relationship between low unemployment and inflation, which is pretty reliable since the 1970's and 1980's," said William Cheney, the chief economist at John Hancock. "But the dynamics of inflation seem to have changed."
While there are "whispers" about the possibility of the economy slowing enough to hurt earnings growth, most analysts said that investors had shifted their focus from fundamentals to a belief that the market would continue its tremendous ascent.
"Had investors focused on just fundamental valuations, they would have been left behind 500 points ago," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott. "There is something larger going on here."
Dow stocks were led by Caterpillar, which rose 3, to 108 3/4 -- a 52-week high. For the year, Caterpillar is up about 45 percent.
American Express rose 3 1/2, to 76 5/8, and Coca-Cola gained 1 7/8, to 71 7/8.
The brokerage firm Advest rose 5 1/8, to 23 1/4, after Business Week reported that two Boston banks were considering takeovers of the firm.
Technology and small company stocks have lagged behind the blue chips this year, but they have also seen strong gains. The Nasdaq composite, heavily weighted with technology issues, rose 11.71 points, to a record 1,423.03. And the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks gained 2.53 points, to a record 392.07.

Par For the Coarse

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md.

 BODY:
O.K., so I have some issues with golf.
I committed my first sin on a golf course. When I was 8, my girlfriend devised a game where we would hide in the woods at the Rock Creek golf course in Washington and wait for businessmen to hit over the hill. Then we'd run out and grab the balls and retreat to our bosky perch to watch the men search vainly for them. 
 When I confessed our ruse to the priest, he said my soul would never be clean unless I returned the golf balls to their rightful owners -- an impossible assignment. (If any of you guys are reading this, please E-mail.)
My opinion of the game did not improve when I grew up and covered this Maryland suburb for The Washington Star. My biggest story was a murder most fowl, a doctor at Congressional Country Club who got so angry at a goose honking while he was trying to play that he bludgeoned it to death.
Covering George Bush for The Times, my feelings grew bleaker. I was forced, on many a summer morning, to rise at 6 and lurch around the back nine, watching the President's manic play -- dubbed "golf-polo" -- and genial cheating. Once after I'd sat cross-legged and doleful as Mr. Bush teed off, he teed off to an aide that I was putting a "Hinayanistic" evil eye on him. (Yes, it's a real word.)
Even during my stint as a sports reporter, my attitude was much like the Young Man in a P. G. Wodehouse story who dismissed "gowf" as "a pestilential pastime," a "a blanked, infernal, fatheaded game." It seemed like premature senility, men with guts pretending they were exercising and giving themselves a fake sense of being in the wild.
I failed to see that those were its attractions. Baby boomers with a good economy and bad knees wanted to revert to the Eisenhower style now that the world was in their hands.
"Golf for guys is about getting away with it," says Sally Jenkins, a writer for Sports for Women magazine. "They like to sit in the clubhouse and drink gin and play card games.
"My dad," she continues, referring to the sportswriter Dan Jenkins, "goes to eat red meat, have a hot dog, which my mother does not allow him to do at home. Golf can be a sunrise-to-sunset deal if you play your cards right."
"The golf course is a haven for men to smoke cigars and tell dirty, sexist jokes," agrees John Feinstein, the sportswriter.
I began to see golf in a new light. A feminist light. A transgressive light. It suddenly seemed critically important to encourage "pink golf," as Ms. Jenkins dubbed the burgeoning number of women players, if only to give the men the dreaded yips and ruin their putts.
Consider that the laureled Tiger defended his swing coach for working at Lochinvar, a Houston club that does not allow women. "I can't be the champion of all causes," Mr. Woods said, adding about the club's rule, "that's just the way it is."
"Nike, American Express and Rolex," said Mr. Feinstein. "Those are the causes Tiger's fighting for."
Multiracial is easier, I guess, than multi-sexual.
I went out to the U.S. Open at Congressional to mingle among the rugged individualists smoking cigars, wearing Madras shorts and belts with sailboats, talking into their cell phones, chatting about their investment advisers, ordering $4 slices of focaccia and $4.50 glasses of iced cappuccino and visiting the A.T.M.'s.
I learned the arcana of the sport, that Tiger travels with an amulet from his dad -- a gold ball mark, fashioned from Earl Woods's melted-down bridgework.
And I learned some lingo. "The casual dropping of the phrase 'titanium shaft' can go a long way," says Tony Kornheiser, a sports columnist for The Washington Post.
Besides the traditional moaning and "oohhh"-ing and "You-the-man"-ing, here are some other lines guaranteed to frighten men into thinking we're invading the sacred precinct. They are best delivered with a Mae West (or Ru Paul) intonation:
"Half of driving it longer is in your head."
"Check out my great Big Bertha."
"Be the longest you can be."
"Don't rinse your ball."
"Are your spikes hard or soft?"
"I rolled it real good."
"I had a violent lip-out."
"Don't groove your waggle."
And once you've rattled them, you can go home and watch something with a more womanly speed. Like the Bulls game.

HEADLINE: A Russian's Rise From Car Dealer to Tycoon

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 13

 BODY:
In the ornate 19th-century merchant's mansion he restored as a sumptuous company club, Russia's most prominent 20th-century merchant was explaining how he put aside his first love, business, to serve the Russian state.
Boris A. Berezovsky, 51, the founder of Logovaz, a car dealership he built into a major communications and oil conglomerate, has worked for the last six months as deputy secretary of the National Security Council, mostly shuttling between Moscow and Grozny to help hammer out a peace agreement with the rebel republic of Chechnya. 
 The boundaries between public office and private wealth are notoriously blurred in Russia. A contentious figure and a natural target for charges of conflict of interest, Mr. Berezovsky put his assets and company stocks in trust after joining the Government. He said he completely divorced himself from the management of his many business interests. "I am not at all responsible for Logovaz today."
Seconds later an aide glided to his side and handed him a mobile phone. "Gluzhkov," he murmured.
Nikolai Gluzhkov is a co-founder and acting chairman of Logovaz, and Mr. Berezovsky's closest business associate. He is also chief financial officer of Russia's largest airline, Aeroflot. Logovaz, which hopes to acquire shares in Aeroflot when the Government reduces the 51 percent stake it has in the airline, has already taken over most of its management.
Mr. Berezovsky jumped out of his seat and took the call in an adjoining room.
In post-Communist Russia, the Politburo has been replaced by a deal-making oligarchy -- the dozen or so powerful, fiercely competitive businessmen who run the banks, oil companies and news organizations, and who banded together to bankroll President Boris N. Yeltsin's re-election.
Mr. Berezovsky is public spokesman and chief lobbyist for this new elite, which moved from the shadows to respectability in a few short years.
Using his national security post as a springboard, he is now recasting himself as a statesman. He donated $3 million to charity last year and a major scientific association named him Philanthropist of the Year. He writes solemn editorials opposing NATO expansion. This week he canceled an appearance before the prestigious Council on Foreign Relations in New York and raced back to Grozny for urgent talks. He recently told a radio interviewer that the 20th-century figure he most admired was Henry Kissinger.
But even as he works to broaden his image, his complex business dealings have once again thrust his commercial interests, not his statecraft, into the limelight.
Like most of Russia's new rich, Mr. Berezovsky made his money mysteriously and fast. A mathematician who worked on decision-making theory for an institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in 1989 he parlayed a relationship with the state-owned automobile giant Avtovaz to spin off Russia's first capitalist car dealership, Logovaz. By 1994 he had expanded that into a vast communications and oil conglomerate. Among other things, he owns a sizable portion of the nation's largest television network, ORT, as well as the seventh-largest oil company, Sibneft.
Following an example set by Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Berezovsky made available an income declaration. According to his calculations, he personally earned a relatively modest $500,000 last year. But outside estimates of Logovaz's worth range from $250 million to more than $1 billion.
Last month, a nasty closed-door battle for control of the state's remaining shares of Sibneft suggested that Mr. Berezovsky's companies remain aggressive players on the Russian business scene.
Behind closed doors, Finansoyava Neftyanaya Kompania, F.N.K., a company Mr. Berezovsky co-founded, managed to prevent KM-Invest, a subsidiary of one of Russia's most powerful banks, Onexim Bank, from bidding in an auction to buy shares of Sibneft. F.N.K., which managed the auction, ended up acquiring the shares for $110 million. Mr. Berezovsky expressed some glee over the feat but said he was not personally involved.
Mostly, the fracas underscored the fierce financial rivalry dividing the leading Russian businessmen Mr. Berezovsky says are united in a civic-minded crusade to promote economic reform and democracy.
Onexim Bank said it would take F.N.K. to court. As is increasingly common in Russia, the rival financial giants then raced to try the case in the newspapers they own.
Mr. Berezovsky's appointment to a national security post last November was widely criticized. There was a scandal when newspapers discovered that Mr. Berezovsky, who is Jewish, had taken Israeli citizenship in 1994 after an assassination attempt in which his driver was killed. He relinquished his dual citizenship before taking the job.
Some commentators suggested that Mr. Berezovsky's induction into government was a sinister plot to allow Mr. Berezovsky to use geopolitics to expand his oil interests.
Like many of the people in Russia who became very rich very fast, Mr. Berezovsky has been the subject of numerous press reports that suggest he relied on organized crime to build his business empire. A Forbes Magazine cover story last December made such a charge, prompting Mr. Berezovsky to sue Forbes for libel in Great Britain.
He hired the Washington-based firm Edelman Public Relations to improve his image overseas, making him perhaps the only the Russian government official to have an American publicist.
As far as anyone can detect, Mr. Berezovsky has spent money in Chechnya, not earned it. While taking part in the negotiations, he took 10 trips and spent a million dollars of Logovaz money hiring private planes and bulletproof cars. After a few early blunders, his skill in getting things done there won him the grudging respect of at least some of his colleagues in the Kremlin.
However, Ivan Rybkin, Secretary of the National Security Council, does not pretend that Mr. Berezovsky is just another subaltern. "The private sector here has huge significance," he said when asked to explain Mr. Berezovsky's duties. "Berezovsky's participation in the power structure is absolutely necessary." Mr. Rybkin said. He added dryly, "In your country, Mr. Perot wanted to be President."
Mr. Berezovsky has handled his outsized clout with grace. A compulsive mobile-phone user, Mr. Berezovsky even complied with Mr. Rybkin's ban on pagers or mobile phones in his office. Like a gunslinger surrendering his Colt .45's at the saloon door, Mr. Berezovsky anxiously but dutifully hands over his phones and pagers to the duty officer before each meeting.
In the gray corridors of the Russian Government, the rakish Mr. Berezovsky stands out.
He was the only member of the Russian negotiating team to meet with Chechnya's most radical and volatile terrorist, Salman Raduyev. He was also the only member of the Russian negotiating team to treat himself after the talks to some rest and relaxation at the Cannes Film Festival.
The only son of a nurse and a builder, Mr. Berezovsky did not grow up in the privileged world of the Soviet elite. His two eldest daughters attended Cambridge University. One now works at Premier SV, an advertising agency that sells all the media time at his network, ORT. The other works at ORT.
Engaging and bristling with drive, Mr. Berezovsky has a knack for networking. He always has. "He was different from the others in his energy and ability to establish business and other connections with people," said Vladimir Borzenko, a research scientist who worked closely with Mr. Berezovsky at the institute. "Everybody knew him and he knew everybody."
Mr. Berezovsky has also proven deft at discarding friends at the opportune time. By 1993, he had ingratiated himself with Mr. Yeltsin's powerful and shadowy chief of security, Aleksandr Korzhakov and another hawkish top adviser, Oleg Soskovets, both of whom proved helpful when Mr. Berezovsky began expanding the Logovaz empire.
When those two men fell from favor during the election campaign, Mr. Berezovsky landed on the right side of their chief rival, Anatoly B. Chubais, who has since become First Deputy Prime Minister. It was in a drawing room of Mr. Berezovsky's Club Logovaz that Mr. Chubais, Mr. Berezovsky and others plotted to oust the hawkish Mr. Korzhakov.
Mr. Berezovsky has grown close to Mr. Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Dyachenko, whom he met only a year and a half ago. Last March he raced up to Nizhni Novgorod the same day as she did to persuade its popular, reform-minded young Governor, Boris Nemtsov, to join Mr. Chubais's economic team. His complex business dealings are a case study of the advantages of insider trading and Kremlin ties. But he casts himself as a free-market reformer.
Critics and friends alike debate whether Mr. Berezovsky is driven by greed or ego, or both. Mr. Borzenko had a simpler explanation.
"The rules of the game in Russia are such that when you have reached a certain level, you cannot stop," he said. "If you rest on your laurels, you will be kicked off your perch quite painfully. It's like a bicycle: you fall when you stop."

Stocks Climb Sharply To 6th Record Close in Row
The stock market extended its record-breaking run, as the Dow Jones industrial average soared another 70.57 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent. It was the sixth straight record close; for the week, the Dow gained 346 points, or about 4.7 percent. 
 A report showing a drop in prices paid to producers served as the fuel for yesterday's surge. As the case for a strong, but moderating, economy grows, investors continue to rush into the market: yesterday was one of the busiest trading days of the year. [Page 36.]
 
Bond prices also rose sharply on the drop in May producer prices. The 30-year bond rose 20/32 , to a price of 9825/32 , and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.72 percent, from 6.77 percent on Thursday. [49.]
 
Japan Speeds Up Liberalization
The Japanese Government plans to speed up its timetable for changes to its financial markets, called the Big Bang. Originally the revamping was scheduled for completion by the year 2001, but now the Government hopes to end controls on brokerage commissions, rules forbidding banks and securities firms to enter each other's business and other restrictions by the end of 1999. [38.]
 
Japan's economic output surged 1.6 percent in the first quarter. Japanese consumers were purchasing freely from January through March in anticipation of a tax increase that took effect on April 1. The higher taxes, however, are likely to slow the economy's growth for the rest of the year. [38.]
 
Judge Approves Barney's Fee
The judge overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings of Barney's Inc. has allowed the retailer to offer a $8.5 million breakup fee to a potential suitor. Two bids have been made so far: one by the Hong Kong retailer Dickson Concepts and the other by the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue. But Barney's creditors committee wants to attract higher bids. [38.]
 
Kohl Confident Of Deal on Euro
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, left, expressed confidence yesterday that there would be an agreement on preparations for the single European currency when European Union leaders meet next week in Amsterdam. Mr. Kohl rebuffed suggestions by France's new Socialist Government to revive plans for ambitious public works programs to reduce unemployment before the currency is introduced in 1999. [3.]
 
Europe and U.S. Reach a Deal

HEADLINE: Teacher, Friend . . . Victim?;
Shaken by Killing, Instructors Weigh the Risks of Caring

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
The students in Stephen Koss's 12th-grade class were more than a little impressed.
A Sunday afternoon in an elegant Colonial house in Westchester, with burnished furniture and a Steinway baby grand. A barbecue on the deck overlooking a sumptuous sweep of lawn, a terraced rock garden and a paved backyard basketball court. 
 For many of the students at the New York City Laboratory School, a public school in Manhattan, it was the first time they had been invited to such a place. It was also the first time many had been at a teacher's home.
"For this to happen, it's pretty amazing," said Nelson Santana, 18, a Roosevelt Islander who, with his mother, has lived on Social Security since his father died in a car accident. "I couldn't think of another person who would make a cookout for us at his house."
Mr. Koss is somewhat unusual in the city system. Three years ago, he shrugged off his six-figure management-consultant career and became a math teacher. He is one of a relative handful of teachers whose affluent backgrounds give them no economic motivation to take on the grindingly tough job of teaching in the New York City public schools.
The murder of Jonathan Levin, a public high school teacher in the Bronx who was the son of Time Warner's top executive, and the arrest last week of a former student, is causing Mr. Koss and many teachers to think about their relationships with students.
Lawyers for the former student, Corey Arthur, said earlier this week that he thought of Mr. Levin as a mentor and visited his home regularly. Prosecutors say Mr. Arthur used his relationship with Mr. Levin to gain entry to his apartment, where, the police say, the teacher was killed for his bank card.
For teachers, the killing has raised deep questions: Amid the race and class tensions so evident in New York, how should teachers go about reaching students with backgrounds distant from their own? How accessible should they make themselves? Should they invite students to their homes?
"I can count on one hand the number of times my students have been over to my apartment, but when this happened to Jonathan, all four of those incidents came into my mind," said Jeremy Chiappetta, who teaches social studies to eighth graders at Intermediate School 90 in Washington Heights. "If they called and asked for help and wanted to meet me, would I let them in the door? The answer is yes, I would."
Some teachers fear the murder could prompt teachers to pull back from their students and even discourage them from teaching in New York City. But some say Mr. Levin's death only underlines the need for teachers to make strong connections to their students, especially students whose rough-edged lives have made them hard, distrustful of adults and the knowledge they try to transmit.
The teachers union tells members to use their own judgment. "They should be cautious, but basically it depends on the style and the preference of the teacher as well as who their kids are," said Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers. "Many of the older teachers, who perhaps have been burned, caution younger teachers who want to have more contact. By burned I mean kids tracking them down at home, kids bothering them at home excessively."
Several teachers asked about their accessibility said they calibrate their behavior in different ways, balancing access with authority. One gives out his phone number, but not his address; another invites students to his Upper West Side apartment on occasion, but said he takes care not to wear his Rolex watch to school.
But all, including those from wealthy backgrounds -- some the only white faces in their classrooms -- said they believed spending time with students outside of school and making themselves available was a critical part of their teaching, one of the only ways to gain students' trust.
The teachers say it matters little to students if a teacher is affluent.
"They assume that if you're a teacher, you're rich, and in reality, making $30,000 a year is more than 99 percent of my kids' families make," Mr. Chiappetta said.
Mr. Chiappetta, 23, who grew up "not wanting for anything" as the son of a Pennsylvania real estate appraiser and investor, said he gives all 180 students his home number and gets calls all the time.
A few times, students have called him to say they are hungry and no one in their family is around. Mr. Chiappetta has met them and bought them dinner. He spends hours with students in the after-school chess club he started, has invited a few to his apartment, and once, when students were misbehaving, he got their parents' permission to punish them by having them take part in a Saturday clean-up of his neighborhood.
"Certainly, I've taken some precautions," said Mr. Chiappetta, who started as part of Teach for America, in which college graduates defer private-sector ambitions for a couple of years while they teach in urban schools. "I do have a caller I.D. box. I do have voice-mail. I have had prank phone calls made, and I am sure they're my students. But the reality is that these students, in order to be successful, need to know that I'm there for them."
Angel Rivera, 13, said Mr. Chiappetta's dedication transformed him from a D student into a member of the honor roll. "He made me get better grades," Angel said.
Marc Sternberg, another Teach for America recruit, whose father owned the Maison Blanche department stores in Louisiana, says he is more cautious. Still, he fields at least 5 or 10 phone calls a night from his fourth graders in Community School 66 in the South Bronx, calls their parents frequently and raised money to take 40 students to a summer school program at Princeton, his alma mater.
But Mr. Sternberg, 24, said that he does not invite students to his apartment, and that he would be hesitant to teach in high school "because of the safety question." He does not talk about his background much, having concluded that the gulf between him and his students is just too wide.
"I'm white, one of the few whites here," he said. "They know that I live in Manhattan. They assume that I'm rich and famous."
And, he added, prejudice goes both ways. "A lot of people who aren't from the Bronx have preconceived notions of people who are. The same is true of people from the Bronx -- especially their attitude toward white people."
Caroline Fraiser, 48, a seventh-grade social studies teacher at I.S. 90, says her own working-class background is an advantage. "I grew up in Harlem, and I live in Harlem," she said. "They respect me. I tell them there will be no pity parties here."
She is accessible to students after school and recently took a student to see a Minnesota private school, which had offered the girl a scholarship. She will give her home number to students who ask for it.
"I don't really push it on them," she said. "I don't want them to feel like they have to play up to me to get a grade."
But some teachers from wealthier or culturally different backgrounds feel they have to earn work harder to make a connection to their students.
"The economic gap, the racial gap, the cultural gap, they're all there and they're huge, gargantuan, much, much larger than I had ever anticipated," said Timothy Shriver, the son of the former Peace Corps director, Sargent Shriver, who taught for 10 years in the New Haven public schools. "I don't know that I was very good in the beginning. I don't think I understood where the kids were coming from."
Mr. Shriver, who left teaching several years ago to head the Special Olympics, said that he could not really have hidden his Kennedy-clan status, but that he dodged student questions because he didn't want to emphasize what made him different. He said he spent a lot of time visiting his students in their neighborhoods, going to their ball games, taking them to the movies.
"Kids have a very sharp lens on sincerity," he said. "They are very eager to know whether you care, do you give a damn. If you come from a place where people are always kowtowing to position and prestige and all that, it can be a refreshing thing. As one of my students said once, 'You like to be here because we treat you like a normal.' "
Mr. Koss, who grew up middle-class in Indianapolis, feels his self-made success can serve as an example to his students at the Lab School, a selective public school for children from all economic backgrounds.
"The kids knew I gave up a business career where I was making a lot of money," said Mr. Koss, who has also told his students about his wife's position as the president of commercial credit for Traveler's Group. His students say his background is evidence of his dedication.
"I think that teaching is a very sacrificing position," said one, Jean Leng, 18. "For him to do what he's doing, it makes a big difference."
Last Sunday, when Mr. Koss escorted his 12 calculus students to his home in Pelham for a barbecue, he was not only intending it as a graduation celebration.
"For them to come here and see this," Mr. Koss said, "hopefully it's motivating."

Cambodian Minister Says Pol Pot Ordered Aide Killed
The First Prime Minister of Cambodia claimed that Pol Pot, the ailing leader of the Khmer Rouge, ordered the execution of a top lieutenant, his wife and 10 members of their family, and then fled his jungle hideout on a stretcher. The account could not be confirmed. 1 

Indonesian Project Challenged
The Clinton Administration said it would ask the World Trade Organization to rule against Indonesia's national car project. The move marks the first direct American challenge to the financial empire of President Suharto, whose son is in charge of the project, which imports cars from South Korea but is exempt from the high tariffs and taxes paid by other foreign producers. The European Union and Japan have already challenged the program. 5
 
Plutocrats Squabble in Russia
A fracas has broken out between Russian plutocrats whose exact interests and powers are clad in mystery. When a company controlled by Boris Berezovsky, deputy secretary of Russia's National Security Council and a self-proclaimed free market reformer, obtained shares in a state company, rivals alleged that his business empire testified to the advantages of insider trading and Kremlin ties. 3
 
No Treaty Accord in Europe
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany met with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France, but no joint French-German accord was reached on whether to support a revision of the Treaty on European Union. Mr. Jospin, a Socialist, proposed public works programs to reduce unemployment but Mr. Kohl, a conservative, rebuffed the idea. 3
 
Somalia Photos Shock Italians
An Italian news magazine published photos showing what appeared to be Italian soldiers abusing unarmed civilians with electrodes and flares during an American-led mission to Somalia in 1993. The minister of defense, after first referring to the actions as "pranks," pledged an immediate investigation into the scandal, which has upset Italians' image of their armed forces as a gentle bastion of pageantry. 4
 
Taliban Attack in Afghanistan
Taliban soldiers in Afghanistan fired rockets and heavy artillery at a strategic city that it is trying to take back from opposition troops. The Taliban has sent thousands of troops to the city, Jebul Siraj, which lies on the only road linking northern and southern Afghanistan. The Taliban, which controls most of the country, lost Jebul Siraj three weeks ago; its last northern stronghold fell on Wednesday. (AP)

Tax-Cutting Bill Approved
The House Ways and Means Committee approved a Republican tax-cutting bill over unanimous Democratic opposition, setting Congress on a collision course with the Clinton Administration over how to divide the tax reductions agreed on in their balanced budget plan. 1
 
Change in Medicare Urged
Senate Republicans said that in their effort to balance the Federal budget they would try to increase the age of eligibility for Medicare and start charging elderly people $5 for each visit by a home health care agency. The American Association of Retired Persons promptly criticized both proposals. 10
 
Army Ends Harassment Line
The Army shut down a special telephone line that has received more than 1,300 sexual-harassment complaints since November because Army officials said anonymous tipsters were trying to use it to settle personal grudges. Army officials insisted they had been considering unplugging the number anyway because the calls had dwindled to a handful a day in recent weeks. 6
 
Simpson Lawyer Disciplined
The California State Bar announced that it had formally reprimanded one of the defense lawyers in the O. J. Simpson criminal trial and would soon censure a second. Carl E. Douglas was issued a public reproval after investigators determined that employees at Mr. Douglas's office had forged his name on two subpoenas sent to a potential witness in the Simpson trial 6

Eric H. Holder Jr., President Clinton's choice to be the deputy Attorney General, faced mild questioning about his opposition to the death penalty and other issues at a hearing as he headed toward an apparently easy confirmation. Both Democrats and Republicans praised the choice of Mr. Holder for the Justice Department's No. 2 post. 22
 
Donation Still in Dispute
Democratic Party officials said they were no longer certain of their assertion that a suspicious 1996 campaign donation had come from the account of a dead woman. The donor may have been another woman by the same name, but even that could not be determined with any certainty, party officials said. 10

Agent Suspected in Theft
The F.B.I. agent who supervised the investigation of Nicholas Corozzo, the apparent heir to John Gotti, is suspected of stealing a major piece of evidence -- almost $100,000 that prosecutors said were loan-sharking profits. Discussions about a possible plea bargain broke down when Mr. Corozzo's defense team learned of the allegations against the veteran agent, Jerome R. Sullivan, and defense lawyers said they would attack Mr. Sullivan's credibility and integrity in an effort to undermine the prosecution's evidence. 1
 
Muslim Symbols Approved
The Board of Education in New York City settled a court suit by agreeing to encourage schools to use the Muslim star-and-crescent symbol as part of displays containing symbols of Christmas, Hanukkah and other holidays. Members of the city's Muslim community said they had brought the Federal lawsuit a year and a half ago after they found that some districts and schools were refusing to include the symbol in holiday displays. 23

The conventional wisdom that low unemployment leads inexorably to rising prices took another hit as the Government reported that an important measure designed to detect early signs of inflation fell in May for the fifth consecutive month.

HEADLINE: House Panel Votes Tax Cuts, But Fight Has Barely Begun

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13

 BODY:
The House Ways and Means Committee approved a Republican tax-cutting bill over unanimous Democratic opposition early today, setting Congress on a collision course with the Clinton Administration over how to divide the tax reductions agreed on in their balanced-budget plan.
While Administration officials and some Congressional Democrats held out hope that the Senate would adopt a plan more acceptable to the President when it takes up its version of the legislation next week, the bill being prepared by Senate tax writers closely tracks the House bill in many ways, increasing the odds of Mr. Clinton's vetoing the final version. 
 The failure of the House committee's chairman, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, to secure any Democratic support for his plan shows that the partisan wrangling that dominated debates over taxes and spending for two years has returned, cutting short the respite since the White House and the Congressional leadership compromised on a budget blueprint last month.
Mr. Archer's plan, approved by a 22-to-16 vote in the early hours of the morning, would reduce tax bills for investors and many families, provide some tax breaks for college expenses, reduce Federal inheritance taxes and expand Individual Retirement Accounts.
The measure calls for $135 billion in tax cuts over five years, offset in part by nearly $50 billion in new revenues, generated largely by expanding existing taxes on airline tickets and closing loopholes.
But the White House and Democrats on the committee attacked the plan as heavily tilted in favor of the rich and as violating the budget deal by scaling back Mr. Clinton's proposed college tax breaks. They said that unless the legislation was changed substantially, the risks of a partisan standoff would be high.
White House officials have avoided explicit veto threats, but Mr. Clinton repeated his criticism of Mr. Archer's bill today, saying that among other problems it "would penalize the working poor and especially working poor mothers."
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Archer's legislation "is not the bill that will be signed into law."
Republican leaders said they expected the main components of Mr. Archer's bill, including a credit of up to $500 a child for families and a reduction in the capital gains tax, to be included in the final legislation -- after the Senate drafts its tax bill and the two chambers settle any differences between them.
But they said they were open to limited changes in the bill.
"We will negotiate to get a signed bill," Speaker Newt Gingrich said.
Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is scheduled to introduce his version of the tax bill next week. A draft of his plan given to Democrats on Thursday included provisions that are likely to prove unacceptable to the Administration, especially in the area of tax breaks for college expenses.
In the House, Mr. Archer's bill passed the Ways and Means Committee with only limited changes. Mr. Archer's proposal to tax Indian tribes for their business activities was stripped out of the bill early today by a combination of Democrats and Republicans, some of whom argued that the plan would amount to an unconstitutional tax on sovereign governments and others of whom sought to protect Indian constituencies in their states.
Mr. Archer's bill could go to a vote on the House floor as early as next week. It will be reviewed first by the House Rules Committee, which will be under pressure from Mr. Gingrich to strip out another provision that could cause political problems for many Republicans, a measure that would end subsidies for ethanol, a corn-based alternative fuel. Ethanol subsidies have long been protected by a bipartisan coalition of farm-state lawmakers, and some Republicans would prefer not to have to vote in favor of their party's tax bill at the cost of opposing ethanol subsidies.
Mr. Archer's bill contains the following provisions:
*A credit of up to $500 a child under age 17 for families with incomes up to $110,000, a key demand of the religious right. But the plan is structured in a way that would make many low- and moderate-income people who receive the earned income tax credit ineligible for the child credit, and it would limit the child credit for families that claim a credit for child-care expenses. As a result, the Administration argues that the credit does too much for relatively well-off families and not enough for lower-income working families.
*A tax credit for 50 percent of up to $3,000 in expenses for each of the first two years of college. The Administration continued to press for its plan, which would provide a $1,500 credit and would not reduce the credit even if the recipient were receiving a Federal student aid grant. The Republican plan contained only a limited version of Mr. Clinton's proposal for a deduction of up to $10,000 a year for college expenses. And the White House argued that the plan violated the budget agreement by allocating $3 billion less than the $35 billion set aside for the President's education initiatives.
*A reduction in the top rate on capital gains for individuals, to 20 percent from 28 percent. Mr. Archer's bill also included a provision to allow investors to factor out the effects of inflation in calculating their gains, starting in 2001.
*An expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts to allow people who do not qualify for tax-deductible deposits to make nondeductible deposits that would accrue interest tax free and be withdrawn tax free for retirement or purchase of a home. Such savers are already allowed to make nondeductible contributions to an I.R.A., but, as with all other I.R.A. holders, the earnings grow only tax-deferred -- they are taxed upon withdrawal -- rather than tax-free. Further, unless the account holder is prepared to pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service, under current law he may withdraw from the I.R.A. only for retirement, not for any other purpose like an earlier home purchase.
*A phased-in increase in the exemption from Federal estate taxes, to $1 million from the current $600,000.
The Senate bill being drafted by Mr. Roth has the same broad outlines, although it differs in many details, and could still change before it is formally introduced next week. But the Administration has long had a strained relationship with the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, and it is unclear how closely the Democrats on the committee will work with the Administration to reshape the bill.
Mr. Roth's plan would create a $500 child credit, but parents with children from 13 to 16 would have to deposit the proceeds into an educational savings account. As in the House version, many recipients of the earned income tax credit would not be eligible for the full child credit.
The Senate bill would have a credit for the first two years of college nearly identical to that in the House bill, but it would not contain any version of the $10,000 college deduction supported by Mr. Clinton. Although the education package in the Senate bill contains several provisions with bipartisan support, including a restoration of deductibility of student loan interest, it allocates $30 billion rather than the $35 billion sought by Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Roth's proposal includes a reduction in the capital gains top rate to 20 percent, but does not include the inflation-adjustment provision in the House bill, and would not reduce the corporate capital gains rate, as Mr. Archer's bill does.

Police Say Man Admits Strangling a Beautician

 BODY:
The police arrested a Brooklyn man early yesterday morning and charged him with strangling a beautician whose body was found earlier this week stuffed above the ceiling of her family's Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment.
During routine questioning, the police said, the man, Kirt Nicholas, an unemployed construction worker, confessed to killing Maudlyn James, 27, almost two months ago. Detective Capt. Michael Muscatello said that the suspect was the boyfriend of Ms. James's 25-year-old sister. But the captain said that Mr. Nicholas, 28, of 299 Woodbine Street, could not explain his motive. 
 Captain Muscatello said that Mr. Nicholas, who moved to New York from Trinidad five years ago, had no police record and appeared to be in good standing with the James family.
Ms. James disappeared on April 21. A few days ago, the family noticed a foul smell in the apartment that seemed to come from a crawl space between the ceiling and roof. A police emergency services unit broke through the crawl space and discovered the body.

HEADLINE: Brutal End for an Architect of Cambodian Brutality

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, June 13

 BODY:
Son Sen, the Khmer Rouge official who was reported today to have been executed by his leader, Pol Pot, was one of the earliest members of the radical Maoist movement, and one of its most brutal.
During the movement's four years in power in the late 1970's, Mr. Son Sen was Cambodia's Defense Minister and oversaw the torture and execution of more than 10,000 people at Tuol Sleng prison in Phnom Penh. They were among more than a million people who died during those years at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. 
 He was also the official who brought about the emptying of Phnom Penh in the immediate aftermath of the Khmer Rouge military victory in 1975, in an experiment in radical agrarianism that had ghastly results.
Mr. Son Sen's reported killing on Tuesday by his close comrades, following an accusation of spying and treason, seemed to close the circle on his role as an executioner during the purges at Tuol Sleng, in which the Khmer Rouge Government devoured itself.
From their early years in power, from 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge under Mr. Pol Pot have been marked by paranoia, and the accusations of betrayal against Mr. Son Sen echo those levied against the thousands of people who died at his hands.
The radical Maoist group had its roots in the Vietnamese-led Communist movement that emerged in Indochina as the French colonial era came to an end in the early 1950's. It moved from underground agitation to jungle warfare to triumph in 1975 along with the Communist victory in Vietnam.
Now the inner circle appears to be narrowing almost to nothing, and it is not clear how many of Mr. Pol Pot's lieutenants remain loyal to him. In describing the events today, First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh said Mr. Pol Pot, in fleeing his jungle hideout on a stretcher, had taken with him three other members of his ruling group -- not as allies but as "hostages."
The first of a series of defections of thousands of guerrillas since last summer was led by Ieng Sary, another close comrade of Mr. Pol Pot's, who had served as Foreign Minister during the years of Khmer Rouge power.
"Ninety-five percent of the armed forces in Anlong Veng are determined to join the royal Government and are now surrounding Pol Pot," Mr. Ranariddh said, referring to the Khmer Rouge's stronghold.
Back in the 1950's, when the Khmer Rouge movement was forming, both Mr. Ieng Sary and Mr. Son Sen were among Mr. Pol Pot's earliest associates. All three studied in France and became converted to Marxism in those years.
A former schoolteacher like Mr. Pol Pot, Mr. Son Sen returned to Cambodia in 1956 after losing his scholarship and resumed teaching. He joined the Communist Party in 1960 and disappeared into the underground insurgency four years later.
He commanded the final Khmer Rouge assault on Phnom Penh in April 1975 and oversaw the first act of mass brutality of the new leadership: the forced evacuation of all city-dwellers into the countryside, where many quickly died of exhaustion, starvation or disease.
The Khmer Rouge proceeded to institute one of the world's most thorough and bloody experiments in radical Communism, reducing the nation to a primitive agrarian economy.
Urban life was abolished, education was curtailed, modern commerce and manufacturing were banned. Mass executions targeted intellectuals, teachers, civil servants, Buddhist monks and other "enemies" of the revolution.
In a newly published book, "Children of Cambodia's Killing Fields" (Yale University Press, 1997), Teeda Butt Mam, a survivor who now lives in the United States, lists some of those victims:
"The rebellious, the kind-hearted, the brave, the clever, the individuals, the people who wore glasses, the literate, the popular, the complainers, the lazy, those with talent, those with trouble getting along with others, those with soft hands."
After being driven from power in early 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion, the Khmer Rouge retreated to hideouts in the mountains and jungles along the Thai border, where they resumed their guerrilla war.
Mr. Son Sen became vice president of Democratic Kampuchea, a nominal government that retained its international recognition and its seat in the United Nations because of Western opposition to the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.
He was also president of the Defense Committee of a non-Communist insurgency in which the Khmer Rouge were allied with democratic forces to fight the Vietnamese.
When that decade-long war formally ended with the Paris peace accords in 1991, he led military negotiations with the United Nations as it brokered arrangements for elections that established a democratic Government.
But the Khmer Rouge leadership chose to boycott the elections themselves, in 1992, and went to war once again against the newly installed Government. In the end, it seems to have succumbed not to armed force but to its own internal divisions.

Yes, a Big Seller Can Have Footnotes

BYLINE: By James Shapiro; James Shapiro teaches English at Columbia University and writes a column on publishing for The Chronicle of Higher Education.

 BODY:
I have no illusions about the relative unpopularity of university press books. The notion of a university press "best seller" is, in the minds of many, an oxymoron. Of the $20 billion that was spent in this country on books last year, only a feeble $350 million, or 1.7 percent, was spent on those published by the hundred or so university presses; that's about a third of what Americans spent on religious books.
A look at what sells best among university press books doesn't change those numbers, but it calls into question some enduring myths. The first holds that university presses produce only expensive, unattractive, dry-as-dust academic monographs; the second, which contradicts the first, maintains that they have all but abandoned their traditional scholarly mission in pursuit of the latest post-structuralist, jargon-ridden trend. Central to both myths is the conviction that university press books are irrelevant to the lives of those outside academe. 
 When I recently asked some marketing directors what a current list of top-selling university press books might look like, they admitted that they didn't really know, and turned the conversation to "all time" big sellers: the Concise Oxford Dictionary (Oxford University), 11 million copies; Kate L. Turabian's "Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations" (University of Chicago), 5 million; and the New Oxford Annotated Bible (Oxford), 3 million. But this information says more about the past than it does about a present in which the rules have changed, when neither scholars nor libraries are buying the numbers of books that they once did, when university support for presses has withered, and when presses are finding themselves competing against tough-minded commercial publishers for authors and readers.
I decided to try compiling a list myself. Amazon.com (an on-line bookseller), half a dozen major independent bookstores and the Ingram Book Company, a leading wholesaler with 42,000 accounts, each gave me a ranked listing of its top-selling university press hardcover books for January of this year. (University presses are defined as those that have faculty review boards.) Books that appeared on more than two lists made the cut for my list. I'm confident that this was about as close as I could come to a fair list, while I'm aware that some of the books would have been replaced by others had I contacted a different set of bookstores.
Perhaps the biggest surprise was the dominance of books on science and history; law, criticism and writing guides rounded things out. Certain books fared better at different stores. Science books sold well at Amazon.com, while Walter Benjamin's collected essays ranked near the top at New York's Posman Books, the Harvard Book Store and Chicago's Seminary Co-op. (Benjamin wasn't even among the top 70 at Ingram, however, and wouldn't be on the final list if not for that endangered species, the independent bookstore.) And while university presses may be publishing many books about multiculturalism, they didn't sell as well as books focusing on Western Europe. "Florence," "Mary Through the Centuries," "The Measure of Reality," "The Scientific Revolution," "The Quotable Einstein," "Walter Benjamin: Selected Writings" and, most obviously, Norman Davies's vast survey, "Europe," testify to the strength of interest in Western cultural and scientific achievement.
The appearance of a book on the list by Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court may also signal a trend. Even as academic stars drawn by generous advances are turning to trade houses, prominent figures outside the academic world are looking to university or other academic presses. It's worth noting that the late Joseph Cardinal Bernardin's "Gift of Peace" was published by Loyola Press (an academic, though not a university, press); it was on the New York Times best-seller list for 16 weeks.
The list is also dominated by what are generally acknowledged to be major university presses: Harvard, Yale, Oxford, Chicago, Princeton and Cambridge. MIT, a smaller press, had a big seller by playing to its strengths in the sciences. Most of the books on the list have expensive four-color jackets; half are illustrated, three with color plates. But the claim that university presses have abandoned the defining feature of the scholarly book -- notes, bibliographies and indexes -- will find little support here. All are indexed, three include bibliographies and half the nonreference books have notes, including three -- "A Matter of Interpretation," "The Measure of Reality" and "The Scientific Revolution" -- that place these notes on the bottom of the page, rather than relegating them to the back of the book.
Most of these are hefty volumes, averaging just under 500 pages. But they cost on the average only about $27.50, just a few dollars more than their slimmer counterparts on The Times's hardcover nonfiction best-seller list. A couple -- notably the Chicago Manual of Style and the New Fowler's Modern English Usage -- may continue selling enough copies over the long haul for the presses to subsidize more specialized scholarly books, though the authors are unlikely to get rich from these titles. The odds of any of these books making a "real" best-seller list is not great, though Oxford continues to have high expectations for "Europe," with 100,000 copies now in print worldwide. For most of these books, though, a run of 12,000 to 15,000 will be a strong one, and some may struggle to break into five figures.
If this list is any indication, university presses are now producing, along with specialized scholarship, books that are handsome, competitively priced, accessibly written and committed to explaining to general readers fundamental historical, scientific, legal and literary issues. But it remains unclear whether this is enough to overcome suspicions on the part of booksellers, readers and reviewers about what's inside the cover of a university press book.
In 1996, a year in which more university press books were available to more readers (thanks to the superstores) than ever before, the rate of growth for university presses was a lowly 2.8 percent, well below the sluggish industry average of 4 percent. If the staggeringly high rate of "returns" from the superstores continues, this year's figures will probably be grimmer. Facing these economic prospects, university presses may well turn inward, redirecting resources into more dependable, if more modest, alternatives. It will be a shame if, at a time when the gulf between academe and the literate public threatens to grow ever wider, an opportunity to draw the two worlds together through crossover university press books is lost.

THE BIG TEN
 The Big Emerging Markets
 and How They Will Change Our Lives.
 By Jeffrey E. Garten.
 232 pp. New York:
 Basic Books. $24. 
 Until recently, when Americans worried about economic competition from abroad they focused on advanced industrialized democracies like Japan and Germany. Today, we are likelier to become embroiled in trade disputes with third world countries like China and Mexico. According to Jeffrey E. Garten, a former top trade policy adviser to President Clinton and now the dean of the Yale School of Management, this change heralds a new era for the world economy.
"The Big Ten" identifies the main agents of the change as a group of 10 countries that are in the process of becoming important enough to affect the entire world economy. Along with China and Mexico, they are Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Poland, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey.
The good news, Mr. Garten argues, is that his "Big Ten" are so potentially wealthy that they may provide producers everywhere with huge new markets -- and hence opportunities for profits and job creation. Especially encouraging, in the author's view, is their rapid adoption of free market practices. The bad news, he warns, is that the 10 don't always agree with the United States on many of the issues that could make or break the world's economic future: for example, how extensively governments should influence trade and investment flows; what rights workers and consumers can legitimately claim; how to insure that further global growth doesn't ruin the environment.
As Mr. Garten observes, several of these emerging powers will also play key roles in solving or aggravating many noneconomic problems, like terrorism and nuclear weapons proliferation. At the same time, most of the 10 are themselves powder kegs, struggling, often unsuccessfully, to contain the pro-democracy pressures generated by greater economic freedom and the greater economic inequality it usually breeds.
Yet Washington is generally unprepared to meet these countries' multidimensional challenges. Even the Administration he served in, Mr. Garten contends, has taken only the first small steps.
For the most part, the Clinton Administration and others urging breakneck trade expansion with the 10 have portrayed them in Polyanna-ish terms. All of these countries, they insist, are steadily liberalizing economically and politically. Mexico is nearly a full-fledged industrialized democracy. China will move toward reform and pluralism through greater trade and investment flows. And all except the worst-educated, least-prepared Americans will profit handsomely from increased trade with these growing economies.
"The Big Ten" is a welcome, though partial, corrective to such views. Over the long term, Mr. Garten believes, the power of technology and free markets, as well as the appeal of political liberty, will turn the emerging market countries into reliable economic and political partners. Yet he realizes that the equally important short and medium terms could be perilous. In fact, he foresees such formidable obstacles ahead that he advises American leaders to play down the goal of global stability and think harder about coping with greater instability. In addition, he repeatedly warns that the growing ability of the 10 to produce sophisticated goods and services at rock-bottom prices could drag down the living standards of even affluent, well-educated Americans -- a prospect widely pooh-poohed by trade enthusiasts in and out of government.
The virtues of "The Big Ten," however, don't outweigh its flaws. Despite their rapid growth, most of these countries are still small change, especially as markets for American products. In fact, Mr. Garten's claim that "the United States now exports more in goods and services to the 10 big emerging markets than to all of Europe and Japan combined" is simply untrue. In 1995, the last year for which a complete geographic breakdown is available, total American exports to Europe and Japan were nearly double those to the 10 (even counting Hong Kong as part of China).
Nor are American exports to many of the 10 growing very fast. Indeed, goods exports to booming China hardly increased at all in 1996, and are lower than goods exports to tiny, stagnating Belgium.
Mr. Garten overlooks the many reasons why consumer markets in these emerging countries are likely to stay small for decades, even if formal trade barriers come down. Two reasons stand out. First, largely because most of these nations have huge foreign debts to pay off, and therefore need to discourage consumption by their populations, they are pursuing export-led growth strategies. Second, if they don't keep wages and purchasing power low, they will have difficulty attracting the foreign investment they require, both to service debt and to finance growth. China, the biggest of the 10, has made it abundantly clear that it has no intention of becoming a major importer; it aims eventually to satisfy most of its own needs.
Where these countries are playing truly significant global economic roles is as production sites for multinational companies seeking to cut costs on the products they sell to the industrialized countries -- especially the wide-open American market. Yet Mr. Garten pays scant attention to these corporations, or to the immense power they wield over American trade policy, especially toward the 10.
Because he exaggerates the power of these countries, Mr. Garten underestimates Washington's influence over them. As a result, he winds up recommending almost wholly ineffectual policy responses. Americans, he warns, can no longer act as if "others need us more than we need them," and he suggests that the only hope for influencing the 10 is in essence to ask them politely to behave themselves.
Actually, it is the United States that holds most of the cards. The 10 need American technology, they need American capital and they desperately need to sell to the American market (which represents fully 25 percent of the world economy). Recognizing this power, nurturing it actively and using it to protect our economic and security interests is the key to coping successfully with these countries -- not the sophisticated defeatism of Mr. Garten's "solutions."

A River Runs Clearer

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; JAMES BROOKE is chief of the Denver bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
SPANISH Colonial explorers, who traveled without inflatable rubber rafts, halted their northern advance on the banks of the Arkansas River. Blocked by roiling whitewater, they called it a day, declaring this fast-flowing river the northernmost border of an empire that stretched 8,000 miles down to Argentina. Impressed by the region's reddish cliffs, the 17th-century Spanish named this land Colorado.
The Upper Arkansas, once a barrier to the Spanish, became an industrial sewer to 19th-century American miners, flushing away acid wastes from the gold, lead and silver mines that honeycombed the Rocky Mountain headwaters. 
 More recently, the Arkansas has become a recreational thoroughfare, plied each summer by as many as 200,000 people who take commercial raft trips. Now Colorado's most popular rafting river, the Arkansas is clean again, protected in large part by the huge constituency that has grown up around river rafting.
In late May, when my 7-year-old son, James, toppled overboard near the start of a two-hour trip from Salida, my concern was not about contamination, but about exposure to 50-degree water. Fished out in a flash, James soon warmed up with a pullover and a hat provided by our boatman, 32-year-old Greg Felt.
When we stopped on a sand bar to wring out James's wet suit, Greg explained how tourists and fishermen are placing a premium on clean water coursing down from the mountains.
"When half a million people a year go out on these raft trips, it has an impact on the politicians," said Greg, who last year served as chairman of the Colorado River Outfitters Association, a group that represents about half of the 120 licensed rafting companies in the state.
This river lobby, along with other groups, successfully pressured members of Congress from Colorado to win Federal money to stop acid drainage from abandoned mines in Leadville, near the headwaters of the Arkansas. Because of the cleanup, started in the early 90's, brown trout and rainbow trout are thriving once again.
"It's quite an ecological success story -- the fishing has really improved," according to Greg, who owns Canyon Marine Whitewater Expeditions, one of a dozen Colorado outfitters that offer fishing as well as recreational rafting trips.
Rafting is part of a boom in summer tourism in Colorado, a state long associated with skiing. Today, golf courses carpet Vail valley, and almost every mountain ski town holds a summer music or dance festival. Summer tourists ride mountain bikes down ski slopes, go on Jeep tours on old logging roads, or ride rafts down boulder-strewn rivers.
 WITH the steep mountains of the Continental Divide serving as headwaters for three major rivers -- the Arkansas, the Colorado and the Platte -- Colorado has seen the number of rafters carried by commercial companies double, from 208,000 in 1988 to 428,000 in 1995. This summer, rafting is expected to pump $83 million into rural Colorado, according to an estimate by the Outfitters Association. Outfitters must observe certain ecological regulations in order to qualify for permits, such as keeping camps a certain distance from the river, and packing up their trash.
Today, every major Colorado ski town offers summer rafting on a nearby river. For Vail, it is the Eagle River; for Aspen, it is the Roaring Fork; for Steamboat, it is the Yampa; for Breckenridge, it is the Blue; for Telluride, it is the San Miguel; for Crested Butte, it is the Taylor; and for Gunnison, it is the Gunnison.
This spring, the levels of unmelted snow were about 30 percent above average in the Colorado Rockies, setting the stage for a busy -- and boisterous -- river running season.
In Salida, an 1880's mining and railroad junction town, motel rooms that fill up with elk hunters in the fall, with skiers in the winter and with fishermen in the spring now fill with rafting families in the summer. Many instructors from Monarch Ski Area, 20 miles west of Salida, now have summer employment, earning as much as $120 a day, including tips, by guiding raftloads of tourists down rapids.
"In the West, rivers used to be where you threw things," said Steve Reese, park manager of the Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area, an intergovernmental agency set up almost a decade ago to manage recreation on a 148-mile stretch of the river, from Leadville to Pueblo. "Now, houses face the river. Yards go down to the river."
Reflecting these changing attitudes, Pueblo, which was heavily damaged by an Arkansas flood in 1921, started a $26 million project this spring to channel part of the river through a new downtown Riverwalk, a 26-acre park complete with an amphitheater and water taxis.
In Salida, this new river community could be seen on May 17, when 320 volunteers turned out to do a job that local governments could never afford to do -- scouring a 125-mile section of the Arkansas for trash.
With each of about 30 participating raft companies taking a river section, volunteers removed tons of garbage, planted about 350 trees and bushes, to create habitat for wildlife and minimize river-bank erosion, and installed about 30 birdhouses for bluebirds.
"We pulled out a 55-gallon oil drum, a shopping cart, sheet metal, a bunch of fencing, and furniture," Greg Felt said of his company's participation in the annual cleanup day. "We filled the back of a pickup truck."
At the end of the day, the volunteers gathered at Salida's River Park for a free barbecue, with music, sponsored by the Colorado Lottery.
One week after the cleanup, our nine-mile float downriver from Salida showed how the community has turned toward its waterway. Suited up with wet suits and life jackets, Greg and the five Brookes pushed off from the Salida boat ramp, uncomfortably close to a local geographic feature, Tenderfoot Hill. Immediately, we ducked our heads to avoid a series of poles strung over the river to create an urban slalom course for kayakers.
With Greg pushing at the oars to guide our ungainly craft, we passed backyards that reflected a cultural split in this town of 5,000 people. Some yards were used to park dead snowmobiles. Others had been landscaped, with walks leading down to fishing platforms or canoeing docks.
About 60 percent of the river-bank frontage in the Recreation Area is privately owned. Because of the increased use of the river, No Trespassing signs are now a frequent sight. Although some rafters have complained of bumping into other rafts on the crowded river, we never saw another raft during our two-hour float.
Our solitude on a Saturday afternoon may have been because of our choice of water -- Class II rapids, described in a brochure as "fun for the whole family." Our 5-year-old twins, Alexander and William, barely cleared the 35-pound minimum that most rafting companies impose on children.
The Upper Arkansas, which drops almost a vertical mile in its 150-mile navigable stretch, offers rapids of all classes. Class III stretches are generally for rafters 12 years and over. Class IV is usually "adults only." In mid-May, Robert Walmer, a ski instructor at Monarch, drowned while kayaking in his own boat through one of the most difficult rapids on the Upper Arkansas, a stretch that alternates between Class V and Class VI. Guidebooks define Class VI as "being at risk of life and limb." As more Colorado athletes jump into kayaks, casualties are mounting. Four others died last year on the Arkansas.
On the Canyon Marine raft on May 24, the biggest risk seemed to be of catching a cold. In the bow, a drenching spray combined with a brisk upriver breeze to make for a bone-chilling cold. But by late June, when the busy rafting season begins, water temperatures hover around a balmy 60 degrees. By August, the average flow can fall to 700 cubic feet per second, easily navigable, but one-third the volumes of late May.
As small waves slapped our turquoise craft, we passed corrals of a cattle auction house, then a remarkably mild-smelling municipal sewage plant. Then the scenery gradually became more rural. To our right rose snow-streaked peaks of the northern end of the Sangre de Cristo mountain chain. In nearby foothills, the abandoned workings of a gold mine could occasionally be spotted, its fine trail of tailings looking like termite dust seeping from a log. Along river banks, cottonwoods, willows and junipers flourished. Here and there, beavers had gnawed into the trunk of a leafy tree.
Small black swallows darted back and forth, skimming the water's surface for insects carried by the powerful spring runoff. Once, we spotted the telltale flash of a red-winged blackbird and the regal sail of a golden eagle.
On the left bank, we watched a fisherman land a brown trout. On another stretch, a weekend miner sluiced river dirt, searching for flecks of gold.
 OUR floating reverie was broken by the racket of a freight train, rumbling down the Union Pacific tracks that border most of the Upper Arkansas. But with industrial mining dying out around here, the railroad plans to stop freight service this October. If another railroad does not step forward in coming weeks, the tracks are to be torn out next summer.
Completing this region's economic shift from industry to recreation, state planners intend to convert the century-old rail route into a trail for hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders.
"Rafters learn appreciation for clean water, for the environment," said Steve Reese, an advocate for green tourism in the Arkansas River valley. "You don't leave footprints when you are in a boat."

'Beach and Beast' Resort Planned for Mozambique

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

 BODY:
The Government of Mozambique has given the go-ahead for an eccentric American millionaire to try to realize his dream: turning a stretch of unspoiled Mozambican coastline into a huge game reserve.
The goal of James Ulysses Blanchard 3d is to make about 900 square miles of southern Mozambique, including a 56-mile swath of white sand dunes, a "beast and beach" paradise -- that is, a reserve where tourists could see everything from elephants to flamingos and also swim, sail and scuba dive in warm Indian Ocean waters. 
 Right now, the area is sparsely populated and fairly pristine, despite being just south of the capital, Maputo, and a day's drive from Johannesburg, the crowded economic hub of South Africa.
The human and animal populations were both devastated by Mozambique's 17-year civil war -- most of the big mammals in the Maputo Elephant Reserve were killed for food or for their horns and tusks, while most of the people around the reserve were driven away by the back-and-forth fighting between Frelimo, the dominant party in the current Government, and Renamo, the rebel movement that opposed it. About 10,000 have returned to the area, in helter-skelter fashion: two small coastal towns have revived, living off fishing and scuba tourists from South Africa, and subsistence farmers have chopped and burned tiny plots in and outside the elephant reserve.
Mr. Blanchard's plans include million-dollar homes, game lodges, golf courses and marinas. His architects are musing about a floating casino, seaside hotels in the shape of beached cruise ships and an elegant steam railway on a 100-mile loop. The whole project as envisioned will take more than 10 years and $800 million to finish.
Getting Government permission and fighting off a rival proposal by a South African paper company to turn the area into a eucalyptus-tree plantation were only the first steps. Mr. Blanchard now has to raise the money, which he hopes to do from a circle of wealthy friends and by offering shares to emerging-market mutual funds and hotel chains.
Mr. Blanchard, a 53-year-old Louisiana native, is a controversial figure in Mozambique, but certainly good at raising money. Starting as a numismatist who wanted to buy and sell gold coins at a time when private ownership of the metal was illegal for Americans, he made a fortune in newsletters, mutual funds and conferences for gold investors. An outspoken libertarian and supporter of anti-Communist causes, he donated money, medical supplies and radios to Renamo, the rebel movement.
He has made his peace with the Frelimo-dominated Government and is now one of a handful of foreign investors seriously interested in Mozambique, which is desperately short of simple things like electric power and drivable roads.
"I'm accused of being a naive visionary, but I don't think the world can stand by and write off Africa," he said. "The amount of money needed to create jobs and property is so small." His reserve would eventually create 12,000 jobs, he said. Local residents, many of whom earn less than $100 a year, would be given shares and first crack at the jobs created.
But before that, big game, the element that draws tourists, has to be brought back. In the next few weeks, said Eugene Gouws, the chief ecological planner for Mr. Blanchard, the first 12 miles of electrified fence will be built for $135,000 to keep the remaining elephants out of local farms. There will still be time before the hot weather returns in October to move in nyala (an antelope with spiraling horns), buffalo and giraffe. "We'll keep to game that's territorial and won't run all over the show," Mr. Gouws said. Some of the remaining elephants got out recently and devastated local cropland.
Eventually, the five-year game-stocking plan will kick in. Zebras are cheap at $400 apiece, and young adult elephants are a steal at $2,130, but endangered black rhinos run $32,000. And with most species, you can't buy just one. The starter buffalo herd will be 120 animals at $2,100 apiece.
The first accommodations, in a tent camp near the beach, where visitors can go diving and deep-sea fishing, will be up by mid-July, Mr. Gouws said. Their primary use will be to entertain potential investors, but paying guests will be able to use them on weekends, "for perhaps $200 a night," he said.
Also, efforts to win over local people will speed up. Mr. Blanchard has said he will put in clinics, bore new wells and build a lakeside village with shops and schools as employees are hired.
Hotel chains and other operators invited in will have to adhere to the master plan, which covers everything from architectural design to hiring and training local people.
Mia Cuoto, a Mozambican biologist retained by the Government to evaluate Mr. Blanchard's plan, said the Government remained a bit nervous about such mega-projects, but found the plan preferable to proposals to turn the area into tree farms for pulp mills.
"The area's vocation is eco-tourism," he said, and the Government's main concern is for dislocated residents. Those who don't get jobs will need firewood and cropland, and those who do will still need occasional access to forest groves and graveyards that are sacred to them.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Learning How To Tread Lightly

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
RESPONSIBLE tourism does not safeguard only plants and animals. With the boom in eco-tourism (as well as in adventure and educational travel), trips to areas where indigenous peoples live apart from the industrial world are of increasing concern.
A number of watchdog organizations have sprung up to offer guidance to tour operators and independent travelers who want to leave only footprints and to avoid even that, if footprints might disturb. There are also books to guide the conscientious. 
 The nonprofit Eco-Tourism Society, a five-year-old group in North Bennington, Vt., considers eco-tourism a segment of the nature tourism market, and offers this definition: "Responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and sustains the well-being of local people." This group does not operate tours; it wants to help people find their way instead of taking them by the hand. Like other organizations, it stresses the informed consent and participation of local residents as the starting point for responsible tourism in less developed areas.
Don Montague, head of the 20-year-old South American Explorers Club, a membership group for individual travelers, says a prime issue is how much of the tourist dollar goes to the local people. The club does not offer tours, but distributes first-person reports on tours or independent trips taken by other members.
Dr. David Pearson, a professor of zoology at Arizona State University in Tempe, discussed two projects in Ecuador as illustrating the crucial nature of local participation. One is the Limoncocha Biological Reserve in eastern Ecuador. In the 1970's, this area was accessible only by missionary plane or canoe; it then had breathtaking views of Amazonian flora and fauna. A road was built in the late 1980's, bringing colonists, and although the Government declared the site a biological reserve, the use of dynamite in fishing wiped out the fish and alligators in the lake. This site is now a sad memory, Professor Pearson said, one that "I do not want to see again."
 
Rejecting Roads
 Recently, he said, an awareness has developed that the formula "if you build it, they will come" is not a recipe for sustainable development. He cited the Kapawi area, near Ecuador's southeastern border, where the Achuar Indians rejected roads and cattle as part of development. Professor Pearson said the Achuar knew change was inevitable but wanted to control it. An Ecuadorean company, Canadros, approached the Indians' president, offering $2 million to develop tourism, agreeing, for instance, to build without nails so that when things rotted, they would return wholly to the earth. "They did not cut corners," Professor Pearson said.
"They said they would teach the local people how to make beds and how to mix martinis and how to lead a nature tour, things they had not thought of," he added. "At the end of 15 years, the agreement says, the whole development will be turned over to the local people."
Kapawi started receiving tourists in April, Professor Pearson said. The project will be included in a new edition of a book by Professor Pearson and David Middleton, "The New Key to Ecuador and the Galapagos." It is due in August from Ulysses Press in Berkeley, Calif.; (510) 601-8301.
The South American Explorers Club distributes first-person reports it receives from members. Not all reports are circulated, Mr. Montague said, because the organization believes some peoples should be visited only by anthropologists.
Mr. Montague sells a book he considers "a model of things to come" in guides: "The Eco-Tourist's Guide to the Ecuadorian Amazon: Napo Province." It was prepared by Prof. Rolf Wesche of the University of Ottawa and 13 geography students and published in 1995 by the Pan American Center for Geographical Studies in Quito.
The authors describe Napo Province as offering one of the widest ranges of facilities and programs in the Amazon Basin and opportunities for sustainable tourism as an alternative to oil, agriculture and lumber. The 106-page guide, with a thick pocket of topographical maps, is dense with data: bus schedules and lists of cabana quarters, guided tours and indigenous eco-tourism projects in each area. The book costs $29, plus $6.50 for postage, or $25, plus $4.50, for members. Regular membership is $40 a year.

Organized Communities
 A human rights organization, Survival International, with offices in London, Paris, Milan and Madrid, is preparing a publication that will come out later this year listing a very few tribal communities that have organized to accommodate tourists while safeguarding their native lands and cultures. A spokesman in London, Richard Garside, estimates that 200 such community organizations exist, probably 100 of them in Australia.
One task the human-rights group undertakes is monitoring the way a people is presented to the world. Isolated tribes that are advertised by tour operators as exotic or Stone Age survivors, he pointed out, do not take long to catch on to what arriving tourists expect and may ornament themselves or invent rituals to earn money, jeopardizing their historic culture. Survival International, 11-15 Emerald Street, London WC1N 3QL, England; (44-171) 242-1441.
The Eco-Tourism Society will provide a list of 60 to 80 member organizations on request; enclose an addressed envelope with two 32-cent stamps. The organizations sign a pledge on joining, according to its president, Megan Epler Wood, but she stressed that the society neither accredits nor endorses any tours. Memberships cost $35 a year for an individual who does not want to be listed in the membership directory. The Eco-Tourism Society, Post Office Box 755, North Bennington, Vt. 05257; (802) 447-2121; E-mail, ecomail@ecotourism.org.
The American Museum of Natural History in New York and its Discovery Tours are on the society's list. According to Dick Houghton, a museum spokesman, almost all of its 60 programs for this year, including trips to Botswana, Ethiopia and the Rift Valley in the Middle East and Africa, are sold out. The catalogue for 1998 has 46 tours. Like almost all tours offered by nonprofit groups, the tours are actually run by commercial operators. The Natural History brochure says that "to insure ethical behavior toward local eco-systems and peoples," it selects operators with a "demonstrated history of responsible tourism."
The 1998 catalogue lists a tour to Papua New Guinea Jan. 28 to Feb. 10. For a maximum of 40, it includes a five-day catamaran trip on the Sepik River; it is run by High Country Passage of Palo Alto, Calif., which serves nonprofit groups only. Depending on the cruise cabin, the price is $6,970 to $8,770, including San Francisco-Hong Kong flights.

Lisle Inc. is a 60-year-old volunteer organization "committed to a more just social order" that seeks to bring diverse people together through cooperative, democratic leadership and participation. The members travel and interact with local groups that share their views of a need for change.
The organization is offering four trips this year, all conducted by Lisle members. A trip to India to visit two ashrams and work with leaders on their social goals is scheduled for Dec. 13 to Jan. 4. Dianne Brause, a vice president and a former Peace Corps member who writes on alternative travel, said the maximum would probably be 20 and the cost would probably be $1,295, not including air fare to New Delhi. A visit in late December to co-operatives that are creating development projects and eco-lodges in Costa Rica is expected to run $1,200 to $2,000 without air fare.

Earthwatch, 25 years old, sends out volunteers to participate in various projects, from folklore to agriculture; the volunteers pay relatively stiff fees, which support the project and pay operating expenses for Earthwatch, a nonprofit organization. The catalogue of projects may be seen on the Internet at http://www.earthwatch.org. One free catalogue may also be ordered by phone or mail. Membership, for $35 a year, brings catalogues and newsletters. Earthwatch, 680 Mount Auburn Street, Post Office Box 9104, Watertown, Mass. 02272; (800) 776-0188; E-mail info@earthwatch.org.
Among the more fragile environments are the remainders of the historic native American cultures in the United States. Painted Desert Productions in Scottsdale, Ariz., offers up to eight Southwest tours a year designed for museums and universities. These include visits to pueblos and cultural sites.
Bonnie Lewis, the president of the company, said that native Americans controlled access to their pueblos and ceremonies, and each year a few more places exclude visitors because of failure to observe the rules. Ms. Lewis said the company spent a lot of time preparing clients for trips into pueblos or venerated sites. "All of our tours have an anthropologist," she said.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Yes, Italian Fare, and Hearty Portions, Too

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS 

 BODY:
WHILE dining at Bellissimo in Waterbury, we found ourselves thinking of a recent letter in which the writer asked, "Why do you only review Italian restaurants?" Anyone who keeps track knows that isn't the case, but it sometimes does seem that every other new restaurant in Connecticut is Italian. This says a lot about economics (the relatively low costs of pasta and pizza) and also about contemporary taste preferences.
Though Bellissimo is more ambitious than the average pizza-and-pasta place, it does have 14 pasta dishes (no pizzas). There are other Italian standards, like veal Marsala, calamari friti, chicken cacciatora and scampi fra diavolo. 
 Many dishes have a decidedly modern spin, such as vitello Bellissimo. Herb-coated escalopes of tender veal, pan-seared, then topped with roasted red peppers and fresh mozzarella, came in a seductively tangy sauce. The tang was provided by combining herbs, shallots, balsamic vinegar and veal broth, with results that tantalized our taste buds.
As is often the case at Italian restaurants, Bellissimo was profligate in most of its portions, especially the entrees. Even a starter like portobello Bellissimo might have doubled as a light supper. A big bowl arrived full of pan-seared mushroom slices, roasted red pepper strips and garlic, and an herb-rich broth, topped with wisps of crisp-fried onions. Tucked beneath all the vegetables were wedges of polenta, softened by the broth but soul-satisfying nonetheless, mushy or not. Gamberi alla griglia was just as generous and as robust. Several pan-seared jumbo shrimp, tossed with pancetta bits, white beans and fresh garlic atop a bed of wilted greens, came in a flavorful white wine bath.
Garlic was a dominant player throughout our meal, beginning with the bulb of roasted garlic buds served with olive oil and warm Italian bread (a boringly commercial type) and focaccia (good). Garlic also appeared in a delicious version of clams casino (vongole alla casino), along with chopped red peppers, onions, bacon and three cheeses. Garlic was a given in the spinaci and salsiccia (spinach and sausauge) that swam in a watery broth.
All entrees were Gargantuan, obviating the need for three courses, especially since a light green salad, with a perky Parmesan-black pepper dressing, was included in meals. (Starters were too zesty to skip, the rather mundane desserts -- except for a rich tiramisu -- were easier.)
In addition to the above-mentioned vitello Bellissimo, salmone alla citrus was a successful main course, lightly grilled, not overcooked. The fish didn't really need both the mountain of mashed potatoes (dried-out, unfortunately) and shredded red cabbage that were served with it.
Pollo Michelina was a fine pasta choice. A large bowl of penne was profuse with grilled chicken strips, wild mushrooms, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and herbs, sauteed with chopped tomatoes, olive oil and chicken stock.
Misto D'Andrea was peppy and just as bountiful, though more of a mishmash: chicken, veal and hot sausage jumbled with plum tomatoes, caramelized onions, wild mushrooms, roasted garlic, hot peppers and other vegetables in a veal stock sauce.
Dinner for two, three courses apiece, came to $56.70, before tax, tip and drinks. The wine list -- 21 reds and 10 whites -- of Italian and California vintages, runs from $15 to $45, with many options in the $20 range. A small, but intriguing beer list includes Watertown-brewed Hammer & Nails.
Bellissimo with its simple, attractive black and white decor and cheerful, upbeat service, provides many hearty, well-made dishes, making dinner bella, though not bellissimo yet.

September in Paris
 
Q. I plan to be in Paris this September and would like a calendar of cultural events. Where can I find one? -- Seymour Dunn, Hollywood, Fla.
 
A. Paris Selection, a free monthly publication put out by the Paris Tourist Office, probably contains the most thorough listing of cultural events. It comes out two weeks before the first of each month, and in your case, the best bet would be to contact the office directly around the first week of August. The mailing address is Service Courrier, Paris Tourist Office, 127 Avenue des Champs-Elysees, 75008 Paris. Call (33-1) 49.52.53.54; fax (33-1) 49.52.53.00. Recorded information in English is available by calling (33-1) 49.52.53.56.
You can also find event listings, some with critical commentary, in local newspapers and magazines. For instance, Pariscope, a weekly publication in French, is available at kiosks for about 50 cents. 
 Among the cultural offerings you will find in Paris this September is a retrospective of 220 paintings and drawings by Fernand Leger (1881-1955) at the Georges Pompidou Center, on view until Sept. 29. Admission is $8, at 5.56 francs to $1; students $5.40; children under 16 free. The center is open weekdays (except Tuesday) from noon to 10 P.M., weekends from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M.
At the Opera Bastille there will be a production of Giacomo Puccini's "Turandot," directed by Francesca Zambello, with Sharon Sweet as Turandot and Charles Burles as Altoum. Performances are on Sept. 8 at 3 P.M., and Sept. 22 and 25 at 7:30 P.M. Tickets range from $26 to $114. Information: (33-1) 44.73.13.00.
At the Theatre des Champs-Elysees, a series of dances will be performed by Bejart Ballet Lausanne on Sept. 19 to 24. The program's three dances include the Islamic-themed "Voyage by Night," "Crucifixion," danced to music by Igor Stravinsky; and "Dibouk," with traditional Jewish music. Information: (33-1) 49.52.50.50. Tickets from $20 to $63.
 
Saxon Churches
 
Q. Do you have information on existing Saxon buildings in England? -- Virginia Wilhelm, New York, N.Y.
 
A. Practically all the buildings in England that contain fragments of Anglo-Saxon architecture -- the period between the end of the Roman occupation of England during the fifth century and the Norman Conquest in the 11th century -- are churches. Among those that have a significant amount of Saxon architecture is Worth Church in Crawley, West Sussex, about six miles from London's Gatwick airport, or about 35 miles south of London. Archaeological work in 1987 confirmed that 95 percent of the walls of the nave, the two transepts and the main arches are original Saxon work from the 10th and 11th centuries. The Reverend Andrew Piper at Worth says visitors are welcome. Information: (44-1293) 882229.
English Heritage, the conservation organization for the British Government, recommends Odda's Chapel at Deerhurst in Gloucestershire, 140 miles west of London. It is described as a rare Anglo-Saxon chapel that is unusual because it is attached to a half-timbered farmhouse. It is open daily until Sept. 30 from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., and from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M the rest of the year. Admission is free. Another English Heritage site, St. Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, Kent, 62 miles southeast of London, contains remains of the foundations of the original sixth-century church. It is open the same hours as Odda's Chapel. Admission is $2.50. Canterbury Cathedral contains examples of Anglo-Saxon sculpture in the crypt. For information, call the English Heritage offices at (44-171) 973 3434.
Geoffrey Claridge, an architect who is an adviser to the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, recommends the late Saxon church in Sompting, West Sussex, 60 miles south of London, which contains Saxon carpentry in its helm roof and fragments of Saxon carving. Open from 7 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. daily. Information: Worthing Tourist Information Center (44-1903) 210022.
Shire Archaeology publishes two guides that may be of interest: "Anglo-Saxon Pottery" by David H. Kennett; and "Anglo-Saxon Sculpture" by James Lang. They cost $8.40 each, plus 1 pound postage (at $1.70 to one pound), and can be ordered. Orders can be sent with a credit card number to Shire Publications Limited, Cromwell House, Church Street, Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire HP27 9AA; telephone (44-1844) 344301.
 
A Uruguayan Resort
 
Q. Please provide information on luxury hotels in Punta del Este, Uruguay. Also, what is the best way to get there from Buenos Aires? -- George Thimot, Canton Center, Conn.
 
A. Until the end of World War II, the narrow peninsula of Punta del Este was little more than a fishing village with a lighthouse and a few summer homes. Today, this southern Uruguayan resort -- with some 30 miles of sandy beaches surrounded by acres of eucalyptus and pine trees -- draws more than 300,000 visitors during the summer, which begins in December. Most of the visitors are Argentines and other South Americans, with an increasing number of Americans and Europeans.
Among the luxury hotels in Punta del Este is the new Conrad Resort and Casino, a flamboyant Las Vegas- style hotel. The hotel, which took its first guests last month, will be fully operational in October. It has 302 rooms, 24 suites, a 24-hour casino, shopping arcade, 5 restaurants and a pool. Prices range from $200 for a double room in low season (from May to October) to $350 in the high season. Information: (598-42) 91111.
Set in pine trees close to the San Rafael casino and two blocks from the Brava beach is Hotel L'Auberge. Its distinctive tower, where waffles and hot chocolate are served at tea time, gives the hotel the appearance of a medieval castle. Some of its 40 rooms are small, but cozy. A three-year-old wing has larger rooms. Doubles range from $140 during the low season, to $250 in January. Larger rooms in the new wing range from $190 (low season) to $350 (high). Information: (598-42) 82601, fax (598-42) 83408.
By far the quickest and easiest way to get to Punta del Este from Buenos Aires, which is about 200 miles to the west, is by plane. In season there are frequent daily flights on Pluna, the Uruguayan airline, or Aerolineas Argentinas. A recent round-trip economy fare on both airlines was $180. SUZANNE MacNEILLE

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Joanne Lorange;
Sorting Out Issues of Abuse in the Home

BYLINE: By ROBIN F. DEMATTIA 

 BODY:
THURSDAY was the third anniversary of Nicole Brown Simpson's murder. While her death received attention for its attachment to celebrity, thousands of other women quietly suffer similar abuses, including 28 women in Connecticut who were killed in 1996, a 33 percent increase from 1995.
Joanne Lorange is working to change those statistics. For eight years she has served as executive director of the Women's Crisis Center in Norwalk. She is a former president and current board member of the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence, an 18-agency consortium, and she serves on the steering committee of Eve's Fund, which raises money for domestic violence education programs. 
 Ms. Lorange recently discussed the problems associated domestic violence. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
Q. How prevalent is domestic violence?
A. Eight years ago we said every 15 seconds a woman is battered in the United States by a husband, boyfriend or live-in partner. Now we say it's every 9 seconds.
In Connecticut for fiscal year 1995-96, the 18 domestic violence agencies had a total of 23,937 hot line calls; provided 906 women and 1,295 children under 18 with shelter services, and helped 16,995 adult victims and 2,584 children with non-shelter services.
Through our victim advocate program, we helped 20,297 in the court system. And 66,196 people attended community education programs. These figures represent a 10 percent increase over the past five years.
Q. What are the causes of domestic violence?
A. The root cause is really one person's need to have power and control over another person. And 95 percent of the victims are women, so a lot of it has to do with a person who really sees women as objects and as secondary citizens.
Q. Are there secondary factors?
A. Drug and alcohol abuse can precipitate the violence. Sometimes people who don't understand domestic violence think that if you're upset because you are unemployed or upset about something else, you might become an abuser, but it really is socially learned behavior.
Q. How is the abuse manifested?
A. It's mainly emotional abuse, which doesn't necessarily mean it will go into physical abuse. But when there's physical abuse, more likely there is emotional and sexual abuse. A lot of women dismiss emotional abuse and say they don't really think they are abused. They are very ashamed, and often times in affluent communities it's even more shameful. The women think "we're educated, we should know better," or "he's a prominent member of the community and I don't want to tell this terrible secret." In more affluent communities, where houses are further apart, the secret can go on longer because others can't hear the yelling and screaming.
Q. Why do people stay in abusive relationships?
A. Women stay because the abuser controls and dominates them so much that their self-esteem is whittled away and they begin to believe they cannot make it on their own. Often the abuser tells the partner "If you leave me I will kill myself," and the victim doesn't want that on her conscience.
Oftentimes the abuse involves financial control, so the person has no inner or outer resources to make it on their own. They may not work, or have credit in their own name. The abuser has made them think they are hopeless and inadequate. And it's hard to go out on your own. It's very expensive, and there's a great fear of becoming homeless.
Q. Is that fear warranted?
A. Absolutely. Statistics from 1991 estimated that 50 percent of all homeless women and children are fleeing from domestic violence.
Q. Were perpetrators of domestic violence abused themselves?
A. A good percentage of abusers have either been abused or grew up in an abusive household and watched their mothers being abused. It is more likely that a male who grows up in that type of environment will grow up to be an abuser. Girls may grow up and marry an abuser because that's the way they think intimate relationships are supposed to be. The notion that women should be passive, and are there for men, is repeated in another generation.
Q. What are the effects of domestic violence on an abused women?
A. Her self-esteem is lessened. She oftentimes is isolated, not able to pursue career or job interests. She is financially trapped, and physically, emotionally and sexually hurt. And the domestic violence not only has immediate effects but also long-term effects. One victim was held at gunpoint and stabbed. She said the physical wounds, as bad as they were, would heal, but it was the emotional wounds she was afraid would never heal.
Q. What are the effects on children in the family?
A. When women are injured emotionally and physically, they oftentimes are unable to care for their children. Children who are in abusive homes, whether or not they are physically injured, are still affected by the violence because the emotional effects can be just as devastating as the physical. So often the children feel responsible for the violence. If Dad says to Mom, "You'd better keep those kids quiet or I'll beat you," kids think "If only I had listened to my mother she wouldn't be beaten." They also feel helpless because they can't stop the violence.
Children suffer from all kinds of ailments -- headaches, ulcers, rashes, stomach aches -- because they are constantly anxious, fearing when the next beating will happen. Children at younger ages may have developmental delays, hearing problems and language problems. They may have behavioral problems at school because they may choose to resolve their conflicts by fighting because that's what they see at home. Older children are at risk for juvenile delinquency, teen pregnancy and alcohol and drug abuse.
Q. What percentage of children in abusive homes are abused?
A. Nationally, 3.3 million children witness domestic violence, and 41 to 50 percent are there when police intervene. Of those cases in 1995 where an abuser was arrested, 14 percent of the children had sustained physical injuries.
Q. What is the significance of the Violence Against Women Act?
A. Passed in 1994, the national act says domestic violence is a crime and unacceptable. It really emphasizes collaborate work between domestic violence agencies, law enforcement and the legal system to protect victims. Legislation is key to saying loud and clear that whether you're assaulted on the street or in the home it's a crime and that behavior should not be accepted. If we don't make the abuser accountable, we'll never stop domestic violence.
Q. What services are provided by the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence?
A. Our ultimate goal is to break the cycle of violence, so we help families and individuals that are in abusive relationships to free themselves from physical, emotional, verbal and sexual abuse.
We offer a confidential 24-hour hot line; individual counseling to women, men and children; short-term and long-term therapy; support groups; emergency shelters, and victim advocacy and child advocacy.
We run an after-school program for kindergarten through high school children, talking about communication skills, conflict resolution and healthy relationships.
We train law enforcement personnel on protocols for referring people to domestic violence agencies, and provide training for the clergy and other social service providers. We also conduct community education for civic groups.
Q. How often do couples resolve their situation and stay together?
A. If we intervene early enough and the abuser is willing to deal with having a problem, we may be successful. But more often than not the abuser does not want to admit he has a problem.
Q. What is your advice to people in domestic violence situations?
A. Our whole philosophy is one of empowerment. We help people get as much information as possible, learn about the patterns and root causes of abuse, and let them make up their minds. Women know best if their lives have been threatened or if the abuser will act on their threat.
One of most important things we do is help individuals or families make safety plans.
Kids learn how to call for help if there is danger, and how to identify adults who are safe to talk to.
Women make sure they have somebody in the neighborhood with whom they have a signal: turning the light on outside of house means she's in trouble and call the police.

HEADLINE: Cable TV Finds A Stamford Home

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
THE year was 1982 and along the Stamford oceanfront complaints were springing up about the tall building on Harbor Drive that glowed brightly through the night. The tenant, the broadcasting arm of Westinghouse known as Group W, was launching its all-news cable network, Satellite News Channel.
"We were operating 24 hours a day, and we were lit up like a Christmas tree," the then-senior executive at Group W, Lloyd A. Werner, recalled. "We had to hire off-duty cops to shut the blinds at night. People were protesting outside, waving placards." 
 Satellite News Channel went dark for good the following year, vanquished by arch-rival Cable Network News. Cable television has since become one of the nation's major growth industries, with hundreds of channels either already launched or in the process of doing so.
Mr. Werner, now vice president of sales and marketing with CBS Cable, which emerged from Group W after Westinghouse bought CBS, still believes that if Satellite News Channel had held on a little longer it would have outlasted CNN and Ted Turner. "Stamford would have been what Atlanta is today," he said.
Would Stamford like a second crack at playing host to a major cable channel? You bet.
In the last few months, the city has avidly courted potential cable companies, to the point of running a telemarketing campaign with neighboring Fairfield County towns.
Stamford's economic planning director, Kip Bergstrom, notes that cable television fits in with other kinds of high-tech businesses that the city has successfully wooed, among them the investment banking giant SBC Warburg and the software leader Hyperion.
"Cable's not the most desirable tenant," Mr. Bergstrom said. "I wouldn't want to overstate it. But it's an important part of the mix. There are a lot of television companies starting up or expanding. TV stations are looking for a home, and they're having difficulty finding it in Manhattan." There is also the potential for enjoying the residual glamour of a successful local cable network. Call it the "Bristol Syndrome," after another Connecticut town that is plugged frequently by its resident cable operation, the sports channel ESPN. Having celebrities like Roger Clemens and Cam Neely mentioning a city's name on national television offers the kind of publicity a chamber of commerce can't buy.
"That is an additional byproduct, that your name can be broadcast," said the Stamford Mayor, Dannel P. Malloy. "It's not the reason for wanting cable networks, but it's nice."
Perhaps more a reason is the business a local studio operation can generate in its community: new customers for everything from video production centers to art shops to all-night diners. It also means employment for hundreds of producers, writers, camera operators, and others not only in Stamford but also throughout Fairfield County.
Stamford already has some of the largest multichannel businesses in the nation. Time/Warner Cable, the second-largest cable operator in the country with 12 million subscribers, has its corporate headquarters in town. So does Alphastar, a pioneering direct-to-home satellite television service owned by Tee-Comm Electronics, Inc. of Canada. While not producers of cable broadcasts, Time/Warner in particular has been one of its most successful distributors.
Then there is Group W, which has hardly lain fallow in the wake of the Satellite News Channel's demise. The Disney Channel began as a joint venture between Group W and the Disney Corporation, and The Nashville Network, started by Group W in 1982, is now the eighth-largest cable network in the country. "The Nashville Network is the engine which drives this company," Mr. Werner said.
The purchase of CBS by Westinghouse in 1995 brought with it the rights to one of broadcasting's most-revered call letters. Not surprisingly, Group W has taken advantage of it. After renaming itself CBS Cable, the company begun its first new network, CBS Eye on People, last March.
CBS Cable is unusually positioned to launch cable channels from its Stamford perch. Three miles north of Harbor Drive, in Glenbrook, lies what may be the largest video earth station in the United States, from which the CBS Cable subsidiary Group W Network Services transmits satellite signals for a wide range of television networks, including CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox.
The head of Group W Network Services, Altan C. Stalker, said the broad range of clientele was why the older name was retained by his division even as the rest of his company took up the CBS mantle. "Even though everyone in this business is very sophisticated, you have to be sensitive," he said.
Nearly a dozen other Group W clients lease in-house services such as playback and post-production suites. They include the Discovery Channel, the History Channel and the Learning Channel. In addition to leasing similar suites from Group W, the Arts & Entertainment network placed its entire operations staff in the same building as CBS Cable.
CBS Eye on People, managed from CBS Cable's Stamford offices but produced mostly at CBS Studios in Manhattan, represents the first real step into the cable industry by the basic-channel network.
Not surprisingly, CBS plays to its long-regarded strength, network news. The president of Eye on People, Geoffrey Darby, takes pains to dismiss the notion of another news channel, calling it a "broad-based entertainment network based on reality programming."
Still, the network features news personalities like Dan Rather and Mike Wallace, not to mention programs like "60 Minutes More" and "Another 48 Hours," that augment and update episodes of "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours," which aired on CBS.
About 200 people are employed by CBS Eye on People, according to the president of CBS Cable, Don Mitzner, but less than a dozen of them work in Stamford. Most of the rest, including production workers and on-air talent, are based at CBS News studios in Manhattan.
"I think if we had gotten the whole thing, it would have given us greater bragging rights," Mr. Bergstrom said. "But having the bigger piece, CBS Cable, here is very significant."
As CBS Eye on People begins to grow, Mr. Bergstrom said he hoped the network would look for a complex of its own closer to CBS Cable headquarters. One ideal location, he said, is an now-vacant television studio near the Darien line previously operated by Xerox's in-house corporate television network. But with so much interaction occurring between CBS and CBS Eye on People, there is little likelihood of such a move happening any time soon, Mr. Mitzner said.
There are many reasons for being in Stamford, CBS Cable executives say. The city is only a short distance away from Manhattan. Since Connecticut is a right-to-work state, cable networks can hire employees and not pay union wages. Finally, there is the bucolic nature of the place, an urban hub and suburb all-in-one.
"Stamford is a great place to work," Mr. Mitzner said. "And what we've seen, others have seen also."
Having CBS Cable, in particular Group W Network Services, buttresses the city's appeal. When Roger L. Werner Jr., former head of ESPN, was seeking a site for two fledging cable channels in early 1995, he opted for Stamford in part, he said, because he enjoyed "a good working relationship" with Group W.
"Stamford's an attractive place, at a convenient distance to New York airports and New York City itself," he said. "The cost of operating a business is less. If you're looking to locate in the New York City area, southern Connecticut is the most attractive place."
Mr. Werner's networks, Speedvision and Outdoor Life, deal with specific niche markets, motor racing and nature recreation respectively, which he said are underrepresented by more broad-based networks like ESPN. While other cable channels have full-package deals with Group W, Speedvision and Outdoor Life go a step further, renting out studio space at Harbor Drive. The two networks use opposite ends of the same studio, one built originally for the Satellite News Channel.
Both networks have a lot of growing left to do. Mr. Werner said Speedvision has 10 million subscribers and Outdoor Life nine million. Stamford's own cable distributor, Cablevision, does not carry either one. But Mr. Werner said the growth of his networks has exceeded expectations, adding he hopes they will have 20 million subscribers by 1998 and thus become eligible for Nielsen ratings. For the moment the networks may be "small potatoes" to Stamford, as Mr. Werner put it, but the city is hardly turning up its nose. CBS Eye on People has only 2 million subscribers. Mr. Bergstrom said the city is quite willing to take what it can get.
"Cable TV is not an industry of large players," he said. "I would love to get an established channel to relocate here. What's more like to happen is a new channel will arrive, then grow."
CBS Eye on People is one such candidate for growth. Mr. Darby said the network may do some taping at CBS Cable's Stamford studios later this year, albeit on a limited basis. The network is already adding programs to its 15-show weekly schedule, and boasting the presence of such top CBS talent as Mr. Rather, Mr. Wallace, and Charles Kuralt, who came to CBS Eye on People after leaving CBS and thus qualifies as the new network's first exclusive on-air personality.
A desire for "face time" has spurred the appearances of veteran CBS News personnel, Mr. Darby said, along with a commitment to join the cable revolution.
"We clearly are offering a real alternative to other programming," said Paula Zahn, who anchors CBS Eye on People's "Fast Forward," a show that updates the stories of people made famous by events from the past. "There's nothing frivolous about it."
Ms. Zahn, the former host of "CBS This Morning" who now anchors "CBS Evening News" on Saturdays and contributes to other CBS programs, said one nice thing about CBS Eye on People is the opportunity to "break out of a four-minute time constraint."
"Nine-minute spots are more the rule on 'Fast Forward,' " she said. "That gives me a lot of flexibility."
Stamford is no bed of roses, Mr. Mitzner said. Zoning difficulties have delayed the addition of more satellite dishes at Glenbrook, he noted, to the point where he now will look elsewhere when it comes time to plan a new series of dishes. "It's just too laborious," he said.
Also vexing is the state of the area's main transportation artery, Interstate 95. Mr. Mitzner, a commuter from Long Island, calls I-95 worse than the Long Island Expressway (known to many in the tri-state area as the world's longest parking lot).
"The L.I.E. is a nightmare, but this is worse," he said. "In 11 years the construction has never stopped. Even the things that are finished are redone."
But the city's attributes outweigh the bumps, he said. "The most important thing is the people who are here. They're well-educated, success-oriented, and they care about each other."
And perhaps even more tolerant of the sort of situations that irked them in the early 1980's.
Mr. Malloy, a Stamford resident familiar with the Satellite News Channel controversy, insists sight-pollution issues are an issue of the past. "All people work longer hours today than they did in 1981 and 1982," he said. "The population has caught up. No one is surprised by lit office buildings at night anymore."

HEADLINE: It's, You Know, About Opinions and Stuff

BYLINE: By Tad Friend; Tad Friend is a contributor to GQ, Vogue and Outside.

 BODY:
If you want to blazon a name as a young television pundit, you can learn from Laura Ingraham. The ubiquitous 33-year-old conservative plies her trade at, among other places, the MSNBC cable network, the cradle of the new commentary, where 19 all-purpose pundits called contributors stand by to kick around the hot topic in the news. In a recent MSNBC colloquy about whether Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue was sexist, Jef Pollock, a Democratic pollster, argued that the images of women were an "objectification." Instantly Ingraham barked: "What does that mean? What does that mean?" Pollock opened his mouth. "What does that mean?" she repeated -- five times in all before declaring, "No one wants to see fat people on the cover of magazines in swimsuits."
 Ingraham represents everything the old pundits fear. She's loud, ambitious and much better looking than the Rumpelstiltskins who dominate public-affairs shows -- and she's unstained by journalistic ink. "When Laura Ingraham was still a lawyer she went to see Robert Novak for career advice," says Fred Barnes, 53, a longtime print reporter and a regular on "The McLaughlin Group." "He told her, 'I started in Omaha, Neb., as an A.P. reporter,' then recited the litany of his reporting career for 30 years before he started going on 'McLaughlin,' 
 Before he came up with 'The Capital Gang.' She didn't listen. That's not what she wanted to do, or needed to do, when on television her opinion is valued as much as mine."
 Novak, 66, is a regular on "The Capital Gang," "Evans and Novak" and, until recently, "Crossfire," which celebrates its 15th anniversary this week. "Producers want to appeal to the X Generation -- they're tired of the old geezers," he says. "But most of the young people don't know what they're talking about."
 Responds Ingraham: "It's not just like I showed up blond and in a miniskirt and said, 'Hire me!' " (Two years ago, for an article about young conservatives, she did show up blond and in a miniskirt for a cover shoot for this magazine.) "If I'd known it was going to be that easy, I never would have clerked for the Supreme Court and worked for a prestigious firm and written as much as I have. All that's as valuable as covering fires in Des Moines." She breathes, then switches to attack: "Those old white males don't speak to a lot of America -- what does Fred Barnes know about my world? You don't hear male anchors and reporters being criticized for being good-looking. No one wants to see Quasimodo up there." Or fat people on the cover of magazines.
 Like Ingraham, many of MSNBC's contributors are young (average age: 35) and don't come from news. They are bankers, law professors, consultants, Congress of Racial Equality leaders -- a visual and philosophical Benetton ad. "We have a group that looks like America," says Eric Alterman, another contributor, "if you kill off everyone over 45."
 But even more striking, and more of a challenge to the old guard than Ingraham's brassy savvy, is the contributors' emerging political perspective, which reflects the concerns of the nearly 80 million Americans born between 1961 and 1981. This is a generation of people who, to judge by a survey conducted by the college magazine Link, consider themselves, by a 3-to-2 margin, neither Republicans nor Democrats but "other." A generation that believes more that U.F.O.'s exist than that Social Security will still exist when they retire. They are fearful for their economic future, yet deeply skeptical that the sort of politicians who shadowed their childhoods with the ghosts of Vietnam and Watergate are in any position to help. They are a group whose grass-roots movements have "yeah, sure" names like Lead or Leave, Do Something and Who Cares, a group to whom R. J. Reynolds, in a spectacular botch, tried and failed to successfully market a premium cigarette called Politix. (If you don't like it in a bicameral legislature, try it in a nicotine-delivery system!)
 "The generation up to 35 rejects traditional politics," says Frank Luntz, a 35-year-old Republican pollster. "They don't trust government, don't like Washington, don't vote, don't read newspapers. They view themselves not as members of political parties but as a generational group. They want less taxes, less regulation, less government and less moral interjection."
 This constellation of beliefs -- suspicion of power; championing of individual rights; the conviction that free markets, rather than government regulation, create a model society -- is neither left nor right. If anything, it is libertarian, and on MSNBC it tends to produce a calming political consensus. In a recent contributors' segment about gun control, Jef Pollock and John Fund, an editorial writer at The Wall Street Journal, began in violent disagreement, then forged an astonishingly swift truce: law-abiding people should be allowed guns for protection, but criminals who use them should receive harsh sentences, and computerized lists of felons should be updated at the state and local levels. The last four exchanges began "I totally agree with John," "I'll agree," "It's very true" and "I agree."
 On most Washington shows, Surgeon General Dr. Joycelyn Elders's suggestion that the topic of masturbation be included in schools' sex-education programs was blasted by the right and bolstered by the left. On MSNBC, Eric Alterman, who agreed with Elders, spoke firmly from the new center. "What?" he asked. "You think most everyone in this studio doesn't masturbate?"
 In other words, while MSNBC's contributors are hardly offering a graduate seminar in John Locke and Milton Friedman, their approach augurs a
sea change. The contributors have by and large gravitated to a generational world view in which Tupac Shakur and Howard Stern matter as much as Newt Gingrich and in which personal feeling is as important as big-picture strategizing, whether the topic is cloning, Congo or Paula Corbin Jones.
 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's discovery of her Jewish heritage, for example, sparked a discussion not of whether the revelation would affect American foreign policy but, in the case of two Jewish contributors, of how it made them feel. This approach doesn't always work. "It's kind of like marathon dancing," says the NBC anchor Tom Brokaw. "It's interesting that they can do it for so long, but it's not that fun to do it or watch it."
 But where the older Washington pundits follow a Congressional template -- partisan fury, then a vote -- the contributors, with more divergent backgrounds, paradoxically come much closer to a coffeehouse consensus. They see Washington not as a glittering prize to be conquered by polemics but
 as a bad sitcom to be clicked off. Change the channel, watch something else.
 Says one contributor: "One is more likely to say, 'I work on MSNBC,' because that's TV, that's cool, than say, 'I'm a political analyst.' Why? Because everyone views politics as reprehensible."
 Omar wasow, another msnbc contributor, is a perfect ambassador for the new pundits. Once a week, he joins two other contributors at the Secaucus, N.J., studio for short discussion segments throughout the day that provide context to the flow of reporting and videotape from around the world. It's the news network's op-ed page. And here he is, emerging from a dressing room, prepared to tell the world what to think.
 Makeup has turned Wasow's caffe latte skin a ghostly porcelain; he wears a dark suit and a blue shirt with the top button secured -- nerd chic. "I wear the suits because while I want to look like a bit of a bad boy -- and the visual trope of my hair certifies me as an outsider -- I also want to be taken seriously," he says. "A friend of mine says, 'You're behaving like a 13-year-old girl hitting puberty.' It scares me a little." At 26, Wasow is the second-youngest contributor. But his well-researched ruminations win almost universal praise, as does his calm willingness to admit "I don't know."
 "I don't know" is unheard of in traditional punditry. But in conversation Wasow often revisits questions weeks later, saying, "I've been thinking . ..." before eagerly refuting his own prior contentions. "You get one Jew in a room and you've got three arguments," he says, laughing.
 Yet, as the old joke has it, he doesn't look Jewish, and his sense of who he is remains flexible. The child of a white Jewish father and a black mother, Wasow thinks of himself as black. And Jewish. Or black and Jewish. He has spoken of himself on the air as both and is comfortable being whatever the conversation calls for: one-stop multicultural shopping. "My identity forms my positions," Wasow says, "but doesn't define them. Unlike older black leaders, I don't want black unity. I want to help poor people out of poverty."
 But the idea that you need an appropriate-looking messenger is an MSNBC dictum: image is identity. The day punitive damages were to be awarded at O. J. Simpson's civil trial, Steve Lewis, a senior producer, felt he needed "a black person in every group today -- not out of political correctness, but because over 70 percent of blacks think O. J. didn't get a fair trial, and blacks know they can get [expletive] by the police." It is hard to overstate how big a change this is. "The unspoken cultural reference point of all the Washington shows," says Michael Kinsley, the former "Crossfire" host, "is, 'As a white man in a suit, I believe. . . .' "
 As a black man in a suit, Wasow's cultural reference point is that of an entrepreneur. New York Online, his seven-person company, has built Web sites for Consumer Reports, The New Yorker and the Government of Martinique, grossing about $400,000 last year, all from his Brooklyn apartment. Wasow believes in free markets yet is strongly pro-abortion rights and pro-civil liberties. His fiercest passion is reserved for supporting school vouchers and the decriminalization of drugs.
 Wasow plans a book, "Cusp," that will lasso these ideas into a platform for his rising generation. "But being able to argue this ideology on television, to a mass audience, is the most important way we can make the dead left come alive," he says. (This view of television's reach is shared by, among others, George Stephanopoulos. "I, personally, can do more for the progressive cause as a commentator in the next four years than I could in the White House," says Stephanopoulos, 36, who has traded being Clinton's senior adviser for regular slots on "Good Morning America" and "This Week.")
 The floor producer fetches Wasow, Jennifer Grossman and Brian Jones to a set that evokes a software start-up cum Starbucks for a discussion about welfare. Not surprisingly, perhaps, Grossman and Jones, who are on the conservative side of the spectrum, amiably (and rather boringly) agree with Wasow that private programs are better than Federal ones at moving people into the work force. "But a majority of the discussions on MSNBC are not polarized," Wasow says afterward. Such consensus is the bane of Washington shows. "They shout fire and brimstone on issues like gun control and abortion," Wasow says, "but they totally miss the point. Most people aren't enthusiastic about abortion, but they're not enthusiastic about heavily regulating it, either. They don't want guns around, but they don't think regulating them will do much.
 "Eric Alterman," -- whose background is left-liberal -- "John Fund and I all agreed recently that people had the right to contract privately to buy cancer drugs outside the F.D.A.-approved process, that the Government should stay out of it. The libertarian consensus stunned us. Bizarre but meaningful coalitions form around ideas. Ideas!"
 Traditionally -- that is, for the last 15 years -- television pundits have been Washington journalists willing to play the role of die-hard partisans. "Ultimately these issues must be put to a simple vote -- up or down?" says John McLaughlin, 70, the blustery eminence of "The McLaughlin Group," the show that practically invented political commentary as entertainment. "We have to cover five topics in 22 minutes, which makes 10 seconds an eternity. So I edit as I go by being quite ruthless and rude and uncivilized. MSNBC's pacing is a little slow, which is easier. Our panelists get to the point faster. And say something they probably shouldn't: what they really think."
 In return for confining themselves to a lean diet of insults and canned bon mots, Washington pundits get huge name recognition: "Through television you can become a conglomerate, where you do writing, TV and speeches," says Fred Barnes. "You make more money, you have more visibility and you can affect the game, which is what the political community in Washington is working out every day."
 Print journalists say they do television because it's where the audience and the action are. Yet unlike Wasow, they don't believe anyone outside the Beltway is really paying attention. "We have an audience," Barnes says, "but we don't have influence." So the older TV pundits are a sheepish oddity: performers in a visual medium who only believe what they read. The sense of slumming is apparent during the "out" shots as a show like "Crossfire" goes to commercials after a fierce exchange and we see the panelists laughing and shaking their heads, as if to say, "What the hell was that about?"
 "I had a bad experience on 'Crossfire' a few years ago," says George Stephanopoulos. "John Sununu said to me, 'Liar, liar, pants on fire!' " He shakes his head. "How are you going to respond to that? 'Fat pig!'?" Says Robert Novak: "The viewer might think you're ready to strangle each other, but the heat is done for television. It's a little like professional wrestling."
 Now the networks are modifying those tactics to woo the famously diffident younger audience, though none have gone as far as MSNBC. ABC picked up "Politically Incorrect" from Comedy Central, which features four celebrities like G. Gordon Liddy and Harvey Fierstein irreverently discussing national affairs. "You've got to fish where the fish are," says Bill Maher, a comedian and the show's host. "Are we doing justice to issues the way 'Firing Line' is? No. But who's watching 'Firing Line'?"
 Typically, as for all public-affairs shows, a 55-year-old white man. Margaret Carlson of CNN's "Capital Gang" reports, "All the mash notes I get are from prisoners and old men with shaky handwriting." In 1995 Howard Polskin, vice president of CNN, set out to change that, eventually leading the network to hire the 20-somethings Farai Chideya and Kellyanne Fitzpatrick together as "Gen X Team" campaign analysts. "That's so cool!" Fitzpatrick said at the time, high-fiving Chideya in, she now ruefully admits, "typical Gen X fashion." The two appeared on "Inside Politics" throughout the campaign. "Seeing is the first step to believing," says Fitzpatrick, an earnest Republican pollster, now 30. "Young people saw me on the air and maybe thought, 'Perhaps there's a role for me.' "
 But Farai Chideya, a 27-year-old liberal, felt that CNN didn't take advantage of the generational perspective she could offer. In the end, "Our analysis was no different than anyone else's," Chideya says. "When Bernie Shaw and Judy Woodruff asked us questions, it was like: 'Here's our little pipsqueaks! They're so cute!' And we'd make a Pearl Jam reference, playing up to Gen-X-pectations. You could never say: 'Time out on the horse race. Let's talk about the real impact of educational tax cuts on the young.' And the 'Gen X Team' was corny, embarrassing -- we should have had thongs and breastplates. It was just marketing, getting boomers to think the station is hip."
 Hipness is all. TV ads for "Nightline" now feature a dude who pauses long enough from sailboarding to say, " 'Nightline' is as cool as land sailing." John McLaughlin has been auditioning 30-somethings for his show, and "This Week" has hired William Kristol and George Stephanopoulos as "new blood." Only the new Fox News Channel, on which Monica Crowley, 28, is the sole pundit under age 35, isn't playing. "I'm a little surprised by the notion that to attract younger viewers you have to have young people on the air," says John Moody, the channel's vice president of news editorial -- disavowing the whole rationale for Fox shows like "Beverly Hills 90210."
 The fatal flaw of most network attempts at hipness -- even MSNBC's -- argues a former MTV political analyst, Alex Abrams, 31, is that they employ younger faces without having an editorial shift to address younger-skewing issues. "Our MTV election poll showed the top five issues for 17- to 29-year-olds are: strengthening the economy and creating new jobs, fighting crime, making higher education more affordable, preserving Social Security and Medicare for future generations and making health care affordable. That's what MSNBC should be talking about, not about Bosnia."
 Christopher Cuomo, 26, a lawyer and the youngest son of the former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, agrees. "You have to sell our generation a reason to believe," he says. He is currently working on "Live Bait," a Gen X interview show in development that would skew young but also capitalize on traditional right-left friction by pairing him with Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, whom he impolitically dismisses as an old soul. "All the media marketers say we don't vote, don't participate -- and it's true that all we know about Sam Donaldson is his freaky hair," Cuomo says. "But if we're such losers, then why are we fighting for the environment, why do we jump on Americorps, why do we overrun Teach for America with applications? Unfortunately, on television we're just represented by George Stephanopoulos, who has no clue because all the young people he knows are politicians.
 "The truth is," the politician's son concludes, putting a new spin on Tip O'Neill's famous aphorism, "all politics is identity politics."
 In october 1995, the president of NBC news, Andrew Lack, began noodling around with an idea for talk segments on his new 24-hour cable network (backed by $500 million pledged for the first five years by NBC and Microsoft). He wanted to woo the young, and he felt that the era of "McLaughlin-like shouting" was done. "So I came up with the idea for 'The Friends,' " a term still used in-house, who would "recreate the relaxed feeling of a bull session with journalist friends."
 Before MSNBC debuted last July, Lack and his producers auditioned more than 100 potential Friends, looking for types almost as if they were casting a huge sitcom. Eric Alterman, 37, a squirrel-cheeked media columnist for The Nation, is well aware of his role in the Friends ensemble: "They told me to be myself -- you know, a wise-guy liberal New York Jew." Alterman, in fact, had written a 1992 book, "Sound and Fury: The Washington Punditocracy and the Collapse of American Politics," that eviscerated talking heads for being a cynical, clownish elite: "The number who manage to present a coherent contextual viewpoint on television is zero," he wrote in one of his milder observations. Alterman acknowledges the appearance of hypocrisy in his current role but says, "Look, I tried to do something about this with my book, and nobody cared."
 Many of the usual Washington suspects weren't interested in traveling to New Jersey every week for an average of $30,000 a year. And that left open the role of the wacky-looking but reasonable Internet guy for Omar Wasow, whose first audition, frankly, bombed. But after a second audition, Wasow was signed part time, and he soon worked his way up to regular duty by reviewing tapes of his segments, learning how to appear natural on the job. Wasow discovered that when he hunches his shoulders he resembles Nixon saying, "I am not a crook." He remembered to sit up straight, to be more aggressive and to make two crisp points and then shut up.
 The big question about technique is, Where do you stop? Rather than appearing simply natural, why not try for truly striking? So you wear a navy blue jacket, which looks splendid on television, and sit on the tail so it doesn't bunch. You cut your hair: close-ups require smaller hair. You lean slightly forward if you want to jump in -- if you're a woman, you even touch the speaker's hand. You speak for 40 seconds to a minute 15 seconds, tops: after that no one's listening.
 And what if someone else has already made your point? It looks lame just to agree, so you reposition. Television, which renders genuine emotion frightening and complexity confusing, militates against saying what you really think. And once you have abandoned sincerity, it's a short step to ending up like Arianna Huffington, who delivered commentary in bed during Comedy Central's "Indecision '96." The older pundits tried to make Washington politics a show but only helped turn it -- and themselves -- into a sideshow. "Once the journalist talk shows defined their appeal as being fundamentally entertainment," says James Fallows, the editor of U.S. News and World Report and a media critic, "they guaranteed they'd be run out of business by a new generation that looks better and doesn't feel sheepish about being on TV."
 Asked to pick the strongest panel for a show, a longtime Fox news producer, Tammy Haddad, says, "I'd have Rosie O'Donnell, Alec Baldwin, the rapper Coolio and President Clinton as the anchor, because he has an incredible grasp of facts and he's likable -- the most important thing." He is also the perfect poll-driven President, channeling the anti-government consensus and rebroadcasting it as the new post-partisan politics. But where are the journalists and partisans? "You said strongest show," Haddad replies. "A girl's got to get an audience."
 The discussion topic is a 13-year-old who sold some- one crack, shot him and set him on fire. Wasow is on with Don Walter, a Republican media strategist from Virginia and something of a conservative firecracker. "Yes, he should go to jail," Walter says. "The people want it."
 "Fine," Wasow replies. "I'm not going to try to make the case that violent criminals deserve more freedom." Then, over Walter's interruptions, Wasow tries to make a more complicated point about the cost to taxpayers of incarceration and the fact that the majority of Federal prisoners are nonviolent offenders. "So let's not just say, 'Lock everybody up.' "
 Walter interrupts, a small smile playing on his lips: "Are you currently on parole right now? You feel so passionate about this." Wasow rocks back in his chair, stammers briefly, then says, "I feel passionate about this because we're bankrupting our states." "No, no, no -- Omar, you're a policy wonk," Walter says. "You live in New York City. People in the real world, who live in communities where bad guys live, if they want to lock 'em up, let 'em lock 'em up."
 Wasow looks calm as the camera swoops to a commercial, but he's seething. "That's a recurring joke Don has with me, the 'What are you smoking, Omar?' thing," he says after the broadcast. "It strikes me as out of line, but it's a very powerful mode of argument, because I don't even want to enter the discussion of 'Am I on parole or not?' "
 I mention to Don Walter that Wasow finds his personal remarks difficult to counter. "You're giving me all the information I need to take him out," Walter responds, laughing. "It's a cruel, hard world and I'm looking for sound bites, because we're in the business of retaining viewers."
 A few days later, upon further reflection, Wasow acknowledges that the exchange with Walter exposed "a weak spot for me. It's my insecurity about being perceived as a hippie, as the pot-smoking Rastafarian that I appear. Symbols truly are stronger than any other kind of narrative on TV. So Don probably wins that discussion, because his points are so much more informal and easy to grasp. I felt like an old academic arguing with a young slickster."
 The paradox is precisely this, of course: Walter is 36, a decade older, and has more television experience. Television punditry turns its young thinkers into young slicksters, who discover that partisan pummeling makes for livelier television than consensus. Ground-breaking though the MSNBC experiment may be, its average audience is tiny: 20,000 to 30,000 households. "Crossfire" draws 637,000; "McLaughlin," 4.5 million. No doubt some of the discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that MSNBC is still in its infancy. But what if audiences actually like old-fashioned, pie-in-the-face conflict? This possibility is not lost on the Friends. "I'm trying to come up with some zingers for the conservatives," Wasow says. " 'What are you smoking?' Or 'Are you high?' It's pathetic that I have to think them up ahead of time, but when the audience is keeping score, if you can't dish it out with the best of them, you're not really in the game."
 John Gibson, an MSNBC anchor, says, "Lying, spin and salesmanship are the hallmarks of the people who want to be on television." His jaundice is laced with melancholy. "The contributors will tell you it's a 70-30 ratio of communicating their important beliefs versus working on their chops, their technique, getting known. When they look back, they're going to see that it's exactly 30-70 the other way."
 Wasow has already begun to take note. "There's something incredibly titillating about the money and the adulation of television," he says slowly, "but it has nothing to do with rising to the moral issue of your day. . . . It's probably not enough to simply articulate ideas on TV. . . ." He slows even more, feeling his way. "Is there some point at which I do something real, like helping bring school vouchers to New York City?"
 We're sitting in Wasow's company office at the end of a long day, surrounded by the computer monitors that have been his window onto the world till now. "But I've been seduced," he admits at last, ever forthright. And he grins as if preparing to confess something truly shameful. "What I'd really love is to do a Gen X 'McLaughlin Group.' "

Live at 11: Death

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
Most local television stations interrupted their customary tales of murder and mayhem long enough recently to cover Carol Marin's noisy but decidedly nonviolent protest. Why?
Marin, as you must have heard, quit her job as an anchor at WMAQ in Chicago because of growing frustration with the quality of the news she was required to read. Her patience snapped when the station signed Jerry Springer, of late a TV merchant of programs like "Women With Watermelon Breasts," to join her program as a commentator. Her resignation evoked so much audience protest that Springer, too, had to quit two days later 
 Television anchors everywhere jumped on this story with obvious sympathy and envy. Most of them must share Marin's disgust with the journalism they are forced to practice, yet most cannot afford to quit. They could not even afford to emphasize the most dramatic aspect of the Chicago dust-up: the public's reaction. As soon as Springer came on the air, half the program's customary audience tuned out. There is promise in that discontent, but not enough broadcasters seem prepared to exploit it.
The idea of tapping Springer's freak-show appeal for the local news sprang from the head of WMAQ's new vice president, Joel Cheatwood, who had made his mark with fire and brimstone as news director at WSVN in Miami. His pyrotechnics earned the highest ratings in Miami and inspired much imitation. During its third annual analysis of 100 newscasts in 55 markets last February, Rocky Mountain Media Watch caught WSVN employing spooky music, blood-red graphics and ear-splitting sound effects to serve up a drumbeat of death, danger and destruction surrounding two long murder tales:

Subject	Length	Murder/suicide victims identified as fireman and wife	(3:22)	Arrests made at crack house	(0:18)	House fire put out	(0:15)	Suspect surrenders in shooting and robbery of tourist	(0:13)	Teacher suspended for carrying	 	concealed weapon after attack	(0:59)	Fire in Everglades almost out	(0:27)	Boat capsizes; one dead, one missing	(0:18)	Lifeguards rescue 50 people today	 	because of strong riptides	(0:17)	Giant sinkhole still not repaired	(0:14)	Seeking tips on racist graffiti	(0:25)	Robbers nabbed outside grocery store	(0:23)	Runaway boy found	(0:21)	Child killed in car crash	(0:16)	JonBenet Ramsey murder; former	 	Miss America compares their lives	(3:25)	Was Atlanta bombing part of a series?	(0:23)	Empire State Building assassin left a note	(0:23)	Lincoln bedroom sleep-over flap	(1:16)	Flooding in Illinois	(0:16)	Attack of the tumbleweeds in New Mexico	(0:12)	
Such was the diet of information fed to a region of more than three million people last Feb. 26, the end of a "sweeps" month when the size of the audience determines the prices that can be charged for commercials. There were no major catastrophes anywhere in America that day. The Dow Jones average stood near 7,000. There was time, therefore, to explore the local economy, or the performance of government agencies, or some new cultural attractions, or the good works of volunteers and the needs of poor people. Yet 72 of the lead stories at 100 stations in 35 states were about crime and violence, mostly murder.
Indeed, fully one-third of all the news on local TV that night dealt with crime, and mostly murder. And so it goes every night, according to another survey made over six months by an academic consortium directed from the University of Miami. Although violent crime has been dropping sharply for two years now in almost every American city, this mayhem machine just keeps on producing its reckless distortions of life for two or three hours a day. Even if death were the only subject capable of grabbing a mass audience, why dwell only on homicide? There are more suicides in America (30,000, not even counting smoking) than murders (25,000) every year, and still more deaths in auto accidents (40,000), half due to alcohol.
It is sadly true, as a Newseum/Roper Center survey reported last month that more than half of all Americans watch the local TV news every day, that more than half think it's good and that nearly 70 percent are "extremely" or "very" interested in the news of crime. But how could they be interested in much else when no one offers much else? Only a single public television station (KTCA in Twin Cities, Minn.) carries a nightly local news program, and only a handful of others are rebelling against sensation.
The Rocky Mountain survey's most encouraging finding came in Austin, Tex., where KVUE avoids most crime stories but still outdraws two competitors hooked on mayhem. KVUE reports only crimes that produce a significant effect or threat in the community. On the survey night, its main stories dealt with falling gasoline prices, poor sidewalks for children and the handicapped, new rules for recycling and a backlog of paternity cases requiring DNA tests.
If other stations are to be emboldened to follow this example, other anchors need to join Carol Marin in finding ways to protest against their customary scripts. The Roper poll reported that more than half of all Americans trust "all" or "most" of what local newscasters say (while less than a third have that much faith in newspaper reporters). That trust attaches to the faces on the screen, not to the stations or the backstage news directors. And as Marin proved, it can be a formidable weapon.
No need for all anchors to resign; just balk a bit. Stop showing such enthusiasm for "breaking" stories when the facts are clouded and the images are immaterial. (On survey night, KWGN in Denver began by shouting about a "riot" at a local high school; it became a "fight" in midprogram and a mere "disturbance" by the end.) Also, stop bragging about "live" feeds that usually catch reporters outside closed doors waiting to be fed minutiae. Start asking, "So what?" and "Why are we doing this?" and "Which is the bigger crime -- that pathetic murder or our report of it?"

Like Old Times: Steel Plant Coming to New Haven

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IN capturing the first newly built large-scale industrial plant in Connecticut in more than 20 years, and the first basic manufacturing company to enter the state in 50 years, New Haven has negotiated a reversal of industrial emigration, what Mayor John DeStefano Jr. calls "a contrarian occurrence."
Williams Specialty Steel of Buffalo has chosen a site in the northern part of the city on which to build a $200 million, 225,000-square-foot plant to make stainless steel slabs. Capable of turning out 500,000 tons a year, the plant will have national impact and negligible competition. Donald Reed, senior vice president of the Connecticut Development Authority, said: "About three million tons are made nationally by about 25 plants. But capacity is less than demand, so at least 25 percent is imported. By the time this plant opens two or three years from now, the demand will be 15 percent higher. Williams will be cutting into imports." 
 Since World War II, Connecticut has been drained of hundreds of manufacturing companies lured south by cheaper operating costs, and its military industries have been downsized. New Haven's heaviest loss was U.S. Steel, which moved away in 1980, laying off 1,200 people. Over the last few years about 25 small manufacturing companies have moved into existing buildings in various towns, "but nothing has been built new or approaching the size of the Williams project," said John Paul, director of business recruitment for the state.
Since the 1960's, demand for stainless steel has been growing by 5.5 percent to 7 percent a year, said Mark Sabers, vice president of Williams. "This is our first venture into stainless, a market that represents a very good opportunity for growth. We owned a carbon steel company at one time, but sold it 10 years ago."
Mayor DeStefano, a Democrat in his second term, outlined the city's role in financing the venture. "We will assist them in placing $55 million in bonds for construction costs," he said, "but the net cost to the city will be $10 million in abated real estate taxes for the first five years."
A total of $2 million to $2.5 million in machinery and equipment taxes will be paid annually by the company. "A balloon payment on the balance of the debt will come due after five years," the Mayor said, "when they can place the debt elsewhere if they can't pay it."
The company is also receiving a 25-year loan of $9.75 million at 6 percent from the Connecticut Development Authority, and an additional $1 million from the Connecticut Department of Community and Economic Development for training 350 permanent workers, all that will be needed in the highly automated operation.
A service valued at $5 million will also be provided without charge by United Illuminating. "We will build an electric substation for them," said Anthony Vallillo, vice president of client services, "that we normally charge for." Of all U.I.'s customers in 17 Fairfield and New Haven County towns, Williams will be the biggest.
"Their primary electric arc furnace generates a tremendous amount of heat to melt the scrap steel for making stainless," Mr. Vallillo said. He estimated that the plant would consume 300 million kilowatt-hours a year, compared with the 6,000 to 8,000 kilowatt-hours used by the average house. Residential customers pay nine cents a kilowatt-hour, but the plant will have a reduced rate.
A gap in financing, city officials say, is the only thing that might threaten the deal. "There have been many expressions of interest from Wall Street," Mr. Reed said. Harry Williams, chairman of the company and a multimillionaire with more than a dozen enterprises, is expected to invest a substantial sum.
He controls businesses in real estate, leasing, telecommunications, electronics, construction and environmental services. His core business is Integrated Waste Systems of Buffalo. Some New Haven officials say he has bought and sold as many as 54 businesses in the last 30 years.
MAYOR DeSTEFANO is unconcerned about possible volatility. "I'm impressed with his ability to deliver on what he says he's going to do," the Mayor said, "and with his track record and his balance sheet."
The Williams company was also "impressed, with the incentives, and the speed and quality of response by state and city governments," Mr. Sabers said. "We looked in Indiana, Maryland, several other states, and considered Buffalo before deciding on New Haven."
Andrew Anastasio Jr., who owns the plant site and will be Williams's landlord, met Harry Williams five years ago while investigating a business opportunity in New Jersey. "We've known Harry and Tony Uzzo for years, but the state deserves the credit for putting us all together," Mr. Anastasio said. Mr. Uzzo is an economic development specialist for United Illuminating, who suggested that part of Mr. Anastasio's 100 acres would be ideal for the Williams operation. A 50-year sublease of 25 to 27 acres of the Anastasio property is being negotiated.
For the last 10 years, the Anastasio family has used the property for an outdoor trucking and distribution center for milled lumber, steel, building materials and telephone poles, under a 99-year lease from Conrail. A Conrail switching station is at the north end of the site and two rail lines run down the east and west sides, serving several spurs up to six times a week. The plant will be built close to Interstate 91 on the banks of the Quinnipiac River, which empties into New Haven Harbor, providing rail, water and highway access that the Williams company found attractive.
Bruce Blakey, corporate economist for Northeast Utilities, which has no connection with the project, enumerated its regional benefits. "New construction," he said, citing a Federal Department of Commerce formula, "has a multiplier of about two and a half, so the 3,000 construction workers from around the state who will spend two years or more on the job will generate 7,500 total jobs in housing, cement, lumber, food and so on. The 350 permanent jobs will produce 950 to 1,000 jobs. If unemployed people get those jobs, they will contribute to the economy. If they are employed and switch, their old jobs will be filled by others. If the plant takes off, it will bring in supplier companies and more jobs."
"Williams is obligated to give New Haven residents first shot at the 350 steel jobs," said Sal Brancati, New Haven's director of business development. The city has an unemployment rate of just under 5 percent.
Bonds are expected to be issued in the fall, and applications for site plan review and environmental permits await completion of building plans.
Mr. Brancati said that New Haven's downtown was beginning to show signs of improvement. "The new $27 million Omni Hotel at Yale is almost completed and taking reservations for December," he said. "First class office space is filled, and we are beginning to absorb second class space."
Demolition of Malley's department store starting next week will open up office possibilities, and some vintage office buildings are being converted into 700 market-rate apartments, for which there are waiting lists. Developers are submitting alternative proposals for the vacant Macy's, and negotiations for property required to build a big mall at Long Wharf are nearing completion.
But it is the steel plant that has lifted spirits. "It's nice to have Swiss Bank and Zurich Re in Stamford," Edward Deak, professor of economics at Fairfield University, said, "but it's very nice to see a manufacturing entity come into the state."

HEADLINE: Taking the Measure Of Lead-Paint Hazards

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS, government officials, doctors and advocates for children have presented a compelling case for the dangers of lead-based paint to children, a danger present in an estimated 64 million homes, in wealthy suburbs as well as inner cities.
But since Federal regulations designed to promote disclosure of lead-paint hazards went into effect last December, they have, regulators agree, had little impact on the buyers and potential buyers whom they were designed to protect. 
 "I don't think that people are fully aware of the importance of this issue," said Clarence Lewis, chief of the National Program Chemicals Assistance Branch of the Environmental Protection Agency.
According to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, nearly a million children have unacceptably high levels of lead in their blood, which can result in behavioral and growth problems, learning disabilities, low attention span and reduced IQ levels.
But understanding what hazards may actually exist in a home in which lead paint is present -- which means most houses and apartments built before 1978 -- is only the first step in a process that includes examining the wide range of possible actions to resolve any problems.
"Most houses don't poison most children," said David Jacobs, director of the Office of Lead Hazard Control in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "But it's always in a homeowner's best interest to know where potential problems are so that future problem can be avoided."
Mr. Jacobs pointed out that there is a distinction between houses that contain lead-based paint and those that contain lead-based paint hazards.
"A hazard means that the paint has deteriorated or that there is contaminated dust or soil on the property," he said. "So while it's true that there are 64 million houses that have lead-based paint in them, our estimates are that something like 20 million contain lead hazards."
But, Mr. Jacobs said, evidence suggests that many children are exposed to lead-based paint hazards as the result of renovation projects in well-maintained homes that contain lead-based paint -- homes that would otherwise be considered safe.
Moreover, he said, many homeowners are unaware that even minor projects -- like paint removal and sanding or scraping of painted surfaces -- can be hazardous if the surface contains lead-based paint.
"All of these activities create fumes or dust," Mr. Jacobs said. "It is possible even for homeowners with the best of intentions to create problems where none formerly existed."
Anne Guthrie, deputy director of the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, an advocacy group based in Washington, agreed. "For suburban homeowners whose houses are in otherwise good condition, this is the area of greatest risk," she said. "I know of many parents who thought they were doing the right thing by renovating their homes who inadvertently ended up poisoning their children."
Typical physical symptoms of severe lead poisoning include stomach pain, seizures, headaches and growth problems. And while all young children are susceptible to lead poisoning the risk is greatest for children under the age of 2. "That's when they are most likely to be crawling and exploring and putting everything they see into their mouths," Ms. Guthrie said.
She added that virtually invisible particles of lead dust from friction surfaces like windows and doors can be ingested by children chewing on windowsills or crawling around floors and transferring the substance from hand to mouth.
It was to control such dangers that the final regulations of the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act went into effect last December. The Federal measure requires property owners of virtually all housing built before 1978 to disclose to prospective buyers or renters whatever they know about the presence of lead-based paint in their properties and to permit buyers to have a lead-hazard inspection conducted.
OVER the seven months that the law has been in effect, however, officials have made an unsettling observation: While buyers are being advised of their right to have a lead hazard inspection conducted, relatively few seem inclined to do so.
With that in mind, the Environmental Protection Agency called a meeting of lead-based paint experts from around the country last month to determine why buyers seem to be ignoring the Government's efforts to increase awareness of the hazards associated with lead based paint.
Several of those experts, interviewed for this article, say that the reason more people are not getting lead-based paint inspections is because many buyers -- indeed, many homeowners -- harbor some basic misconceptions about the issue.
Many homeowners, for example, erroneously believe that lead-based paint is an "inner city" problem. In fact, experts say, there is lead-based paint in about two-thirds of the nation's housing stock. And wherever lead paint is present, they say, so, too, is the potential for problems.
Another misconception is that even if lead-based paint is present in a house, it poses no danger as long as the paint is not chipping or peeling off walls or ceilings. Indeed, specialists say, while intact surfaces are safe as long as they remain intact, they can easily become hazardous if they are abraded by regular use -- such as by opening and closing windows and doors -- or by renovation efforts like tearing down walls and removing or stripping woodwork.
And finally, those who have studied the problem say, a good number of homeowners are under the mistaken impression that to render a home safe from lead-based paint hazards requires nothing less than removal of every last bit of lead in the house -- an extraordinarily expensive solution that is out of the question for most homeowners.
Abatement contractors point out, however, that the best way to deal with existing lead-based paint is to remove what can easily be removed and cover or maintain what cannot -- options that are relatively inexpensive and generally safe.
If concerns about the ingestion of some floor dust by otherwise healthy children seems to be a well-intentioned exaggeration of the hazard posed by lead, consider the following illustration of the problem provided by Lee Wasserman, president of Lew Corporation, a lead inspection and risk assessment company based in Livingston, N.J.
Under current law, Mr. Wasserman said, the "action level" for lead dust on surfaces -- the point at which that surface is deemed to represent a potential hazard -- is 100 micrograms per square foot.
One microgram, Mr. Wasserman explained, is one one-millionth of a gram. One gram, he said, is roughly the equivalent to the contents of one small packet of Equal, the artificial sweetener.
"That means that if you had one gram of lead dust in a 10,000-square-foot house, and you could distribute that dust evenly over every floor in every room in the house, then every square foot of every single room would fail the Federal and state action levels," Mr. Wasserman said.
Dr. Herbert Needleman, professor of Psychiatry and Pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School, pointed out that there was essentially no safe amount of lead that a child can ingest. "There's clear evidence that changes in children's' cognitive function can begin with concentrations as low as 10 micrograms -- that's 10 millionths of a gram -- in about 3 ounces of blood," Dr. Needleman said. "That's like a teaspoon in a swimming pool."
Some early lead paints that were used, he said, contain as much as 50 percent lead.
"That means that a paint chip as big as your fingernail could contain as much as 500,000 micrograms of lead," he said. "So if you have lead-based paint on every windowsill and every door frame, and you determine that they're shedding lead dust, the wise thing to do is to get it taken care of."
And that, Federal regulators and health experts say, is what underscores the need for an inspection to detect the presence of lead-based paint and an assessment of any hazards that may exist.
"The whole purpose of a lead inspection is to say to the consumer, 'Here is a blueprint of your house that points out where there is and where there isn't lead based paint,' " said Mr. Wasserman of the Lew Corporation.
A properly conducted inspection, he said, begins with a visual inspection of the entire premises. That, he said, will identify areas that could represent a problem if lead-based paint is found on such a surface.
Then, he said, all painted surfaces in the house should be tested for the presence of lead-based paint. And since leaded paint is frequently buried under several layers of nonleaded paint, most inspectors will use X-Ray fluorescence equipment to essentially take an X-ray of the surface to be tested. With such equipment, Mr. Wasserman said, highly accurate readings can be obtained without removing paint from the surface and sending samples to a laboratory.
"Every surface in every room should be tested," Mr. Wasserman said, adding that it was not unusual for an inspector to take as many as 200 separate readings in an average house.
A thorough inspection, he said, should also include "dust wipes" taken from floors, window sills and window wells; soil samples taken from exterior areas -- particularly children's play areas -- and water samples taken from the tap. Those samples are then sent to a laboratory to determine whether they contain unacceptable levels of lead.
AFTER the inspection has been completed and lab results have been obtained, Mr. Wasserman said, a report should be provided to the homeowner indicating the lead content of every surface tested. Finally, he said, homeowners should make sure the report contains a "risk assessment" section that describes the relative risks associated with any lead-based paint that is found in the house.
"Risk assessment is critical," Mr. Wasserman said, explaining that a thorough inspection and careful assessment provides a homeowner with a blueprint and an action plan for dealing with lead-based paint.
An intact wall surface with a top coat of high-quality, nonleaded paint, for example, is generally safe as long as the surface is properly maintained. A window or door that gets constant use, on the other hand, could constitute a potential hazard because friction can wear away outer coatings and turn long-hidden lead paint to dust that accumulates on sills and floors.
"Should lead paint in a house scare the living daylights out of everyone?" Mr. Wasserman asked rhetorically. "I would say 'No.' " "If it's intact, you probably just have to maintain it. Lead in a wall is not going to jump out and bite you."
Mark Androsiglio, president of Environmental Diagnostic Tech, a lead-abatement contractor based in Neptune, N.J., agreed.
"We try to prioritize," Mr. Androsiglio said. "If there is lead paint on a ceiling or wall and we can stabilize it and the homeowner can maintain it, that's what we'll suggest. If there is a problem with lead dust on windows and doors, then we'll suggest replacing the windows and doors."
Generally, he said, the cost to have a lead-abatement contractor perform renovations in a house will run about 75 percent more than an ordinary contractor. So, for example, if an ordinary contractor would charge $200 to replace a window, a lead-abatement contractor might charge $350.
There is a reason, however, for the additional expense.
"You can't just take a crowbar and whack out windows and doors that have lead-based paint," Mr. Androsiglio said, explaining that whenever a lead-bearing surface is disturbed, precautions must be taken to insure that the abatement or renovation itself doesn't create additional contamination.
The first thing a competent abatement contractor will do, he said, is seal off the area being worked on to prevent dust from migrating to other areas of the house.
In most cases, Mr. Androsiglio said, workers wear protective jump suits and respirators to avoid ingesting or breathing airborne lead particles. That should be a signal to homeowners to avoid the work area while work is in progress. And whenever lead-bearing surfaces are being disturbed, he said, children and pregnant women should be out of the house.
Proper cleanup of the work area is also important. "First of all, you have to use a HEPA-Vac," Mr. Androsiglio said. Such vacuums, he noted, utilize high-efficiency filters that trap minute particles that standard household and shop vacuums would miss. In fact, cleanup with an ordinary vacuum can often increase contamination.
"With a regular vacuum, the dust is not only not trapped, but it's blown out all over the place," he said.
Once the area has been vacuumed, Mr. Androsiglio said, all surfaces must be wet-wiped with a solution containing either tri-sodium phosphate -- commonly known as TSP -- or Ledizolve, an industrial cleaner. Unless such chemicals are used, Mr. Androsiglio said, lead particles will simply be sloshed around and then left on the floor.
Finally, Mr. Androsiglio said, when all surfaces have been thoroughly cleaned, a competent contractor call in an inspector to take samples of dust and have them tested.
"It's called a final clearance criteria," Mr. Androsiglio said. "It's the final testing to insure that the house is safe."
There are, of course, homes that do contain chipping and peeling paint on walls, ceilings and woodwork. In such cases, homeowners have several options available: total or partial abatement of lead-bearing surfaces; enclosure or encapsulation of such surfaces; removal and replacement of friction surfaces and stabilization, maintenance and in-place management.
Total abatement, of course, is the most effective way to eliminate lead hazards. It is also the most expensive. It is not unusual, for example, for a total abatement job in an averaged-sized house to cost anywhere from $50,000 and up.
Enclosure, which entails covering lead-bearing surfaces with sheetrock, is less expensive than abatement but can still run into tens of thousands of dollars -- more than most homeowners are prepared or able to spend.
PARTIAL abatement, however, when accompanied by in-place management, often makes sense. With partial abatement, for example, only surfaces that pose the greatest hazards are abated. Window frames and door jambs can be replaced or stripped chemically. Those surfaces that cannot be removed or stripped can sometimes be rendered safe in other ways.
"We ended up getting replacement windows," said Dr. Jane Kanowitz, an oncologist who recently bought a house in Maplewood, N.J. Dr. Kanowitz, who has a 6-month old child, said that when she and her husband had the house they were buying inspected, the inspection disclosed lead-based paint throughout the house -- including the friction surfaces of the windows.
"It made a tremendous difference to us," Dr. Kanowitz said, adding that while she and her husband could feel comfortable with the covered and intact lead-based paint on the ceilings, walls and woodwork, the windows had to go.
"I'm looking at this as a parent, not as a physician," she said. "Our concern might have been less if we didn't have a child."
Yet another alternative to abatement, enclosure or replacement is encapsulation.
George Keefe, president of Global Encasement, an industrial coating manufacturer based in Manhattan, said that his company's product, known as LeadLock, is a liquid encapsulate that can be warranted for 20 years when properly applied.
"Management in place is now more of an acceptable solution," Mr. Keefe said, explaining that as long as a lead-bearing surface can be maintained in sound condition, it is considered safe. LeadLock, which is thicker and more durable than paint, can be brushed, sprayed or rolled onto just about any surface.
The product, which costs from 42 to 80 cents per square foot applied, recently won the second-prize award for "best new products" at the 1997 Buildings/NY trade show in Manhattan.
"It comes in either flat or gloss finish," Mr. Keefe said. "And we can make just about any color you want."
Even homeowners who can afford to spend little or nothing on lead-based paint remediation, experts say, can take steps to reduce the danger to their children.
"We particularly worry about first-time home buyers," said Nick Farr, executive director of the Center for Lead Safe Housing in Columbia, Md. "They are typically buying older houses that need a lot of renovation and if they run into a problem with lead-based paint, they may not have the money to deal with it properly."
However, Mr. Farr said, with careful monitoring of surfaces that contain lead based paint and regular cleaning of floors, window sills and window wells with TSP or Ledizolve, homes without seriously deteriorated surfaces can be made fairly safe.
"Lead poisoning can be prevented if you're careful," Mr. Farr said. "Why take a chance?"

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Hudson Square;
Trinity Church Reinvents a Neighborhood - Again

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
LOOKING for more space for his company, Cyber Dialogue Inc., Andrew Watt found what he liked at 304 Hudson Street in an area to the south of Greenwich Village, east of SoHo and north of TriBeCa. The fact that he lives in TriBeCa was not irrelevant.
With 3,000 square feet of space, he is not exactly a major tenant of Trinity Real Estate, which owns 5.5 million square feet of space in commercial buildings, most of it in an area it is marketing as the Hudson Square neighborhood. 
 But Mr. Watt's business is exactly the kind of hip, high-technology company Trinity is seeking to rejuvenate a faded manufacturing district. Cyber Dialogue is an Internet data base consulting company operating on the forefront of new communications systems.
"We help people understand who is visiting their Web sites," said Mr. Watt, the company's chief executive. "If a company has a Web site and wants to tell its advertisers who its customers are, we help them work it out."
Mr. Watt said he looked at both the East and West Sides of Manhattan after outgrowing space on Maiden Lane downtown before settling on the Hudson Street location and moving in January. "It was nice loft space at a reasonable price," he said.
Trinity is the major landlord in an area bounded by the Hudson River, Canal Street to the south, the Avenue of the Americas to the east and Morton Street to the north, owning about 45 percent of the commercial property. The company, which is owned by the 300-year-old Trinity Church near Wall Street, comes by its real estate assets in an unusual way: they are the result of a land grant by Queen Anne of England in 1705.
For almost a hundred years, this was a manufacturing district, with graphic arts and printing companies operating in structures sturdily built to support heavy, vibrating printing presses. Many of the buildings can support 225 pounds per square foot, compared with 90 to 100 pounds in typical office buildings, Trinity officials said.
For many years, Trinity collected rents and turned the money over to the church to support its charitable programs. But changing technology and the stock market crash a decade ago dealt a heavy blow to the printing industry. With fewer rush jobs from securities companies, the companies had to cut their costs to bid more effectively for the remaining work.
"Three things happened to the printing industry," said Joseph T. Palombi, executive vice president of Trinity Real Estate. "New technology meant less space was needed to operate a print shop, many companies moved their operations to lower-cost, nonunion locations in New Jersey, Long Island and Queens and many companies started to do a lot of their own printing."
The impact on Trinity was substantial. Companies leasing 3 million of the Trinity's 5.5 million square feet failed. Observing that manufacturing in general was shrinking in Manhattan, Trinity officials decided to remake the neighborhood, seeking companies in the advertising, publishing, telecommunications and the high-technology, new-media industries.
Since noisy, vibrating, dirty printing operations do not make good neighbors to office tenants, the remaining printers were consolidated into three buildings on Vestry, Hudson and Canal Streets with 800,000 to 900,000 square feet of space.
"TRINITY decided to invent a neighborhood," said Stephen D. Heyman, who joined the company earlier this year as director of commercial leasing. "To do that, it was important to create an identity for an area that was thought of as SoHo west. So they dusted of some maps from the 1800's, and found the term Hudson Square and decided to apply the name to a larger area." (The actual square, now vanished, was below Canal Street and outside Trinity's holdings.)
The conversion program appears to be working. Tenants in all the targeted categories have arrived, most notably the Saatchi & Saatchi advertising agency, which moved into a new building developed by Tishman Speyer on land owned by Trinity. Older buildings have been renovated to obscure their industrial past with new lobbies and upgraded elevators and air-conditioning.
The amount of vacant square footage has dwindled to 887,000, according to Mr. Heyman, with leases pending on almost 500,000 square feet of that. "At the end of the day, we are only going to have about 150,000 square feet of office space available," Mr. Palombi said. "The rest is mostly storage, basement and retail space."
Brokers say Trinity has been largely successful turning an industrial area into one of mixed commercial uses. (No housing, however, since the zoning does not permit it.)
"It is perceived as a niche area that derives some of the cachet of SoHo and TriBeCa, and Trinity has a reputation for operating well-managed buildings." said Bruce E. Surry, a senior managing director of Insignia/Edward S. Gordon. "They have, in fact, transformed the neighborhood by refusing to renew the leases of the printers in some buildings and grouping them elsewhere."
He said asking rents, under $20 a square foot 18 months ago, had risen recently to an average of $23.50.
"Trinity has done a good job marketing the area and they are seeing a lot of activity," said Vincent J. Peters, a vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield. Mr. Peters said Trinity's reputation helped the marketing effort. "You can't find a better landlord in the city," he said. "They are conservative, but take a lot of pride in what they do."
It should not be surprising that this church-owned real estate company has been successful in converting a neighborhood. Trinity has been doing it for a long time.
The original grant of land was intended to provide financial support for the church by its use as a farm. It was bounded roughly by Broadway on the east, the Hudson River on the west, Fulton Street on the south and Christopher Street on the north. Over the years, the church gave away or sold large amounts of its land. Two notable recipients of land donations were Kings College, now Columbia University, and St. Vincent's Hospital.
Trinity officials say the Queen's grant is probably the largest contiguous piece of Manhattan land ever owned by one entity. Today, they say the church owns 3 to 4 percent of the original tract. As a farm, the land produced little income, but as the city expanded northward, the land came into demand for housing. The church leased the ground to landlords, some of whom built crowded, unsanitary tenements or used their buildings for even less savory purposes.
"BY the late 1800's, the church's leaders realized they owned the red-light district of New York," Mr. Heyman said. "So the rector decided to sell or trade those properties for locations where commercial buildings could provide the church with an economic base." By the late 1920's, the basic industrial nature of the neighborhood was established.
Trinity generally leased the land to developers who had the capital to build factory buildings. That arrangement worked fine during the early decades of the century, but during the Depression many building owners defaulted on their mortgages and the properties were in danger of being seized by the city for unpaid taxes.
A bank lent the church money to satisfy the tax payment, which is how Trinity came to own the buildings as well as the land.
The company is continuing its factory-to-office renovation program, with three buildings, two on Hudson Street and the other on the Avenue of the Americas, undergoing conversion. Trinity officials are also starting to think about new development.
"We have locations where we can expand as of right, although we're not ready to say much about our plans yet," Mr. Palombi said. He said these rights would allow the company to add extra floors to existing buildings to produce new space.
"The way it would work is that you would empty out a building, strip it down to the frame and add new stories," Mr. Heyman said. "That way you could turn a 250,000-square-foot building into one with 500,000 square feet."

HEADLINE: Fill 'er Up? We Do.

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: LINDEN

 BODY:
IT'S just before 9 on a dazzling morning and the largest refinery on the East Coast is running full tilt, as it always is these days. The world's biggest catalytic cracker is cracking, crude and gas and diesel are surging through 675 miles of blue and gray pipe, the intermittent "psssht" of venting steam rises above the hum of compressor motors. And as Michael Karlovich, Bayway Refinery's head of community relations, stands on the deck of company headquarters admiring a surreal 300-foot-high skyline that looks like gargantuan thermos bottles and mixing bowls and flame-topped rocket-launching platforms, he is reminded of a recent conversation.
"We had some people from Liberty Science Center up here and one woman said, 'Is there a registry of national historic places that this is on?' I said I wish everybody else felt that way." 
 The fact that not everybody else does feel that way speaks volumes about New Jersey's love-hate relationship with its most visible industry and its crucial contribution to the region's economy. In Texas and Wyoming, they make a cultural fetish of their rigs and derricks. But New Jersey seems to be in a permanent state of apology for being home to the world's largest oil port -- of which Bayway, where on any given day there is enough gasoline on hand to drive a car to the sun and back 27 times, is only one part.
Every year, more than 28 billion gallons of petroleum in various forms flows in and out of the Port of New York, whose facilities are mostly in New Jersey. It sloshes in the holds of hundreds of town-sized tankers and thousands of barges that ply the Arthur Kill, rides on the backs of trains and trucks and rumbles along underground at 20 miles an hour through the eastern United States' largest oil pipeline, which ends a few hundred yards from Bayway's door.
And when it's not moving, of course, the stuff rests, in the big fat cylinders that make the flight approach to Newark International Airport look like an enormous checkerboard where white is beating the pants off black. In the northeast quarter of the state, mostly along the Arthur Kill, Newark Bay and the Hudson, Hackensack and Passaic rivers, roughly 700 king-size storage tanks hold more than 3 billion gallons of gas and oil awaiting processing or shipment all over New Jersey, New York, New England and Pennsylvania.
Just as important as New Jersey's capacity to move and store fuel is its capacity to make it. The state's six refineries -- besides Bayway, the others are a Hess plant in Woodbridge, a Chevron asphalt plant in Perth Amboy, and plants run by Mobil, Coastal and Citgo along the Delaware River near Paulsboro, south of Camden -- account about half of the Eastern Seaboard's refinery output.
And for the past 10 years, New Jersey's refineries have been getting busier. They now process about 30 million gallons of crude oil a day, up from 19 million a day in 1987 and more than enough to meet New Jersey's 25-million-gallon-a-day appetite for fuel if it all stayed in-state. Even with the increased production, though, refinery jobs, which pay top scale of about $20 an hour, are disappearing just as fast as other manufacturing jobs in New Jersey. The refineries now employ 5,200 people, down 23 percent since 1990 and down by more than half since 1919, when New Jersey was the nation's leading refinery employer.
Much of the increased production is at Bayway, whose parent company, the Tosco Corporation, has doubled processing capacity to 12 million gallons a day since it bought the plant from Exxon in 1992 for a paltry $157 million (Mr. Karlovich estimated the whole refinery would cost $2 billion to replace). Tosco, based in Stamford, Conn., has become one of the nation's biggest independent refiners by buying up refineries that others no longer find profitable.
The local refineries help keep fuel prices low in New Jersey, in part because they have to compete against imports that come into the Port of New York, which receives more than half of the nation's imported petroleum products, and against Gulf Coast refiners that use the Colonial Pipeline, which supplies more than half of the region's fuel and terminates in Linden. The main reason, though, for New Jersey's low prices at the pump, is the fact that the state has the nation's fourth-lowest gasoline tax.

'You Have to Burn Fuel to Make Fuel'
Of course there are drawbacks to this petrochemical wealth. The fourth-, fifth- and sixth-biggest polluters in the state are all oil refineries, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. The top three are all utility generating stations. In 1995, Bayway, ranked No. 5, belched out 5,092 tons of the ingredients that make smog, 551 tons of carbon monoxide and 1,208 tons of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain.
But the refineries pollute far less than they used to -- no more burnt-popcorn smell as you drive up the New Jersey Turnpike -- and, with considerable prodding from state regulators, they are continuing to improve.
"I don't think there's any single industry that's more environmentally conscious than we are," said John Maxwell, associate director of the New Jersey Petroleum Council.
Besides, said Ray Papalski, the supervising environmental specialist in the D.E.P.'s Bureau of Air Quality Planning: "Somebody's got to be the largest. These are big facilities that have a lot of employees and a lot of pieces of equipment and process a lot of product, and they do stuff that by its inherent nature causes air contaminants. You have to burn fuel to make fuel."
At Bayway, crude oil from any number of places, including the North Sea, South America and several African countries, is pumped off a tanker at the company's dock on the Arthur Kill. It travels two miles through pipes, under the turnpike to a tank field, where it is blended with other types of crude and piped to a furnace.
There, it is boiled at about 650 degrees and sent to a distillation tower. The resulting vapors rise to the top of the tower, and as each of the compounds that make up the crude cools below its boiling point, it condenses to a liquid and flows down through a series of trays. Heavier components with higher boiling points -- asphalt, fuel oil, jet fuel, diesel, heating oil, and the raw ingredients of rubber and plastic -- condense first and flow to lower levels. Lighter products -- gasoline components and lighter-than-air gases like propane and butane -- collect higher up.
The black, arm-like sidepipes that reach out of the tower at regular intervals pull the components off and send them on their way. Some, such as jet fuel, require no further processing and proceed directly to storage tanks. Others require more processing.
Because the demand for gasoline, compared to other petroleum products, is much greater than the supply that naturally occurs from distillation, some of the heavier components are sent on to the catalytic cracking unit, commonly known as the cat cracker. In the cracker, long, heavy oil molecules are bombarded with a finely powdered, 1,300-degree catalyst that breaks them into smaller molecules of gasoline or light heating oil.
"It's like a big kitchen," Mr. Karlovich said. "We're heating, we're cooling, we're mixing, we're blending, changing things from ingredients to finished product." The journey from the crude ship to the gasoline storage tank takes about four days.
The finished product is liable to wind up just about anywhere in the Northeast. BP, Getty and Amoco tanker trucks fill up at Bayway's rack with custom-blended gasoline. Barges pick up heating oil and haul it to tank farms on Long Island or bring it to New Haven Harbor, where it is distributed throughout New England.
And much of Bayway's product is delivered to the Buckeye Pipeline's Linden station, which connects to pipelines at the Station Manifold, a mansion-sized labyrinth of pipes and almost 800 valves. The Buckeye receives fuel from the Bayway and Hess refineries, a handful of storage terminals, the Colonial Pipeline and the Harbor Pipeline along the Delaware Bay, and sends it as far west as Pittsburgh and Buffalo. Buckeye also pumps fuel under the Hudson to New York City and pipes jet fuel to Newark, Kennedy and La Guardia airports.
Storage terminals or tank farms, which make up much of the visible oil landscape in New Jersey, come in two varieties: those owned by an oil company that supply a single brand fuel, and those that rent out storage space to oil distributors and are essentially fuel warehouses. The 17-tank Amoco Terminal in Carteret, for instance, which fills 100 Amoco trucks a day and dispatches barges across the Arthur Kill to Staten Island or up the river to Mount Vernon, often takes deliveries from the independent G.A.T.X. terminal across the street.
"If you decide you want to go into business and you want to buy 130,000 barrels of product coming in from, say, Venezuela," said Amoco's terminal manager, Lou Romano, "you call up G.A.T.X., they store it for you and ship it out based on your instructions."
One drawback of the enormous concentration of oil tanks in the harbor is the small but ever-present risk of sabotage or attack. "It's one of those unquestioned questions," Mr. Romano said. "Everybody knows where they are; you can't hide them. We do have alerts when there are heightened tensions between the U.S. and other countries. Otherwise, it's a concern but not an overriding factor."

How to Make Money In a Competitive Market
For Tosco, operating an oil refinery in the middle of the world's biggest petroleum market has its pros and cons. Obviously, it cuts transportation costs to be where the customers are. But the endless supply coming in on tankers from Europe, barges from the Gulf of Mexico and the Colonial Pipeline means prices must be kept low. At the same time, electricity in Texas costs half of what it does here, Mr. Maxwell of the New Jersey Petroleum Council said, and labor -- the Bayway refinery has 950 employees -- is considerably cheaper.
Then there is added cost of doing business in New Jersey, which has some of the nation's strictest air regulations. And there is the ongoing problem of silt buildup in the harbor, which keeps out bigger tankers and forces many boats to unload some cargo at sea in order to become light enough to make it into the harbor. (Tosco got tired of waiting for the silt problem to be solved and commissioned a fleet of extra-wide tankers that hold 20 percent more than a conventional tanker of the same draft.)
All of this has meant that Tosco has had to be lean and mean, and it has. In the process, industry analysts say, Tosco is making about 12 percent profit off a refinery that lost money for Exxon. "Tosco's purchase of that refinery was good news for New Jersey, for Tosco, and for Exxon," said Fredrick Leuffer, an analyst with Bear Stearns.
The only people who do not seem completely thrilled are the members of Teamsters Local 877. Tosco renegotiated the union contract when it took over and, according to the local president, Curt Greder, got rid of about 100 workers.
"They basically trashed our contract," Mr. Greder said. "They try to make the contract as vague as they possibly can, eliminate work rules so they have a more or less free hand in dealing with labor. That allows them to hold the sword of Damocles over you and make you hope they don't do anything else."
Labor relations notwithstanding, Bayway takes great pains to maintain its public image and cope with the headaches that come with running a mammoth factory along the state's main road.
Earlier this year, as part of its effort to improve the plant's esthetics, Bayway began dismantling a rusting 50-foot-high propane storage sphere just beyond the Turnpike fence. Not long after, Mr. Karlovich said, the company got a call from a state trooper who said the Governor wanted to know if there was anything wrong.
Mr. Karlovich is particularly annoyed that Bayway's $22 million wet gas scrubber, which vents clouds of water vapor -- not smoke -- as it pulls waste gas and dust particles out of the emission stream, has somehow managed to become the news industry's stock shot of New Jersey pollution. "It's like a hex on us," he said. "Every time there's some kind of chemical calamity or pharmaceutical scandal, they show our scrubber."
Mr. Karlovich pointed out on a tour that Bayway's sprawling property -- at 2.1 square miles, it is roughly twice the size of Hoboken -- includes a lot more than pipes and towers. There are three named streams -- Peach Orchard Brook, West Brook and Morses Creek -- a reservoir, a modest birch forest, the Morse family's 18th-century burial ground, and a surprising amount of wildlife even in the most barren-looking places. A snow-white egret pecks along the gravel-lined banks of a cooling-water return channel. Geese and goslings swim in the rain puddles that pool in old tank pits. Cormorants sun their wings in the reservoir.
One place where Bayway does not need to improve its image is in Linden itself, where the company is the biggest taxpayer and one of the few remaining industrial employers. It is also so active in the city's civic life that it received a state Good Neighbor award last week.
"They've been very generous to our cultural heritage committee and our Golden Gloves boxing program," said the longtime Mayor, John Gregorio. "And anytime anything happens out there, they call us immediately and let us know."
Last December, the refinery released a cloud of oily soot that settled on cars and houses. The next day, Bayway hired power-washers to clean off roofs and porches and offered free car washes to all those affected.
Mr. Gregorio, who is 70, said he did not think the refinery was an environmental hazard. "The oldest citizens we have live in Tremley Point, right in the middle of the tank fields," he said. "I don't suspect the people in Linden are being hurt at all by any of the industry here."
And as for the thick refinery smell that once permeated the town, Mr. Gregorio said those days appeared to be gone for good.
"I don't smell anything," he said. "Besides, the prevailing winds go east, so Staten Island would get the smell if there was any."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Make the Modern Modern? How Very Rash!

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
MODERN ART IS BETTER than ever! At least, it's just as scary. This is the awful truth disclosed by Rem Koolhaas's proposal for the expansion of the Museum of Modern Art's midtown campus. Youthful, even bratty, shimmering with bright new ways to frighten the horses, Koolhaas's design would literally burst the old Modern apart at the seams.
The design could destroy the place, and possibly save it. Koolhaas's proposal can be glimpsed, but barely, in an exhibition now in the museum's top-floor galleries of architecture and design. "Toward the New Museum of Modern Art: Sketchbooks by 10 Architects" presents the results of the first round in the competition to design the expansion. Koolhaas, at one time regarded as a leading contender for the commission, did not place among the three finalists. 
 The three proposals, all as tasteful as table water biscuits, are by Pierre Herzog and Jacques de Meuron of Switzerland, Yoshio Taniguchi of Japan and Bernard Tschumi of New York. A winner will be chosen by the end of the year. As the show's title suggests, these are not fully worked-out designs but concepts, some quite rough in form.
Koolhaas presented his proposal in the form of a nearly 400-page hard-bound book. Like "S, M, L, XL," the massive tome Koolhaas brought out in 1995, this volume is a stylish production that reproduces the texture of an architect's thought. Sketches, hard-line drawings, photomontages, images of models, renderings, philosophical musings, jokes visual and verbal, are organized with a cinematic sense of pace.
At the museum, unfortunately, Koolhaas's book is displayed behind glass; visitors can't peruse its contents. As much a philosophical critique of the museum as a plan for its physical enlargement, the book deserves wider circulation. In years to come, many will look back on it as the Modern that could have been.
Koolhaas begins by reviewing the museum's history and analyzing its present situation. This makes for a sweet and sour show-and-tell. With deftly chosen images and quotations from the museum's founders, Koolhaas evokes the days when the Modern was new and its novelty stood in sharp contrast -- philosophically and architecturally -- to the world around it.
The contrast has grown fuzzy. Instead of a crisp frame enclosing intimate galleries, the museum is now an unfocused blur. As Koolhaas puts it: "The old part of MOMA is shabby. The new part of MOMA is tacky." He supports these views with color pictures that coolly capture the museum's physical shortcomings.
Koolhaas's design does not propose to restore the museum to its original purity. Nor does he rail against the museum's fall from artistic purity. He takes as a given that the Modern has many functions other than esthetic contemplation. It sells watches. It throws parties. It courts the media. It makes deals. These functions, Koolhaas believes, could be architecturally expressed.
A garden surrounds Koolhaas's museum. To create it, he takes a can opener to the existing buildings on West 53d Street and slices off the ground floor, turning them into a floating slab. On the West 54th Street side, Koolhaas sinks Philip Johnson's much-loved sculpture garden, intact, to basement level, allowing visual contact between the garden and the street. At the eastern end of the garden, now occupied by the museum restaurant, Koolhaas places what he calls the Forum. This he envisions as a Miesian "universal space" enclosed by glass, to be used for lectures, concerts, conferences, temporary shows and social events.
The museum's six curatorial departments -- offices for curators, support staff, preparers -- would be based, one department per floor, in the original museum building, designed by Edward Durell Stone and Philip L. Goodwin, and completed in 1939. A new seven-story tower for administrative offices would be built atop Johnson's 1964 addition, the site of the present bookstore. Koolhaas calls this tower "MOMA Inc.," as if the museum were an industry whose chief product is cultural prestige.
The museum's main galleries would be contained within a new six-story building, to the west of Cesar Pelli's 1985 residential Museum Tower. It would run the full block, from 53d to 54th Street. Atop this generic box, Koolhaas proposes to plant a slim 16-story triangular spire, its shape and dimensions conforming to the zoning envelope of allowable development the museum would acquire by tearing down the Dorset Hotel. A multi-use structure, the triangle would contain study centers, private viewing rooms, restaurants.
Koolhaas conceives these structures as episodes in an architectural narrative. Or call it a flow chart, a diagram of circulation. Money and power, accumulated by MOMA Inc., are converted into energy that is channeled into the curatorial departments. Here, artifacts are selected, then hauled out of storage and put on public display.
Just as the 1939 building derived its esthetic from industrial architecture, so Koolhaas proposes, in effect, a factory for the post-industrial city, an urban center geared for the manufacture of culture. Inside the building, Koolhaas proposes to make visible other museum operations that are ordinarily screened from view. Circulation -- of artworks and people -- gets big play here.
IN PLACE OF THE SHOPPING MALL escalators in Pelli's garden hall, Koolhaas proposes a grand moving staircase. He includes, as well, provisions for a new mode of transport. Developed by Otis, the Odyssey transport system is a cross between an elevator and a funicular tram. The same car can move vertically, horizontally and diagonally.
Some design elements extend familiar Koolhaas preoccupations. His esthetic has been described as a synthesis of Miesian classicism and the romantic imagery of Wallace K. Harrison; both sources are in evidence here. The architect's renderings of the museum's interiors echo the photomontages Mies himself devised for several museum projects. The triangle and square tower recall Harrison's pairings of different forms, like the Trylon and Perisphere, or the General Assembly and Secretariat Buildings at the United Nations Headquarters. Like Koolhaas's Piranesian Space at the Chunnel station in the French city of Lille, the Odyssey system expresses Koolhaas's weakness for technologically assisted disorientation.
Koolhaas's vertical forms hark back to the "culture of congestion," the theme of his legendary 1978 book, "Delirious New York." Unlike the other proposals, Koolhaas's design for the Modern actually embraces the Museum Tower instead of ignoring it. You get the sense that he'd want to put a residential high-rise on the site even if one weren't already there, and that just like Pelli, Koolhaas would also clad it with a glass skin inspired by Mondrian.
This plan is not easy to love. It doesn't begin to be elegant. It lacks the grace of formal simplicity. With or without Harrison as precedent, Koolhaas's vertical forms don't rhyme in the mind. His cutaway ground floor brings to mind the gloomy space beneath the floating garden slab of Lever House. His sunken garden will elicit shudders of recognition from those who've suffered the damp sculpture moat at the Whitney. The whiffs of technology, like the automated painting retrieval system, summon forth memories of French rinky-dink modernism from the 1960's.
And then Koolhaas has such a cheeky attitude. MOMA Inc., indeed. Trustees support art museums to bestow gentility upon money, power and social ambition, not to have the mask ripped away. Koolhaas rubs in his social commentary with images of stuffy Gilded Age dinner parties, complete with crystal chandeliers. In one collage, a seated woman turns a cold shoulder to a Matisse. The woman is Jessica Mitford, as depicted on the jacket of her book "The American Way of Death."
Because of these and other digs, some people have interpreted Koolhaas's submission as a sendup of the competition rather than a serious bid to win it. As those who've heard the architect lecture will recognize, however, this is just the way Koolhaas thinks. Here, in what is, after all, a sketchbook, prepared in less than a month, Koolhaas is simply thinking out loud.
His jokes are serious, and on target. The chandeliers and the Stanford White dinner party are visual shorthand for the overbred curatorial intelligence that has often haunted the halls of the Museum of Modern Art -- including this competition. Isn't this, more or less, what the finalists propose to give us: polite Gilded Age dinner spaces, reclad in the International Style?
WHY INVITE KOOLHAAS to the party and expect him to be anything less than Koolhaas? Nothing in his proposal should surprise anyone who has leafed through "S, M, L, XL." Isn't anyone at the Modern curious to see where Koolhaas might take his ideas? Yet the truth is that to make something successful from this proposal would take a client with more strength of will than the Modern is presently able to muster. It would take a client with the capacity to think yes and no simultaneously: Yes, your mind is working. No, you may not sink our garden into the basement. No, you can't cut away the ground floor. You may not use robots. Cut the cute stuff about MOMA Inc. Nix the chandeliers. Can the Odyssey. Got any more ideas?
If Koolhaas ever was a favored contender for this project, it was not because he was best known of the 10 architects, or because he was hot, or because he had put out an 800-pound book, all of which happen to be true. He was favored because no architect had a more focused view of the post-industrial city and of architecture's role in its cultural development.
As his attempts to wed Mies and Harrison suggest, Koolhaas collapses dualistic ways of thinking. His esthetic probes the lines that allegedly separate reason and folly, subjectivity and objectivity, world and dream. It seeks relationships more complex, in other words, than the simple old-versus-new opposition embodied in the Museum of Modern Art's original design.
Even the old Modern, however, challenged one of Western culture's most vexing dualisms, the one between art and life. That's why the architecture and design department was created. It's easy to overlook how successful the department's mission turned out to be: not in remaking the world according to the tenets of Good Design, but rather (like Duchamp or Warhol) in calling into question the difference between art and other things.
The culture has taken that idea and run with it, leaving the Modern behind in the dust of a concept it pioneered. The Koolhaas proposal, even in unbuilt form, clears away the dust. Rude, brash, aiming a deflationary arrow at our willingness to puff milquetoast as risky, his proposal slaps the museum awake from a deep post-modern slumber.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ASTORIA;
Putting Damper on Housing In Former Steinway Factory

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
A developer's plan to convert the old Steinway piano factory in Astoria into a 275-unit rental building was defeated recently after Community Board 1 rejected the proposal during a tumultuous public meeting.
The developer, Nikos Kefalidis of Manhattan, had asked the board to rezone the building, at 45th Street and Ditmars Boulevard, to residential from commercial. 
 He said he planned to finance the $30 million conversion through a city-sponsored program that grants low-interest loans to developers who set aside at least 20 percent of units for low-income residents.
Mr. Kefalides said that his rezoning request will go to the City Council for a vote but that without community board support there is virtually no chance it will be approved. "It is zoned for manufacturing," he said, "so I will put something appropriate in its place."
"I don't care if they put in a crematorium or a chicken slaughterhouse in its place," said the president of the Astoria/Ditmars Homeowners and Tenants Civic Association, Rudy Sarchese. "We won't put up with an apartment house."
Mr. Sarchese and other residents complained that the building, intended for an estimated 400 dwellers, would ruin the flavor of their middle-class neighborhood of one- and two-family homes. "Astoria already bears its fair share of problems," Mr. Sarchese said, citing congestion from La Guardia Airport and Rikers Island, both nearby, as well as overcrowded schools and a lack of parking. "How much are we supposed to take? No more."
The crumbling six-story brick factory, built in 1901 by the Steinway family, has been empty for six years. Its most recent tenant was Stern's department store, which used it as a furniture warehouse.
Community Board 1's chairman, Vinicio Donato, said Mr. Kefalidis had promised to give the elderly priority for the low-income apartments. Mr. Donato and the board's district manager, George Delis, said that although most board members thought the rezoning and conversion would benefit the area because of the opportunity for more housing for the elderly, they voted 25 to 6 against the plan after 600 people, many shouting their opposition to the plan, attended the board meeting on June 4.
"The community board members gave the people what they wanted," Mr. Delis said. "But they voted out of fear. We all know the greatest need in this community is senior housing."
Queens, which has absorbed many immigrants to the city in the last decade, has an apartment vacancy rate of 3 percent, compared with 4 percent citywide, according to the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
Mr. Kefalidis, a Greek imigrant who settled in Astoria 20 years ago, said he thought objections to his plan centered not on overcrowding but bigotry. "It's an old argument," he said. "These people are afraid that welfare families would move in. They don't want people with dark skin or the last name "Rivera" living in their neighborhood."
Mr. Sarchese denied that assertion. "There's no racial overtone to this at all," he insisted. "Not at all." CHARLIE LeDUFF

Coming to a Laggard's Aid

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
The $2.2 billion Vanguard Explorer fund is changing its management structure after a couple years of disappointing performance.
Effective Aug. 1, the current managers, Wellington Management and Granahan Investment Management, will manage roughly 60 to 70 percent of the portfolio. The balance will be divided evenly between two new advisers: Chartwell Investment Partners and Vanguard Core Management Group. 
 Chartwell was founded in April by former employees of the Delaware Management Company. It is led by Edward N. Antoian, former manager of the Delaware Trend and Delaware Delcap funds.
Vanguard Core Management will use a quantitative, or computer-based, approach to choose stocks that approximate a new small-company growth fund stock index constructed by Morningstar Inc. That index will be adopted as a benchmark for the fund, replacing the Russell 2000 index.
"We have a high degree of confidence that these four advisers in concert will improve the fund's performance," said John J. Brennan, Vanguard's president. Vanguard will also use stock futures to keep the fund more fully invested while allowing it to keep cash on hand for redemptions.
 
Sticker Shock On the Internet
Mutual fund companies are rushing to set up Internet sites in hopes of gaining an edge in a crowded marketplace. But the costs can be staggering, according to a recent report by Forrester Research, a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass.
The report, "Transaction Site Sticker Shock," analyzed the cost of setting up and delivering financial services over the Internet. For its cost models, Forrester interviewed executives at 31 financial institutions whose Internet sites allow transactions, and it gathered cost information from site developers, systems integrators, software and hardware vendors and content providers.
The study found that combined start-up and first-year costs could run $5 million to $23 million a site, depending on the services offered.
A basic site that provides account information and permits financial transactions, like that of the Gabelli funds, is at the low end of the cost scale. Sales sites intended to attract new customers and high volume could cost $17 million initially. An example of such a program is that of Charles Schwab & Company.
Looking ahead, Forrester said that an advisory site with a high degree of individual attention, aimed at affluent customers and providing a wide range of personalized financial advice, would cost upward of $23 million. The company said that while no sites were now offering such a level of services, it expects big brokerage firms and large banks to begin doing so.
"Over time, I would expect the costs to continue to go up," said Karen Epper, author of the report.
 
New Managers
American Century Investments has made a series of manager changes to its American Century group of funds. John Schniedwind, a senior vice president for equity research, and Kurt Borgwardt, director of quantitative research, are the new lead managers for the Income and Growth fund, succeeding Dong Hao Zhang, who left the company. Mr. Zhang had also managed Equity Growth, which goes to Jeffrey Tyler, who will remain lead manager on the American Century Strategic Asset Allocation funds, and William Martin, who has served on the management teams for two American Century funds.
Mr. Borgwardt and Mr. Schniedwind will also take over American Century Utilities; it was previously run by Steven L. Colton, who had also been manager of the American Century Income and Growth and Equity Growth funds until last year.
Mr. Zhang will join Mr. Colton at Phoenix Duff & Phelps, where they will manage a new growth and income fund.
 
New Funds
The Victory Real Estate Investment fund aims for a high level of income and moderate long-term capital growth by investing in real estate investment trusts and publicly traded companies that own a variety of commercial properties, including shopping centers, apartments and office buildings.
Munder Capital Management has started three life style funds, which invest in a mix of the company's stock, bond and money market portfolios. The All-Season Maintenance fund seeks current income; All-Season Development aims for high total return by combining capital appreciation and current income, and All-Season Accumulation aims for long-term capital appreciation. The sales charge is 5.5 percent.
 
On the Web
Oppenheimer Funds has opened a World Wide Web site offering facts about the company and its products, daily net asset values and monthly performance for more than 40 funds. (www.oppenheimerfunds.com). Shareholders and advisers can review account transactions and balances; the site's interactive features include financial planning work sheets, and retirement and college planning calculators.
 
Openings and Closings
Putnam New Opportunities, opened in 1990, will close to new investors after June 23. Participants in 401(k) and other retirement plans and shareholders who make systematic investments will still be able to buy shares.
Oppenheimer Enterprise, which has been closed since March 29, 1996, has reopened the door.

Developer's Big Plans Have Seen Ups and Downs

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
In 1982, David Walentas was well on his way to creating an office and entertainment colossus on the sleepy Brooklyn waterfront between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. The developer, 42 at the time, bought up a half dozen buildings and won city and state designation as the developer for the site.
Mr. Walentas's vision was big. Wall Street back offices would occupy more than two million square feet of new office space, visitors would survey the lower Manhattan skyline from a 330-foot observation tower and a luxury marina would hold 100 boats. 
 But in 1984, the city derailed Mr. Walentas's dream. Ruling that Mr. Walentas did not have sufficient financial backing for the project, officials removed him as the official developer. Mr. Walentas accused the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, Kenneth Lipper, of trying to destroy the project out of revenge.
In 1977, J. Frederick Byers, Mr. Walentas's business partner and Mr. Lipper's friend, had killed himself by jumping out a window of his Upper East Side apartment. Mr. Walentas said the Deputy Mayor blamed him for the suicide and had derailed the project to get back at him. Mr. Lipper dismissed the charge, saying that Mr. Walentas was being held to the same standards as any developer. Whatever the motives, Fulton Landing was dead.
Mr. Walentas's failure sparked a new push by the Brooklyn Heights Association and other groups for a park along the waterfront. After nearly a decade of lobbying, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo backed the creation of a Brooklyn Bridge Park during the 1994 gubernatorial campaign. But when Mr. Cuomo lost the election, the proposal died, too. Mr. Walentas, who had been waiting for a resurgence in the real-estate market, dusted off his plan. DAVID ROHDE

HEADLINE: The Wedding Gown: Revealing the Nation's Mood

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE GUTMANN 

 BODY:
IT may happen in the fitting room of a tony bridal salon or in a designer's atelier, or even in a mother's sewing room amid a sea of pins and pattern paper: There is a moment when the bride, after a long search and many false leads, first puts on The Dress, the one she realizes she will wear when she is married. "Usually somebody's crying in the room," said Rachel Leonard, the fashion editor of Brides magazine. "Your mother, your friend, even the bridal consultant."
The moment, Ms. Leonard said, has something to do with being plucked from ordinary life and suddenly becoming a symbol -- set apart but also connected in a long chain with one's mother, grandmothers and brides everywhere. 
 There is something iconic about the bride, but the actual elements of that image have shifted over the years. Wedding gowns have not always looked, as a character in the film "Four Weddings and a Funeral" put it, like "a big meringue," with bouffant skirt and clouds of tulle.
In the giddy 1920's, for example, a perfectly respectable wedding dress was short and straight, reflecting that decade's exuberance and fashion upheaval. Bustlines and natural waists disappeared under sacklike sheaths, and as compensation, shocking expanses of leg were revealed as wedding dresses shot up.
"New York Gets Married: Dressing for a Special Day, 1765-1997," at the Museum of the City of New York until Sept. 21, chronicles such shifting styles, in wedding pictures, memorabilia and, of course, dresses. There are 40 of them, from the Empire-waisted gowns of the early 19th century to the cacophony of styles of the 1990's.
Bridal gowns are always, Ms. Leonard said, a "reflection of the economic and social climate, the popular culture and fashion of the day."
 Some moments in history.
 
Age of Innocence
The bridal image has not always been white. Wedding dresses were virtually any color in the 1800's, said Phyllis Magidson, the curator of "New York Gets Married."
"It was simply the best dress your family had to offer, meant to be worn at special occasions thereafter," she said. A very wealthy woman might have her gown made at Maison Worth in Paris, where a dress could cost as much as a middle-class person's salary for a year, but for most people, Ms. Magidson added, "wearing something that was specifically and solely intended to be worn for the wedding -- the concept that we have of being a fairy princess -- is a fairly contemporary perception."
Queen Victoria's wedding in 1840 was the 19th-century equivalent of Lady Diana Spencer's extravaganza in 1982, and Victoria just happened to get married in white because she wanted her gown trimmed with a particularly rich lace. Her wedding-picture engravings were so widely circulated that the public began to associate white with weddings, Ms. Magidson said.
One may think of the speedy knockoff as a recent phenomenon, but at the turn of the century there were two developments -- the camera and the department store with its glass window -- that brought the dresses of the rich to the attention of the public. That helped move the concept of wedding dress from "best dress" to the modern state of pure costume, says Anne Hollander, author of the fashion history "Seeing Through Clothes" (Viking, 1978).
But even for the wealthy, it was considered socially acceptable to wear one's wedding dress for special occasions. In "The Age of Innocence" by Edith Wharton, which was set in the late 1800's, May Archer asks her new husband what to wear to a reception. He suggests her wedding dress, and she exclaims: "If only I had it here! But it's gone to Paris to be made over for next winter, and Worth hasn't sent it back."
 
Of Wally and War
Another flurry of wedding dress activity occurred in 1937, when Edward VIII abdicated his throne to marry Wallis Warfield Simpson. The populace swooned over this great romance -- and tried to get a piece of it by knocking off her $250 Mainbocher wedding ensemble, a form-fitting day dress. A newspaper article of the time, with the headline "The Descent of the 'Wally' Gown -- From Paris to New York's 14th Street in Six Weeks," traced the path of the dress, noting its appearance at "a swank shop on Fifth Avenue for $25" and at "Klein's Cash and Carry on 14th Street for $8.90" several days later.
But the 1940's put a stop to wedding dress excitement. Citizens were asked to conserve raw materials for the boys overseas. Though the United States did not adopt garment rationing as Britain did, the Government asked manufacturers to keep silhouettes lean and to avoid frills; most complied. A wedding was also likely to be rushed, so a bride might stand next to her soldier groom wearing something ordinary, tailored and Rosalind Russell-esque.
Armistice Day provided an unleashing of sartorial extravagance. "Women were feeling romantic because the men were home, and they were eager to get out of their Rosie the Riveter overalls," Ms. Magidson said. With a population ready to dress up, designers ended up pillaging "everything from the royal bag of tricks," Ms. Magidson added. "Boned and standing collars, puffed and melon sleeves, very full skirts, extended trains, even the crown gets resurrected."
 
Modern Brides
Compared with the relatively uneventful and sober 50's -- a time of bouffant gowns, narrow waists and full skirts -- the late 60's and early 70's were about rejection of tradition.
"The girls really didn't want wedding dresses at all," recalled Monica Hickey, the director of Custom/Couture Bridal at Saks Fifth Avenue, who served as a bridal consultant at Bergdorf Goodman in the 70's. "But most of them succumbed because Grandmother would cut them out of the will if they didn't."
Still, the ambivalence was expressed with "nonwedding wedding dresses." "I did barefoot brides in beautiful dresses from India in natural linen with beads and colored crewel work," Ms. Hickey said, "and dresses from Mexico that were all short and perky. We did a window at Bergdorf's where the bride was in this Indian embroidery and bare feet, holding sheaves of wheat. We were paying court to the hippies; rich hippies, anyway."
In the 80's, when ambivalence about wealth disappeared, the lavish wedding dress of great skirts and trains came into style, a trend crowned by what Ms. Hickey calls "the last great show on earth" -- the wedding of Lady Diana to the Prince of Wales. Elizabeth and David Emanuel's billowing creation, with its endless train (known as "cathedral length" because it suits the scale and pageantry of a big church wedding), "set up the idea that you spend an enormous amount of money on something that has nothing to do with the rest of your life so you can look like that for that moment," Ms. Hollander said. (Ms. Emanuel will introduce her new bridal collection in a trunk show on June 23 and 24 at Saks Fifth Avenue.)
What does the bride of the 90's look like? These days, "it's every man for himself," Ms. Hollander added, noting the diversity of designs.
Vera Wang, who opened shop on Madison Avenue and 77th Street in 1990, excised the frou-frou wedding cake embellishment and streamlined the shape. Now, top fashion designers who have tended to avoid bridal collections have jumped into the pool. Last year, Giorgio Armani started his first bridal-wear collection with such nontraditional outfits as tightly-fitted jacket and slit-skirt combinations, or tuxedo coat with mandarin collar, and a price range of $6,000 to $20,000. And at the same time, the team of Mark Badgley and James Mischka began a bridal collection that resembles elegant evening wear.
This season's bride won't necessarily wear white. Erisa Yuki is still doing gowns in black, and one of Ms. Wang's best sellers is pale sea green. The gown of a 90's bride might have corsetlike ties at the back or boning that seems taken from lingerie, or it might be trimmed with cowrie shells like the Afrocentric gowns of Therez Fleetwood.
Industry wide, the 90's bride is "more naked," said Ms. Wang, who is largely responsible for getting her that way with her plunging backs and cutout waists. (Her line costs $2,500 to $6,000.) Narciso Rodriguez showed lots of skin with a bias-cut slip dress for Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy that has been widely imitated.
One of Ms. Wang's best sellers is slim and columnar, with a fantail train that suggests an old-fashioned bustle. But at the same time, designers are also seeing a desire for "pomp and circumstance," said Ms. Wang, whose line includes the traditional bell skirt that still captures the popular imagination.
Ms. Wang said this redirection was about "the desire to be more bridal and more grand, more not like everyday life." And perhaps to be part of that great chain linking mother, grandmother and brides everyone.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Plymouth Breeze, Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Contour;
The Return of Detroit's 'Low Priced Three'

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB

 BODY:
DID somebody say "value"? With auto makers from Hyundai to Mercedes repeating that word like a mantra, its definition has grown fuzzy. But for many new-car shoppers of limited means, a good value means the biggest car for the money.
The three brands represented on this page, Chevrolet, Ford and Plymouth, were conceived as purveyors of high-value transportation, and they filled that role neatly for decades. Well into the 1960's they were the "Low Priced Three," the first rung up the automotive ladder for working people who wanted a roomy, reliable, economical car, with perhaps a little style thrown in. Over time, the three broadened their offerings and blurred that image, which brand-driven marketers are now trying to reclaim. 
 That strategy leans heavily on these cars: front-drive sedans that fit between Chevy's Cavalier and Lumina, between Ford's Escort and Taurus, between the Plymouth Neon and Chrysler's standard-size sedans like the Dodge Intrepid. The Chevy Malibu, Ford Contour and Plymouth Breeze are big enough for small families, easy on gasoline and generally well-behaved, but they are not as nimble as their smaller siblings, which also have more personality than these bland utilitarian sedans.
They are products of compromise, since they are aimed at a broad swath of the public but must inhabit a narrow price niche starting around $15,000. They have tight, solid bodies, but they can be noisy. With their standard four-cylinder engines they come close to being underpowered.
For any of these cars, consider a bigger, optional engine. Quieter, peppier V6's are available on the Contour (about $1,200) and Malibu (a bargain at $395), at little cost in fuel economy. A Breeze buyer should definitely spend an extra $450 for a 2.4-liter four cylinder; the standard 2-liter (the Neon's smallest engine) is inadequate for this car. The similar Dodge Stratus can be ordered with a 2.5-liter V6.
For this comparison I drove basic four-cylinder models with popular equipment: automatic transmissions and power windows, locks and mirrors. Air-conditioning is optional on the Contour but standard on the Breeze and Malibu, which also throws in anti-lock brakes.
With competition fierce in this segment, any buyer should be able to deal. (Current rebates include $1,000 on the Breeze and $500 on the Contour.) And there are plenty of other worthy competitors, from the smaller Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla to the Nissan Altima, which is being redesigned for 1998, and the Mazda 626. Still, the Big Three are getting ever better at making high-value sedans, as these three cars demonstrate:
 
A Rock-Solid Plymouth
The Plymouth Breeze feels relatively big and decidedly American, the opposite of the smaller, European-feeling Contour. Owners of traditional full-size cars will be most at home in the Plymouth's spacious cabin.
The Breeze is a plainer version of the Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus, and, like them, it is a triumph of cab-forward design. With the wheels moved out toward the corners, the cabin offers impressive room for five adults, though rear headroom is just adequate, and the trunk is spacious.
And the Breeze looks nice, with clean, modern lines and jazzy graphics. Inside, there are few frills, but nothing feels cheap: The controls are where you want them; the console has a storage bin under a comfortable armrest, along with coin slots and cup holders; the cloth upholstery seems durable. (Think "Days Inn love seat"; the Malibu fabric is more "Motel 6 bedspread.")
The body feels as solid as Plymouth Rock. Still, vibration and harshness from the
drivetrain, coupled with a lack of insulation, make the cabin a loud place indeed. Road noise rumbles up and the engine roars when the transmission kicks down, which is often. Wind hissing at the side windows adds to the cacophony. Expansion strips in elevated pavement boom through.
The 2-liter engine can handle the air-conditioner, or it can move the Breeze briskly onto an expressway, but it struggles at both tasks at once. The car lacks torque at moderate speeds. The steering is somewhat numb, but the Breeze handles well in town and is a pleasant highway cruiser -- if you can stand the noise.
The Plymouth would benefit from other refinements. The headlamps cast a short, splotchy beam. An oval defroster panel struggles to cover the huge windshield, and on one wintry day the side windows never cleared. The side mirrors affixed to twin stalks do not flex, putting them in grave danger in cramped Manhattan garages.
The Breeze's brilliant concept is undermined by weak execution, with a drivetrain that doesn't measure up to the overall design and details that need more attention. As a result, the Plymouth comes up short against its better-balanced rivals.
 
INSIDE TRACK: Less than you may have bargained for.
 
A Chevy Without Apologies
For those who've so disdained G.M.'s small cars that they've stood at the car-rental counter pleading for something -- anything -- else, the Malibu's arrival is as welcome as springtime. Look beyond the bland styling, the unsupportive seats and a few tacky trim pieces and you'll find a practical car that works surprisingly well.
The 2.4-liter engine was the peppiest four-cylinder in this group, moving the car smartly from a stop and merging it neatly into traffic, and the four-speed automatic was the smoothest transmission. The engine is noisy, however, whining on acceleration.
Though it didn't track as true as the Breeze at 70 miles an hour, and it doesn't command winding roads like the Contour, the Malibu handled well. There was not a trace of "wheel hop" on rough pavement, and the Chevy inspired confidence on a twisting, rain-slick mountain road. Though not a car you would want to push hard, the Malibu remained unflappable when driven as fast as its buyers are likely to go.
Inside, a lot of thought went into the controls, which are well placed and operate smoothly. The ignition switch and trunk-release buttons are handy on the dash. The optional AM/FM/cassette stereo was the best in this group, both for its rich sound and for its excellent knobs and buttons. Ditto for the softly lit window, lock and mirror controls, perfectly situated at a slight angle on the driver's door.
A tachometer is standard, in contrast to the Contour, but sunny days produced glare on the instruments. There are useful storage spaces and a comfortable center armrest. The air vents include almost-face-high outlets on the windshield pillars.
Alas, this Cinderella has warts. The slippery steering wheel looks and feels cheap; the front seats are almost flat, with little side support. The back of the bottom cushion was thin and uncomfortable.
A strip of faux granite across the dashboard looked like Formica I rejected for my kitchen. Nearly everything that slides out or opens up was wobbly: A left-side cup holder is handy, but feels as cheap as a snap-together Batman toy. And like every other Malibu I've sat in, the center armrest in the test car jiggled like Jell-O at the touch.
There is room up front for almost anyone, and the back seat rivals the Breeze's, though it, too, is short on headroom. But the base model has no grab handles and the upholstery was thin; the rear armrest felt like a slab of foam wrapped in a sheet. The pop-out clothes hooks had a plastic-toy feel.
While the Malibu is devoid of personality, it is the most balanced, workmanlike car in this group. Its lack of panache puts me off -- G.M. marketers seem to think their target customers don't care about style -- and I can't imagine a Malibu in my own garage. But given its many features and low price, it may be the best deal for the budget-minded.
 
INSIDE TRACK: More than meets the eye.
 
The Taming of the Ford
The smallest car in this group, the Ford Contour, is the most agile. While the Breeze is an Interstate cruiser and the Malibu is a suburban runabout, the Contour is in its element in the city. With its compact dimensions and German manners, the Contour darts through traffic and brakes decisively.
Since it arrived as a '95 model, the Contour has been one of my favorite American sedans. One of the most engaging cars I drove last year was a bare-bones '96 with a stick shift, a $16,000 economy sedan posing as a low-budget BMW. Among the few things I'd have changed on that car was the stereo, with its infuriating rows of identical buttons (15 to 20, depending on the sound system). Adjusting the volume was distracting; setting a station could be hazardous.
Well, Ford has given the Contour and its fraternal twin, the Mercury Mystique, a makeover for 1998 -- they're on sale now -- and the old radio is still there, clunky as ever. What has changed are characteristics I'd have left alone: the suspension is softer, making the handling less crisp; the once-precise, on-center steering feels as if it has been injected with Novocaine; the driver's seat has a fold-down armrest, but it is too high even for a tall driver.
Ford still offers two excellent engines, the 2-liter Zetec four-cylinder, which now has variable cam timing for better economy and lower emissions, and a 2.5-liter Duratec V6. Either is happiest with the five-speed manual, which has a new cable shifter. The test car's Zetec-automatic combination had trouble handling the steep mountain road to my weekend house, a good test of a car's pulling ability. The Breeze also struggled, but the Malibu skittered up like a goat.
Since Ford now offers the high-performance Contour SVT for enthusiasts, it seems to have made run-of-the-mill Contours more mainstream, answering complaints of onetime Tempo owners who found the ride too harsh and the handling too direct. Indeed, the ride is smoother, though relatively new pavement on the Palisades Parkway made the car rock curiously from side to side.
The Ford leaned on turns and drifted in straight-ahead driving, requiring constant attention in moderate winds. The steering is heavy, and it conveyed less road feel than I'd like. The car bounced unpleasantly over bumps on the Tappan Zee Bridge.
After reviewing my notes on the '96 ("a hoot to drive, tracks straight, good on-center feel") I wondered if something about the '98 test car, like misinflated tires, was the culprit. A spin in a '98 Mystique indicated otherwise. That V6 model did handle better with its bigger 15-inch wheels, but its steering also felt numb and needed correcting.
Not that the '98 Contour is bad -- it's just not as sharp as before. Of this group, its body is the most rigid, its seats are the best, its rakish dash is the sportiest (though there is no tachometer on cheaper models). I still like the Contour, especially with a stick shift, but I liked the old one better.
 
INSIDE TRACK: A good car better left alone.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Sector Fund Quandary: Right Place, Wrong Time

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
JUST take note of what's hot and what's not -- that is the simple precept behind the trading of specialized stock funds.
Technology may be the market darling for a while, but then financial or health care or some other group of stocks grabs the lead. Surely, catching one of these waves early on will pay off. Or so people often think in their eagerness to graduate from the buy-and-hold school of investing, tried and true though it may be. 
 But so-called sector investing is not quite so simple in real life, as some who practice this type of trading have shown recently. Even though the stock market has been increasingly volatile this year -- smacking of opportunity for quick-draw McGraws -- the sector timers have failed to keep up with the broad market averages.
Select Timing Service, which advises subscribers when to buy and sell Fidelity Investments' sector funds through its Web site and E-mail, is doing poorly in this boom year for domestic stocks. Select Timing (reachable at www.dollarlink.com) eked out a 4.3 percent gain for the year, through June 10, compared with a 16.8 percent rise for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Factoring in transaction costs and sales charges would further reduce the service's return.
A rival portfolio recommended by All Star Funds Newsletter of Austin, Tex., was down 1.5 percent through June 6. Because Fidelity is the dominant company in sector funds, All Star also chooses among its funds.
Though both fund pickers assert that they have far better long-term records, their recent shortcomings expose the difficulty of jumping in and out of the right sectors at the right time in today's stock market.
"Markets are becoming more efficient," said Jack Bowers, who recommends sector shifts in Fidelity Monitor, a newsletter published in Rocklin, Calif. "Whereas in the past you could ride these momentum systems for a good four or five weeks, now it all happens in four or five days. This may ultimately become as difficult as doing market timing, and we all know how difficult that has become."
On the surface, sector rotation is an attempt to raise profits by anticipating changes in the business cycle, perhaps investing in auto stocks during a recession, when sales are weak, and selling them at their peak. Carried to its extreme, sector investing can mean trading not over the course of years or months, but of weeks or days or even hours.
NO matter the time period, sector trading is a cousin of market timing, which is the effort to anticipate big market moves by being heavily invested during market rallies and absent during routs.
Timing has been a largely futile exercise since the great bull market began in 1982. "Any strategy that called for anything other than being fully invested hasn't looked good," said Robert Markman, who operates a group of funds under his name from Minneapolis.
Sector rotation has scarcely done better of late. On their best day, proponents of the approach face practical problems:
* Funds that specialize in specific industries and stock sectors are relatively few in number. Fidelity has the broadest array of offerings, at 36, but even many of those are clustered in one sector, technology.
* Transaction costs can be high. For most people, Fidelity imposes a sales charge of 3 percent on its Select, or sector, funds, and a redemption fee of 0.75 percent of assets for shares held less than 30 days. A transaction fee of $7.50 also applies to exchanges or sales of these funds.
* Frequent trading leads to additional costs, like taxes on short-term capital gains. "It's not a tax-efficient strategy," said Ronald E. Rowland, editor of All Star Funds. "It's better for a tax-deferred account," like a retirement fund.
To avoid redemption fees, most sector timers use systems built around holding their fund shares at least 30 days. That restriction may be part of their problem, if Mr. Bowers is right about the shorter and shorter nature of stock cycles.
The ultimate problem, though, is not choosing sectors wisely. Stan Lekach, a mathematician with a statistical approach to investing who makes the choices at Select Timing in San Francisco, said his poor showing this year could be attributed entirely to one false move.
His methodology, based on spotting sudden upward moves in a sector's share prices, led him to recommend Fidelity Select Medical Delivery Fund in March, just before a spate of negative publicity depressed the price of Columbia/HCA Healthcare, one of the fund's biggest positions. "That fund dropped about 10 percent in two weeks," said Mr. Lekach, owner of Dollarlink Software, parent of the timing service. As a money manager, Mr. Lekach handles a scant $3 million in private accounts.
Furthermore, opportunities to exploit shifts in the relative fortunes of industrial sectors are shrinking. For one thing, swings in the business cycle have become progressively less extreme since the Depression, behaving like a pendulum winding down.
THE tendency toward short spurts of volatility has led Mr. Bowers to stop picking sectors based on their momentum. Instead of looking at what is moving up, he finds sectors with relatively low valuations. To do that, he compares an industry group's price-to-book ratio with its historical average. His model portfolio, which invests in multiple sectors at once, recently dropped the Fidelity Chemicals, Defense and Aerospace and Industrial Equipment funds, and added the Insurance, Health Care and Transportation funds.
This value approach, which has paid off in the overall stock market in recent days, has left Mr. Bowers in better stead than many sector rotators. His Fidelity Select portfolio had gained 10.8 percent as of June 10, lagging behind the S.& P. 500 by six percentage points.
But for the little guy, at least, buy and hold remains the investment strategy to beat.
"Unsophisticated investors are not going to be extremely successful doing sector rotation," said Charles Carlson, commentary editor of Dow Theory Forecasts, a newsletter in Hammond, Ind. "It's hard to be a trader."

HEADLINE: OFF THE RACK;
In These Ratings, Paradise Is in the Eye of the Beholder

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
THE July issues of Worth and Money magazines offer strikingly different snapshots of the "best" places to live in America. But some second and third thoughts may be in order before you start packing.
Worth's rating is focused on money, dependent solely on median home prices -- with the assumption that whatever else makes the living good will follow in the wake of wealth. Money's rankings are based on statistics and survey results in nine categories: the economy, health care, crime, affordable housing, education, weather, transportation, leisure activities and the arts. The results are sometimes quirky. 
 John Koten, Worth's editor, defended his magazine's second annual survey, "The Richest Towns," against reader criticism last year that such an article didn't belong in an investing magazine.
"Where to reside is one of the most important financial decisions anyone can make," Mr. Koten writes. "That means the towns we include are those that the market has, for one reason or another, deemed among the most desirable. They're valuable places to live because they provide connections to society's movers and shakers; because they're (usually) near places where fortunes are being made, and because they offer privacy, prestige and comfort. These are all things that help successful people become even more successful -- certainly one definition of a worthy investment."
Worth says the richest town is Matinecock, population 880, on the North Shore of Long Island. The town's median home price is $1.5 million and there are seven local country clubs. But don't rush to call your real estate agent; Worth says homes there rarely come on the market.
The others in the top 10, along with median home prices, are: Aspen, Colo., $1.4 million; Rolling Hills, Calif., $1.1 million; Centre Island, N..Y., $999,000; Snowmass Village, Colo., $975,000; Rancho Sante Fe, Calif., $970,000; Atherton, Calif., $967,500; Hillsborough, Calif., $931,500; Jupiter Island, Fla., $922,500, and Kapalua, on Maui in Hawaii, $900,000. These are all small places, ranging from a population of 12,300 in Rancho Santa Fe (yes, the site of the Heaven's Gate suicides) to 408 in Kapalua.
The list includes 238 towns -- wealthy areas of larger cities are not counted -- and the cutoff point for home value is $300,000.
Unlike the 1996 ratings, this year's do not take household income into account. States with the most rich towns are California, 78; New York, 55, and New Jersey, 24. Most of the high-priced real estate can be found near San Francisco (Silicon Valley money), Los Angeles (Hollywood megabucks) and New York (Wall Street wealth).
The whole exercise is a paean to money. The writer, Jane Berentson, senior editor of Worth, waxes enthusiastically that Aspen's home values get "a boost from wealthy celebrities, people like former Playboy cover girl Barbi Benton and her husband, George 'Mobile-Home King' Gradow."
Money magazine takes a broader, more statistical approach in "The Best Places to Live Today," by Carla Fried with Jeanhee Kim and Amanda Walmac. It ranks 300 towns, cities and areas, big and small.
The winner is Nashua, N.H., where a four-bedroom house costs $125,000 (and the property tax is $3,700), the unemployment rate is 2.3 percent and there is no sales tax or state and local income tax. The rest of the top 10, in order, are: Rochester, Minn.; Monmouth and Ocean Counties, N.J.; Punta Gorda, Fla.; Portsmouth, N.H.; Manchester, N.H.; Madison, Wis.; San Jose, Calif.; Jacksonville, Fla., and Fort Walton Beach, Fla.
Dead last on the list is Davenport, Iowa, and Money all but apologizes for it. "Residents feel their place is a pretty darn fine spot to live," the article says. But despite 42 miles of picturesque bike trails, six museums and three riverboat gambling casinos, the city still comes up short. The region's overall violent crime rate, an important factor in Money's poll of readers, is 27 percent higher than the national average. And it's a three-hour trek to Chicago for top restaurants and major league sports.
BUSY BANDWAGON The crowded field of personal-finance magazines is beginning to breed look-alikes -- at least on their covers. Forbes and Fortune, which have long had sections dealing with personal finance, appear to have joined the fray.
Forbes's June 16 issue, containing an annual investment guide, has a cover article on second careers as the key to successful retirement. The cover could have been designed by Money; the photograph shows an aerobics instructor going through her paces. No cigar-chomping cable-TV mogul here.
Fortune's June 23 cover has a teaser headline --"Nine Stocks to Bank On" -- that reads like it came from Smart Money's playbook. Even the venerable Economist, on its May 31-June 6 cover, features a cartoonlike drawing of a tax collector chasing a man with a cellular phone around a spinning globe. It illustrates an article titled"The Disappearing Taxpayer," about the difficulty of assessing and collecting taxes in a global, high-technology economy.
LISTEN UP, FED David Hackett Fischer, a professor of history at Brandeis University, argues in the July-August issue of Bloomberg Personal that the Federal Reserve is obsessed with inflation fears and runs the risk of prompting a world depression.
CREDIT WHERE DUE Kiplinger's and Money see bright spots for women in terms of credit and pensions. Kiplinger's notes that for the first time men and women who are business owners have about the same access to business capital, according to the Census Bureau and the National Foundation for Women Business Owners. Money says women could get bigger pensions under proposals in Congress, including one that would expand the so-called homemaker individual retirement account.
 
ON THE WEB Money's World Wide Web site (www.money.com) offers links to what it considers top Internet spots for information on stocks, mutual funds, financial calculators and the like. Smart Money, in its June Issue, had a cover on its 10 favorite Web sites, but they are not linked to a central site like Money's. Money articles and advice are also available on line through Compuserve.
 
BITS AND PIECES Smart Money's July issue rates discount brokers . . . . Individual Investor thinks it's time to jump back into some Japanese stocks. . . . Several magazines predict a pickup for bond prices in the second half of the year, along with a correction in stocks.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
A Threat to a Tax Break For College Employees

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
NEXT year, Christopher Anderson will be a senior at Ohio Wesleyan University, with a triple major in music, philosophy and 20th-century studies. With a grade-point average of nearly 3.8, he aspires to join the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.
Yet if it were not for a tax break that allows colleges and universities to give employees tax-free tuition assistance, he might not be able to afford Ohio Wesleyan at all. And that tax provision is now under attack in Washington. 
 Mr. Anderson's mother, Pamela B. Anderson, a purchasing assistant at the school, said: "Like a lot of people out there, my husband and I earn too much to get financial assistance, not enough to pay for tuition. Without the tuition assistance, my kids might have gone to college somewhere, but not here."
The tax break that lets Mr. Anderson attend Ohio Wesleyan, and will allow his sister, Kylie, to attend next year, is called the qualified tuition reduction exclusion. It allows college employees to escape taxes on the value of the tuition the college gives them. The tuition breaks can be granted either at the employee's home college, at another in the same conference, at a school with a reciprocal agreement, or -- in some instances -- in the form of a grant that can be used at any accredited institution.
But a bill that has cleared the House Ways and Means Committee would tax the value of the tuition as income.
The change was included in Republican tax proposals issued last Monday by Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the committee chairman. A revenue-raising part of the Archer plan would require employees of colleges and universities to pay taxes on the value of tuition breaks received by their children.
Those who would eliminate the tax break say the issue is one of fairness. "Tuition costs are rising like crazy, and who sets the tuition price? People who work at universities," said Kenneth J. Kies, chief of staff at the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. "And who are the only people who don't pay tuition? People who work at universities. The object here is to get comprehensive rules that put everyone on an even playing field."
Opponents of the tax break say it benefits college administrators who earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year -- and who could easily afford their children's education without such help.
While the tuition break is used by administrators, it is also used by employees whose salaries are less -- and who sometimes get a break that is a percentage of the tuition bill, not the total amount.
For the Anderson family, which will have two children receiving a total of $50,640 in tuition benefits and free room and board next year, the additional taxes would total $14,000 a year.
"Here at Ohio Wesleyan, we have 412 full-time employees, and 59 take remission tuition," said Thomas B. Courtice, president of the school. Of the 59 recipients, 32 are professors or administrators and 27 are hourly employees like clerical workers, groundskeepers and maintenance staff.
Matthew W. Hamill, a lobbyist for the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, said, "That percent is about what you would find across the country." Mr. Hamill's organization represents 900 private universities.
The universities say a loss of the tax break would make it harder to recruit top teaching talent and to finance graduate students who work as teaching assistants.
"These are students who make salaries of $10,000," said Ruth Flower, director of government relations for the American Association of University Professors, "and if they go to a school where the tuition is $30,000, they may have to pay $6,000 tax on that. All they would have left of their cash income is $4,000."
According to a 1996 study by the College and University Personnel Association, about 85 percent of the schools surveyed offered tuition assistance to all employee groups.
"Losing tuition remission will upset the whole economy of the university," Ms. Flower said.

HEADLINE: AT THE GATE;
A Stylish REIT Offering Could Stand a Little Trim

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
MORTIMER B. ZUCKERMAN is a well-connected publisher and tabloid columnist, but his biggest business is a real estate company many analysts regard as the Tiffany of its field. When he takes the enterprise public this week, however, some investors may be reluctant to pay the premium price he will ask.
It's not that the deal is insignificant -- far from it. Mr. Zuckerman and his partner, Edward H. Linde, plan to raise $785 million by selling 31.4 million shares of the company, Boston Properties, at an expected price of $24 to $26 a share. That makes this offering, 62.7 percent of the enterprise, the biggest ever for a real estate investment trust that is focused on commercial properties. 
 And the company, founded in 1970, has a sterling roster of properties scattered across the Northeast. It owns 63 office buildings, including the 24-acre Cambridge Center complex in Massachusetts and the International Trade Commission Building in Washington, as well as nine industrial properties, two Marriott hotels and a parking garage. And its three major markets -- Boston, New York and Washington -- are thriving. Rents are rising in all of them, especially in Boston, where they have jumped more than 9 percent since 1995. Moreover, given the high cost of development in those cities, rents are unlikely to be driven down by a flood of new office space.
Even critics of the offering say Mr. Linde and Mr. Zuckerman, who owns The Daily News in New York, U.S. News and World Report and The Atlantic Monthly, are one of the best development teams in the country. Boston Properties weathered a harsh real estate recession in the early 1990's, and the company says its average annual return has been about 14.2 percent the last five years. And, in a feature that makes REIT's a favorite of defensive investors, Boston Properties will carry a dividend that is high relative to most non-REIT stocks: $1.62 a share, or 6.5 percent of the $25 share price.
Nevertheless, some aspects of the offering, which is primarily underwritten by Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs, may give investors pause. Although virtually all the proceeds would be used to reduce the debt on 14 buildings, Boston Properties would still carry big debts compared with similar REIT's.
Its preferred measure of indebtedness, the ratio of debt to market capitalization, gives it a score of 37.6 percent after the offering. But the average for office REIT's is 24 percent, making Boston Properties' ratio 57 percent higher than its peers'.
Such debt can hamper growth. "The deal is being priced at a premium because it's Mort Zuckerman," said Ryan Jacob, director of research for IPO Value Monitor. "But we felt that it's going to be difficult for Boston Properties to continue to develop and acquire properties with the constraints of a highly leveraged balance sheet."
Moreover, as office REIT's compete with hedge funds and investment banks for real estate in a resurgent market, prices for office buildings have shot up. Since last August, the average price for a square foot of office space in the Northeast has risen 21.5 percent, to more than $103, according to the Property Information Exchange, a real estate research service. Such a jump can greatly narrow the trusts' profit margins.
"We're at a point in the real estate cycle where returns on acquisitions are not as high as they were a year ago," said Samuel A. Lieber, manager of the Evergreen equity funds in Purchase, N.Y., which has $320 million invested in real estate stocks. "That's one reason office REIT's are not flying as high as they were a year ago."
Indeed, after achieving total returns of 49.8 percent in 1996, office REIT's have returned negative 3.3 percent so far in 1997.
For a leveraged company like Boston Properties, rising prices can make it hard to compete; growth means borrowing money, and debt levels are one factor that lenders look at hard. The company's fans suggest that its debt load is more than offset by blue-chip tenants at buildings like 599 Lexington Avenue, a million-square-foot tower at 53d Street in Manhattan. But as much as 14 percent of the company's space is leased to the General Services Administration, which, like most Government tenants, tends to trade its creditworthiness for lower rents.
True, like most REIT's, the company expects to grow through acquisition, mostly stock swaps with old-line real estate moguls who might appreciate the trusts' tax-deferred status. (The trusts do not pay income taxes as long as they distribute 95 percent of income to shareholders.) But Mr. Zuckerman would need to make $500 million to $800 million in office deals annually to generate significant growth for a company as big as Boston Properties, some analysts say.
And the industry is becoming crowded. Since 1994, the number of office REIT's has grown from 1 to 15, with more on the way.
For example, Sam Zell, the Chicago investor, plans an offering for Equity Office Properties in July. It is for just $345 million, but the underlying company is the nation's largest, most diversified office REIT, with an estimated value of more than $3 billion and 90 office buildings comprising 32.2 million square feet spread over 47 markets.
By contrast, Boston Properties has 75 properties worth an estimated $2 billion and containing 11 million square feet.
"There are a lot of high-quality office companies out there," said Joe Harvey, senior vice president of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, which manages $4.7 billion in publicly traded real estate securities. "So there are a lot of choices."
So some investors may wonder if Mr. Zuckerman has been somewhat aggressive in pricing his shares. With REIT's, price levels are measured using funds from operations -- the industry's rough equivalent of net income. On average, the shares of office REIT's trade at about 11.8 times their estimated 1997 funds from operations, per share. But Boston Properties shares would sell at about 12.2 times, a modest premium.
Some people who otherwise like Boston Properties balk at this price. "It's a great company with excellent properties," said Mr. Lieber. "What more could you want?"
His answer to this rhetorical question: "A fair price. I think there's positive growth in this portfolio, but it's not dramatic. The way we look at it, there has to be a haircut on the price to guarantee that it'll be a strong performer in the aftermarket."
Of course, a price trim would dilute the value of the shares earmarked for Mr. Zuckerman and Mr. Linde. But since their holdings would be worth about $440 million at the $25 price, maybe there's room to cut.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Wall Street Puts On Its Best Show Since 1982

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Only nine weeks ago, there was real fear in the American stock market. Investors had -- shudder -- actually taken money out of stock funds during one week. There was concern that Alan Greenspan might do something about "irrational exuberance" besides just talk.
Now, all that is forgotten. Money is again pouring into stock funds. Few fear that the Federal Reserve will do anything to spoil the party. The bears who had become vocal have generally retreated and begun buying stocks again. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen 21.3 percent over the nine-week stretch. 
 That kind of rapid increase -- at least 20 percent over nine weeks -- is quite rare and is typical of the beginning of a bull market, not of a period after a bull market has been around for years. This is the eighth increase of that magnitude since the S.& P. 500 was invented in 1928, and all of the previous spurts started when share prices were severely depressed.
Consider the two most recent such moves. They began when long bear markets ended in 1974 and 1982. In each case, prices had fallen more than 20 percent over the previous year, and initially there were few who could believe that stocks could rally. Dividend yields were high -- 5.4 percent in 1974 and 6.3 percent in 1982 -- but stocks were generally scorned. The economy was in recession, and what little money was being invested in stock mutual funds was not being put to work because the managers were afraid that prices would keep falling and had 11 percent of their assets in cash.
The other five moves came during the 1930's, always after prices had fallen sharply and when valuations were depressed.
The current rally could hardly have occurred in a more different environment. To be sure, the S.& P. 500 had fallen almost 10 percent from its high in February, and bearish sentiment had risen. But the S.& P. 500 was up 17 percent from a year earlier, and the dividend yield was just 2 percent. Mutual funds had raised a little cash, but the total was under 6 percent of assets. The economy was doing fine, and if Wall Street was unhappy at all, it was over concern that business might be too good. The bull market was alive and well before the surge began.
Barton Biggs, the Morgan Stanley strategist, has an explanation for the rally. "I see capitulation and complacency," he wrote earlier this month. He said several veteran money managers, all of whom had been bearish as the year began, were now buying with enthusiasm.
It also appears that foreign investors, who had been similarly skeptical, have been loading up on American stocks.
There was one time before this year when the S.& P. 500 rose almost 20 percent over a nine-week period that did not begin with share prices down sharply from a year earlier. That climb started when prices were up 23 percent over the previous year, but down almost 6 percent from a month earlier. It saw the S.& P. 500 leap 19.6 percent over the next nine weeks, a period that ended on Aug. 3, 1929. The Great Crash came in October.
"You never know what is enough until you know what is more than enough," Mr. Biggs wrote before last week's 4.1 percent S.& P. gain. "I have the feeling we are setting up for something out of the blue soon. Something with the stunning violence of a punch in the mouth when you aren't expecting it. The dog days of summer have often been the time for brutal muggings of investors by markets."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Timing the Market, and Proud of the Results

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRUSH 

 BODY:
GERALD APPEL is a longtime practitioner of an out-of-favor art: market timing. Using mathematical models, Mr. Appel, 64, zips in and out of the market with the more than $300 million he manages, hoping to catch the rising waves and skirt the plunges. In a world where "buy and hold" is investment gospel, such short-term moves are seen as a heretical strategy that does not improve returns and incurs high commissions.
Nevertheless, Mr. Appel, who has run his investment advisory firm, the Signalert Corporation, since 1973, has done relatively well. In a ranking of 61 newsletters of various investment styles by Mark Hulbert, editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, Mr. Appel's composite results over the last 10 years place him first on a risk-adjusted basis, and 15th without such adjustment. 
 In the following interview, conducted in his firm's office in Great Neck, N.Y., Mr. Appel describes the workings of his models, his belief that Wall Street has a bias against market timing and his reasons for thinking that Japan's market is on the rebound -- and that America's looks better now than it did two or three months ago. MICHAEL BRUSH
 
Q. Tell me about your investing style.
A. We time various markets -- the primary American market, represented by the Standard & Poor's 500 or the Dow; the secondary American market, reflected by Nasdaq or the Russell 2000; various international markets; the bond markets, and the gold markets. Within the United States, we also look at the technology area and a few other areas that are especially significant.
Based upon our timing models, we then trade mutual funds. If we think gold, say, will go up in price, we'll buy a gold fund. If we think gold will go down, we will transfer the money into a money market fund and wait for the next gold buy signal. We're essentially fairly short-term traders.
Q. How do your models work?
A. I don't want to go into what triggers the actual buy too much, because that is proprietary. But basically what we're measuring is price and breadth momentum in the market, and we're looking for shifts.
Generally, a buy signal can occur when a short- or intermediate-term market decline is losing downside momentum. Prices are beginning to find technical support; market breadth is beginning to improve and there is at least minor reversal in price. The sell signal is basically the reverse. Upside momentum and breadth begin to weaken, and the price begins to turn down.
 
Q. How do you measure the breadth of the market?
A. There are three or four measures we mainly use. One is the weekly advances and the weekly declines on the New York Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq. That's the number of stocks that have risen in price for the week compared with the number of stocks that have fallen. These numbers may tell a different tale from the market averages. For example, it's possible for Nasdaq to be up because a few stocks like Intel or Microsoft are up, but for the typical secondary stock to be down.
We also look at the number of stocks making new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows on both indexes. It's the same question: Though a market average may be at its high, what's the real amount of participation going into this advance? Or how many stocks are really collapsing even though the average is coming down? A lot of times, these measures change direction before the popular averages do.
Another measure of market breadth is the percentage of stocks in up trends, which we define as standing above their 30-week moving averages. For example, even though as we speak the Dow is at a high, only 74 percent of stocks are in up trends. In 1995, over 90 percent were in up trends. So even though the major market averages are higher, the typical stock is not nearly as strong.
 
Q. Do you trade only in mutual funds?
A. We do very little trading in stocks, for a couple of reasons. We happen to be better market timers than we are stock pickers. That's just a fact of life, I'm afraid. And market timing is a little bit like predicting a Presidential election. The pollsters could tell with great certainty that Clinton was a sure winner the last go-round. But they could not tell very well how any individual voter might vote. It's the same thing with the stock market. It's a lot easier to call the market than to call a stock.
 
Q. What do you think of the American markets today?
A. We are, at this point, in an intermediate up trend. We got a buy signal on April 28 and we've been in the market ever since.
 
Q. Is the current market a good one for you to be doing what you do?
A. The whole period between the summer of 1990 and this year has been more atypical than typical. There was not a market decline of 10 percent in all those years and normally you see at least one a year.
So we've had a steady up market and this has not been great for timers because there's been nothing to time. The best thing you could do would be to stay still. And this is, I think, why people are suddenly asking if timing is worthwhile at all.
This steady up market reflects a confluence of factors. The declining deficit -- Clinton did a very good job with that. The end of the cold war -- and for that you probably have to give Presidents Bush and Reagan some credit, although they spent a lot of money doing it. An internationalization of corporate profit structures. And then there were a lot of layoffs. All these came together in a stable political and inflationary climate.
But now some people wonder about the rise in stocks taking some fundamental parameters to levels we just haven't seen before. It used to be considered extremely bearish if stock market dividends fell to below 3 percent. We are down to about 1.85 percent now, which means stocks are maybe 60 percent higher than they were at the 3 percent level.
Real market tops after the kind of bull market we've had take a long time to occur. For example, the market top of 1972, before the last really serious bear market, took almost a year to form. Then the advances became narrower and narrower and you really hit a bad market in a lot of stocks long before people knew it from the Dow.
 
Q. Do you see a similar market top forming now?
A. I would have thought so two or three months ago, but the broader market indexes, like the Value Line Composite or the Russell 2000, have been overtaking the narrow indexes, like the Dow or the S.& P. 500, in relative strength. But this is something we need to watch.
 
Q. Was there one time when you called something absolutely right?
A. We had two real good occasions when we had all our clients and subscribers out of the stock market in the weeks before the crash in 1987 and again in 1989.
 
Q. How did you know?
A. The things we spoke about before; the market beginning to fail. In 1987 there was a lot of warning all spring that the market wasn't keeping up with the Dow.
 
Q. And what about specific sectors?
A. Well, we called the turn on the Japanese market pretty well just a few weeks ago. Japan seems to be making a very significant comeback after a nine-year bear market. And I don't really know the ins and outs of the Japanese economy -- I just see the technical patterns of the stock market and I would say that they look kind of ready for a serious emergence and that any period of decline there over the next few weeks will probably be a good time to enter.
 
Q. What have been your big misses?
A. Nothing is ever really big because of the way we trade. In other words, if we have gold sell signals, we'll sell, and if gold turns up the next day we simply buy it back. It takes so little to get us in and out. If I had to take a guess, I'd say we were premature in calling for a reversal in the small-cap area early this year.
 
Q. Some studies suggest that timing is bad for investors. One by Sanford Bernstein & Company shows that if investors miss just the 10 best days in the market over a period of years, the average annual returns are off several percentage points annually.
A. Let me take that study. It said that between 1980 and 1989, the S.& P. had an average annual return of 17.6 percent. If you missed the 10 best days, your return fell to 12.7 percent and if you missed the 20 best days, your return fell to 9.6 percent. But let's see what happens if you miss the worst 10 days. According to a study by Ned Davis Research, your return pops up from 17.6 percent to 27 percent and then if you avoid the worst 20 days your return pops up to 31 percent. So I don't know why they played that study on one side.
Anyway, most people use timing in just about everything. If you go out to buy a car, you wait until there's a sale. If you look for real estate, you shop when prices look inexpensive. Why shouldn't it be the same with stocks? They get expensive and they get cheap.
So why do people say market timing is a bad thing? Well, the mutual-fund fellows are going to say it because the last thing they want is to encourage market panic. Can you imagine them going out on the network to all their customers and saying: "Liquidate your holdings. There's going to be a bear market. Move everything to a money market."? So they've got to say, no, this is the long haul.
But what is the long haul? Fidelity Magellan has had three portfolio managers over the last several years. It has had a portfolio turnover of 136 percent since 1990. So what are you buying with Magellan? Are you buying a buy-and-hold approach? The brokerage houses do an awful amount of timing, too. There are good timers and bad timers, but I think there's a lot of vested interest against talking up timing. And of course, we have had a bull market for years. The psychology now is the market's always going to come back, even though that's not always so.
But some arguments against timing have a certain validity.
 
Q. Such as?
A. Those concerning the tax treatment of short-term capital gains versus long-term capital gains.
 
Q. Short-term gains get treated as income, and therefore are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains. And timing may result in lots of short-term trades.
A. Right. So, I'd say, though people don't think about it, a timed portfolio lives in a natural habitat of tax-advantaged accounts -- I.R.A.'s, pension accounts, things like that.
Another argument against timing is that one must have the psychology to go against the crowd. A lot of times, you're entering the market when things don't look good and exiting when things do look good. That's a hard thing for some people to do.
But one big argument for timing, even so-so timing, is that it reduces risk. A lot of studies bear this out. Let's say the Dow's at about 7,300. Suppose you have a sort of timing model that would take you out of the market on a Dow decline to 7,000. Say the Dow goes down to 7,000, then to about 6,500, then comes back up. You go back into the market by your model at the same 7,000. So you can say that nothing really good has happened as a result of the transaction.
But you were out of the market during the worst of the psychological climate. And you don't know how far down that market would have gone, and whether you would have panicked. You re-entered at the same level with your portfolio value showing very little fluctuation, whereas otherwise it would have shown maybe twice as much fluctuation.
 
Q. Do you have any advice for people who want to try timing on their own?
A. Some basic things work surprisingly well. One, of course, is what Marty Zweig, the market-timing money manager, likes to say: Don't fight with the Fed too much. One simple indicator people can use is the direction of interest rates reflected by short-term government bonds, three- to five-year bonds. If rates are higher than they were about six or seven months ago it's a dangerous time to own stocks -- not necessarily a fatal time, but a dangerous time. We just did a study, going back to 1970, that showed this. And if rates are lower than they were six or seven months ago -- now, they're down from about 5.3 percent to about 5 percent, and stable -- it's generally a favorable time to hold stock.
The other thing is to watch the weekly advance-decline line on the New York Stock Exchange. As long as it's in an up trend you could pretty well stay put. Let's take 10,000 as an arbitrary number. You take the number of stocks to advance or decline for the week -- say it was 2,000 up and 1,500 down, for a net of plus 500. You add that to the 10,000 so your new weekly advance-decline line is 10,500. As long as that line generally keeps zigzagging up, making new highs, the market can be held.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
A Rose-Colored View of Race

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EIGHT years ago, a 29-year-old white woman jogging at night in New York's Central Park was chased down, beaten and raped by seven black and Hispanic youths. Their arrests, trials and convictions brought a torrent of invective and hand-wringing over the state of race relations in the city. Supporters of the suspects charged that the case had been trumped up by a racist criminal justice system determined to convict African American and Hispanic youths.
This month, two young black men were charged with robbing and murdering Jonathan Levin, a white teacher at a predominantly black and Hispanic high school in the Bronx. The reaction so far from black politicians and civic leaders to this potentially racially charged case has been silence. 
 The responses to the two cases go beyond questions of evidence or police conduct. The differences seem to reflect the general change of racial climate, not only in New York but across the country. After years of accusations exchanged -- racism, anti-Semitism, insensitivity, laziness, bigotry, arrogance or just plain bad manners -- a curious new element seems to have descended over America's roiling racial landscape:
Peace.
It is a tranquillity that seems more relative than absolute, possibly more temporary than enduring, and largely grounded in resignation rather than reconciliation. Still, as President Clinton addressed the nation yesterday about the state of race relations, there is evidence that he chose a moment far calmer than just a few years ago.
"This is a good time for a lot of people," said Michael Meyers, head of the New York Civil Rights Commission. "You can't argue against the facts. We have made a whole lot of progress in race relations, and we have to acknowledge that."
 
 
Satisfaction
 For now, no cities are burning. No divisive events like the O. J. Simpson trial are preoccupying Americans. Among African-Americans overall, income, life expectancy and employment have been rising. Figures like Colin Powell, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods are idolized by whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians alike. A Gallup poll released last week showed remarkably high levels of satisfaction among blacks and tolerance among whites.
In some ways the climate makes Mr. Clinton's appeal for racial healing, while important, sound oddly out of sync. "Typically speaking, Presidents talk about the race question in times of a real, overt, no question-about-it civil strife type of emergency," said Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School. "This is not that moment."
But if peace abounds, it is also fraught with paradoxes, and the pessimists have fodder of their own. Unemployment rates in the poorest neighborhoods have barely budged. Disparities in the quality of education persist. Hispanic people, especially, are losing ground. As more blacks move into the middle class and their contacts with whites increase, their doubts that racial harmony can be achieved have only grown. And many blacks are quietly seething over the scaling back of affirmative action programs.
"The climate feels like one of retrenchment, and quite possibly quite severe retrenchment in terms of civil rights," said Lawrence Bobo, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Los Angeles.
As James Carville or Karl Marx would no doubt say if asked the underlying reason for the placid face of race relations: it's the economy, stupid. Indeed, the jobless rate among blacks, while still twice that of whites, has hovered around 10 percent since 1994, the longest period of sustained relatively low black unemployment in 20 years.
"A lot of ordinary folks are benefiting tremendously from one of the best economies we have had in memory," said Milton Morris, former vice president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which studies race-related issues. "And the black community is benefiting substantially from that."
In these good times, blacks are expressing satisfaction with their circumstances that belies the gloom-and-doom scenarios often sketched by leaders of liberal civil rights groups. In the far-reaching poll by the Gallup Organization, 74 percent of black respondents said they were satisfied both with the way things were going in their personal lives and with their standard of living.
 
 
Voting and Marriage
 The Gallup poll also pointed to levels of acceptance and tolerance among whites that are unprecedented. In the survey, 93 percent of whites -- a higher percentage than African-Americans -- said they would be willing to vote for a black candidate for President. And 61 percent of whites said they approved of interracial marriages, the highest level since the polling firm began asking this question in 1972 -- when only 25 percent of whites were approving.
Some skeptics scoff that these findings are the result of people parroting what they think an interviewer wants to hear. But there are other measures of acceptance: five African-Americans won re-election to the House last year in majority white districts, for example, after the Supreme Court invalidated their old districts, which had been deliberately drawn to create black majorities.
Still, there are some underlying reasons for the relative calm that do not necessarily augur well for the future. One is the demoralized and disorganized state of liberal civil rights groups, which have failed to rally opposition to a conservative tide that is reshaping public policy in three areas that are racial flash points: crime, welfare and affirmative action.
"They're winning," said Mr. Meyers. "They've cut welfare, They're tough on crime, and affirmative action is out the window. Of course things are quiet."
Perhaps most worrisome in the poll was the finding that even if things are relatively good on the racial front, whites and blacks do not feel they will get much better. Fifty-eight percent of the whites and 54 percent of black respondents said they felt race relations will always be a problem in this country; in 1963, 44 percent of whites and 26 percent of blacks held that view. Such a finding may indicate that as the nation approaches the end of the century what remains apparent, to paraphrase the Kerner Commission in its report almost 30 years ago, is two societies, still separate, still unequal, and, if happier with their lot, more than ever feeling that things are about as good as they're going to get.

Graphs: "Hopeful Signs"
A new national survey revealed widespread pessimism among Americans on race relations, but there was cause for optimism, especially when the responses to some questions were compared with results from earlier polls. Graphs show results based on polls conducted by the Gallup Organization.

Guess What City Looks Like America

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY often seems like some outrider to the American experience. By its scale and its reputation for excess, the nation's largest city has long cultivated an aura of prickly difference that residents and nonresidents alike have relished. New Yorkers gaze across the Hudson with arrogance and contempt, and the rest of the country gapes back with awe, loathing and relief.
But the millions of foreign tourists who are thronging the city's streets, and corporations like the Walt Disney Company that are burnishing landmarks like Times Square into high-gloss symbols of American culture, are seeing -- or marketing -- a different New York entirely. Their New York is in fact a mirror for all that is so distinctively American: its multiculturalism, its brutish economic vitality, its breakneck pace. 
 Hello? Will the real New York, or the real America, please stand up? Is New York really a place apart from America, or is it so American that we don't quite recognize it up close -- or don't want to?
The answer is to be found in contradictions that increasingly define New York.
One hundred years after the consolidation of its five boroughs into one city, creating the world's first true megalopolis, the paradoxes woven through New York's economy and culture are pushing it toward a new and unfamiliar place: a New York that actually resembles the country around it.
For all its reputation as home to the avant garde and, in the past at least, to liberal local government, and despite what might seem in some neighborhoods to be an unusually high body-piercing rate, New York may be as deeply conservative in its institutions and traditions as any place in America.
True, the city's size does allow individualism and eccentricity. But the nation's broad social and economic trends, whether in retailing or in spirituality, tend to start elsewhere and find their way to New York only later, if at all. In the 1990's, that pattern is making New York one of the last refuges of an old-fashioned America that has been mostly lost across much of the country.
In a nation where malls and big-box retailers like Wal-Mart have killed off downtowns and transformed many of the rhythms of economic life, much of New York, for better or worse, echoes Beaver Cleaver more than Beavis and Butthead. Family-owned businesses thrive. Central business districts are still places to shop.
There is, strange to say, still a small-town feel in the city's commerce. Local movie houses serve local neighborhoods; multiplexes have yet to conquer. New York coffee, until recently, remained a weak brew bought in delis, long after companies like Starbucks had reinvented it elsewhere. This weekend Disney celebrated the world premier in Times Square of its animated movie "Hercules" with a parade through Manhattan that would have been right at home on Main Street, U.S.A.
There is a quaint, dated feel to many of the city's demographic patterns as well. Despite the New York stereotype of the two-income, cigar-puffing power couple, nearly half of the residents of the New York metropolitan area do not work outside their homes (think June Cleaver), a higher proportion than in any other urban center. That gap has begun to close in the last few years, though, bringing the city more in line with the national norm.
Sociologists and other experts in economic culture say New York, first in so much, brings up the rear as a trend-setter because of its history, money and geography.
The city was built, and continues to be rebuilt now as much as ever, by foreign immigrants. Immigrants have historically never stretched boundaries. They assimilate. They work hard and hope to see their children enter the mainstream.
"The first generation strives, and the second becomes the establishment," said Wendy Liebmann, a New York retailing consultant and immigrant herself, from Australia.
New York also remains the American business establishment's home office. Corporate power and huge concentrations of capital, from the Fortune 500 fortresses of midtown Manhattan to the financial empires of Wall Street, do not, by their very nature, encourage social experimentation.
A third force of inadvertent conservatism is real estate. Most of the rest of the country is cheaper. Kmart finally came to the space-constrained island of Manhattan for the first time in 1996 for the simple reason that it was one of the few frontiers left. The economics of opening a store in New York finally made sense because the rest of the country got full up.
The idea of New York City as a promised land -- unlike, say, California -- has never really gripped the American imagination. For millions of Americans, the phrase "back East" remains a sweeping stock expression that often takes in the New York of their Ellis Island heritage and, in a general way, the past itself.
Just in the 1990's so far, about 1.3 million residents of the New York region have moved out. Indeed, it was big news this year when a New York Times Poll found that for the first time in a decade, a majority of New Yorkers said that given the chance to leave, they wouldn't.
But at the same time, New York is also one of the world's great population magnets, both for foreign immigrants and for ambitious native-born Americans in fields as diverse as finance and theater, television and accounting and, most recently, computer technology. For the thousands who leave, thousands more come, leaving the population basically unchanged now for years while the city itself constantly churns.
In the past, that classically New York pattern -- millions of struggling immigrants living alongside highly skilled, highly paid strivers -- made the city an aberrant American place of extreme poverty and extreme wealth. Its base population on average was far less educated than Americans as a whole.
But in recent years, extremes of rich and poor have come home to apple-pie America as well, in cities of every stripe, as middle-class economic gains have eroded. New York simply doesn't look so strange anymore. Meanwhile, changes in immigration law designed to encourage skills needed in the work force have resulted in sharply higher education levels among foreign arrivals to New York. In Los Angeles, by contrast, a high proportion of immigrants -- many from Mexico, in particular -- still come in the classic style, with little formal education.
New York's economic identity -- unlike Chicago's, for example -- was only marginally ever based on making things. The city had manufacturing, certainly -- the garment industry, in particular -- but what made it boom, beginning in the 1800's, was the buying and selling and repackaging and marketing of products made elsewhere. Forget the big shoulders. New York was the city of big ledger sheets.
Some sociologists and economists say that the descendants of that mercantile-seaport economic culture, industries that range from Wall Street to advertising to television, are now morphing into a new form as technologies and world trade rhythms meld.
In the post-cold war economy of the 21st century, said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and planning at New York University, what America will sell most is its vision, its world view, its entertainment -- in sum, its culture. And among the places that seem most rapidly to be building such a prototypically American economic sector, he argues, is New York.
"A new industrial complex has burgeoned," Professor Tobier said.
Exhibit A of this cultural/industrial complex is the interconnection of entertainment, fashion and technology that is emerging as the signature flavor of New York's growing computer software industry, known as Silicon Alley. Another example is the tourism-fueled transformation of Times Square.
The next logical question, of course, is what vision of American culture New York will proceed to sell to the world, given that the city has rarely acknowledged the existence of a culture anywhere west of the Hudson River. Or in the end, will New York simply export itself and call it America?
Who will know the difference?

HEADLINE: Freewheeling Freedom;
Appalled by Risk, Except in the Car

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FROM Alar on apples to cyanide in Chilean grapes to flammable cargo in the holds of airplanes, the question about risk is often: how much should be imposed on people?
Here's a tougher one: how much risk should people be allowed to impose on themselves? The answer seems to be: the sky's the limit as long as it involves their cars. 
 Cars are a prime American symbol of personal freedom, and politicians propose limits on them at their peril. Last week the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that states toughen laws to insure seat-belt use and keep children out of the front seat. The issue isn't safety versus money: Unlike new equipment for planes, buckling up or putting a child in the back is free. The issue is safety versus freedom.
Take, for example, current law regarding seat belts, which cut the risk of death almost in half. Although the Government has required them in cars since the early 1970's -- and 49 states require their use -- 36 states forbid the police to stop drivers just because they or front-seat passengers are unbelted. The officer must first see what is considered a more serious violation, like a burned-out tail light.
In many states the only law that police cannot routinely enforce is the seat belt law.
Legislatures debate every year whether to strengthen their laws. Only the most compelling events move them to act. In Oklahoma this year, a bill toughening requirements for children under 18 seemed destined for defeat again until mid-May, when a hospital trauma nurse testified that she had flown on a helicopter to the scene of a two-car accident. Even before landing, she saw that two unbelted people had been thrown from one of the cars. The nurse rushed to one victim and, finding him dead, she headed for the other. She immediately recognized the child by his shoes. It was her son, also killed in the crash.
Her story shocked the legislature into changing state law. But in Illinois, where the death toll from not wearing seat belts was similar but there was no such dramatic tale, politicians voted down a bill last month.
And just as the states do not dictate to people what they may do in the sacred precincts of their cars, they also do not tell them how to handle their children there. They all require baby seats. But the laws governing older children are a muddle and in many states weak and weakly enforced.
"Parents who let their kids go around inside a car unbelted, well, it borders on child abuse," said R. David Pittle, vice president and technical director of Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. "It's like letting a kid play in traffic. It's about that irresponsible."
But it happens all the time.
 
 
A Free Lunch
 The dichotomy between risks that are imposed and those for which individuals volunteer became clear last week, when the Federal Aviation Administration, responding to last year's Valujet crash, proposed a rule to make airlines install smoke detectors and fire suppression systems in the cargo holds of 3,700 jets at a cost of up to $75,000 each. The airline industry asked for the rule, even though its officials say the chance of a fire in such holds is about 1 for every 40 million departures. They wanted uniform regulation on an issue of considerable public anxiety.
On the other hand, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board complained that every day highway deaths equal the 110 killed in the Valujet crash. One quarter would be saved if all wore seat belts, he said, and it costs nothing.
In fact, it is less a free lunch than it is a lunch the public would be paid to eat. If the amount of people wearing belts rose to 85 percent from the current 68 percent, according to the safety board, 4,200 fewer people would die yearly. Society would save $7 billion in medical and other costs; of that the Federal treasury would save $1 billion.
Surely, a policy wonk would have figured out by now that there are better uses for $1 billion than failing to enforce seat belt laws. Even libertarians agree. "Since my insurance premiums go up if you behave stupidly, why don't I have a say in your behavior?" said Peter M. VanDoren, an economist at the Cato Institute.
But it's not about money.
It's not about probability, either, because unlike plane crashes, car crashes are probable for most Americans. Most drivers can expect to have more than one. There is 1 crash every 210,000 miles driven, and the average driver covers 13,400 miles a year, which works out to 1 crash every 16 years. Fatalities occur once every 58 million miles, which is the distance that 4,300 average drivers cover in a year. That means that for every 100 people you know, one is likely to be involved in a fatal car crash.
But Americans do not think that cars are so dangerous that their behavior needs to be regulated. "Americans seem to be most libertarian, if you will, about their cars," said Mr. VanDoren. The car, he said, is "the late 20th-century incarnation of the Wild West frontier."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Suddenly, the New Politics of Morality

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WANT to see a politician really hem and haw? Show up at his or her next town meeting and ask about the issues now dominating American public discourse: Should adultery be tolerated in the military? Should cloning be banned or encouraged? Should doctors be allowed to help terminally ill patients commit suicide?
Most politicians do not have well-thought-out answers to these questions. The political parties certainly don't. Democratic or Republican position papers on adultery? Highly doubtful. 
 Politicians are at a loss in part because mixing the moral and the political has always been perilous. Such issues do not fit comfortably in the political arena because views on them are so subjective and personal that they defy ideological categorization. And politicians have had little practice debating morality without the templates of the cold war and economic ideology that until recently shaped political dialogue.
Dan Schnur, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, said that when politicians weigh in on such issues, "Republicans end up sounding sanctimonious and Democrats end up sounding hypocritical." Remember the firestorm Newt Gingrich caused in 1994 with comments about Susan Smith? He said her drowning of her two children in South Carolina underscored "how sick society is getting," and that "the only way you can get change is to vote Republican."
Abortion is probably the prime illustration of how problematic, and incendiary, moral questions can be. As much as some Republicans trumpet their opposition to abortion, the issue has caused great grief to a party trying to broaden its appeal.
But moral questions are on the political agenda now in part because with the economy soaring there are fewer old battles to fight. Just last week, the two parties agreed to cut taxes, an issue they've been feuding over for a generation. In addition, the nation is preoccupied with no war or great external threat. And so big cultural issues that people usually only ruminate about at family dinners or with their ministers have been brought to the fore -- pushed there by dizzying technological and scientific advances and demographic changes, among other factors. If the parties don't respond to these issues -- now core concerns for many voters -- they risk becoming marginalized and irrelevant.
Increasingly, moral matters are being played out in political forums, and that may force politicians to take positions. Oregon voters will decide in November whether they want their state to be the first to legalize assisted suicide. And last week, President Clinton, addressing an issue rarely if ever dealt with by his predecessors, called for a ban on the cloning of human beings. But he was more ambiguous about the cloning of animals and certain human genes for research.
Such issues could challenge the parties to redefine themselves. "When an election is about health care or the state of the economy you just get a very different set of alliances than if it is about the right to die or gays in the military," said Byron E. Shafer, a professor of American Government at Oxford University. "The public has a harder time making sense out of politics: If I knew your position on the war on poverty, I would have no idea what your position was on the right to die. If I knew how you felt about union regulation, I wouldn't have a clue how you felt about cloning."
 
 
What's My Party Line?
 You can make an educated guess as to the likely partisan positions on such issues. You might surmise, for instance, that Republicans, who fashion themselves as the party of the traditional family, would most strongly condemn adultery, especially in the military. But just the other day there was Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, defending First Lieut. Kelly Flinn, the Air Force pilot who was forced out of the military last month after confessing that she had lied to commanders about her affair with a married man. And conservative groups were noticeably silent on Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, who removed his name last week from consideration as chairman of the Joint Chief as of Staff because he committed adultery years ago. Only women's groups, more closely identified with Democratic politics, spoke out against the General.
"How do parties use these issues to their advantage?" said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "It's not easy because the bases of both parties have very strong feelings about these issues that are muddled for most Americans."
Such a predicament was on display last year in California, where most candidates stayed clear of a referendum on medicinal use of marijuana, which voters approved. The only ones who raised the issue were local politicians who used it to play to their bases in overwhelmingly partisan areas: Democrats in liberal San Francisco could afford to play up their support for medicinal marijuana, while Republicans in conservative Orange County could score politically by emphasizing their opposition. But the issue was too controversial to be taken up by candidates running statewide.
Maybe the newly emerged issues will eventually break along party lines. Perhaps, in time, Democrats will see the "right to die" issue as a matter of basic civil rights, while most Republicans will condemn assisted suicide as violating basic American values.
Then again, such issues may never find a partisan cast. The notion of cloning seems to frighten Democrats and Republicans alike. And which party is about to endorse adultery? On the other hand, perhaps adulterers' right to privacy can be defended. But by whom?
Polls show that on a range of such moral and cultural matters, voters are divided not by party but, if anything, by factors like religion and the region in which one lives. (An exception: far more Democrats than Republicans condone same-sex marriages.) Voters may also be torn over the role of Government in these matters: as much as voters may oppose physician-assisted suicide, they may also resent the idea of the Government telling them when they can pull the plug.
William J. Bennett, the Republican values guru, said that while many of the moral issues are not partisan, the parties cannot afford to ignore them. "These are issues that hit people where they live," he said, warning that politicians "are going to be asked where they stand," and they will need good answers.
The proper character of American life has been hotly debated before in American history, and the test of a party is how well it can respond to a new issue. The Whig Party, for instance, collapsed from internal turmoil over how to address slavery. In the 1920's, issues like prohibition and the Scopes evolution trial were at the forefront of politics.
Ben J. Wattenberg, a conservative writer, argues that the moral issues that now preoccupy the public have no place in American politics. "There is going to be adultery in the United States of America," he said, "and there's not a whole lot the Government can do about it."
Maybe. But when has the inability of Government to do something stifled a politician from speaking out?

HEADLINE: Greasy Kid Stuff;
Washington Kidnaps Dick and Jane

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN President Clinton and Congress clinched their deal to balance the Federal budget, Republicans rushed to the Capitol rotunda to celebrate. Sweeping up a little boy named Jose, two lawmakers hailed him as a symbol of the millions of children whom a balanced budget would benefit.
These days much of the nation's political debate focuses on children -- or on the needs and interests of children as defined by politicians and advocacy groups. From the battle over abortion to the war against Joe Camel, from solving the problems of welfare and health care to protecting the environment, adults are basing their arguments and strategies on the next generation. 
 Much of the concern is genuine and warranted. But children are also being used as proxies in larger debates over social and economic policy. Even as they take opposing positions, liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, ask, in effect: "How could you oppose me? I am protecting the interests of children."
Children don't vote, so they cannot reward or punish those who champion or ignore their interests. The very young -- and those not yet born -- cannot speak for themselves ("infant" means "unable to speak") so they cannot challenge politicians who speak for them.
Politicians, of course, have always kissed babies to appeal to their parents. But Government efforts on behalf of children today -- initiatives that strike responsive chords with baby boomers still rearing their own children -- go far beyond such gestures.
Mr. Clinton, for example, set his Administration's tone with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the first bill he signed, which allowed workers to take unpaid time off to care for newborns. He now wants to expand it so workers can be excused to attend school conferences or to take their children to the doctor.
The centerpiece of the huge tax bill that Congress is now writing is a $500-a-child income-tax credit. To protect children, the Government has proposed new restrictions on tobacco, tried to keep hard liquor ads off television and radio, advocated use of the V-chip and prodded the television industry to flag programs containing sex or violence. A new law seeks to protect children from sexually explicit material on the Internet. And Mr. Clinton recently toughened food safety standards to protect children against food-borne illnesses.
The techniques of child advocacy that were perfected by liberals like Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, are now imitated by many, including the conservative Family Research Council, headed by Gary L. Bauer, a former Reagan Administration official. In recent budget battles both sides invoked the interests of children to justify their positions. Republicans say that their crusade to balance the budget is waged on behalf of children, and that the burden of debt on future generations must be reduced by cutting programs for this one. Interest on the debt already accounts for 15 percent of Federal spending, more than is spent for Medicaid, food stamps, welfare and education combined.
 
 
Shifting the Focus
 Mrs. Edelman has focused attention on poverty through the lens of children's needs. In her 1987 book, "Families in Peril," she said that the Children's Defense Fund had been formed "because we recognized that support for whatever was labeled black and poor was shrinking, and that new ways had to be found to articulate and respond to the continuing problems of poverty and race, ways that appealed to the self-interest as well as the conscience of the American people."
Wade F. Horn, president of the National Fatherhood Initiative, a nonprofit group that tries to get fathers more engaged in their children's lives, said, "Marian quite strategically, cleverly and effectively shifted the focus from poverty to children, knowing that people would be more interested in poor children than in antipoverty programs in general."
Mr. Horn, who was chief of the Children's Bureau in the Bush Administration, added: "A cynic would say that children are being used as props or as proxies. But there is also a genuine concern for children. Poor children live in poor families."
Martha A. Matthews, director of Stanford Law School's family advocacy program, said: "Politicians on the left and the right play children as a card. This is perhaps a mix of sincere concern and political strategy. Poor children are a lot more popular in the public mind than poor adults because they can't be blamed for their condition.
"The left tends to use the symbolism of children to get political clout that we wouldn't otherwise have," she said. "If you're trying to raise standards for safety and decency in housing, you use a photo of a tiny kid in a rat-infested tenement, rather than a photo of a 40-year-old adult."
Debate over the welfare bill last year was couched almost entirely in terms of its effects on children. Few lawmakers or lobbyists spoke up for the parents who would lose cash assistance, food stamps, Medicaid and other benefits.
The emphasis on children as an especially vulnerable group comes even as public health experts and Government officials cite favorable trends. Infant mortality is declining, childhood immunization is rising, child-support collections are up and the teen birth rate is down.
But teen-age drug use is rising, and many parents have a sense that children are under siege, subjected to violence on the streets and to sex and violence on television. "Everywhere we look, children are under assault," Hillary Rodham Clinton, a former chairwoman of the Children's Defense Fund, wrote in her book "It Takes a Village." And so politics sometimes seem to revolve around children, as shown by these initiatives:
* Stymied in his effort to guarantee health insurance for all Americans, President Clinton is now working with Congress to guarantee coverage for children.
* The campaign against smoking has moved beyond restaurants and the workplace to focus on children, as the Clinton Administration tries to halt the sale and advertising of tobacco products to minors. Leaders of the campaign say that smokers are hooked on tobacco as children, and so a new tobacco tax is justified to finance health insurance for children.
* Opponents of abortion, hoping to answer the accusation that they are intruding into women's lives, say they are trying to protect "preborn children."
* In April, President Clinton signed an executive order telling Federal agencies to protect children from "environmental health risks and safety risks." Children's small size and their developing bodies make them particularly vulnerable to contaminants, he said.
* The White House held a conference on early childhood development to highlight new research on the brain. One lesson is that neural connections formed in the first two years of life establish the foundation for rational thinking and problem-solving skills, vital to success in later life.
Why has there been so much emphasis on children and childhood?
Philippe Aries, a cultural historian, analyzed the concept in a 1960 book, "Centuries of Childhood." "In medieval society," he said, "the idea of childhood did not exist." Until about the 12th century, he asserted, medieval artists portrayed children in neither realistic nor idealized ways, but simply as "small-scale adults."
Freud, by contrast, saw childhood as the most important stage of life and traced the neuroses of adults to their experiences as children. Psychological researchers are still elaborating on his insights.
Politicians have cited those findings to argue for more money for Head Start, child care and nutrition programs. But it is not just new understanding that explains the fixation on children. The narcissism of baby boomers is a factor.
"The baby boom generation is having kids," Dr. Horn said. "When baby boomers were in their 20's, they focused on themselves. Now that they're in their 40's, they are focusing on their children. They want things to be better for their kids. What baby boomers want, they get."

HEADLINE: NATO Invitations Snarled by Splits Among Allies

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, June 12

 BODY:
Russian objections to enlarging NATO may be out of the way, but the allies remain far apart over issues they will have to resolve before they can go ahead next month with plans to extend the first formal invitations to prospective new members.
The United States is at odds with France, Italy, Turkey and other allies in its insistence that only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic can be admitted in the first wave. 
 France is still holding reorganization of NATO hostage to its desire to replace an American admiral with a European officer in the alliance's key southern military post, the Southern Command in Naples, allied officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels said. In Brussels on Thursday, Secretary of Defense William Cohen rebuffed the French again.
And in yet another hitch, here in Turkey, a NATO member since 1952 , officials say that their country will block any decision on enlargement unless it gets some encouragement in its decadeslong quest to join the European Union.
President Clinton and other NATO leaders want to proclaim the alliance reorganized for the post-cold-war era and extend invitations to the first Warsaw Pact countries to join it at a summit meeting in Madrid July 8 and 9.
But NATO decisions require a consensus of all 16 members. Some, including Turkey, want Romania included in the first wave of expansion.
And Turkey, miffed at recent suggestions from some European Christian Democratic politicians and others that Muslim Turks are not real Europeans, is threatening to hold NATO hostage to its longstanding desire to get into the European Union.
Turkey's shaky coalition Government and its powerful military establishment, at odds over the direction their country should take on many other things, appear to agree on the enlargement issue.
"If Turkey has the feeling that we are not being discriminated against in the European Union, then we will be in a position to participate in the NATO enlargement process," said Onur Oymen, a senior Foreign Ministry official.
He added that Turkey was also demanding full membership in the Western European Union, a European defense group that coordinates with NATO.
Gen. Cevik Bir, the powerful Deputy Chief of Staff of the Turkish armed forces, put the Turkish position more bluntly, saying, "We would like to use NATO as a tool for our integration into the European Union and the Western European Union."
General Bir expressed concern over what he called the "anti-secular activities" of the coalition Government of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, whose Islamist leanings have also alarmed some European Union leaders. But the Turkish Defense Minister, Turhan Tayan, brushed aside European objections.
"Our European friends are not being very objective when evaluating our desires," he said. "It is not possible to explain Turkey not being accepted as a European state."
Turkey, with 62 million people, has been trying since 1963 to join what is now called the European Union. All tariff barriers between the group and Turkey were lifted last year in a customs union.
But some Western diplomats argue that Turkey's high inflation rate, over 70 percent this year, its high unemployment, and a social and military conflict with Kurdish separatists that has led to accusations of widespread human rights violations all put it far behind Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and other Central European countries on the list of European Union applicants.
"No country can become a European Union member with such serious internal problems with a minority or a region that democratic structures or the security of the country are placed in peril," the German Ambassador here, Hans-Joachim Vergau, said recently.
Turkish officials say that unless a report by the European Union's Executive Commission on prospective new members gives Turkey reason to hope for eventual membership on the same terms and criteria as applicants from Central Europe, there will be trouble at next month's NATO summit in Madrid. The report is expected within a few weeks.
Some Turkish critics of the Government here take it to task for its bargaining tactics.
"It's been misplayed," said one of them, Ahmet O. Evin, rector of the private Bilkent University here. " 'I'll veto this if you veto that' is no way to get into the European Union, and it obscures the long and constructive active role that Turkey has played in NATO."

HEADLINE: Mary D. Keyserling, 87, Dies; Senior Government Economist

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Mary D. Keyserling, an economist who made women and children the focus of her work in and out of government, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in McLean, Va. She was 87 and had been director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau during the era of feminist ferment in the 1960's.
Her brother, Dr. Thomas D. Dublin of Washington, said the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease. 
 By 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her to head the Women's Bureau, Dr. Keyserling had established herself as a leading economist and as a champion of economic opportunities for women.
She was also something of a Washington insider: the wife of Leon H. Keyserling, a prominent economist who had been chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Harry S. Truman, and a woman of accomplishment with a wide circle of influential friends.
She had worked closely with Eleanor Roosevelt as chief of the research and statistics division of the Office of Civilian Defense in World War II, and with W. Averell Harriman as chief of the Commerce Department's international economics division from 1946 to 1953.
Dr. Keyserling was a onetime president of the Women's National Democratic Club.
She also ran the District of Columbia Commission on the Status of Women and advised the National Academy of Sciences on child development, working on issues that had been a major concern since she was a child.
Dr. Keyserling's mother had been a college-trained social worker, and her father was a statistician and vice president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
As a girl growing up in Manhattan and on a farm in Westchester County, Dr. Keyserling weighed the rival parental influences, then blithely chose to follow both at once by becoming an economist specializing in social issues, like the sometimes high prices paid by consumers and the often low wages earned by women.
After graduating from Barnard College, where she was president of her senior class, she did graduate work at the Geneva School of International Studies and the London School of Economics before to New York. It was at Columbia University that she caught the eye of Mr. Keyserling, a young economics instructor. They were married in 1940, when she was 30.
As a Government economist in an era when the New Deal had attracted droves of women to high-level Federal positions, Dr. Keyserling had a lot of company in the corridors of power. But it was a tribute to her prominence that when the prestigious Cosmos Club in Washington finally deigned to admit women in 1988, she was one of the first 18 women to join.
As director of the Women's Bureau until 1969, Dr. Keyserling was in the forefront of efforts to obtain and enforce Federal legislation banning sex discrimination in employment.
It was a task that had its surreal moments, like the time she participated in a White House conference whose major concern seemed to be whether Playboy clubs would be forced to hire men as "bunnies."
For all her official accomplishments, Dr. Keyserling may have made her most powerful impact on social policy after she left the Government. She supervised a vast study of commercial day-care operations for the National Council of Jewish Women, producing a highly critical 1972 report, "Window on Day Care," that became the national blueprint for changes in such programs.
Besides her brother, she is survived by another brother, Amos Dublin of Norwich, Vt. Her husband died in 1987.

HEADLINE: Face the Failure of Racial Preferences

BYLINE: By Newt Gingrich
and Ward Connerly; Newt Gingrich is Speaker of the House of Representatives. Ward Connerly is chairman of the American Civil Rights Institute and a University of California regent.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In August 1963, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave heartfelt voice to his dream of a world where children are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin. A few months later, in May 1964, President Lyndon Johnson told the graduating class of the University of Michigan, "The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents."
 Unfortunately, three decades and $5.4 trillion of Federal Government spending later, Dr. King's dream still remains unfulfilled and nearly all of America knows that the Great Society has become an expensive failed tribute to the collective liberal imagination. Over the years, Federal welfare programs for the poor were enacted that created and sustained an illusion of activity but that, in reality, did more harm than good. 
 Even worse, a complicated set of Government rules and regulations were developed in almost every area of life, the intent of which was to eliminate discrimination. Yet the cruel fact has been that Government has brought about nearly as much discrimination as it has eliminated -- just in a different form -- and has masked the very real problems that still exist.
 President Clinton's speech on race yesterday in San Diego was actually a missed opportunity to address these issues; there was little indication that his advisory board on race includes anyone who will critically examine the impact of racial preferences on society. But more important, we wish he could have laid out a plan for real education reform that would produce genuine equality of opportunity for all.
Let us take a look at the record. Welfare spending is more than eight times what it was in 1965, adjusted for inflation, and it's time to ask, What do our children have to show for it? Well, for starters, over four million more of them are now living in poverty -- 43 percent of all black children and 41 percent of all Hispanic children. Violent crime has skyrocketed, especially in the inner cities.
But for evidence of the Great Society's greatest failure, look no further than the current state of public education and President Clinton's politically expedient but totally indefensible support for racially based "Band-Aid" measures. Rather than face up to the catastrophic failure of inner-city educational systems and deal honestly with their essential problems, the President, like others holding on to this failed system, refuses to reform a system that fails morally as well as practically.
Like so many whose political fortunes depend on unions and bureaucracy, Mr. Clinton, sadly, refuses to acknowledge that the ill-conceived education policies of the 1960's deserted the children who needed help the most.
The education bureaucracy won't concede that, despite spending trillions of dollars on education over the past 30 years, American children are further behind today. It doesn't want to admit that the S.A.T. scores of African-American children, which average 100 points less than the scores of white children, are the direct result of the current policies. The National Education Association doesn't want to bear the blame for the fact that 40 percent of all 9-year-olds can't meet basic literacy standards or that 66 percent of African-American fourth graders fail national geography standards. These are not racial inadequacies, they are education inadequacies.
Nor will the education bureaucracy admit that low-income high school students are giving up on school in ever increasing numbers. The fact is that disadvantaged children are not receiving the "knowledge to enrich their minds and to enlarge their talents," as President Johnson promised. Instead, many education and minority leaders cling to a system of racial preferences using the diplomas of an arbitrary few to paper over what has become a national human catastrophe. For the sake of all our children, these people must face the cold, hard truth: Every time we use racial preferences to effect change, it is proof that we have failed a child somewhere.
President Clinton refuses to face the core of the problem: Money without reform will not educate our children. Look at the spending in inner-city schools today. The District of Columbia spends more money to educate its children than any state in the country -- more than $9,000 per student per year -- and yet its children rank at or near the bottom of national test scores. Something is very wrong with the schools of our nation's capital; both the teachers and their students are being shortchanged by a stagnant, uncaring educational bureaucracy.
Government-imposed quotas are no substitute for education reform. Racial preferences may offer an illusory way out for a few students, but sadly, the vast majority of children in the inner cities are being deprived by their schools of the opportunity to go to college. We've all seen recently the dramatic drop in minority admissions to the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Texas School of Law, institutions that did away with race-based preferences. This shamefully underscores how much race and race alone has been used instead of merit in our halls of higher education.
Supporters of preferences see those numbers as vindication for their claims of racism in America; they are simply wrong. The real villain in this 30-year morality play isn't bigotry or the University of California Board of Regents or the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The original affirmative action policies were indeed well-intentioned efforts to redress centuries of racial discrimination. Yet they have been perverted over the years. The racial preferences used in their name have been used as masks to avoid real reform. They have become an excuse to perpetuate an inner-city system to cheat those children most in need out of a real future.
Failing to save these children should cause shame to all Americans. No one has chosen to help our underprivileged develop their talents. No one has insisted they have schools in which they can succeed. As a country, we all share that shame, but the creation of a small minority professional class through racial preferences to ease elitist guilt is an unacceptable and unconscionable alternative. And applying racial preferences to business practices is no better.
Yet the education bureaucracy warns that "radical" reform could harm children. It is difficult to imagine that any of the education proposals being offered today could do any more damage than the failed policies of the last 30 years.
There are promising solutions: In the 104th Congress, for the first time ever, a legitimate school voucher initiative for the children of the District of Columbia was passed in the House; there were enough votes to pass it in the Senate.
 Unfortunately, unions, resistant to change, prevented it from coming to a vote. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, has introduced a similar measure this year. Is giving poor parents the same opportunity as wealthy ones to send their children to the school of their choice a risky venture?
Is giving poor parents the opportunity to send their children to a safe school truly dangerous or just threatening to those dependent on the status quo? Is it harmful to the future of our children to demand that they be able to read before they are passed on, or do real standards bring too many of the failures of the current bureaucratic system to light? Does lowering the standards of graduate school admissions for certain individuals really address inequality of opportunity or simply give one group a place at the table while trampling on the basic rights of another? Do we bring the people of this country closer together when we reject one of America's most basic principles -- the notion that people should be judged individually on merit, not collectively by the color of their skin -- or do we breed new resentment and doubt?
Education is the key to a productive, healthy citizenship. But our system of racial preferences is the wrong door. The failed Great Society policies have devastated and divided two generations. We have seen how Government-imposed racial preferences actually stand in the way of true educational reform. The President must abandon the misguided belief that our society should ever use discrimination to end discrimination.

Atlantic Salmon Stocking Program Runs Into Opposition

BYLINE: By Pete Bodo 

DATELINE: PULASKI, N.Y.

 BODY:
Standing alongside a concrete tank under a fluorescent light in the Salmon River fish hatchery, it was hard to imagine that the shallow tray built into the tank might hold an important key to the future of the complex and currently troubled Lake Ontario cold-water fishery.
The surface of the tray was smaller than that of the average desk, but the water in it was black with Atlantic salmon fry -- 35,000 of the little critters were packed into the tray so densely that it resembled a long drawer filled with finishing nails, covered by an inch or two of water. This tray of tiny fish, under the right circumstances, could provide the foundation for a blue-ribbon fishery on an entire river system, and eventually generate millions of dollars in economic activity along its banks. 
 And, as if that were not enough of a responsibility, the Atlantic salmon fry's ability to survive looms as another crucial battle in the ongoing effort to restore native species in environments where they have either been eradicated, suppressed or replaced by non-indigenous species.
In fact, the next tank over was loaded with juvenile chinook salmon (a transplanted Pacific species) that would compete with the Atlantic salmon for food (in the lake) and spawning habitat (in the tributaries during the fall spawning run). Some of the other tanks were brimming with fingerling steelhead, coho salmon and brown trout, all non-native species that played key roles in making Lake Ontario and its tributary rivers one of the continent's most fertile and diverse fisheries -- the great melting pot of fisheries.
"I'm always amazed when I stroll through this hatchery," said Fran Verdoliva, a former fishing guide who now works as the program coordinator for the Salmon River Corridor on behalf of New York State. "This represents an abundance of riches, and I guess you could have a lot worse problems than that."
Nevertheless, this fishery is facing the worst potential result of its abundance and diversity.
Since the 1960's, Lake Ontario has made an astounding recovery from nearly terminal pollution. Ironically, problems created by the increased water clarity and purity, combined with the number of predators introduced into the lake by the massive chinook, coho and steelhead stocking programs of recent years, have led to a steady decline in the population of the most important forage fish in the lake, the alewife. Even the alewife (a member of the herring family) is a colonist that probably established itself in Lake Ontario through the canal system created to facilitate shipping, and then flourished through the odd ecology of pollution.
Biologists attribute erratic survival rates of stocked chinook salmon and the diminished carrying capacity of the lake to the decrease of alewives. In turn, the growing paucity of chinooks has led many anglers, including commercial charter-boat captains, to target steelhead more vigorously. As a result, far fewer steelhead are returning to rivers such as the storied Salmon River to sustain a once-robust fall and winter fishery.
The repercussions of these events are being felt at the very top of the food chain. Local businesses have been hurt, but many people still resist any change in the liberal stocking and management policies established back when the lake was chockablock with alewives and the chinook fishery was booming. The majority of anglers, shop owners and outfitters also oppose the implementation of management techniques such as reduced bag limits, or changes in the dates or duration of the open season.
On a recent visit to the Salmon River, I saw far fewer anglers than in the past. But despite the obvious decline in both fish and anglers, establishments like the popular C & M Diner were collecting signatures on a petition opposing any reduction in the daily bag limit of three steelhead.
Partly for such reasons, some people see the Atlantic salmon stocking program as another threat to the status quo rather than as an intriguing restoration effort whose time has come because of the changing nature of the lake and the fishery.
Proponents of the program argue that it may be a crucial first step toward developing something valuable that the area presently lacks: a viable summer fishery for one of the the most highly prized of game fish.
The fry in the Salmon River hatchery will be stocked this spring in a branch of Fish Creek, a river system that was once abundant with the extinct strain of Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon. The fry will then have to survive in the river, a long downstream passage to the lake, competition with the Pacific species in that crowded environment, and a daunting 70-mile return trip through a veritable maze of dams and lakes at spawning time. The fish will have their work cut out for them, but that's life -- and politics -- in the great melting pot.

HEADLINE: Vallone Seeks Sanctions on Nations Persecuting Christians

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
In an effort that has alarmed many New York City business leaders, the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, has introduced a measure that would bar the city from doing business with companies that operate in 15 countries that he says routinely persecute Christians, including China, Egypt, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.
The measure, introduced last month, also calls for the city to withdraw deposits and investments from banks that do business with those countries. If passed, the bill would make more than one-third of the world's business population off-limits to the city, which has the fourth-largest governmental budget in the country. Only the Federal Government, California and New York State have larger budgets. 
 Business leaders have begun a campaign to fight the bill, saying the city's economy could be devastated if businesses were forced to choose between their global markets and their New York City contracts.
But to Mr. Vallone, the most urgent concerns are moral, not financial. He said that the 15 countries named in his bill frequently imprison, torture, enslave or kill Christians for practicing their faith, and that the city should use its economic might to stop the persecution.
With the backing of the influential Mr. Vallone, the bill is likely to make its way onto Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's desk. Aides to the Mayor said he generally supported the bill's intentions but would not commit to details until after hearings had been held and he could determine the full scope of the problem and the impact on businesses.
Mr. Vallone, a Roman Catholic who keeps plaques engraved with Bible quotations on his desk, is keeping step with a national movement to draw attention to the persecution of Christians in Communist and some Muslim nations. His bill is actually stronger than a measure introduced last month in Congress, which calls for narrow Federal sanctions against offending countries.
New York officials have long sought to curry favor with the city's immigrant population by issuing resolutions condemning renegade governments. And the city has occasionally put economic weight behind its principles. The city's municipal pension fund is among the investors that subscribe to the MacBride Principles, antidiscrimination guidelines for companies that do business in Northern Ireland. And in the 1980's, the City Comptroller, Harrison J. Goldin, worked to have city pension funds divest themselves of investments in companies doing business in South Africa.
Now, with measures like the Vallone bill and a similar bill enacted last month against the military regime in Myanmar, the City Council is again trying to use economic muscle to promote human rights.
If approved, the bill would effectively ban the city from working with business powerhouses like Time Warner, Pepsico, General Motors, Mobil and Chase Manhattan, business leaders and city officials said. It would also prohibit the city from working with some of world's largest design and engineering companies, like Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, and Skanska, a worldwide construction company based in Stockholm with offices in New York, officials from the industry said.
"No business in New York City would go unaffected if this bill is passed," said Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, who said he planned to meet with city leaders to lobby against it.
"Once again," Mr. Kiley said, "businesses are being singled out as the bad guy. If they can't get at the offending country at the City Council base, they're taking it out on companies. This is a kind of old and not very desirable tradition of isolationism and know-nothingism cloaked in morality."
But New York City is not alone in its efforts. Last month, New York joined 18 other cities and states in passing legislation to restrict their governments from doing business with banks and other companies in Myanmar because of abuses by its military Government.
When Mayor Giuliani signed the bill several weeks ago, he pointed out that the city has tremendous economic power to pressure oppressive foreign regimes to change. He said that as soon as the city saw changes in Myanmar, the city's relationship with companies that do business there would resume.
But business leaders say they are being wrongly singled out, saying companies have indicated that they would rather give up city contracts to stay competitive worldwide.
Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, which represents 300 members in the design, construction and real estate industry, said that in his industry alone more than $2 billion in annual export business would be compromised by the Myanmar bill. "The city's building industry certainly is not in favor of the actions of some foreign governments, nor do we support corrupt or ruthless governments," Mr. Anderson said. "But local legislation in the city of New York is not the answer."
Besides China, Egypt, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, the bill singles out Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Pakistan, Morocco, Nigeria, North Korea, the Sudan, Turkey and Vietnam. Under the law, city purchasers would be banned from buying cars, computers or petroleum from multinational corporations active in the countries.
City Councilman Thomas K. Duane, a Democrat of Manhattan, praised Mr. Vallone's efforts, calling it a moral issue for the city.
"Just like in South Africa and in Northern Ireland, New York City can stand as a leader in the battle for human rights around the world," Mr. Duane said.
Representatives of countries listed in the Vallone bill have been scrambling to deny that their Governments persecute Christians.
"We have many foreign workers in the Kingdom and they are treated as guests," Jamal I. Nasef, director of information at the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, said recently in a written statement, "and every consideration is given for their needs, as long as they abide by the Sharia Law," a legal system based on the Koran.
Dan O'Flaherty, vice president of the National Trade Council in Washington, which represents more than 600 businesses, said that if the proliferation of local sanctions persisted, companies would consider banding together to file a lawsuit to determine whether the laws were legal.
"The Constitution reserved foreign policy decisions to the President and the executive branch," he said. "The argument would be that our relationships with all of these countries is a Presidential prerogative, not that of municipalities."
But Mr. Vallone has a clear vision of where the city stands with the Constitution. "To those who say, why are you meddling in foreign affairs, that's outrageous," he said. "No one can tell me or any other individual in this city how we can and should invest our money."

Another Act in the Baseball Follies

 BODY:
BOB COSTAS of NBC Sports lives in St. Louis and says he will be in attendance at today's Indians-Cardinals interleague game. Still, he has some misgivings about baseball's newest wrinkle and agreed to answer some questions about it. 

 Q. What are your thoughts on interleague play?
A.I favor the concept of interleague play but as part of a comprehensive plan that makes long-range sense, not this slapdash deal that baseball has thrown together with its usual lack of thought.
Q. What's wrong with the present plan?
A. First off, let's grant the obvious. These games do offer some novelty appeal, and some undeniably exciting and interesting matchups -- Mets versus Yanks, Orioles versus Braves, and so on. But over all, it's a hodgepodge. There are games played under two sets of rules, unequal numbers of home and road games for teams in the same division, different sets of opponents for teams competing for the same wild-card spot, a jagged travel schedule filled with two-game series created to accommodate the interleague schedule, a further diminishing of games played within your own division and a September schedule that includes interleague games at the expense of head-to-head divisional matchups.
This is part of a continuing disregard for the integrity of the pennant races, which the balanced schedule and wild cards have already made a mockery of. And even on its own terms, baseball can't get simple things right. If they are going to play these games right now, why use home-team rules? If the idea is to give fans a glimpse of the other league and its style of play, why not play interleague games without the designated hitter in Cleveland but with the d.h. in St. Louis?
Give fans a true look at the other league. This would be especially beneficial in National League parks, because without the d.h. rule some of the biggest American League stars -- players fans presumably want to see -- either won't play or must play out of position. A little thought could have led baseball to this conclusion, but a little thought seems to be too much to ask.
It reminds me of when baseball finally ended its bitter strike in the spring of 1995 and then announced a 144-game schedule, immediately transforming an already-damaged season into a historical anomaly. This in the sport most dependent upon records and history. How much thought and cooperation would it have taken to schedule 10 doubleheaders per team that season, label them two-for-the-price-of-one days as a "we're sorry" to the fans and thus create a 154-game season that would have had a quirky, throwback appeal?
Then, if Tony Gwynn had hit .400 that season, no problem -- it would have been in the same number of games as Ted Williams's .406 in 1941. And if Ken Griffey Jr. had hit 62 homers -- true, not the same schedule as Roger Maris's, but exactly the same as Babe Ruth's -- it would have been interesting and valid. Instead, baseball wound up with 144 games, which fit into no context at all.
Q. What, in your view, is the way to approach interleague play?
A. As part of a radical realignment. Thirty-two teams are inevitable, although it will further dilute play. Still, it's a workable number in terms of markets, divisions and scheduling. In fact, the owners should have held expansion back as a bargaining chip with the players, promising four new teams and 100 new jobs, but only in return for significant economic concessions and cooperation in other areas. But that's another story.
Anyway, they should go to 32 and pledge to hold it there for 20 years at a minimum. Some teams -- the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox, White Sox, Cubs, Cardinals and others -- should never lose their American League or National League identities, but the expansion teams and about a dozen existing teams can go anywhere that makes geographic and economic sense. A few teams that are truly not viable in their present locations should be allowed to move in the interest of long-term stability.
Once the 32 teams are in place, arrange them in four 8-team divisions (East and West in each league) as dictated by geography, history and potential rivalries. Agree on a unified set of rules regarding the d.h. and then play a schedule like this: 13 games against six of the seven teams in your division and 12 games against the seventh for a total of 90. Then add six games -- one series home and away each season -- against the eight teams in the other division of your league for a total of 48. And finally, to bring the grand total to 162, 24 interleague games played under a rotating, alternate-year format.
Under the rotation, teams would play three games against each of the eight teams in one division of the other league and then repeat the process against the other division the following year. For example, the Yankees would play four three-game series at home against National League West teams in a given year while visiting the other four teams in that division for three games apiece. The following season, they would play the National League East. And while the Yankees would play the Dodgers every other year, home-field rotation provides that each team visits the other's park once every four years.
This approach insures that every interleague series remains special, with the once-every-four-year visits by superstars truly anticipated. At the same time, the travel and scheduling makes sense, league and division identities still exist and it's fair, because all your division foes play the same schedule.
Obviously, we permit no wild cards, so you would have four true pennant races, with the winners advancing straight to the League Championship Series. Under this plan, you've modernized with major realignment and substantial interleague play, but you've preserved the concept of real pennant races, something that was once distinctive to baseball and should be restored.
Do I think this will happen? No chance. Baseball will go to 32 all right, but will break it up into eight 4-team divisions in which it will be impossible to play a meaningful division schedule and in which the significance, prestige and drama of winning will be virtually nonexistent. Then baseball will dismiss anyone who points out the absurdity of it all as a purist.
Q. You've been called a purist yourself.
A. This automatic labeling of people who have legitimate objections to the recent changes in baseball as purists or traditionalists is a mindless way to frame the issue. It is a caricature that keeps people from dealing with the substance of the argument, which is usually what people do when their own arguments are lacking in substance.
Now, is tradition more important in baseball than in any other team sport? Yes, and I think it's instructive that the only unqualified success in baseball in recent years is the movement to new/old parks like Camden Yards or Jacobs Field or the return to grass, and the feel of an earlier era, in St. Louis, which suggests that a significant part of the game's appeal is a connection to the past.
So, tradition should be respected, but that's not the same thing as being tradition-bound. My objection is not that baseball is changing. It should change, in some cases radically. My objection is that these new steps are so poorly thought out. Let's suppose there is a consensus that welfare reform or tax reform is needed. Does that mean there is no debate over the best way to go about it?
This is where baseball fails. The notion of change is fine, but that doesn't mean all changes are for the better or that simply labeling something progressive means that it has been well-conceived and executed. There are many intelligent and decent individuals in baseball, but collectively baseball's actions often reflect not insight but desperation, with little apparent belief in, or appreciation of, the uniqueness of its own game.
Accordingly, the silliest argument of all is the one that goes like this: "Baseball's in trouble. We've got to do something to revive it." Yes, baseball is in trouble, but not necessarily because it needed fundamental changes in its competitive structure. In 1993, just four years ago, with no interleague play, with four 7-team divisions and no wild cards, baseball broke all its attendance records (even discounting the expansion teams) and TV ratings were generally higher than they have been since.
Baseball is in trouble now mostly because of the sheer bungling of the owners and the shortsightedness and selfish agendas of the owners and players both. This finally caught up with them, and alienated millions of fans. Baseball is still paying for it.
Now we are supposed to accept unquestioningly the prescriptions for recovery offered by those who created the mess in the first place? This is like finding yourself in the emergency room, looking up, and discovering that the guy who poisoned you is now the attending physician. It's sort of funny, provided you don't care about the game.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Clinton's Speech on Race in America

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, June 14

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the text of President Clinton's speech on race in America delivered today to graduates of the University of California, San Diego:
Today we celebrate your achievements at a truly golden moment for America. The cold war is over and freedom is now ascendant around the globe, with more than half of the people in this whole world living under governments of their choosing for the very first time. Our economy is the healthiest in a generation and the strongest in the world. Our culture, our science, our technology promise unimagined advances and exciting new careers. Our social problems, from crime to poverty, are finally bending to our efforts. 
 Of course, there are still challenges for you out there. Beyond our borders, we must battle terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the prospect of new diseases and environmental disaster. Here at home, we must ensure that every child has the chance you have had to develop your God-given capacities. We cannot wait for them to get in trouble to notice them.
We must continue to fight the scourge of gangs and crime and drugs. We must prepare for the retirement of the baby boom generation so that we can reduce that child poverty rate that Coleen talked about. We must harness the forces of science and technology for the public good, the entire American public.
But I believe the greatest challenge we face among all those that Coleen talked about is also our greatest opportunity. Of all the questions of discrimination and prejudice that still exist in our society, the most perplexing one is the oldest, and in some ways today the newest, the problem of race.
Can we fulfill the promise of America by embracing all our citizens of all races, not just at a university, where people have the benefit of enlightened teachers and the time to think and grow and get to know each other, but in the daily life of every American community? In short, can we become one America in the 21st century?
I know and I've said before that money cannot buy this goal. Power cannot compel it. Technology cannot create it. This is something that can come only from the human spirit, the spirit we saw when the choir of many races sang as a gospel choir. Today the state of Hawaii, which has a senator and a congresswoman present here, has no majority racial or ethnic group. It is a wonderful place of exuberance and friendship and patriotism.
Within the next three years here in California, no single race or ethnic group will make up a majority of the state's population. Already five of our largest school districts draw students from over 100 different racial and ethnic groups. At this campus, 12 Nobel Prize winners have taught or studied from nine different countries. A half-century from now, when your own grandchildren are in college, there will be no majority race in America.
Now, we know what we will look like. But what will we be like? Can we be one America, respecting, even celebrating our differences, but embracing even more what we have in common? Can we define what it means to be an American, not just in terms of the hyphens showing our ethnic origins, but in terms of our primary allegiance to the values America stands for and values we really live by?
Our hearts long to answer yes, but our history reminds us that it will be hard. The ideals that bind us together are as old as our nation, but so are the forces that pull us apart. Our founders sought to form a more perfect union. The humility and hope of that phrase is the story of America, and it is our mission today. . . .
Though minorities have more opportunities than ever today, we still see evidence of bigotry from the desecration of houses of worship, whether they be churches, synagogues or mosques, to demeaning talk in corporate suites. There is still much work to be done by you, members of the class of 1997.
But those who say we cannot transform the problem of prejudice into the promise of unity forget how far we have come, and I cannot believe they have ever seen a crowd like you. When I look at you, it is almost impossible for me even to remember my own life. I grew up in the high drama of the cold war in the patriotic South. Black and white southerners alike wore our nation's uniform in defense of freedom against communism, and they fought and died together from Korea to Vietnam. But back home, I went to segregated schools, swam in segregated public pools, sat in all-white sections at the movies, and traveled through small towns in my state that still marked restrooms and water fountains "White" and "Colored."
By the grace of God, I had a grandfather with just a grade-school education, but the heart of a true American, who taught me that it was wrong. And by the grace of God, there were brave African-Americans like Congressman John Lewis, who risked their lives time and time again to make it right. And there were white Americans like Congressman Bob Filner, a freedom rider on the bus with John Lewis, in the long, noble struggle for civil rights, who knew that it was a struggle to free white people, too. . . .
As you have shown us today, our diversity will enrich our lives in non-material ways, deepening our understanding of human nature and human differences, making our communities more exciting, more enjoyable, more meaningful.
That is why I have come here today, to ask the American people to join me in a great national effort to perfect the promise of America for this new time as we seek to build our more perfect union. . . .
Let me say that I know that for many white Americans, this conversation may seem to exclude them or threaten them. That must not be so. I believe white Americans have just as much to gain as anybody else from being a part of this endeavor, much to gain from an America where we finally take responsibility for all our children, so that they at last can be judged, as Martin Luther King hoped, not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
What is it that we must do? For four-and-a-half years now, I have worked to prepare America for the 21st century, with a strategy of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community of all our citizens. To succeed in each of these areas, we must deal with the realities and the perceptions affecting all racial groups in America.
First, we must continue to expand opportunity. Full participation in our strong and growing economy is the best antidote to envy, despair and racism. We must press forward to move millions more from poverty and welfare to work, to bring the spark of enterprise to inner cities, to redouble our efforts to reach those rural communities prosperity has passed by. And most important of all, we simply must give our young people the finest education in the world. . . .
In our efforts to extend economic and educational opportunity to all our citizens, we must consider the role of affirmative action. I know affirmative action has not been perfect in America. That's why, two years ago, we began an effort to fix the things that are wrong with it. But when used in the right way, it has worked. . . .
Over the coming year, I want to lead the American people in a great and unprecedented conversation about race. . . . What do I really hope we will achieve as a country? If we do nothing more than talk, it will be interesting, but it won't be enough. If we do nothing more than propose disconnected acts of policy, it will be helpful, but it won't be enough. . . .
We have torn down the barriers in our laws. Now we must break down the barriers in our lives, our minds and our hearts. More than 30 years ago, at the high tide of the civil rights movement, the Kerner Commission said we were becoming two Americas, one white, one black, separate and unequal. Today we face a different choice. Will we become not two, but many Americas, separate, unequal and isolated? Or will we draw strength from all our people and our ancient faith in equality and human dignity, to become the world's first truly multiracial democracy? That is the unfinished work of our times, to lift the burden of race and redeem the promise of America.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
No Realignment Proposal Can Satisfy the Wishes of Every Team

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Now isn't this another fine mess Major League Baseball has created.
The owners extract -- extort? -- $125 million from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who to everyone's knowledge will be located in the southeast corner of the United States, and tell them that when they begin play next year, geography will be turned on its head and they will play in a division that stretches to the northwest corner of the United States. 
 The owners take another $125 million from the Arizona Diamondbacks and, after a couple of years of effectively clever lobbying by their managing partner, tell them they can take their balls and bats and play in the National League, only now they want to say "never mind" and bounce them to the American League.
Both of these fledgling franchises have grounds for bitter complaint, the Diamondbacks if they are forced to play in the American League, the Devil Rays if they are forced to play in the A.L. West. But unless someone concocts a plan currently beyond the owners' imagination, one of these teams will begin life in the big leagues in a foul mood. Plans in debate would solve the Devil Rays' problem only if they create one for the Diamondbacks.
While these neophytes anxiously await their fate, there is an older franchise that really has become the forgotten child of Major League Baseball. No matter which way they turn, the Texas Rangers get the economic knife where it hurts.
The Rangers, with an address in the central time zone, play in a division with three teams whose clocks read Pacific time. Not only do the Rangers have to beam many of their games back home at hours that are late even for Texans, but they also can't play the team they want to play more than any other. While every other pair of geographical rivals play this season in the first interleague games in baseball history, the Rangers don't play the Houston Astros because they are out of alignment as far as the divisions go. The Rangers are in the A.L. West, the Astros in the N.L. Central and never their schedules shall meet.
"We made a giant mistake in baseball many years ago when we didn't put the two Texas teams together," said Tom Schieffer, the Rangers' president, who was not in baseball many years ago. "I would like to resolve it by both of us being in the same division. If we did that, we'd have a natural rivalry and that would be an advantage. It's a little hard to see how that's going to come about, but that's what I would hope."
Not everyone agrees that teams in geographical proximity should play in the same league. "Vince Namoli violently disagrees," Schieffer said, referring to the Devil Rays' managing partner, who wants his team to be the only A.L. team in the Southeast rather than create an N.L. Southeast rivalry. "But I think they would be much better off playing the Marlins and with Atlanta just up the road. He doesn't see it that way and it's his franchise, but I think he would develop much better rivalries.
"Texas is no different. The people in Houston think they do things better than the people in Dallas-Fort Worth and vice versa. That's what a rivalry is. If you put us in a situation where our fans could get in their car and drive down to Houston or Houston fans could drive up here and we were in a hot pennant race, it would help the rivalry."
Under one of the realignment plans in debate, the Astros would replace Arizona in the N.L. West. The Astros aren't leaping at the chance, but one baseball official said they are not as adamantly opposed to that idea as they are to changing leagues.
"Everybody has their desires, what their first choice is," the executive said. "We wouldn't want to switch leagues, but if that was necessary to make things work out, we would consider doing that."
The Rangers, though, remain opposed to another plan under discussions -- an unbalanced schedule, in which a team would play more games against division rivals and fewer against other teams. "We have been the ones primarily in opposition to it in the A.L.," Schieffer said. "They made a commitment to us when we went into the West Division that we wouldn't play an unbalanced schedule, at least not until 2000."
Playing even more games on the road against the Western teams would only make the Rangers' radio and TV schedule less desirable. "We have to deal with that issue some way," Schieffer said. "Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that will benefit everybody. We certainly don't want to stand in the way of what's best for baseball. At the same time, we have to consider what's best for our fans."
That, Schieffer said, would be realignment based on a North-South split, grouping teams in the same time zones. "If you did that," he added, "you'd have more games in prime time, and I think that would be of benefit to everyone."
The realignment committee, facing a ticklish task, is supposed to submit a report to the owners by the end of the month. To satisfy the Rangers, Devil Rays, Diamondbacks and others (Kansas City wants to be in the same division as St. Louis), it will have to practice prestidigitation.
 
Pinch-Hitting Philosophy
 Matt Franco, Jerry Lynch said, is to be congratulated.
"Tell him if he has a bad week, I had weeks where I was 0 for 7," Lynch said. "But you can't let it get you. The next week you can be 3 for 4. You wonder if you'll ever come through in the clutch again, but it happens."
Franco is the Mets' super pinch-hitter. Since having the precise stretch that Lynch mentioned, 0 for 7, Franco has had 11 hits in his last 16 pinch-hitting appearances, including 5 in his last 5. His pinch-hitting average is a dazzling .478.
Lynch knows about these things because in his day, a 13-year career with Pittsburgh and Cincinnati from 1954-66, he was a super pinch-hitter. He holds the National League record with 18 career pinch-hit home runs and is tied for the major league record with 25 runs batted in for one season.
"I had no choice," he said, explaining his career as a pinch-hitter. "I hurt my arm in 1956 with the Pirates and was on the disabled list most of the season. I went to Cincinnati in 1957 and Birdie Tebbetts said you have just become a professional pinch-hitter. With a wife and four kids to feed, I had no choice. You had to do anything if you wanted to stay in the big leagues."
Lynch, who lives in Georgia and watches the Braves on television, said a good pinch-hitter can be just as important as a relief pitcher. But he said he would draw the line at designated hitting.
"I'd hate that," he said. "Pop up, go sit on the bench, pop up again. Make four mistakes in a day. That would be awful. You can't get yourself primed up four times in a game. When you pinch-hit, the game is on the line."
 
Bonds Puts Team Before Self
 Barry Bonds is fully prepared to sacrifice himself for the good of the team. Given his way of thinking, he has already done a terrific job. The San Francisco Giants have been in first place since May 11, and before that they were either in first or no more than two games from first. Yet Bonds has struggled at bat, entering last night's game with a .261 average and 12 home runs.
"I'm not really concerned," Bonds said. "I've done well throughout my career and always come up short. I've put up big numbers and been in last place. If this is what it takes to win, I'm all for it."
No one really expected the Giants to be serious contenders, let alone be in first, especially after they traded Matt Williams last winter.
"Sure, I'd love to have Matt Williams," Bonds said. "Anybody who wouldn't might as well kill yourself. But you have to play with the parts given you. If you allow that to dictate your season, then you might as well turn in your uniform and not play."
The questions Bonds hears about the Giants' unexpected success -- not unexpected to him, he said -- do not bother him.
"I think you get more questions when you have a great team and you're not winning than when you have a team that isn't expected to win," he said. "We had a lot of unanswered questions when we had all of us and we were in last place."
 
Ryan Mulls a Run for Office
 Nolan Ryan retired four years ago but only from baseball. Ryan, who pitched 324 victories, including 7 no-hitters, and struck out 5,714 in 5,387 innings in his 26-year career, is busier than he was in his playing days. When he played, he worked every fourth or fifth day. Now he is involved with commercial endorsements, a bank, a cattle operation, the Rangers and the Texas parks and wildlife commission. Gov. George W. Bush appointed him to the commission. Ryan's next step in Texas politics may take him higher in state government.
"A lot of people are talking to me about being Commissioner of Agriculture," he said, discussing an elective state post. "I am visiting with people about it. I have no idea if I want to take on something like that. The election is next year and I have until March to make a decision."
If he runs, the 50-year-old Ryan said, it will be as a Republican. "I'm not a Republican," he said, setting the record straight. "I don't belong to either party. But I guess they consider me an independent Republican by nature."

HEADLINE: Bilingualism At Hostos Is Receiving A Hard Look

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Thirty years ago, when Herman Badillo, as Bronx Borough President, first dreamed of opening a college in the economically depressed South Bronx, he wanted a college in which Spanish-speaking students could receive degrees as quickly as possible, learning English while taking other courses taught in Spanish.
Thus was born Eugenio Maria de Hostos Community College of the City University of New York, a rare experiment in bilingual higher education in America. 
 Today the success of that experiment is in question. City University's trustees, Mr. Badillo among them, accused Hostos last month of giving diplomas to students who do not know English, and voted that all university students must pass an English writing test to receive a degree.
"If you can't express yourself in English, you shouldn't graduate," said Mr. Badillo, who proposed the writing test requirement as vice chairman of the university's board of trustees and is Hostos's leading critic. "Bilingual means two languages, English and Spanish. You have to be fluent in English to have a career. No one would ever have approved Hostos if they thought it meant monolingual."
While bilingual education is widely used in elementary and secondary schools, few colleges have picked it up. In Florida, Texas and California, for example, all of which have large immigrant populations, college courses taught in English are the rule.
"We want students who are proficient in English," said David Spence, executive vice chancellor for the state university system of Florida, who said college bilingual education was not a big issue in his state.
And at Boricua College in upper Manhattan, which describes itself as the only four-year, bilingual liberal arts college in the United States, all classes are in English, although faculty members and administrators are required to be bilingual so they can help students with language problems.
"We don't believe we should give students the option of taking a degree in the United States of Spanish courses, because we don't believe it would be helpful to them," Roland Marrero, a student services official at the college, said.
At Hostos, which straddles the Grand Concourse in the Bronx just a mile from Yankee Stadium, and where more than three-quarters of the nearly 5,000 students are Hispanic, college officials defend their approach and say they are achieving their mission.
"The bilingual model has been effective in providing access to large numbers of students," the president of Hostos, Isaura Santiago Santiago, said in a recent interview in her office. "They've left here skilled. Our career programs are nationally recognized in a variety of fields. And we've been particularly effective in giving access to minorities."
"We should build on what people know, and teach them English," she added.
About 22 percent of the college's classes, mostly introductory subjects, are taught in Spanish, and many students spend term after term taking English-as-a-second-language courses. Some of the college's departments, like its highly respected health science programs, require that their students be proficient in English to enter.
Despite Hostos's success in areas like nursing and dental hygiene, where virtually all of its graduates pass state and national certification exams, English -- and passing the City University writing exam -- remains a stumbling block for many students. Although students at other City University colleges have similar difficulties, none of the other colleges have seen such large portions of its students repeatedly fail the university writing test. When the university offered the test to prospective Hostos graduates earlier this month, only 13 of the 125 who took it passed it.
Hostos is a tough place to run any education experiment. Not only do many students enter speaking little English, but many are poor and poorly educated.
On the writing placement examination given to all City University entering freshmen, fewer than 15 percent of Hostos's students passed last fall, a rate lower than at any other university college.
Teaching English to adults is not easy. Young children pick up new languages fairly naturally. Adults rarely, if ever, gain the proficiency that children do. Language experts have also found that adults who are more literate in their native language do better learning a second language than less educated adults.
"That's what makes this so complex," said Henry M. Levin, a Stanford University professor and expert in remedial education who is a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation in New York. "It's the dirty little secret; it's more a literacy problem."
Many immigrants who enter City University with limited English do quite well, passing the university writing test, excelling in their studies, sometimes graduating at the top of their classes and going on to elite graduate schools.
As immigrant students have flooded their campuses, City University professors say, their methods of teaching English to nonnative speakers have improved. One approach that is winning increasing attention involves placing students in courses like biology or history as quickly as possible and pairing those courses with English-as-a-second-language classes.
As in the bilingual approach, this pairing allows students to accumulate college credits at the same time they master English. Vocabulary and grammar drills are keyed to the paired course, and in some cases the textbook in the paired course may be used as an English reading text. Teachers who have used this approach say students learn English more rapidly because the readings cover topics they want to learn.
In yet another approach, City University has begun to introduce language immersion centers. Some applaud them as programs that allow students who know little English to concentrate in an English-only environment for five hours a day, 25 hours a week, before formally starting college. But others say the typical City University student knows at least some English and does not need the immersion, and that the immersion does not allow students to improve their English in an academic context.
At Hostos, students offer mixed views about the bilingual approach.
Maria R. Bosora, a 22-year-old public administration major who grew up in the Dominican Republic, said she might be better off taking fewer courses in Spanish. "This is the problem," she said. "I little speak English. My problem is I don't practice. At home I speak Spanish. All my family speaks Spanish. I think I would be better off if I took all English for practice."
But Julio Alcantara, a 43-year-old Hostos student who came to New York from the Dominican Republic 10 years ago, said the college should not change. "The bilingual system is supposed to work," said Mr. Alcantara, who is president-elect of Hostos's student government.
For now, Hostos and its bilingual approach remain an option at City University, although the university's chairwoman, Anne A. Paolucci, has set up a task force headed by Mr. Badillo to study the college.
Mr. Badillo, for one, is still not ready to give up on the notion of a bilingual college, and says it can work better than it has.
"Just because people have corrupted the process, doesn't mean it can't be done well," he said. "This doesn't mean we should throw this baby out with the bath water."

HEADLINE: Forest Service Proposal Would Protect Alaska's Tongass Forest;
Losing on Timber

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Poor Deal for the Tongass" (editorial, June 8) is an even poorer deal for taxpayers. According to the General Accounting Office, the Forest Service lost $100 million in its sale of Tongass National Forest timber from 1992 to 1994. 
 The economics of Tongass timbering is now even worse than a few years ago. Both of the pulp mills that consumed most of the Tongass's timber are now closed, victims of a worldwide glut of pulp and refusal to invest in anti-pollution technology.
The Forest Service's own economists predict that timber demand has plummeted to less than 100 million board feet annually. Nonetheless, the Forest Service wants to market 267 million board feet every year -- not because it cares about local communities, which rely more on recreation, tourism, fisheries and services than timbering, but because it wants to save the jobs of its own bureaucrats.

HEADLINE: Defending Affirmative Action, Clinton Urges Debate on Race

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, June 14

 BODY:
Speaking in a state that has led the movement against racial preference programs, President Clinton today made a broad appeal for racial reconciliation and vigorously defended affirmative action on college campuses. "We must not resegregate higher education," Mr. Clinton said.
In an address at the University of California at San Diego, Mr. Clinton began what he called a yearlong effort to lead America in a "great and unprecedented conversation about race" three decades after the Kerner Commission found that America was "moving towards two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal." 
 The President acknowledged that there was still "old and unfinished business" between black and white Americans. But he sought to reframe the debate in the context of demographic changes that he said now pose "many dilemmas of race and ethnicity." Predicting that in half a century there would be "no majority race in America," Mr. Clinton posed a choice:
"Will we become not two but many Americas, separate, unequal and isolated?" he asked at the university's commencement ceremonies. "Or will we draw strength from all our people and our ancient faith in the quality of human dignity to become the world's first truly multiracial democracy?" [Excerpts, Page 16.]
Mr. Clinton chose to underscore his remarks by beginning his focus on race relations at a campus of the University of California, a university system that moved in 1995 to prohibit the use of race or sex in hiring and admissions.
In a separate action, Californians last year approved Proposition 209, which bans consideration of race and sex in state hiring, contracting and education. Although a Federal appeals court in San Francisco upheld the constitutionality of the initiative in April, its provisions have been stayed pending further court appeals.
"Let me say, I know that the people of California voted to repeal affirmative action without any ill motive," Mr. Clinton said. "The vast majority of them simply did it with a conviction that discrimination and isolation are no longer barriers to achievement."
But he pointed to reports that the University of California has seen a significant drop in applications from minority students and, more recently, in the number accepted. "Minority enrollments in law school and other graduate programs are plummeting for the first time in decades," he said. "Assuming the same will likely happen in undergraduate education, we must not resegregate higher education or leave it to the private universities to do the public's work."
Again and again, students in gowns and mortarboards applauded as Mr. Clinton said that affirmative action had produced "a whole generation of professionals in fields that used to be exclusive clubs" including more black, Hispanic and Asian-American lawyers, judges, scientists, engineers and accountants.
Mr. Clinton held up the military as an example of successful affirmative action. "So much for the argument that excellence and diversity do not go hand in hand," he said.
Mr. Clinton offered to listen to opponents of affirmative action if they could find an alternative way to keep campuses diverse. "I would embrace it if I could find a better way," he said. "And to those of us who still support it, I say we should continue to stand for it."
In fact, opponents of affirmative action were highly critical of the speech because of Mr. Clinton's adherence to racial preference programs. While Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters in his home district in Georgia today that he would be willing to work with the President's newly appointed seven-member advisory panel on race, he also criticized its makeup and purpose: "I'm going to ask it to have hearings where folks who are different than the normal set of liberals are allowed to come and testify -- successful black businessmen and women, people who have risen on their own, people who are multiracial," Mr. Gingrich said. "It's Tiger Woods."
 A son of the south, Mr. Clinton has given long thought to questions of race in America and has called President Dwight D. Eisenhower's use of Federal troops to desegregate Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., the formative political experience of his youth. Some of the most striking speeches of Mr. Clinton's Presidency have concerned race.
Now stepping up his focus on race in his second term, the President has asked his advisory panel to work with him across the next year and also plans a series of town meetings and appearances such as one in September commemorating the integration of Central High School. At the end of the year, he promises to write a report to the nation.
Mr. Clinton made few concrete proposals today beyond a call for Congress to provide more financing for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. But he has indicated that he wants the year to produce proposals to deal with housing, education and economic opportunity, as well as the administration of justice.
"If we do nothing more than talk, it will be interesting but it won't be enough," he said today. "If we do nothing more than propose disconnected acts of policy it would be helpful but it won't be enough. But if 10 years from now people can look back and see that this year's honest dialogue and concerted action helped to lift the burdens of race from our children's future we will have given a precious gift to America."
The reaction to Mr. Clinton's speech demonstrated the vast division of opinion on matters of race. Aside from the conservatives' criticism, civil rights groups called his speech a first step that needed to be followed with actions that go beyond sentiment and talk.
"An immediate and appropriate follow-up to the President's speech would be an increased effort by the Administration to enforce existing Federal civil rights protections that are being violated" by anti-affirmative action measures like the university system's new rules, said Thomas A. Saenz, the Los Angeles regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund.
In addition to Mr. Gingrich's remarks today, he also called the President's speech a "missed opportunity," in a joint opinion piece in Sunday's edition of The New York Times. He and Ward Connerly, a University of California regent who led the charge against affirmative action programs in the state, said in the article that Mr. Clinton should have laid out a plan for real education reform.
Mr.Connerly attended the President's speech and was sitting on a dignitaries platform.
Much of Mr. Clinton's speech was devoted to a sweeping review of the nation's history of discrimination from European settlers pushing Indians off their lands, to slavery to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
Mr. Clinton also vividly recalled his own childhood experience of segregation. "I grew up in the high drama of the cold war, in the patriotic South," he said. "Black and white Southerners alike wore our nation's uniform in defense of freedom against communism. They fought and died together, from Korea to Vietnam. But back home, I went to segregated schools, swam in segregated public pools, sat in all white sections at the movies and traveled through small towns in my state that marked restrooms and water fountains 'white' and 'colored."'
A Gallup Poll released earlier this week found that 58 percent of whites surveyed thought that the quality of life for black Americans had become better over the past decade, while only 33 percent of black respondents thought that it had. Asked if the Federal Government should make "every possible effort" to improve the social and economic position of minority groups, 59 percent of blacks, but only 34 percent of whites, said yes.
The White House has been considering the race initiative for months. Mr. Clinton examined data on racial attitudes assembled by his pollsters, and this week he had an array of scholars and civil rights leaders at the White House. Across the past week he and his speech writers have gone through draft after draft of his address, with the President sometimes rewriting passages and sometimes dictating the words he wanted into a tape recorder.
The President was polishing his final draft past midnight, aides said. Mr. Clinton said that early this morning his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, called him with her own last-minute criticisms of the final draft "which is a routine I have come to look forward to in life."

HEADLINE: The Times Rolls Its Presses In Manhattan One Last Time

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
The curtain rang down last night on the longest-running production on Broadway.
After 146 years, 93 of them in Times Square, The New York Times was printed in Manhattan for the final time. 
 In the culmination of planning begun in the 1980's to increase press capacity, add new sections and offer later news for readers in the metropolitan region, the pressroom under 43d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues rumbled its last.
At the end, where nine huge Goss presses whirred as recently as six months ago, there roared only a single half-century-old press tended by a crew of a baker's dozen, turning out about 5 percent of the news sections of the 1.64 million copies of the Sunday paper.
In all, some 80 pressmen, paper handlers, machinists, electricians, mailers, drivers and managers were involved in the final night of what had been the largest manufacturing operation in Manhattan.
Beginning today, The Times, with a weekday circulation of 1.1 million, will be printed for metropolitan area readers at its new $350 million, five-press plant in College Point, Queens, and at a $450 million, six-press plant in Edison, N.J., which has been operating since 1993.
The headquarters of The Times's news, editorial and business offices will remain at 229 West 43d Street.
Commenting on the transfer of production from Manhattan to College Point, where The Times employs about 500 people, Charles Millard, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said: "This should remind everyone that economic development in New York City includes five boroughs, not just one."
The city gave The Times $21.5 million in tax credits, grants and purchase options for the new plant. The long-term tax breaks were intended to keep the jobs in the city.
The conclusion of an era on 43d Street was tinged with sadness for many employees of The Times.
"The emotional portion of it is very difficult," said Tom Walber, the plant manager responsible for production. "There are tough guys in here, and they're crying."
Raymond Kelly, 57, a pressman for 40 years and the assistant general foreman of all pressroom operations for The Times, echoed Mr. Walber. "It's heartbreaking," Mr. Kelly said. "It's my adult lifetime."
In a formal statement to the entire staff on Friday, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher, took note of the inclination to sorrow over the end of production on 43d Street. "But," he wrote, "our history is one of constant renewal, and it teaches us that the passing of one tradition also marks the birth of a new and exciting era."
The Times, founded in 1851, has been printed since 1904 in Times Square and since 1913 at 229 West 43d Street. The final press run in Manhattan came on a night when the Disney Company's parade across West 42d Street and up Fifth Avenue underscored the profound changes that have reshaped the neighborhood in recent years.
"They're not going to change the name to Disney Square," Mr. Sulzberger asserted as he walked through the newsroom on Friday.
Gone are the decrepit movie theaters on 42d Street on the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. They have been replaced by rebuilt and renovated legitimate playhouses and an array of new shops and eating places calculated to attract family trade to a street whose past habitues gave it an unsavory reputation.
On West 43d Street, traffic will no longer be halted by huge Times tractor-trailers and smaller trucks tracing arabesques on the narrow thoroughfare before bucking backward into the loading bays to pick up their cargoes of newspapers.
"A lot of memories," said James Donald, 61, a Times driver for 25 years, as he contemplated his final night of driving out of 43d Street. "I don't want to go."
He recalled good times, jokes and gags with co-workers as he spoke of the ambience of the block where, he said, an impatient motorist once took a baseball bat to the windshield of a Times truck, where a decoy police officer baited thieves with a dangling camera while slumped in a supposedly drunken stupor on the street and where prostitutes and transvestites added to the scenery. "That's a show right there," Mr. Donald said.
Four months ago, The Times began printing at plants outside Boston and Washington for 110,000 Times buyers from Maine to Virginia who previously received the New York edition. Beginning in September, as a result of the addition of the College Point plant, The Times will expand its four-section New York regional edition to six sections on most weekdays, adding color photography and color advertising seven days a week. In the meantime, the newspaper, also printed at other plants around the nation, is building its circulation elsewhere in the country, which has reached 268,000 on weekdays and 376,000 on Sundays.
The end of The Times's printing operations in Manhattan leaves only The New York Post among the city's three major dailies to print in the borough. The Daily News is printed at its Liberty View production plant in Jersey City.
 In other editions, the caption with a picture showing a pressroom supervisor reaching up to two streams of printed paper coming off the press misidentified him. He was Harry Barrett, not Patrick O'Sullivan. The caption also misstated the time of the action pictured. It was Friday night, not Saturday.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Sunday about the transfer of The New York Times's printing operation out of Manhattan referred incorrectly in some editions to the length of time the paper was printed on West 43d Street. It was 84 years, ended on Saturday, not the 146 years since The Times's founding.

HEADLINE: 2% Tax Proposed to Preserve Open Land

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
AS a building boom supplants farms and open space onthe East End, a new coalition of environmental, business and civic groups is promoting a 2 percent real-estate transfer tax to preserve open lands.
Influential real-estate and builders' groups strongly oppose the proposal, complaining that it would unfairly penalize buyers. 
 The new coalition -- whose leaders include environmentalists, individual farmers, some builders and real-estate and bank officials -- said the tax was urgently needed to enhance preservation programs that they contend are falling short.
Officials in East Hampton are moving to submit the tax to a vote in November.
The tax, which would apply to transactions of more than $250,000 for house sales and $100,000 for unimproved land, would finance measures like buying land and development rights.
The proposal would mean that a buyer paying $500,000 for a house would pay a transfer tax of $5,000. A buyer of a $1 million house would pay $15,000. The money would go to a fund in that town.
The tax, which would not apply to sales less than the thresholds, would be tailored to exempt transactions where land remains in agriculture.
Supporters said the tax would be modeled after a similar tax on Nantucket that they said had been successful in preserving that resort island. The proponents said the tax would wrest benefit from a tide of development that threatens to rob the area of character, environmental and esthetic assets and rural ways of life.
"The premise is that you capture the real-estate-market activity in each of the East End towns, so that if there is a hot market there will be more money available for preservation," said Kevin McDonald, vice president of the Group for the South Fork, an environmental group in Bridgehampton.
Mr. McDonald said the coalition estimated that it would cost $375 million to preserve significant areas of farms and open spaces that make up 35 percent of the total land area in the five towns.
In addition to East Hampton, the towns include Riverhead, Southampton, Southold and Shelter Island.
Imposing the tax would require state permission and approval by a majority of local residents in town-by-town referendums. Last week, in a major advance for the tax, the East Hampton Town Board requested state permission for a referendum. Supervisor Catherine H. Lester said she expected broad support from voters who had backed other preservation programs.
One-third of the land in the town is protected, Mrs. Lester said, adding, "Right now, with the building boom on the East End, it's more critical than ever to take steps to maintain our character."
Money from the transfer tax would protect "our open space, drinking water, harbors, bays and farmlands," she added.
State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, Republican of Port Jefferson, said he was introducing a bill in Albany that would authorize the referendum in East Hampton.
A companion bill is to be introduced in the Assembly with backing from Fred W. Thiele Jr., Republican of Sag Harbor, and Thomas P. DiNapoli, Democrat of Thomaston.
Mr. LaValle said if East Hampton approved the tax that could be a model for other East End towns, none of which have requested permission for a referendum.
"We chose East Hampton because we had the greatest support there from government, real-estate and development people," Mr. LaValle said. "The other towns need to go through a longer gestation period. But East Hampton seemed poised to go ahead."
The Long Island Builders Institute, the Long Island Board of Realtors and their statewide parent organizations have pledged to fight the bills. Officials of the groups said that the tax could spread to other parts of the state and country and that it might finance programs other than preservation.
The executive director of the Long Island Builders Institute, Robert A. Wieboldt, said the tax was an admission fee charged to new buyers, at no cost to landowners or residents. "It's so easy to pass something like this," Mr. Wieboldt said. "You are taxing people that aren't there yet."
Mr. Wieboldt said programs that transferred development rights from areas to be preserved to areas that would be developed more intensively had proved successful in preserving 45,000 acres in Montgomery County, Md., where he recently took coalition members on a tour.
He said transferring development rights, already in use on the East End, was a way to preserve space without taxes or public spending.
Mr. McDonald, who went to Montgomery County, said it was disingenuous to suggest that the transfer of rights was a solution. "We are headed for suburbia with a few spots of open space in between," he said. "And the people who are opposed to measures like the transfer tax know that, and they are content to let it happen."
In Southampton, where development has been the most rapid, Supervisor Vincent J. Cannuscio, a Republican, said he would decide soon whether to support the tax.
"I will probably come down on the side of supporting it, but with certain limitations," said Mr. Cannuscio, adding that they included a time limit on the tax or provisions that it would be suspended if the market cooled.
He also said that Southampton had taken significant steps to protect land, including approval in November of a $5 million bond for open space and farm preservation. "We have already demonstrated our commitment, and now some individuals are saying on top of that do the transfer tax," he said.
Mr. McDonald noted that 13 percent of the remaining 6,000 acres of farmland in Southampton was the subject of applications for subdivisions. "The problem is that time is our enemy," he said. "If we wait the land won't be there."
Another coalition member, Edwin M. Schwenk of East End Forever, said the vote in East Hampton would give "us a leg up to start applying pressure on the Town Board in Southampton and the other communities."
"East Hampton is going forward, and Southampton, I hope, won't want to be left in second place," said Mr. Schwenk, who lives in Southampton. He predicted that residents would overwhelmingly support the tax.
Mr. Schwenk said he had resigned as executive director of the Builders Institute because the group would not support the tax, which he had espoused.
"They think it is a regressive tax," Mr. Schwenk said. "I don't agree. With all the second-home owners coming out here, it's the sort of thing that preserves our quality of life."
Another coalition member, Paul C. Brennan, vice president of Sotheby's International Realty in Bridgehampton, said the tax would help preserve qualities that sustained the South Fork market.
"Over the years, all along Long Island you have seen suburbanization," Mr. Brennan said. "Resort communities of years past have now become major towns and suburbs. There is not much rural character left on Long Island anymore."
Mr. Brennan said that the tax would not dampen the South Fork market and that most local real-estate professionals would agree that the tax would be beneficial.
The tax is also adamantly opposed by statewide real-estate organizations that worked to defeat such measures in the past.
"A transfer tax is not only inequitable, it's downright evil," Joseph E. Mottola, chief executive officer of the Long Island Board of Realtors, said. "It is patently unfair to incoming residents, and it results in windfall profits for current property owners."
"There are Federal, state, county and local town funds allocated for open space, and nobody says there is anything wrong with that," said Fritz Mayer, an executive officer of the Hamptons and North Fork Realtors Association, Inc. "But this is a 'welcome stranger' tax, and we are opposed to it."
Coalition members said such views differed from East End sentiment for an economy built on preservation.
"The economic and environmental communities agree we must protect the landscape that makes eastern Long Island so special," Thomas Tobin, president of the Bridgehampton National Bank, wrote in a statement announcing coalition support for the tax.
"It's no longer the environmentalists vs. the economic community," Richard L. Amper Jr. of East End Forever said. "It's the East End environmental and economic community against the up-Island producers of suburban sprawl."
"It's only the East End if everyone works to preserve it," said Mr. Amper, who is also executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society. "It is only a treasure if everybody agrees that it is and keeps it special."
Members of the coalition said that officials in Southold and on Shelter Island had shown interest in the tax but that Riverhead had shown limited interest.
A member of the Southold Town Board, Joseph L. Townsend Jr., said he believed that the board would support asking the Legislature in Albany for permission for a referendum on the tax. Mr. Townsend said that the town had supported the tax in the 80's, but that the Legislature never approved the bills.
On Shelter Island, Supervisor Huson B. Sherman said there was support on the Town Board for a referendum. "Right now we are watching to see what the other East End towns are doing," Mr. Sherman said.
Deputy Supervisor Russell Kratoville of Riverhead said the details of the tax had "just come to fruition."
"The Town Board," he said, "has not yet had an opportunity to fully digest this proposal."

HEADLINE: Car Test May Bring Big Lines

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
LINES at gasoline stations, reminiscent of the oil crises of the 70's, may reappear after Nov. 15, retailers are warning.
"There will be a rude awakening on Nov. 15," the owner of the DJM Service Station on Deer Park Avenue in Deer Park, Mitchell S. Macy, said. "There will be long lines of cars up and down the block. It's going to be a real shock." 
 Mr. Macy said the lines would be caused by a miscalculation by the state, which is planning for most of the 4,700 downstate service stations that perform inspections to continue in the program after new testing equipment is required.
"No one I know, and I know 10 to 15 service station owners, will do it," said Mr. Macy.
The New York State Association of Service Stations and Repair Shops, with 3,500 members, said 60 to 65 percent of its members who did inspections would not participate.
"The overwhelming majority said they would not participate for either physical or financial reasons," the executive director of the group, Ralph Bombardiere, said. "The new inspection equipment ties up one bay. So it makes no sense for a two-bay location."
The $40,000 cost of the equipment, Mr. Bombardiere said, is prohibitive.
The executive director of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association, Kathryn L. Pollane, said most of that group's 800 members in Nassau and Suffolk Counties were also balking at buying the equipment because of the expense.
"If we could get everybody collectively not to do the program, it won't happen," said Ms. Pollane.
A deputy environmental conservation commissioner, Dave Sterman, said the state believed that 3,000 to 3,500 stations would stay in the program. The state, Mr. Sterman added, realizes that some smaller sites would drop out, but that "it probably would not be economical for them to do the testing, anyway."
The state is trying to keep down the price of the equipment and is meeting vendors, Mr. Sterman said. The state has not certified equipment, and it is is watching a pilot program in California, expecting to approve the analyzer certified there in a "couple of weeks," he added.
The machine, Mr. Sterman said, would analyze three emissions instead of two and include safeguards against fraud. The program intends to have the state comply with Federal mandates in the Clean Air Act.
The state says the equipment will pay for itself in a year.
Mr. Bombardiere said that would be impossible.
"The inspection will take between 37 and 45 minutes, compared with 20 to 30 minutes now," he said. "You would need to do 160 inspections per month to make it economically feasible and seven years to pay it off. An average station now does only 80 inspections a month."
He said that each inspection would cost $35, instead of the present $19 and that the station would retain $31 instead of the present $15. The rest of the money will continue to go to the State Clean Air Fund for consumer protection and enforcement.
"We suggest an increase in the fee to $50," Mr. Bombardiere said. "That would be enough so our people would make some money, and even low-volume locations would buy the equipment."
As of Nov. 15, stations have to have whichever analyzer the state designates. Mr. Sterman said manufacturers would require the stations to sign agreements to buy the second half of the equipment, a dynamometer, that will be required for all inspections after Nov. 15, 1998.
Vendors will begin providing the dynamometers by year's end, he said. A dynamometer requires a car's tires to sit on rollers and places pressure on the tires as the rollers spin, simulating travel up and down hills.
Mr. Bombardiere pointed out that unlike the test in California, which spins the tires at a constant speed of 15 miles an hour under 50 pounds a square inch of pressure, the New York test will fluctuate the pressure and vary the speed, up to 37 miles an hour.
The president of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association, Robert A. Santasiero, said one reason that he would not participate in the program was safety.
"The dynamometer will not work when it is snowing or raining and the tires of cars are wet," Mr. Santasiero said. "They would have to be dried before being placed on the rollers of the dynamometer, because they could slip off the rollers. That could damage the dynamometer and the car and be hazardous to the inspector. State officials just shrug their shoulders when you mention it to them."
Mr. Sterman said that concern was unwarranted. "I can't believe manufacturers would let a machine out the door without providing safeguards," he said. "These machines are running in other states. I spoke with the Ohio Commissioner, and he said they have been running a successful program using the dynamometer for a year or so and that they got past the initial problems quickly."
New York has decided against requiring inspections at state-operated sites.
"We went away from a centralized test, because all the service stations would lose out," Mr. Sterman said. "We had considered having 12 or 15 centralized stations in the state. But there was a potential for waiting in long lines."
In addition, stations that repair failing cars might not have the equipment to insure making the repairs.
That would result in a "Ping Pong effect," motorists going back and forth between the testing sites and repair shops, Mr. Sterman said, adding:
"That was another reason we decided to go with the decentralized program. Now they are yelling to have it the other way."
Mr. Bombardiere said his association had initially favored decentralized testing and repairs, but now preferred a centralized system, because "so many of our guys will not participate" in the new arrangement.
Even the owner of an inspection station that plans an upgrade said he would prefer centralized testing.
"Do you know of anybody who is going to give a state trooper a $50 bill to get an inspection sticker?" the owner, Richard F. Sayres of the Holbrook MTA Auto Service, asked.
Mr. Sayres said he would buy the new equipment because he "learned a long time ago that you can't fight City Hall."
"The sooner you get with the program, the better you are," he said. "It's just unfortunate that people with two or three bays will have to decide."
Mr. Sayres, with eight bays and two outside lifts, said he favored a system to combat fraud. A device, either a video or still camera, would take a picture of each car.
"It legitimizes the industry and takes me off the hook of being the bad guy" when refusing to falsify a test result, said Mr. Sayres.
"Unfortunately there is a cloud over the industry" because of cheating, he added.
Mr. Sterman, saying he could not quantify the cheating, added:
"One of the reasons we are not getting the kind of emission remediation we should get is because of the cheating component. This is the rationale for the Environmental Protection Administration not giving us as much emission reduction credit."
With photographs the state could prevent "golden Cadillacs," cars parked at shops to pass emissions tests in the place of cars in violation.
New York is one of 37 Eastern states that is trying to reduce up to 85 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants. Over the next two years, Mr. Sterman said, the state hopes to realize a 24 percent reduction in hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere based on 1990 levels.
"Hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide, when combined with the heat of sunlight, creates a chemical reaction that causes ozone or smog," he said.
The new vehicle inspections will be effective for the four and a half million cars on Long Island and in New York City, as well as in Westchester and Rockland Counties.
The state says that it expects most of the 11,000 upstate inspection stations to participate. Those areas already comply with the Federal ozone standards.
Mr. Santasiero, who has owned a Mobil station on West Old Country Road in Hicksville for 38 years, said he was not certain that the new program would work.
"We're all for clean air," he said. "I have kids, too. But we want to make sure we are doing this in a sensible way. If we knew this new program would bring the results we wanted, it would ease the pain a little."
The state plans to test the equipment for 18 months, Mr. Santasiero said, and it might require stations to spend an additional $20,000 on equipment.
"How stupid do they think the merchants are in the Northeast corridor?" he asked. "We just spent $12,000 to $15,000 for a new machine four and a half years ago that they are now telling us is obsolete. How can we have confidence in the people making the laws?"
Mr. Sterman said that the present equipment was certified in 1990 and that the new equipment would be used for a minimum of seven years.
Mr. Sayres said he believed that whoever "jumps on the bandwagon first" would benefit from the program.
"I think more than half of the guys are going to do it, because no one has a choice," he said. "You can't stop progress. It's the wave of the future."
The vice president of legislative and economic affairs for the Long Island Association, Mitchell H. Pally, said he believed that most stations would ultimately buy the machines, "because they know how important it is."

HEADLINE: My Days Underground

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
SHE wore a brown cloth coat and little half-glasses, and she emerged from the side of the 14th Street platform with the light behind her, creating a halo effect around her hair, like an angel's. I never learned her name because she jumped onto an uptown No. 1 local train a minute later, but I will never forget her. She rescued a struggling musician in the grimmest moment of his first-ever afternoon playing for the passing throng of the New York transit system: she listened.
Every subway musician has a story like that about a resonant moment when performer and audience suddenly and unexpectedly connected. But how does it happen? How, in this least likely of places -- the subway -- where New Yorkers wrap their cloaks of anonymity and self-defense more tightly than almost anywhere else, does a subway musician break through? That's what I went underground with my guitar to find out. Is music that powerful a force? How does it persist, even thrive, in such a stony environment? 
 Some people might argue that subway music is one of New York City's lesser miracles. But no one can dismiss its power or its place in the culture of the nation's largest mass transit system. The producers of a CD compilation of subway musicians released last year counted more than 200 subway acts over several months as they toured the tunnels. On any given day, there are musicians and singers by the dozens, with dizzying degrees of talent: ragged players of ragged old guitars and austere practitioners of the pure-toned Chinese stringed instrument known as the erhu, and brave souls who stride forth with no more than a crosscut saw and a violin bow. There are bored-looking mariachi bands and intense jazz bands, and torch singers and crooners to make you weep or wince.
What they all have in common is their strange stage: an enclosed, cavernous place of sometimes vague menace, where people avoid eye contact and subconsciously calculate the amount of threat in any given pose or body language. Few people go to the subway for a good time, or to escape their worries and cares. And yet that is exactly what subway musicians must provide their audiences in order to succeed: they must be everything that the subway is not.
For a musician, it is a world of soaring emotional highs and plummeting psychic lows, none of which -- for better and for worse -- lasts longer than the average wait for a train. Indeed, after a while, all life seems measurable in blocks of about three to five minutes. A subway performer has that long, if not less, to win over an audience, and at the end of that time he or she is inevitably doomed to see the audience disappear. People and faces, like the trains, come and go in a constant blur. The ancient Greeks who posited the circular, ever-repeating universe would feel right at home.
Luke Ryan, a blues and rock performer who has been playing in the subway for 15 years, calls this effect the "constant audition." It's the only environment he knows, he said, where a performer wins hearts instantly, or fails completely, because there is no time for anything in between.
For most of my first afternoon on the subway stage, I was firmly in the failed category. I had played for perhaps half an hour without a single person's so much as acknowledging my existence, and was beginning to feel a growing, desperate expertise in the various postures of indifference: the opened newspaper, the opened paperback, the casual laughing conversation, the turned head, the turned back.
The woman in brown changed it all. She stepped out of the light, leaned in, listened, smiled, touched her forefinger and thumb together to signal, "O.K.," and threw a single quarter in the open guitar case. She brought hope.
I ultimately played and sang underground on two more occasions over a 10-day period at various times and stations around the city -- morning rush hour on the Upper West Side 72d Street downtown I.R.T. No. 1, 2 and 3 trains; afternoon into evening on Wall Street, uptown No. 4 and 5, as well as that afternoon on the 14th Street platform -- and through it all I was always trying to recreate that first moment of victory.
I played the song she liked, "Maybelline," by Chuck Berry, just about to death -- sometimes with success, sometimes not, but always with her in mind. I became a slave to what worked and a vicious editor of what I felt did not. Songs that survived my play list, like "Maybelline," or "Folsom Prison Blues," by Johnny Cash, did so through the most brutal and elemental forces of the marketplace: They sold, they connected, they produced a dollar in the guitar case.
The money, which all went to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, became in some ways doubly important for the symbolism it acquired, representing my pathetic little psychic ledger sheet. I began, inevitably perhaps, to measure my value by what passing and anonymous strangers would pull from their wallets and purses. I did not make much: exactly $61.39 for more than nine hours of physically exhausting work -- better than the minimum wage, though not by much.
But getting the money, after a while, was also beside the point. I played not so much to win, but to avoid losing. I tried to play exactly what people wanted, as many times as I thought it would work -- or as many times as I could stand -- because the alternative, to be ignored and treated as a thing without value, unworthy of attention or respect, was so grimly appalling. I had felt that once and I would do whatever it took to avoid feeling it again.
I tried dressing up in a shirt and tie, and dressing down in jeans and T-shirt. On the Upper West Side I tried Museum of Natural History humor, on the mistaken belief that references to the nearby museum might be mildly diverting at 7:45 A.M. Here's an old song, I would announce to the platform, that was "popular in the Devonian period among the early cartilaginous fishes." People looked blank. I dumped the Devonian jokes.
Still, I began to think after a while that I could read the various types of people who walked by. I would look at a particular man, well dressed, in his 40's, and think: Creedence Clearwater Revival. I imagined some drunken frat house Saturday night, circa 1973, and did my best to try to recapture for him the feeling of youth and freedom by playing "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?" or "Travelin' Band."
I would look at a particular woman and think, for no reason that now makes much sense: Neil Young. I would sing "After the Gold Rush" to her, or "Four Strong Winds." If she would not look at me, I sang to her back, trying to make her turn around. I saw late middle age and played Everly Brothers. I saw cowboy boots and played Buck Owens.
In retrospect, my song list probably limited my appeal, and it dated me. Growing up in Utah in the 1960's and 70's, I played with various bands, often country-tinged, from high school through college, and with only a few exceptions, everything I performed in the subway was frozen in that genre and era: three or four chords, a little country twang and composed before the first Reagan Administration. I tried to learn a Nirvana song, with deliberate demographics in mind, and couldn't make it sound right.
Still, there were some moments of indescribable sweetness. A man named Regeland Smith, who came to New York in 1960 from North Carolina to be a rock-and-roll singer (but who found God in 1967 and became a subway preacher instead) spontaneously stepped up and harmonized on the John Fogerty song "Up Around the Bend." A group of young women from Brooklyn danced before my guitar case. Mark Fulgione, a secret rocker who wears a suit on Wall Street, presented me with the gift of a guitar pick -- a brown Fender, thin gauge -- and made my day.
A beautiful 7-year-old girl named Bianca, missing both front teeth, sang "Old MacDonald had a Farm" with me and made up unusual animal farm inhabitants that included ghosts and snakes. Her gapped teeth allowed for the perfect sibilant reptile hiss.
Some subway performers become addicted to those kinds of encounters. Jim Graseck still vividly remembers the night in the late 1960's when, as a young Juilliard student, he was waiting for a Long Island Rail Road train to take him home. Acting on impulse, he took out his violin and played the Mendelssohn concerto he'd been practicing. He never quite got over what happened next, how the commuters gathered around him, moved by the music -- and how he made a quick $10. Mr. Graseck now records and plays with symphony orchestras, but still regularly goes back to the transit system, he said, because he cannot find the immediacy of the subway audience in any other forum.
"It's kept me in some ways inspired," he said. "I come away feeling younger, in spirit and in years."
Sometimes the bonds that grow between musicians and listeners endure beyond the next train.
Vince Hoare, an 81-year-old retired postal worker from Elizabeth, N.J., has been going into New York nearly every Saturday now for five years to hear a subway jazz band called the Ninth Street Stompers that he fell in love with one day. Mr. Hoare (pronounced hore-RAY) calls the band's leader and trumpet player, Ed Fennell, to find out where the band will be playing. He and Mr. Fennell exchange Christmas cards. He persists in putting a dollar in the collection box even though he's been politely told by the band that he shouldn't.
"You can't stop him," Mr. Fennell said.
There are also things that a performer can pick up only over time about how the underground stage works. Veterans say a couple on a date is often a happy sight, for example. Men like to look expansive or generous -- or at least not like cheapskates -- and will often dig into their wallets if only to show off. Wednesdays are often bad because many New Yorkers get their paychecks that day and won't feel flush until Thursday. And a police officer's song requests should, if possible, always be obliged.
Mr. Fennell said the music itself is also different in the subway. Unlike the audience in a jazz club, which expects subtle musical references and complicated meters, almost no one in the subway has gone there to hear jazz. Underground, he said, people don't have the patience for self-indulgent solos or musicians who play to impress other musicians. What sells is the mainstream: swing tunes, especially familiar ones, played clean and with an easy-to-follow beat.
It is one of greater mysteries of the subway music world that anything sells there at all, and that people will actually pay money for a performance that is by its nature free with the cost of a token. And the even greater wonder is that there seem to be real, if unwritten, rules about it all. In this least formal corner of the informal cash economy, there are rough standards of fairness about what is given and what is received.
Eye contact, for example, is a crucial threshold issue. If I got a person to look me in the eye in the middle of a song, a barrier was broken. One human being had acknowledged another. But in the subway musical code of fair exchange, it also meant, on a deeper level, that something offered had been accepted. It very often led to another dollar in the guitar case.
Ed Robinson, a plumber from Ridgefield Park, N.J., said he almost always gives to subway musicians. He counts off his favorites: the gospel singer near the Port Authority, the little girl singer at Grand Central, the blind guitarist who does Beatles tunes along with his friend on the recorder at Times Square. Mr. Robinson was just getting off work from a construction site in lower Manhattan when he approached me on the Wall Street platform. As a former rock-and-roller himself, who eventually "grew up," as he put it, Mr. Robinson said a donation is a matter of respect.
"I never liked a free ride," he said. "If somebody's playing music, I feel a responsibility, I guess."
But some exchanges go beyond money -- beyond words, even. There was a woman on 72d Street, for example, who stood rooted on the platform's edge perhaps 30 feet away. She never approached closer, never reached in her purse for a dollar, never said a word. But she was on some level a Neil Young type, I guess. I saw her turn to face me as I began one of Mr. Young's songs ("After the Gold Rush" for the umpteenth time), and as her downtown express train approached, I ended the tune and quickly began another, singing by now to her alone.
The noise level rose, drowning me out, but I kept singing, and right up to the moment the train doors opened, we stayed connected -- a performer and an audience of one. Just as she boarded, she gave me a nod, a slight slow bow of the head with her eyes closed. For that one brief shining second, it had all worked just right. The barricades had fallen.
Then she was gone.

HEADLINE: Whats Doing In;
Williamsburg

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; DAVID E. SANGER is a correspondent for The Times in Washington.

 BODY:
Thomas Jefferson nearly killed off Williamsburg, and the Rockefellers saved it. It was Jefferson who moved the capital of Virginia to Richmond, leaving the genteel little town on the James River to slip into a century and a half of gradual decay. Nobody bothered the place, not even George McClellan, the Civil War Union general, who was supposed to.
Today Williamsburg is America's most famous Colonial restoration, and the kind of place that a decade ago I would have avoided -- smiling folks in tricorn hats offering a sanitized version of a pretty rough era. I was wrong. There are plenty of tricorn hats, but the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, created by John D. Rockefeller Jr. in the 1930's, has gone to extraordinary lengths to take off the varnish. Eighty-eight 18th-century buildings survive -- shops, taverns and houses -- and many more have been painstakingly recreated on original foundations. 
 And there's one more reason that my wife and I now find Williamsburg a marvelous retreat from Washington: Our son, Andrew, just shy of 3 years old, is at that age when booming muskets, tricorn hats and settlers' forts begin to fascinate.
Some sites are found in the nearby Jamestown settlement, where the first English settlers tried -- largely unsuccessfully -- to scratch out a living. Williamsburg, which bloomed 150 years later, marks the settlers' eventual triumph.
 
Events
 From June 23 to July 4, archeology courses ($390 for one week, $625 for two; lodging extra) will offer a chance to work at a dig within the historic area. Similar courses are scheduled from Sept. 1 through Sept. 12 and from Sept. 22 to Oct. 3. For reservations, call (800) 603-0948.
Lord Cornwallis will again occupy Williamsburg June 28 and 29, setting up a full British encampment on Market Square. Shoppers will have to pass checkpoints and risk court-martial. More encampments will be set up throughout the summer.
Every Friday from June 27 through Aug. 29, traditional African-American dance and music, drawing heavily on 18th-century Virginia, is performed at the Playbooth Theatre. Free with a Williamsburg ticket.
On July 27, the Bruton Parish Church re-enacts the nasty disagreements between the congregation and the vestry over choosing a new rector, a conflict that reverberated throughout the Colonies.
 
Sightseeing
 The wondrous thing about the restoration is its tranquillity, the tucked-away gardens behind Colonial houses where you find yourself -- and no one else -- admiring ivy gardens and aster walks. And when you watch visitors in shorts and T-shirts walking alongside the Benjamin Franklin look-alike in his formal vest and stockings, it is hard to say who seems more otherworldly.
For sheer immersion in the spirit of the times, stop by the papermaker's shop to see the art of marbling, and the silversmith's, attached to James Craig Jeweler, where an apprentice describes his life and his customers -- who would bring in their coins for transformation into silverware. Nearby on Duke of Gloucester Street, the Raleigh Tavern, one of the best in town in 1735, is now an exhibition hall; a tour runs from the public rooms to the not-so-private, where guests were stuffed two or three to a bed.
In the Fine Millinery Shop, a tailor fresh from London works on hooped petticoats while a young woman cuts fabric for pilches, the Colonial equivalent of plastic diaper covers. The saddlemaker gives a priceless accounting of how to work leather into something suitable for a governor. You can't buy anything in these two shops, but there are plenty of places where you can, like Tarpley and Company, which specializes in ladies' and girls' fine straw hats with satin ribbons and bows, starting around $40 to $50. There are also teas ($5 for a quarter-pound) and coffees ($11 a pound) blended to approximate flavors of the times. A jewelry shop is stocked with mostly locally made temptations -- delicate gold vermeil earrings ($40 to $50), silver bangles and pewter from the Williamsburg foundry. Most shops are open 9:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. daily.
The major sites are the Governor's Palace, the Capitol, with its hall of the House of Burgesses, and Bruton Parish Church, where there is often choral singing in the evenings.
Less visited, because it is out of the way on Francis Street, is Bassett Hall, John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s Williamsburg home, built in the 1930's and jammed with the Rockefellers' furnishings. Family members still use it, so reservations are required, at (757) 229-1000.
On a rainy morning we wandered into the DeWitt Wallace Gallery, a bright, airy and remarkably complete collection of early American furniture, intricately engraved muskets, imported porcelain and prints.
A one-day pass to the historic area is $25, or $15 for ages 6 to 12; for $29 (6 to 12, $17), you can get two days. The price includes all the buildings (save the Governor's Palace, for which you buy a pass costing an extra $8), the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center and the DeWitt Wallace Gallery. For information and hotel reservations, call the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, (800) 447-8679.
After the crowds, the meticulous restorations and the organized events of Williamsburg, the starkness and simplicity of Jamestown -- the first permanent English settlement in North America, started in May 1607 -- is a welcome change. A quick nine-mile drive along the scenic Colonial Parkway from Williamsburg, Jamestown -- with its reconstructed Indian village, fort and ships -- is a sure hit with children.
Last fall, archeologists announced the discovery of the structure everyone knew lay at the edge of the James River: the fort that made up the first colony. These days, laid out in the tiny museum inside the National Park (admission $5; under age 17, free) is the remarkably preserved skeleton of one of the first settlers, a young man whose remains were found during excavation of the fort. His body was exhumed in September and will be reburied after archeologists poke at his bones and examine the musket-ball hole in his knee that probably led to his early death. Until then, he's the closest you will get to meeting one of the first settlers. Information: (757) 229-1733 (the National Park Service Visitor Center).
Jamestown Island, the site of the original settlement, is history in the raw -- the foundations of a few houses and statues of the more familiar figures of the Jamestown drama.
Just outside the gates of the National Park, the privately run Jamestown Settlement ($9.75; ages 6 to 12, $4.75) contains working reproductions of the ships that made the perilous trip with 144 Englishmen, and the first fort and community they built. On board the Susan Constant, the largest of the ships at 116 feet long, visitors can crawl through the mid-decks and check out the cramped captain's quarters. Other high points are the fort, with mud-and-wood reproductions of the first church and other buildings, and the Indian village. Information: (757) 253-4838 or (888) 593-4682.
On the way back on the parkway is Carter's Grove, a handsome 1750's brick mansion and plantation on the James River. The reconstructed slave quarters is a welcome feature because you get little sense of the life of African-Virginians from the refined precincts of Williamsburg. Admission is included when you pay the extra $8 on the Williamsburg pass.
 
Where to Stay
 There are several hotels outside the restoration, starting with the 295-room Marriott, (800) 228-9290, fax (757) 253-0541; and four Best Westerns, (800) 446-9228, with a total of 610 rooms, but all are a bit removed.
The restoration operates four places to stay, all linked by bus and all reachable at (800) 447-8679.
The Governors Inn is the most economical, starting at $84.
The Woodlands, just outside the restoration and near the visitor center, is on 44 acres. This is more motel-like, but family friendly, with swimming pools, playgrounds and biking. Summer doubles begin at $91.
The most famous of the lodgings is the 99-room Williamsburg Inn, the gracious Southern hotel with sweeping views across a spectacular golf course and two pools. The patio directly behind the main lobby is the best place for a sunset drink. Rooms start at $300. Reservations: (757) 229-1000; fax (757) 220-7096.
We took a room in one of the Inn's outbuildings, the Market Square Tavern, a 1749 Colonial house with a wood-paneled reading room and a wonderful bit of history: Thomas Jefferson lived there while studying law with Andrew Wythe. The house has been restored to that era, down to the old floorboards and leaded-glass windows. Our room was cozy (the bathroom was tucked into what appeared to be an old closet) and modestly furnished, with a view to a spectacularly maintained rear garden of asters. The front door delivers you right to the middle of Duke of Gloucester Street, conveniently across from the stockade if the kids act up. Rooms in the Market Square Tavern and other outbuildings of the Williamsburg Inn are about $180.
Across from the Inn is the modern Williamsburg Lodge, with a luxurious spa. The rooms are Hyatt-like; doubles from $159.
 
Where to Eat
 There are four taverns run by Colonial Williamsburg, and reservations for all of them -- and many contemporary restaurants -- can be made by calling (757) 229-2141.
Our favorite was Christiana Campbell's Tavern, named for a proprietress described by one client as "a little old woman about four feet high and equally thick." Today it is a seafood tavern, also known for sweet-potato muffins and hot spoon bread. George Washington never slept here, but he drank plenty, and his receipt from Mrs. Campbell is reproduced on the menu. There is a full chicken dinner with appetizer (recommended: the vegetable pasties in herb tomato sauce) and dessert. Crab cakes and salmon are specialties; dinner came to $60, without wine, for two adults and a child.
The Josiah Chowning Tavern, in the middle of Duke of Gloucester Street, is the most informal of the taverns. It serves simple tavern fare, like filling Welsh rarebit with well-spiced mustard, cheddar and beer We sat in the back garden, a quiet corner covered by a grape arbor. A wandering musician sings old Scottish tunes. Dinner for two and a half without wine came to $44. The King's Arms serves more standard Continental fare, in much the same atmosphere.
Quick snacks can be found at the Raleigh Tavern Bake Shop in the restored area, where gingerbread and apple cider are plentiful.
Just outside the restored area, in Market Square, are more-conventional restaurants: for burgers, sandwiches and other fare ranging from $6.50 to $16, try the Trellis, opposite the Toymaker of Williamsburg. Seasons Cafe has similar offerings but more room for outdoor dining. The Williamsburg Inn serves a sumptuous Sunday brunch for about $25 a person. A buffet breakfast (go for the pancakes) is $13.
 "If it was my kid, I would want them to keep trying," he says. "I think we were never going to stop."
 Ben's heart did begin to beat again, and he was transferred to Martin Memorial's intensive-care unit. The surgeon, who had know Ben since he was a baby, went with McLain to talk to Tammy Kolb. "There has been a serious problem with your son," McLain remembers telling the woman. "His heart stopped. We had to restart his heart. He is extremely critical, in a coma-like state."
 He winces at the memory: "You don't know how strong to be to get your point across. You want her to understand, but you can't stick a knife in her."
 At first, Tammy Kolb did not seem to understand. "I know he's going to wake up just fine," she said.
 "I don't -," McLain said.
 "I've seen this on TV. As soon as he wakes up I have a Christmas present for him. I brought it for him early."
 Ben reamined in a coma for nearly 24 hours. His parents and older sister remained at his bedside as their fog of denial slowly lifted. The next day they agreed that his ventilator should be removed, and he was declared brain dead. As with the death of Jose Martinez, a lot can be learned by what happened after Ben Kolb died.
 First, the hospital's risk manager, Doni Haas, had all the syringes and vials used on Ben locked away, then sent to an independent laboratory for analysis. Second, Haas promised Ben's parents that she "was going to find them an answer, if there was one."
 There was. Tests showed that there had been a mixup, a mistake, a human error in a system that made that error more likely. Ben Kolb, lab reports showed, was never injected with lidocaine at all. The syringe that was supposed to contain lidocaine actually contained adrenaline, a highly concentrated strength that was intended only for external use.
 Procedure in the Martin Memorial operating room at the time was for topical adrenaline to be poured into one cup, made of plastic, and lidocaine to be poured into a cup nearby, made of metal. The lidocaine syringe was then filled by placing it in the metal cup. It is a procedure used all over the country, a way of getting a drug from container to operating table. According to Richmond Harman, the hospital's C.E.O., "It has probably been done 100,000 times in our facility without error."
 But it is a flawed procedure, the hospital learned. It allows for the possibility that the solution can be poured into or drawn out of the wrong cup. Instead, a cap, called a spike, could be put on the vial of lidocaine, allowing the drug to be drawn directly out of the labeled bottle and into a labeled syringe. The elimination of one step eliminates one opportunity for the human factor to get in the way.
Haas received the lab results three weeks after Ben died. The family had hired an attorney by then, and Haas and McLain drove two hours and met with the Kolbs at Krupnick, Campbell, Malone, Roselli, Buster, Slama & Hancock.
 "It was very unusual," says Richard J. Roselli, one of Flordia's most successful malpractice lawyers and the president of the Academy of Florida Trial Lawyers. "This is the first occasion where I ever had a hospital step forward, admitting their responsibility and seeking to do everything they can to help the family."
 A financial settlement was reached by nightfall, but neither side will confirm the amount paid to the Kolbs.
 After the papers were signed, the family asked for a chance to talk with the doctors at the hospital. The first thing Ben's father, Tim, did when he entered the emotion-filled room was to hug his son's surgeon. Then came the torent of questions, questions that had kept the Kolbs awake at night, questions they might never have been able to ask had the case spent years in court.
 Was Ben scared when his heart rate started dropping? Was he in pain? How much did he suffer?
 The doctors explained what the Kolbs did not know, that Ben had been put under general anesthesia long before anything went wrong.
 "The decisions I made for him were the same I would have made if it were my child," McLain said.
 Just before the family left, they asked if it would be O.K. for them to continue to use Martin Memorial for their medical care.
 "Of course," Haas said, grateful and amazed.
 Would the hospital promise to spread the word about how Ben died, so that the procedure in question could be changed in other places?
 Haas promised.
 With that, the Kolb case was closed, but it wasn't over. Tim Kolb still coaches his son's soccer team. The family still grieves.
 The doctors in the operating room that day still have nightmares of their own. "I let that child's life slip through my fingers," McLain says. "They tell me there was nothing I could do. I know there was nothing I could do. But it's like I was a lifeguard and he died on my watch. There must have been something."
 And the lawyers at Krupnick, Campbell are still searching, too.
 "We're not done with this - yet," Roselli says. Why, he asks, was it possible to mix up the lidocaine and the adrenaline? Did the two bottles look alike? "We're still investigating the product liability aspect of it," he says. "The questions of packaging and labeling.
 JOANNE TURNBULL DID not fully realize she was part of a sea change until she was in a Palm Springs auditorium last October - two months after the death of Jose Martinez, nearly two years after the death of Betsy Lehman, one day after what would have been Ben Kolb's eighth birthday - and marveled at what was going on around her.
 At the front of the room were representatives from Martin Memorial Hospital. Keeping their promise to the Kolb family, the group spent nearly two hours retelling the story of how and why the boy died. In the audience, fighting tears as they took notes, were more than 300 doctors, nurses, pharmacists and administrators, each of whom had been given a smiling photograph of the child at the three-day conference on "Examining Errors in Health Care."
 "Five years ago if we'd held this conference, very few people would have come," Leape, of Harvard, said at the opening session. But the list of sponsors included not only the A.M.A. and the joint commission, but also four medical insurance organizations, three pharmaceutical groups and the American Hospital Association.
 "This is a miracle that this is happening," Turnbull remembers thinking as the session concluded. "Everyone's telling the truth."
 In the months since Jose Martinez died, Turnbull has become an expert herself on the world of human factors research. She has done her root-cause analysis for the joint commission and learned a lot more about what went wrong that night: that the hospital's pharmacy was short one technician because someone called insick and that policies there require that the phone be answered in four rings and visitors greeted within five seconds of their arrival; that the nurse who questioned the order was trained in a country where women rarely confront men and nurses rarely confront doctors; that the first resident was distracted by personal problems. Turnbull has made changes, too, ones she hopes will be strong enough to make such human imperfections matter less. Hermann Hospital's computer now flags questionable orders for the most dangerous drugs, including Digoxin. The hospital is looking into a paging system that alerts a caller when the person being paged has his beeper turned off. Double copies of a prescription are no longer sent to the pharmacy unless it is a prescription that must be filled within 15 minutes.
 Administrators even asked the joint commission to schedule its accreditation review for April, not August, to ease the stress during the hospital's busiest month. Two research experiments are being planned to increase error reporting.
 As a result of Turnbull's analysis, and the accompanying changes, Hermann Hospital is no longer under "accreditation watch." On Dec. 27, 1996, it was given full accreditation, with commendation, the highest designation given by the joint commission.
 That brings satisfaction, she says, but mostly she feels sadness for the little boy and his family and concern for the staff members who are also still burdened by the event. She is wary, too, because everything she has learned tells her that no institution can ever be certain that something like this will not happen again. And she feels a sense of responsibility, an understanding that this moment and movement might well be seen as a crossroads for medicine. "We've become part of something," she says. "We want to make sure it is something that's done right."
 
To Err Is Human, Even in Medicine
 The most unsettling lesson of human factors research is this: Despite all best efforts, mistakes happen. Careful planning can reduce the number, and mitigate the consequences, but it cannot completely prevent mistakes.
 The aviation industry has learned that in the decade since it began to confront human error head-on. Crew training was over-hauled, equipment modified and procedures changed. The number of crashes attributed to human error (distinct from insufficient maintenance and aging airplanes) decreased significantly. So impressive were the changes, says John Nance, an aviation analyst, that the industry was feeling pleased with itself. Then, in December 1995, an airplane crashed outside Cali, Colombia - which was result of human error. Even with all the changes, tragedies continue.
 Now medicine is starting to grapple with the same lesson. One morning this winter, I was observing a meeting of the pediatric oncology staff at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Suddenly the session was interrupted with the news that a 6-year-old patient had erroneously been given a double dose of his chemo medication.
 Perhaps no institution has been more aggressive in error prevention than Dana-Farber. And yet somehow a pharmacist had misread a confusing recipe card for Cytarabine, a drug used to fight leukemia. The error was caught because the pharmacist was given the same prescription for a second patient a few hours later. When he mixed that second prescription a mental alarm bell rang, and he realized he had made a mistake earlir in the day.
 By the time word reached this meeting, the medicine had already been administered. The first thing the staff did was look for someone to blame, taking momentary comfort in the fact that the overdose was not actually given at Dana-Farber: the little boy had visited the Dana-Farber clinic that morning but had been sent across the street, to Boston Children's Hospital, which is affiliated with Dana-Farber and has made most of the same procedural changes.
 "It's not our problem - it's Children's problem," one pediatric oncology fellow volunteered.
 "It's our patient, it's our service, it's our problem," his attending, Dr. Amy Billett, said sharply.
 All energy then turned to a search of the available literature to see what effects a double dose of Cytarabine would have on the child. Five doctors crammed into a closet-size office, reading textbooks and jounral articles aloud. Eventually Billett found a 1979 article revealing that early patients were given far larger doses of the drug with no evidence of toxicity. Relieved, the doctors decided no remedial action was called for. Then, armed with reassuring knowledge, they told the family.
 "A mistake was made," Billett remembers saying. "Your son received too much medication." She then assured the parents that their son was well, and was likely to remain well, although he would be closely monitored.
 "We were able to offer them reassurances," Billett says. "They were not particularly concerned."
 An internal investigation was begun immediately. The preparation card was changed so that it was less confusing. For Billett, for everyone, it was a sobering lesson. The staff learned that all the recent changes, all the heightened awareness, while necessary and effective, were far from foolproof.
 "You can never design a truly perfect system," Billett says. "There are no guarantees."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 6, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The What's Doing column on June 15, about Williamsburg, Va., misstated the given name of a man with whom Thomas Jefferson studied law. He was George Wythe, not Andrew.
 The cover of The Times Magazine today and an article on page 28 about medical mistakes render a prescription figure incorrectly. The order for digoxin given for Jose Eric Martinez, a 2-month-old who died in Hermann Hospital in Houston, was written as .90 milligram (not 0.9 milligram, a different way of writing the same amount). The dosage the child was supposed to receive, under the original doctor's orders, was .09 milligram. The 0.9 rendering was supplied by the Houston hospital; the error was discovered after the article had gone to press.
An article on June 15 about medical mistakes misidentified a Representative who in 1995 challenged a bill that would limit awards in malpractice suits. He is John Bryant, a Democrat from Texas, and not Ed Bryant, a Republican. (The article also misidentified Ed Bryant's state; he represents Tennessee, not California.)

THE ONE BEST WAY
 Frederick Winslow Taylor
 and the Enigma of Efficiency.
 By Robert Kanigel.
 675 pp. New York:
 Viking. $34.95. 
 In November 1910 some railroads were trying to prove, as it had recently become their burden to do, that they merited Federal permission for rate increases. Representing opponents was Louis Brandeis, the future Justice, who questioned railroad officials about their costs. Were new efficiencies in operations an alternative to rate increases? No, said the railroaders. How did they know? Brandeis asked. Trust us, they said.
But Brandeis was in no mood to trust people who trusted their hunches, intuitions and experiences rather than the rising clerisy of experts. He caused a sensation by asserting that the railroads could save $1 million a day -- serious money then -- by "scientific management." How did he know? He knew about Frederick Winslow Taylor, who was about to become famous, and frequently unhappy, for the remaining five years of his life.
Taylor is still renowned among historians of American business. Peter Drucker, the well-known student of management, says that Taylor, not Marx, deserves to be ranked with Darwin and Freud in the trinity of makers of the modern world and that Taylorism is perhaps "the most powerful as well as the most lasting contribution America has made to Western thought since the Federalist Papers." Robert Kanigel's judgment is more measured: "The coming of Taylorism made our age what it was going to become anyway -- only more so, more quickly, more irrevocably." However, Mr. Kanigel's richly detailed biography, "The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency," shows how much drama there was in the mundane when Taylor was making it the stuff of a new "science" of efficiency.
Taylor, whose life (1856-1915) coincided with America's period of pell-mell industrialization, was born into an affluent, landed family in suburban Philadelphia. At the age of 13, during extended travel with his parents in Europe, he watched his impatient father use the power of his purse to get reluctant local laborers to repair a bridge so the family's touring could proceed. This was, for young Fred, an intensely practical epiphany: money can make working men move faster.
He was to become one of those men, briefly, and would use his years on the factory floor to achieve moral ascendancy through downward mobility. For the rest of his life he would invoke his laboring experience to claim the moral high ground in fierce debates about whether he understood, respected and served working people. At Phillips Exeter Academy (where, the saying was, there were "no rules, only absolute freedom, tempered by expulsion") he passed Harvard's admission exam with distinction. However, he chose to work in a factory making iron castings. There he learned that life is real, life is earnest.
He entered what Mr. Kanigel calls a "world of wood, iron, rope, leather, cloth," a world of steam power transmitted through belts and pulleys that amplified human muscle, which was abundant. Abundant and hence, Taylor saw, squandered. As he rose quickly into the ranks of management, he could act on his one seminal idea: the key to productivity is knowledge, not muscle power -- although sometimes the most important knowledge is how to organize the use of muscles.
The instruments of organization included stopwatches, with dials marking tenths and hundredths of a minute for easy calculations. Taylor's interest was less in what could be done in 10 hours than in 10 seconds. How much time did it take to perform a properly analyzed task -- fill a wheelbarrow, drive a nail, shovel coal? Assembly lines, like Ford's, or even disassembly lines, like those of Chicago's meatpackers, required the disassembly of work. "Amid the blur of activity of human work," Mr. Kanigel writes, "where did one element end and another begin?" Well, time-and-motion studies would tell. "Now, gentlemen, shoveling is a great science compared with pig-iron handling," Taylor said to a Congressional committee in 1912.
The committee was hostile and Taylor was bewildered. Theatrical in temperament, brimful of certitudes and vehement in expressing them, he was not just offended, he was uncomprehending when politicians and other people reacted furiously to his statements like: "In our scheme, we do not ask the initiative of our men. We do not want any initiative. All we want of them is to obey the orders we give them, do what we say, and do it quick." Although he could address workers with appalling brutality ("I have you for your strength and mechanical ability, and we have other men paid for thinking"), he considered himself a progressive, as did Brandeis, Ida Tarbell and other reformers.
This was, after all, a time of self-conscious modernity, defined in part by faith in science. In 1912 the nation would elect a political scientist President. There was a strong paternalistic streak in the progressivism of Walter Lippmann; Herbert Croly, the founder of The New Republic and leader of progressivism; and others who believed that modern life was too complicated for the untutored masses to cope with. A tutoring class, in government and business, would lead the people up from backward practices. However, it now seems that such workplace paternalism often is, well, inefficient. The unending search for enhanced productivity now often leads to something like workplace democracy, empowering the workers to help organize their toils.
In Mr. Kanigel's telling, there is much pathos in Taylor's sense of being ill used by critics. He was sure his system would dissolve tensions between labor and capital by demonstrating that high wages are not a problem but a solution. His mantra was "Men will not do an extraordinary day's work for an ordinary day's pay." So pay better for workers who will pay the price in new techniques for enhanced productivity. However, that price included more than the heightened stress of a more revved-up workplace. It also involved the moral insult of diminished prestige inherent in the transfer of all thinking from labor to the new management class. The result was a world of work that felt and even sounded different. As Mr. Kanigel says, "Everything clacked and whirred faster."
Taylor passionately believed Taylorism would raise what has come to be called the "standard of living." However, the controversy that engulfed him demonstrated that that concept is too complex to be reduced to a few indexes of material betterment. The man who helped ratchet up the level of stress in modern life may have had his life shortened -- he died the day after his 59th birthday -- by the strain of living with the controversy he caused. This in spite of the fact that in his last years he stopped to smell the roses: one of his final searches was for the one best way to cultivate them.
In 1916, the year after Taylor's death, Lenin passed some of his time in Zurich annotating a German translation of a Taylor book. The year after that, America's entry into World War I secured the nation's embrace of efficiency as a sovereign value and of Taylor as a prophet. In the 1920's a Parisian cleric declared, "The love of God is the Taylor System of our spiritual life." In 1927, at the end of an Italian conference on scientific management, Mussolini gave Taylor's widow a photograph of himself in exchange for one of Taylor. In 1928 the United States elected as President an engineer who had written a report on waste in industry. It has been reported that when Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times," with its depiction of a man meshed with a machine and reduced to a machinelike jerkiness of movements, was shown to audiences in industrial Pittsburgh, they did not find it funny.
Mr. Kanigel is an award-winning science writer, but his prose could use an infusion of efficiency. (He uses "kid-glove" as a verb.) And he is not as attentive to intellectual history as he should be. His scanting of that allows his narrative to suggest that Taylorism triggered a spanking new anxiety about a Faustian bargain that degrades workers while making them materially better off. Actually, that anxiety is as old as industrialism. Mr. Kanigel does cite Adam Smith's famous hymn to the division of labor in that pin factory where "one man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head," a process "divided into about 18 distinct operations." Smith was sanguine about this because specialization increases a worker's "dexterity," and hence "the quality of the work he can perform." However, Marx thought the division of labor produces alienation but that all would be well under Communism, "where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity." He was vague about the details.
Mr. Kanigel could have lengthened the pedigree of the controversy that engulfed Taylor had he considered the fact that in the second quarter of the 19th century, when American industrialism was in its infancy, Alexis de Tocqueville anticipated the ambivalence that Taylor catalyzed early in this century: "When a workman is unceasingly and exclusively engaged in the fabrication of one thing, he ultimately does his work with singular dexterity; but, at the same time, he loses the general faculty of applying his mind to the direction of the work. He every day becomes more adroit and less industrious; so that it may be said of him, that, in proportion as the workman improves, the man is degraded."
Taylor's critics worried about both "deskilling" and the creation of an "aristocracy of the capable," and about work becoming scarce because of what is now called "downsizing" -- a productive few displacing the less fit. Mr. Kanigel believes, reasonably, that Taylor's legacy -- a new kind of seriousness about enhancing workers' productivity -- has been, on balance, benign. It certainly came in handy when Hitler was rampant. Mr. Kanigel quotes Mr. Drucker: during the war, "by applying Taylor's Scientific Management, U.S. industry trained totally unskilled workers, many of them former sharecroppers raised in a pre-industrial environment, and converted them in 60 to 90 days into first-rate welders and ship-builders." One ship, launched in South Portland, Me., in 1942, was the 7,176-ton S.S. Frederick W. Taylor.
 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 15, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A review in The Times Book Review today, about "The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency," by Robert Kanigel, refers erroneously on page 10 to Adam Smith's description of the division of labor in "The Wealth of Nations." The reference should read, "Smith was sanguine about this because specialization increases a worker's 'dexterity,' and hence 'the quantity of the work he can perform' " (not "the quality").
Because of an editing error in the review, on page 8, a quotation from Frederick Winslow Taylor omits a word; the sentence should read, "In our scheme, we do not ask for the initiative of our men" (not "ask the initiative").

In a further push into Latin America, DDB Needham is buying a stake in a Brazilian agency.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
MADISON AVENUE giant is singing along to the Carmen Miranda tune "South American Way" -- and just like her, with a Brazilian accent.
DDB Needham Worldwide in New York, one of the three global agencies of Omnicom Group, has agreed to acquire a majority interest in DM9 Publicidade, a privately held, creatively focused agency based in Sao Paulo, Brazil. DM9, known for award-winning work for clients from brewers to banks, was ranked -- appropriately -- No. 9 among Brazilian agencies by the trade publication Advertising Age, with billings of $209.3 million in 1996. 
 When ranked by 1996 income of $48.6 million, an increase of 63.8 percent from 1995, DM9, which also has an office in Brasilia, placed seventh in the Advertising Age listings.
Though financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, DDB Needham, the No. 5 worldwide agency with billings last year of $967.7 million, will acquire about 60 percent of DM9 from its top managers for cash and Omnicom stock. DM9, founded in 1989, will be renamed DM9 DDB as it becomes part of the DDB Needham network, which has 12 offices in 10 South American countries.
The acquisition, the most recent in a skein by Omnicom and Omnicom-owned shops, will more than double the size of DDB Needham's Latin American operations, said Darryl Lindberg, president of DDB South America in New York.
The deal, announced on Friday, is indicative of the growing attention being paid to Latin America by both ad agencies and the multinational marketers for which they create campaigns.
"Latin America is a key area of focus for our clients and our prospects, too," Mr. Lindberg said.
"And Brazil is the largest country with the largest economy," he added. "It's a fantastic growth area."
Similar ardor was expressed on Friday by Young & Rubicam Advertising, which is making the first pan-regional purchase of television commercial time in Latin America for the Colgate-Palmolive Company. The purchase, made by Y.& R. Latin America in Miami, is estimated at $3 million to $4 million and covers 11 cable networks.
Commercials for big brands like Colgate toothpaste and Mennen antiperspirant will run on networks like CNN en Espanol, owned by Time Warner Inc.; ESPN, part of the Walt Disney Company, and Fox Sports, a unit of the News Corporation.
The clients of DM9 include multinational advertisers like Levi Strauss & Company; Electrolux A.B., the Swedish appliance maker; Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A., the Italian food and dairy company, and the Schering-Plough Corporation, the pharmaceutical company. The agency also handles accounts of Brazilian marketers like Banco Itau, the country's second-largest bank, and Companhia Antarctica Paulista, Brazil's second-largest brewer.
It was for an ad for an Antarctica brand, Antarctica Diet Guarana, that won DM9 the Grand Award for print ads in 1994 in an international competition sponsored by the New York Festivals. DM9 also won a Clio Award that year and three awards from the Art Directors Club.
This year, for the fifth consecutive year, DM9 won the most awards in the Brazilian Creative Club competition. And the agency was a finalist in the print and cinema/television categories in the prestigious One Show sponsored by the One Club for Art and Copy.
Mary Warlick, executive director of the One Club in New York, praised DM9's work, describing it as typical of South American agencies in being "very visually driven."
One factor driving the deal between DM9 and DDB Needham was a shared client, the Budweiser beer brand brewed by Anheuser-Busch Inc. Budweiser is made and sold in Brazil by a joint venture that is 51 percent owned by Anheuser-Busch and 49 percent by Antarctica.
Another factor behind the transaction, Mr. Lindberg said, was the creative heritages of both agencies. A predecessor agency of DDB Needham, Doyle Dane Bernbach, created legendary campaigns for brands like Volkswagen, Avis and Sony.
Nizan Guanaes, president of DM9, who will remain in that post after the acquisition, paid tribute to a co-founder of Doyle Dane. "It's a great honor for a copywriter like me to be a partner in Bill Bernbach's agency," he said in a statement.
Mr. Lindberg compared DM9 to BMP DDB, the creatively focused British agency of DDB Needham. BMP DDB was the offspring of a deal made eight years ago, when Omnicom bought Boase Massimi Pollitt Partnership. The London office of Boase Massimi, BMP Davidson Pearce, was merged with DDB Needham's London office to form BMP DDB, now the No. 4 British agency in billings, according to the trade publication Campaign.
Negotiations between DDB Needham and DM9 began "a few months ago," said Mr. Lindberg, who will oversee DM9 DDB. Mr. Lindberg reports to Bernard Brochand, president of the DDB Needham international division.

HEADLINE: Opening a Conversation on Race

 BODY:
In proposing a year-long national "conversation" about race, President Clinton put the nation's most important social problem where it belongs, at the top of the national agenda. His speech on Saturday at commencement exercises of the University of California at San Diego was a sermon with little sanctimonious preaching. He went beyond the obvious need for racial justice to the practical and even economic reasons why the United States must nurture its increasingly diverse society.
For a President with a reputation of trying hard to please, it took political audacity to stand up for affirmative action in the very state and university system that had begun dismantling this essential remedy against injustice. Reaching out to those on the other side of the issue, Mr. Clinton said Californians were doing this "without any ill motives" and from a sincere conviction that racial discrimination is no longer a significant barrier to success. But the President rightly implored Americans not to follow that path, which would only turn their public universities and private workplaces into segregated islands of privilege. 
 A generation ago, as Mr. Clinton noted, the Kerner Commission warned that the United States was in danger of becoming two nations, one black and one white. Today the country's ethnic difficulties are far more varied and subtle. In another generation, the President said, the United States will encompass ethnic minorities from across the world. It will be of great social and practical importance to harness such diversity to improve the quality of life for everyone and create an economy that can engage in an even more diverse global marketplace.
The President spoke at a time when ethnic and religious conflict has erupted throughout the world. He foresees a historic role for the United States, leading the way to a new definition of nationhood in which diversity is a strength, not a weakness.
President Clinton's speech evoked skepticism and criticism from partisans on both sides of the racial divide. Foes of affirmative action were disappointed that he did not reject what they consider to be the failed path of quotas and racial preferences. Advocates of more aggressive action on race and poverty were disappointed that he did not commit more resources for job-training and education. They express lingering bitterness over the welfare law enacted last year that is likely to deepen poverty and racial despair. The President focused on the future, however, and encouraged his newly appointed advisory panel, with the historian John Hope Franklin as its chairman, to listen before making recommendations.
The appreciative applause from the Californians at the graduation this weekend was a welcome sign that the issues of race, affirmative action and diversity can be discussed candidly. If Mr. Clinton's speech starts such a process, and leads to concrete actions, it could be remembered as a turning point for him and the country. Let the conversation proceed.

HEADLINE: Dutch Take 'Third Way' to Prosperity

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM

 BODY:
The Dutch are used to living with a potent mix of neighbors often seen here as more pushy or flamboyant than themselves. They watch the mighty Germans, the elitist French and the insular British and sometimes get a little sour about being ignored while others drive European affairs.
So it is with some amusement that the Dutch suddenly find themselves upheld as a model for the rest of Europe. 
 In the weeks preceding the meeting of European leaders that begins here on June 16, foreign economists, sociologists and union and political figures have visited seeking to understand what has kept the Netherlands so stable, prosperous and curiously without strikes.
 As Europeans wring their hands over what is usually presented as a choice between heartless American-style modernizing of their economies and preserving the old European social safety nets, many people say the Dutch have found a "third way" combining an open, vigorous market with generous social benefits and a measure of social justice.
Critics point to the high percentage of temporary jobs and social benefits that they say are still too expensive. But for the last five years the Dutch economy has grown faster than those of Britain, France and Germany, and unemployment -- at 6.5 percent -- is well below that of the large European countries.
The Dutch example has begun to gain wide attention with the approach of next year's deadline for the strict criteria countries must meet if they want to join the common European currency. Countries aspiring to use the currency, called the euro, are in the midst of austerity programs that have led to social unrest and antagonized voters. Leaders at the meeting here are expected to sign an accord aimed at insuring the euro's stability.
The Dutch say they have invented nothing new by keeping down wages, inflation and interest rates, and by easing the rules for hiring and firing and for opening new businesses.
But what is different here, often astonishing foreign analysts and investors, is the painstaking consensus building that has avoided social unrest and made wide changes possible. In contrast to the convulsions of bigger neighbors like Britain, France and Spain, the Dutch have worked on avoiding ideological confrontations and for more than a decade have sustained a pact between left and right. As long as unions accepted financial discipline, management has not demanded the dismantling of the welfare state as the price of investing and creating jobs.
In May, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based research organization of the industrialized nations, noted the Dutch success. It said the country had found a way to tackle unemployment and introduce reforms "through a consensual process, involving the social partners and clearly not threatening social cohesion."
A recent scene in Amsterdam would have been hard to imagine in London or Paris: the leader of the biggest labor confederation, addressing a workers' congress, declared with passion that it was vital to maintain the strength of the Dutch currency and of the planned European currency. In the front row was the president of the Netherlands central bank, Wim Duisenberg, who applauded, beaming.
"I might have phrased it a little differently," he said afterward, "but I could sign my name to this."
Such a fraternal scene is not unusual for this country, whose Prime Minister, Wim Kok, was himself a labor leader.
Now in the spotlight as the host for the European meeting, Mr. Kok has a reputation as a skillful negotiator. He is widely credited as the chief architect of the "social pact" between Government, employers and unions that has insured stability.
As the country's top labor leader, in 1982 he helped launch the pact under which labor federations kept to wage demands of 2 percent per year in exchange for shorter work weeks and more jobs. He stuck to austerity as the Finance Minister from 1989 to 1994, the year he became Prime Minister as leader of a left-right coalition. On a Continent where people are widely disgruntled with politicians, his approval ratings have remained high.
The Dutch say their achievements have come from tough negotiations. Cuts in unemployment benefits have pushed people back to work, and the large number of workers calling in sick dropped when new laws shifted the burden of sick pay to employers. As Cees Oudshoorn, an official at the Ministry of Economy put it, "The Dutch miracle, if it exists at all, is that our labor unions could be convinced to rally around a free-market economy."
Signs of a flourishing market abound. On the outskirts of Amsterdam and around Rotterdam, the world's busiest port, new office parks have drawn foreign companies. Consumers are driving up sales in stores, which only last year got permission to stay open after 6 and on Sundays.
One telling indicator is the growth of job agencies, which have expanded by 50 percent in the past four years. They advertise a plethora of vacancies in technical jobs, services, sales and health care.
To draw more people, especially women, into the work force, the Government has deregulated work hours, allowing previously unthinkable part-time and temporary contracts. This has made job agencies into a growth industry, now employing more than 12,000 people. Randstad, the largest temporary help chain, had a staff of 1,600 in 1993 and has 2,800 today.
"We know where the shortages are, and we help companies plan their work force," said Maarten den Ottolander, a Randstad director. "In the past, temporary jobs could last only six months, but now that they are unlimited, the agencies' role in the market is becoming very big."
One result of the new flexibility is that the Dutch now have Europe's most developed temporary job market. Critics complain that it is a serious weakness that one-third of Dutch jobs are now temporary or part-time. But part-timers still get benefits like vacation and health insurance, and after six months they begin accumulating pension rights.
Hersta de Goede, in her early 20's, is herself doing temporary work at Randstad and represents the view of many people just out of school. "I'd prefer to work full-time," she said. "But this is better than no work."
Nicolette Koopman, 23, works three days a week at an Amsterdam bookshop. She said she preferred this to full-time work. "It gives me time to do other things," she said. "If I need more money, I can get extra odd jobs."
The lively temporary job market seems indeed a boon for young people here, compared with France, where 27 percent of young people are unemployed. But things look worse for workers over 35. Specialists say that the easy-come, easy-go market makes it harder for older employees, because they are more expensive and seen as working less hard.
Skeptics say the Dutch still have a way to go before all the unaffordable fat from the welfare state is trimmed. Some 800,000 people in a population of 15 million draw disability pay for mild or vague ailments, including "stress." That is 100,000 fewer than three years ago, when the Government tightened the rules.
Other problems loom. Religious leaders have warned that inequality has risen with the more competitive market. An aging population means that today's benefits may not go on, as workers paying for them become proportionately fewer.
Yet other Europeans have said that they wish their statistics were as rosy as the Dutch, and that they were as skilled at avoiding political conflict. Whether the Dutch social contract is exportable is unclear. The country has long been governed by coalitions and may be more used to deal-making and compromise than other European countries.
The endless meetings and debates that come with the Dutch consensus model can seem exasperating to foreign businessmen. But some foreigners note that the lengthy sessions in which the Dutch thrash out ways to live together -- "a kind of never-ending group therapy," in the words of one diplomat -- have recognizable results. The approach has produced a level of trust in the system.
"It's enough to make politicians in France envious," one French resident said.

Take a personal computer. Shrink it. Add a Windows operating system. Now what?

BYLINE: By Michelle Slatalla 

 BODY:
THE first generation of hand-held computing devices using software that looks and feels like the familiar Microsoft Windows operating system is now on the market, with products from seven different hardware makers. In fact many of these products will be on display this week at the PC Expo industry bazaar in Manhattan. But many analysts say that at $500 or more, the Microsoft-based gadgets so far pose no serious challenge to the popular Palm Pilot by U.S. Robotics.
The reason is simple. The Palm Pilot, whose introduction last year revitalized the moribund hand-held computing market, relied on a radical idea: Stop trying to replace the personal computer and instead create a PC extension, an easy-to-use, fit-in-your-pocket device to automate the keeping of calendars, to-do lists and phone files and other workday data. And sell it for less than $300. 
 The Pilot strategy paid off. So far more than one million of the units have been sold, capturing about 70 percent of sales in the growing hand-held market and creating the kind of grass-roots support among programmers and hackers not seen since the early days of the PC.
By comparison, Microsoft's strategy of adapting its popular Windows operating system to a tiny new hardware platform has not impressed many analysts, who say the devices are too expensive and try too hard to emulate PC's -- but with inferior screens and cramped keyboards.
"They've just made a mini-PC, shrunk it down," said Tom Rhinelander, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "And maybe that's neat from an engineering perspective, but not from a user's perspective. But the Microsoft devices aren't going to be the successful devices, because of size and function and what they try to do. They're too big, they're not designed for what people will use really small mobile devices for."
While no one is willing to release early sales figures for the Microsoft-based hand-helds, recent market surveys by both Dataquest and PC Data Research Studies indicate that U.S. Robotics' Pilot still has a substantial lead over all competitors.
"The Pilot defined the market for a hand-held device," said Mike McGuire, Dataquest's senior industry analyst for mobile computing. "Is there room for Windows CE in the category? Perhaps. But the Pilot operating system, which was designed solely for that device, is almost Zen-like in the way it's built."
The lesson, in the case of the Pilot, is that a successful hand-held device is one that moves information back and forth from the desktop, not one that creates information. The Pilot does not even have a keyboard; users rely on hand-writing recognition and hook up the device to their PC's to download data or electronic-mail messages.
Users of Pilot can also jot down upcoming appointments, update contact lists and compose simple messages they want to send later. At the end of the day, users connect the Pilot to their PC's to transfer the information to their desktop machines.
"People said you can't do a product like this without wireless communications. But we tried to see through what people say they want, and give them what they really want," said Donna Dubinsky, general manager of the palm computing division of U.S. Robotics.
In contrast, the Microsoft devices support wireless communications, as well as spreadsheet and word-processing programs. The Microsoft devices also have the Internet TCP/IP software protocols built in, which give the user the capability to connect directly to the Net for sending and receiving E-mail and to browse the World Wide Web. Many analysts say, however, that those are activities better suited to the keyboards and screens of much larger computers.
But don't count Microsoft out. The mere fact of the software giant's announcement last year that it was entering the hand-held market with Windows CE (the CE stands for consumer electronics) lent legitimacy to a then-struggling industry.
Not only did major hardware vendors like Hewlett-Packard, NEC, Casio and Compaq sign deals to create Windows CE devices costing $500 to $700 apiece, but software developers took interest, too. That is because developers, who already know how to write applications for Windows, can use the same tools to create programs for CE devices -- which means plenty of programs to run equally well on all the different brands of CE hand-helds.
Still, while Microsoft is already focused on the second generation of hand-helds, code-named Griffin, the real success of Windows CE may come in a different arena altogether. The operating system is powerful and flexible enough to run any number of devices -- from digital telephones to television set-top boxes. (Remember Microsoft's deal in April to acquire Web TV?)
"We always had bigger purposes in mind for where Windows CE would be used, and hand-helds was just the first place where it wound up," said Jim Floyd, a product manager for hand-held PC's at Microsoft.
Microsoft is already working toward using Windows CE in a whole new category of computers that analysts call "ultra-ultra-portables." Such a unit would weigh about 2.5 pounds and cost less than $1,000, or about half the price and half the weight of today's portables.
Add a battery life of at least eight hours, and ultra-ultra-portables could replace notebooks and laptops for most mobile professionals. In a computer like that, with a full-size keyboard and monitor, users might welcome the chance to run Word and Excel and the other more sophisticated applications that CE supports.
As for the Pilot? Its makers are happy to stay put in the category the Pilot defined, thank you. "You can imagine us putting more functionality into more or less the same form or maybe reducing the size," Ms. Dubinsky said. "But we'll keep the same functionality."

HEADLINE: THE FINE PRINT: A close look at a tax break;
Tax Bill's Complexities Often Aid the Wealthy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
"Beset with invisible boomerangs."
That's the way the Justice Robert H. Jackson of the Supreme Court described the hidden dangers of tax laws in a 1952 opinion. 
 The bill the House Ways and Means Committee approved last week is a good illustration of just what Justice Jackson was talking about.
Take, for example, a provision in the bill that would exempt from capital gains taxation up to $500,000 of the profits a couple made from the sale of their home but would set the exemption for a single person at $250,000.
That caused great mirth among several of the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants who spent breaks in the committee's sessions this week trying to puzzle out unintended consequences in the bill the way other people might work on crosswords.
An accountant said he had an elderly client outside Philadelphia who had a house worth more than $1 million and who he knew would look for a marriage of convenience if the $500,000 exemption became law.
"I can just see this guy finding himself an old lady somewhere and getting married and selling his house and then dumping her like a sack of potatoes," the accountant said.
A lawyer thought of a corollary: "Say your husband's on his death bed and you've got this house with a big capital gain. You'd better sell it quick before he dies."
These people were mostly joking. But they also saw a more serious consequence that was being overlooked in the section of the bill dealing with capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments. The bill would lower the top capital gains tax rate, now 28 percent, to 10 percent for taxpayers with incomes below $41,200 and to 20 percent for those who were better off.
The main beneficiaries of the 10 percent rate, the tax experts said, would not be middle-income taxpayers selling a modest amount of mutual funds. Instead, it would be wealthy families who were selling stock to pay for their children's tuition. They could cut the taxes in half by giving their appreciated stock to their children and having the children sell it, rather than selling it themselves and paying the higher tax because of their higher income.
That is not the only instance in which the bill would give a better tax break to affluent people sending their children to college than it would give to taxpayers who were less well off.
The bill would allow parents to put money into an educational investment account, similar to an individual retirement account, in which interest and dividends would accumulate tax-free. The money could then be withdrawn to pay college expenses. The Democratic staff of the Ways and Means Committee calculated that a family that could afford to invest $50,000 in such an account when a child was 8 years old would save almost $4,000 a year in taxes on a $22,500 annual tuition bill when the child reached college age. Under the bill, a family that could not afford to put aside so much money in advance and had to meet the college costs from income and student loans would get a tax break of only $1,500 a year, and that would be available only for the first two years of college.
If all this sounds complicated, it is. That is somewhat embarrassing to the principal author of the bill, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who has made a career of complaining about how complicated the income tax system is.
Mr. Archer commented on the paradox in his opening statement to the committee on Thursday evening. Holding up the 422-page bill, he said, "When you look at a tax bill that's this thick, you know it's not going to simplify things for the taxpayer."
Then, to make sure no one thought he had changed his stripes, he quickly added, "This in no way hinders my ultimate goal of abolishing the income tax system."
The most "fabulously complicated" part of the legislation, said Jeffery L. Yablon, a prominent tax lawyer here, is the provision that would allow investors to adjust the value of their capital gains to take account of inflation, a process known in tax lingo as indexation.
Here is how it would work. Say an investor bought stock for $100, held it for three years and then sold it for $110, and assume the inflation in overall prices in the economy was a total of 9 percent for the three years.
Under the law now, the investor would report a capital gain of $10. But if the law allowed indexation, the taxable gain would be only $1.
Sounds simple enough. But here is the problem. Many people buy stock with borrowed money and take a deduction for the interest they pay on their loan. So if the investor borrowed the money at an interest rate of 4 percent, his tax statement would show a loss of $3 ($1 profit minus $4 deduction), although he had actually made a profit on his investment even after adjusting for inflation.
"Borrowed money is a killer," Mr. Yablon said. "If you index the basis of assets, you have to index the basis of debt, and once you start doing that, you have insane, wild ramifications."
Not all of the boomerangs in the bill are invisible. One would require that labor unions report to their members on a special form the percentage of the members' dues that are used for political activities. The unions say this reporting would cost them more than $20 million.
Republicans concede that the provision was not put in the bill for tax reasons. It was added because Republican lawmakers were irritated by how active organized labor was on behalf of Democrats in last year's election. The Republicans think that union members would rebel if they knew how much of their dues was used for political purposes.
Another item in the bill would have completely expected consequences. The measure would allow some large bakery companies, like Pepperidge Farm, Freihofer's and Arnold, to designate certain drivers as independent contractors, which would mean that the companies would not be required to pay the drivers' Social Security, Medicare and unemployment compensation taxes.
Why should the bakers get something not available to butchers and candlestick makers?
"They have a better lobbyist," a Ways and Means Committee staff member explained.
Asked about this, Rob Mackie, a lobbyist for the American Bakers Association, replied, "I'd like to think we finally got our act together."

The Respect Divide

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Corey Arthur made virtually no effort to conceal his role in the murder of Jonathan Levin, investigators said.
Detectives believe that Mr. Arthur, 19 years old, bounced around on the subways in the day or two before Mr. Levin's death, trying to persuade first one and then another acquaintance to join him in the fatal scheme. 
 After the widely admired 31-year-old high school teacher had been stabbed, shot and robbed in his Upper West Side apartment, Mr. Arthur, like so many other young violent offenders, could hardly wait to tell friends what he had done, police said.
"He was boasting about it," said a veteran homicide detective. "They all do it. They want their peers to know."
Mr. Arthur left a message on Mr. Levin's telephone answering machine before the murder and reportedly left personal items in the apartment afterward. He never really tried to hide. He never fled.
"He even even kept the bloody clothes," the detective said. "For what? Souvenirs? He might as well have dialed 911 and said come get me."
Some people hit game-winning jump shots at the buzzer. Some save lives on the operating table. Some write hit songs. It doesn't matter what they do. It's all about respect. They want their peers to know.
In the world inhabited by Corey Arthur there are an extraordinary number of hapless individuals, mostly male, who roam the streets and ride the subways raging at their insignificance, at their isolation and chronic inability to deal successfully with the larger world, at the contempt and disdain with which they are viewed by so many, including themselves.
They are obsessed with gaining respect. Unable to achieve it in more conventional ways, many turn to violence. A Brooklyn teen-ager once said to me, "Nobody disses you when you've got a gun on 'em."
Corey Arthur (who has been indicted, along with a co-defendant, in Mr. Levin's murder) had very little going for him. He wanted to be a rap star but his talent was limited. He had a police record. He was expelled from William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx, where he first met Mr. Levin. He had a drug habit. An acquaintance quoted in a Times story said: "He always wanted to have money but never wanted to get a job. His M.O. was to stick black people up or whoever he can."
Mr. Arthur may not have known that Jonathan Levin had come from an extremely wealthy family, but it's a safe bet that he envied what he saw as his ex-teacher's exalted status. Jonathan Levin got lots of respect; Corey Arthur got none. Whatever happens to Mr. Arthur (the options range from acquittal to execution), it is in that deep and destructive divide that we need to be working if we want to prevent the many tragedies that flow from the sense of worthlessness that is felt by so many potentially violent youngsters.
It is the tallest of orders, and not at all for the faint of heart. Families have to be knitted back together and fathers brought back into the home. Children have to be taught to read and to reason in schools that are secure and in good repair. Attitudes have to be changed so that violence loses its cachet and teen-agers don't feel that after killing someone they are entitled to turn around and take a bow. Punishment for those who harm others should be swift and certain and severe.
Also, civil rights organizations, ever vigilant to external threats, need to devote at least as much energy to the enemies within. And the men and women with their hands on the levers of the economy need to be made aware that a saner, safer society depends on employment opportunities being available to everyone who can work.
Many people are already hard at work on these matters. (Jonathan Levin was one. He had a gift for honing the talents and ratcheting up the esteem of his students.) But the task is enormous and getting bigger. The demographers tell us a huge new wave of teen-agers is almost upon us. We can engage them and guide their energy and talents along constructive paths. Or we can ignore them, and wait for the weakest and most desperate among them to seek their measure of respect and the applause of their peers by squeezing the trigger of a gun.

HEADLINE: A Year Out of Bankruptcy, Orange County Hits the Road

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., June 15

 BODY:
A year after emerging from the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy, Orange County is heralding the anniversary with an itinerant coming-out party in five cities.
In presentations to investment fund managers, bond-rating agencies and insurers over the next three weeks, local officials will try to repair the county's junk-bond credit rating by describing its fiscal health, which is being aided by California's vibrant economy. 
 Five local officials, including William Steiner, the chairman of the county's board of supervisors, and Jan Mittermeier, the county's chief executive, are arguing that Wall Street should restore the county to its pre-bankruptcy investment-grade status because its government has improved oversight of investment decisions and because the region of 2.5 million residents is financially healthy. Onerous conditions imposed on the county's new debt securities in the wake of its fiscal crisis have cost taxpayers more than $30 million, Mrs. Mittermeier said.
"It's a good story," said John Pizzarelli, managing director of public finance for MBIA Inc., the nation's largest bond insurer, who heard the county's pitch in New York on Wednesday, the day before the one-year anniversary. "You've got a sizzling economy putting the wind in their sails."
In the aftermath of its $1.6 billion investment loss and December 1994 bankruptcy filing, Orange County issued $1.4 billion in bonds backed by MBIA insurance, but at three or four times the normal cost. Without insurance to buoy the creditworthiness of the county's notes, all the issues would have fallen below investment grade and would have to bear a higher interest rate to offset the higher risk for investors. Of the $180 billion in municipal bonds sold last year, 48 percent carried insurance, up from 43 percent in 1995.
Now, if MBIA was to insure an Orange County issue, "we would give them a break on pricing," Mr. Pizzarelli said, "because things have gotten better." He said he was reassured by the county's efforts to rein in expenses, impose more discipline on issuing new debt and its revenue boom from rising sales and property taxes. Still, "some people are going to need more convincing," he acknowledged.
Among the messages emphasized by local officials are a second wave of post-bankruptcy budget cuts that will trim 220 positions and $10 million in costs, effective July 1, and a credit management policy that includes a reserve fund to retire high-priced debt.
The county has no immediate plans to return to the capital markets for new debt, although refinancing of some issues may be considered, Mrs. Mittermeier said. These include $155 million in so-called Teeter notes, which are secured by delinquent property taxes.
"I don't think we should be in the market until the market feels more comfortable with us," Mrs. Mittermeier said. That, she said, would be signaled by a change in the county's investment rating, which now is below investment grade at Moody's and Standard & Poor's. "We think we should have investment- grade rating three or four years from now."
Stephanie Peterson, the vice president of municipal research for the Charles Schwab Corporation, agreed that Orange County's road show would probably improve Wall Street's comfort level. "They want the market to appreciate that Orange County has put the bankruptcy behind them," she said.
Others are skeptical that the county's story, no matter how good, is enough to erase the investor insecurity caused by the municipal crises. In the end, Orange County bondholders were paid in full without a taxpayer bailout. The county engineered an elaborate plan to repay its debts by diverting funds coming into some of the county's agencies. Some municipalities agreed to accept only 80 cents on the dollar for claims they had against losses in the county's investment pool, with the remainder to be made up from hoped-for proceeds of litigation filed by the county against its former financial advisers.
"There is a lingering issue of trust that takes time to restore," said Stephen B. Ward, Schwab's chief investment officer. "The county reached into a bag of tricks that others didn't. People will have to be convinced that that's really over. It will take a solid record over time. What will really dispel it is another recession. They recovered during a recovery."
One municipal bond portfolio manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity, predicted the county would be forced to pay slightly higher interest rates on its debt securities for up to 15 years, just like the penalty still attached to bonds issued by the Washington Public Power Supply System, which defaulted on $2.3 billion in bonds on two nuclear power plants in 1983. "The stigma will not go away," he said.

HEADLINE: Voting Shows Croatia, in Effect, Annexed Bosnia Region

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: MOSTAR, Bosnia and Herzegovina, June 15

 BODY:
The red-and-white flags hanging along the tree-lined streets were Croatian. The posters of President Franjo Tudjman were the same as those plastered on billboards in the Croatian capital, Zagreb. And throngs of voters filed through the gate of the Mostar polling station today by showing their blue Croatian passports to the police.
In theory this region is part of the American-brokered federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In fact, it has been annexed by Croatia, in one of the most flagrant violations of the Dayton peace agreement. The Bosnian Croats vote in Croatian elections and have their local leadership as well as their military financed and directed by Zagreb. 
 In the voting for president, Mr. Tudjman, 75 and seriously ill with cancer, appeared tonight to be headed toward a landslide victory for a second five-year term. He has been increasingly criticized by Washington, and it was in this city that the raw intolerance of his hard-line nationalism and the duplicity of his dealings with the outside world were most visible.
"You have Bosnian Croats in the diaspora, who have never lived in Croatia, voting in this election," a Western diplomat said of the some 400,000 voters who live here and in other countries, "while hundreds of thousands of Serb citizens from Croatia, who spent their whole lives here, are denied the right to vote."
Croatia's economy, burdened by outdated industry and mismanagement, is limping along at 55 percent of the capacity it had before the Bosnian war. The currency is overvalued, the foreign trade deficit is widening, and unemployment is at least 20 percent.
Mr. Tudjman is, nevertheless, lionized as the man who in 1991 led Croatia's independence from the old Yugoslavia and created the modern Croatian state.
"He is the father of our country," said Drago Pezic, 76, a former platoon commander during the fascist Ustashe government that ruled Croatia in World War II. "He gave to us our state after 900 years of being ruled by others. He brought all Croats under one roof. He got rid of the Serbs. He finally won the war we started in 1941 and lost to the Communists."
In the process, Mr. Tudjman purged 500,000 of 600,000 ethnic Serbs from the country and carried out the de facto annexation of the largely Catholic region of Herzegovina. In short, he gave Croats an "ethnically pure" state.
"What have I promised that I have not fulfilled?" the President asked a cheering crowd in his last campaign rally on Thursday in Zagreb.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, during a visit to Croatia this month, strongly condemned recent violent attacks on remaining minority Serbs, most of them elderly, who were driven from their homes. She also expressed her displeasure with Mr. Tudjman's refusal to hand over indicted war criminals, may of whom have taken refuge in Mostar, to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
Washington, which considered Zagreb an ally during the war in Bosnia, in large part because of its willingness to permit clandestine shipments of Iranian arms to the Bosnian Muslims, now appears to have lost patience.
Senior American officials say they intend to begin blocking development loans, applications into Western trade bodies and military alliances. A $13 million loan granted to Croatia a few days ago was approved several weeks ago and was not large enough to reconvene international lender organizations to block, they said.
"Most Croatians do not yet realize what this isolation will cost them in economic and security terms," a senior Western diplomat said.
The election campaign here has been as bombastic and stilted as those once waged by the Communists. The state-run media, including all nationwide radio and television stations, have slavishly exalted Mr. Tudjman and his governing Croatian Democratic Union.
While Mr. Tudjman was deified, his two opponents, who rarely appeared in the state-run media, were described as "enemies of the state."
If none of the candidates win more than 50 percent of the votes, the two top-placed finishers are scheduled to compete again on June 29. But such a runoff, given Mr. Tudjman's popularity, is unlikely.
The two opposition candidates are expected to receive no more than 30 percent of the vote when the final results are released on Monday.
Those beleaguered candidates, Vlado Gotovac of the Social Liberal Party and Zdravko Tomac of the Social Democrats, were even assaulted by enraged Croats during the campaign.
Mr. Gotovac, a 66-year-old poet who has called for the return of ethnic Serbs, was knocked unconscious and hospitalized by a captain in Mr. Tudjman's presidential guard at a rally in the city of Pula. During the assault, during which the officer punched Mr. Gotovac and beat him over the head with the metal buckle on his army belt, the officer shouted, "Long live Ante Pavelic!"
Mr. Pavelic was the fascist dictator who ruled Croatia in the Second World War and oversaw the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Gypsies, Jews and Croatian opposition leaders.
Mr. Tomac, the head of the reconstituted Communist Party, campaigned from a van, and his vehicle was stoned twice by angry mobs. He was denied a permit to hold a campaign rally in Zagreb on Friday.
Mr. Tudjman, during his second term, will oversee the reintegration of the last Serbian enclave, now administered by a United Nations mission, into Croatia. The enclave, called Eastern Slavonia, was seized by rebel Serbs at the start of the 1991 war. Two other rebel enclaves were taken by force in 1995 by the Croatian Army. During the capture, the army drove 250,000 Serbs who lived in the enclaves out of the country.
The refusal by Zagreb to permit all but a handful of the exiled Serbs to return home, as called for in the Dayton agreement, has led Washington to call for an extension of the United Nations mandate in Eastern Slavonia beyond the scheduled July 15 turnover date.
There are, however, other disturbing consequences of this unbridled nationalism.
The looting and seizure of tens of thousands of Serbian homes, especially in southern Croatia, has empowered a lawless and dangerously violent segment of Croatian society that has taken over cities like Mostar. The city remains divided between ethnic Croats and Muslims, who live in what is little more than an eastern ghetto and have no access to the Croatian section of Mostar.
Luxury cars, many stolen from Italy, German and Switzerland, according to international police monitors, clog Mostar's streets. And local mafias in Croat-controlled west Mostar, despite some arrests by Zagreb, collect protection money from shop owners, intimidate local officials and run vast prostitution, counterfeiting and drug rackets that reach into Milan and Frankfurt.
The leaders of Mr. Tudjman's party, including members of his family, along with this growing mafia, have acquired vast riches in the state's murky privatization program.

HEADLINE: Deep Anxiety Over the Coming Election in Albania

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania, June 15

 BODY:
Preparations for parliamentary elections intended to put this chaotic country on the road to normalcy are in such a state of disarray that the voting could result in more chaos, European and Albanian officials said today.
Both sides said that despite the threat of violence, the elections, to be conducted in the presence of a European security force, should proceed on June 29. But each side blamed the other for the lack of such basics as candidate lists and for an atmosphere of disorder that seems likely to inhibit effective election-day monitoring, even with more than 6,000 European troops on hand. 
 "One thing is for sure, though some effort has been made, this bird doesn't fly," said Gerard Stoudmann, a Swiss diplomat who is leading the election assistance group here for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. "There are a lot of deficiencies in the preparations and there is nothing more we can do."
Mr. Stoudmann evidently wants to distance the 54-country European organization from what may happen on election day. He said he would tell participants in a meeting in Vienna on Wednesday that will include Franz Vranitzky, the former Austrian Chancellor and chief representative of the European group on the Albanian crisis, that the Albanians should bear the responsibility.
"There's been a truckload of advice given to them and they have not been in a position to do these things because of the state of the country," Mr. Stoudmann said.
But the chairman of the Albanian Central Election Commission, Kristaq Kume, said today that he had implored the European forces to help by escorting him and other election officials to dangerous parts of the country but had been turned down. "I'm worried about violence on election day," he said.
Much of Albania spiraled into armed rebellion in March over the collapse of spurious financial schemes that investors blamed on the authoritarian Government of President Sali Berisha. New elections were perceived by the United States and Western Europe as the most calming solution to the crisis.
Albania, which was run into the ground by 50 years of rigid Communist rule, is the poorest country in Europe and has a population of only three million.
But the State Department worries that the mass of armaments that were taken in raids on warehouses or given away to Mr. Berisha's supporters during the rebellion could filter into neighboring Kosovo in Yugoslavia and into Macedonia, which have large Albanian populations.
Italy, whose eastern coastline faces Albania across the Adriatic Sea, received 16,000 Albanian refugees during the crisis and wants to shut down the flow. Greece, where hundreds of thousands of illegal Albanian immigrants provide a cheap work force, is also concerned about an influx of more refugees.
The management of the Albanian situation has been a test case for the ability of the Europeans to deal with a crisis in their own backyard.
Italy, as the country with the most direct historical, economic and emotional interest in Albania, pressed to take the lead. But its role has been plagued with mishaps.
The European military force, dominated by the Italians, is seen by many Albanians as being too passive in the face of local violent crime and thuggery. One American diplomat criticized the force as behaving more like "Boy Scouts than soldiers."
Another American diplomat, who specializes in the Balkans, said the Europeans failed to realize that Albania was a "third world country that's having a meltdown" and that it needed stronger support than it was receiving.
The dispute over the role of the foreign military force is at the heart of the potential for trouble on election day. So far, Mr. Berisha has insisted that the polling places be allowed to stay open until 9 P.M.
But the Italian military has told election supervisors that its mandate does not allow it to accompany monitors or balloting results from polling places to local election headquarters after dark. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has said that in the armed environment of Albania it is too unsafe for monitors to be left at remote polling places without military escorts.
Thus, the European security organization, along with the Council of Europe and other monitoring organizations, is faced with not being able to guarantee the safety of monitors who stay at polling places while the vote is being counted. Other monitoring organizations agreed today with Mr. Stoudmann's conclusions.
The National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a Government-funded group based in Washington that has been an observer in four Albanian elections, issued a report tonight saying its visiting delegation was not confident that "minimum conditions" would exist on election day. The institute said that Albania's "most-senior politicians" shared responsibility for the "profound crisis gripping the country and they have not yet done enough to instruct their respective supporters to lay down their weapons."
But it urged the European security organization and the military force to make more concerted efforts to distribute and collect election materials.
An official of the Council of Europe, Uwe Muller, said he was discouraged to find that during a spot check Friday, only 3 of 10 election commission stations here in the capital were functioning. Most did not have staff present, and one did not even have a sign, he said. Tirana is supposed to be the best-prepared for the elections.
Some major towns, particularly in the south where the insurrection started and where there is almost a total lack of either civilian or military authority, have not reported lists of candidates to the Central Election Commission, Mr. Kume said.
At his election commission headquarters this evening, Mr. Kume, a mathematics professor, broke into tears as he recounted how the driver of a bread delivery van in Mr. Kume's home town of Vlore was shot and killed yesterday.
The town was so out of control, he said, that everyone went inside at midday and locked the door, leaving the streets empty except for the armed gangsters. The same would happen on election day, whether the polls closed at 6 P.M. or 9 P.M., he predicted.

HEADLINE: Lott Calls Clinton 'Spoiled Brat' For Stand on Tax Cuts in Accord

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, today called President Clinton a "spoiled brat" for wanting his own way in divvying up proposed tax cuts.
"He acts like a spoiled brat," Mr. Lott said on the ABC News program "This Week." "He thinks he's got to have it his way or no way." 
 The President later ignored the remark, saying only of Mr. Lott, "I wish him a happy Father's Day."
Mr. Lott made his comments as part of a concerted Republican effort to try to regain some footing after the party's lengthy maneuverings against the Administration over the disaster-relief bill ended last week in a political fiasco.
The tax cuts referred to by Mr. Lott are part of a package approved last week by the House Ways and Means Committee. The proposal, for $85 billion in net tax cuts, promises reductions in capital gains taxes and estate taxes and other measures, including a child tax credit, as part of a deal to balance the budget by 2002.
But the White House and Congressional Democrats have objected to the Republicans' plan, mostly because they say it tends to favor the wealthy. One point of disagreement is over how to apply a $500-per-child tax credit. Republicans would exclude the poorest citizens because they pay no income tax. Democrats want to extend the credit to the poor, even to those who already receive an earned-income tax credit.
Mr. Lott and House Republicans took issue with the President's approach on various television programs this morning.
"I really think the President is not committed to giving working Americans, middle-class Americans, a tax cut," Mr. Lott said. "I think they are getting positioned to veto the tax-cut provision."
He that starting on Monday, "we're going on the offensive in trying to explain what's in the bill, why it's important to working Americans and what the President is up to."
Gene Sperling, who heads the National Economic Council, said in an interview, "Rather than engage in name-calling, the majority leader should explain why they specifically designed their child tax credit to give nothing to four million of our most-pressed, hardest-working families."
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, said Mr. Clinton's proposal on the tax credit would increase costs by giving a Government check to people who paid no income tax.
"Tax relief shouldn't go to people who don't pay any taxes," Mr. Archer said on "Fox News Sunday."
In a letter urging the President to reconsider, Mr. Archer said, "Your proposal in effect increases welfare spending, and does so by taking tax relief out of the hands of middle-income, taxpaying parents with teen-age children."

HEADLINE: Tax Plan Gives Most Relief to the Middle Class;
Tax Cuts Aid Growth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I take great issue with the article "Cutting Taxes a Luxury Now With Consequences Deferred" (front page, June 11). You state as a premise: "Ever since economists and politicians discovered in 1982 that the tax cuts enacted the year before would lead to an explosion in the budget deficit . . ." This is a fallacious contention. 
 There are two sides to the budget: revenue and spending. The experience of the 1980's, like the experiences of the 1960's and the 1920's, shows that tax cuts lead to stronger economic growth and increased tax revenues (which are stable historically at about 19 to 20 percent of gross domestic product). The budget deficit of the 1980's was caused by uncontrolled government spending, not by tax cuts.

HEADLINE: High Court Backs Netanyahu in Influence-Peddling Case

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 15

 BODY:
The Israeli Supreme Court today upheld the decision of the Attorney General not to prosecute Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or his Justice Minister in an influence-peddling case, thus lifting one burden from the embattled Government.
But the threat of a major confrontation with American Jews over rules for conversion to Judaism, the increasingly tense impasse in the Palestinian talks and a new rebellion within his coalition have compelled Mr. Netanyahu to cancel a planned trip to the United States. 
 The Supreme Court's decision effectively put an end to the political fallout from the six-month-old "Bar-On affair."
The case developed from allegations that the Prime Minister had appointed a lawyer named Roni Bar-On as Attorney General under pressure from a powerful politician seeking to gain respite from his own legal problems. Mr. Bar-On resigned after less than a day.
After a long investigation accompanied by extensive news reports, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein concluded in March that he had insufficient evidence to indict Mr. Netanyahu or Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, though he recommended charges against the politician, Arieh Deri of the religious Shas Party.
By a 4-to-1 decision, the Supreme Court rejected petitions demanding that Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Hanegbi be indicted. The majority ruled that the court does not intervene in the Attorney General's decisions unless they are "extremely unreasonable."
"This affair is behind us," Mr. Netanyahu declared today. "I intend to move forward and to deal now with the problems connected to achieving peace and security and economic prosperity for the state of Israel."
But Mr. Netanyahu is still facing what has been shaping up to be a bitter showdown with American Jews over a law proposed by rigorously Orthodox Jews in Israel declaring that conversions performed in Israel must be done by Orthodox rabbis to be valid.
The bill has passed the first of three readings in Parliament and is expected to be brought to a vote by the end of the month.
This crisis evidently led Mr. Netanyahu to cancel a visit to the United States for the International Conference for the Environment.
Though the bill would confirm the unofficial status quo, Reform and Conservative Jews in the United States -- who account for about 84 percent of American Jews -- view the legislation as a humiliating attempt to relegate them to second-class status within Judaism. American Jews have responded with fury.
Israeli press reports say American Jewish donations to Israeli recipients -- about $230 million a year in the past -- are down 10 percent.
Politicians of the rigorously Orthodox factions say the conversion bill was prompted by a suit filed by Conservative Jews in Israel asking that the Interior Ministry recognize their conversions. The Interior Ministry is involved because conversion to Judaism opens the door to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return.
For Mr. Netanyahu, the choice is bitter. If he blocks the bill, the religious parties could bring down his Government. If he supports it, he risks a serious rift with American Jews and, without their support, with the American Government.
Another factor that evidently prompted Mr. Netanyahu to forgo the trip to the United States was a worsening of the situation with the Palestinians. Efforts by Egypt to mediate a return to negotiations have brought no results so far, and a new wave of violent confrontations has erupted in Gaza and Hebron.
The daily Maariv said Israeli intelligence agencies had warned that the situation could worsen and that they had recommended that Mr. Netanyahu not leave the country for long periods.
In Hebron today, the Israeli police fired volley after volley of tear gas and rubber bullets to keep Palestinian stone throwers at bay in the second day of violence near the Jewish settlements in the center of the city. The Palestinian police were conspicuously absent.
Palestinian officials said the anger in the streets has been fanned by a nonbinding resolution adopted last week by the United States House of Representatives calling on President Clinton to affirm that Jerusalem is the undivided capital of Israel and earmarking $100 million to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The resolution has drawn a tide of furious comments from Palestinian officials and organizations. It is perceived as further evidence that the United States is abandoning the role of an impartial broker.
On Friday, the Palestinian Authority of Yasir Arafat issued a statement that said, "The Palestinian leadership, which showed great flexibility and unlimited patience in order to preserve and protect the peace process from collapsing, cannot understand the reasons which made the Congress take such a dangerous decision in regard to Jerusalem."
Ami Ayalon, the director of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, was reported to have warned at the Israeli Cabinet meeting on Friday that with the continual impasse, Mr. Arafat's position was being seriously eroded while Hamas, the Islamic militant movement, was gaining strength among Palestinians.
In addition to these problems, Mr. Netanyahu is facing sharp criticism from one of his strongest former supporters in the governing coalition, Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky.
The immediate cause of the rift was evidently the appointment of a new Ambassador to Moscow, Herzl Anbar, instead of the candidate proposed by Mr. Sharansky's Russian immigrant party. Mr. Sharansky also charges that Mr. Netanyahu has failed to consult with a committee on Government appointments that he set up last winter after the Bar-On scandal and that the Prime Minister has reneged on other promises.
Mr. Sharansky is not expected to bolt the coalition. But late last week, in what was perceived to be a strong political signal, he held a well-publicized meeting with Ehud Barak, the newly elected leader of the opposition Labor Party.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 18, 1997, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about political developments in Israel misspelled the surname of the new Israeli Ambassador to Russia, whose appointment caused a rift in the governing coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The envoy is Herzl Inbar, not Anbar.

HEADLINE: Clinton Feels Sure-Footed on the Tightrope of Race

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15

 BODY:
President Clinton was in the Oval Office meeting with his new advisory panel on race on Friday when a journalist asked him about widespread skepticism among civil rights leaders that his initiative would go beyond talk.
"Anybody who looks at my entire public life can see that it's been dominated by three things: economics, education and race," Mr. Clinton shot back. "If there is any issue I ought to have credibility on, it is this one because it is a part of who I am and what I've done, and I don't feel the need to defend myself." 
 In fact, ever since he has appeared on the national stage, Mr. Clinton has been an intriguing political figure precisely because he has been trying to redefine racial politics for the Democratic Party.
Some of this has come from his heart -- as a white Southerner, he was deeply offended by the segregation he grew up with. Some of it has come from his pragmatic recognition that the Democratic Party was hemorrhaging white support because too many working-class and lower-middle-class whites thought that their interests were overlooked by liberals concerned about the interests of the black poor.
In his first four years as President, Mr. Clinton did much to build white support for the Democrats. He sought to end the party's identification with big spending, with welfare and with indulgent attitudes toward criminals --all issues that carried racial undertones in the political arena.
Now, with that groundwork behind him, Mr. Clinton seems to be embarking on an effort to build white support for a still undefined effort to help the minority groups that have been left behind in America's booming economy.
"I know that for many white Americans, this conversation may seem to exclude them or threaten them," he said on Saturday. "That must not be so. I believe white Americans have just as much to gain as anybody else from being part of this endeavor -- much to gain from an America where we finally take responsibility for all our children."
Usually the nation has embarked on these efforts only after times of turmoil. The assassination of John F. Kennedy generated a national mood that allowed President Lyndon B. Johnson to win passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and urban riots led to the Kerner Commission's report, which concluded that America was moving toward "two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal."
But Mr. Clinton and his advisers say they believe that it is the very lack of turmoil right now that makes the time ripe to tackle race once more: that the good economy, the drop in crime and the decline in welfare rolls have all reduced white resentment enough for people to talk about race and related issues, like immigration and demographic changes.
Of course, as always with Mr. Clinton, it has been a bumpy journey to get to where he stands today. The President's support for affirmative action, so ringing on Saturday, seemed more tentative when he was facing a re-election campaign and the Republicans were viewing affirmative action as a social issue they could use against him.
In an appearance before California Democrats in 1995, he said: "We don't have to retreat from these affirmative action programs that have done great things for the American people and haven't hurt other people. We don't. But we do have to ask ourselves, Are they all working? Are they all fair? Has there been any kind of reverse discrimination?"
Three months later, Mr. Clinton, however, helped stem the Republican push against racial preferences with his "mend it, don't end it" speech, which civil rights leaders say forged a national consensus where none looked possible to protect affirmative action programs.
But the President rarely crusaded against California's Proposition 209, the anti-affirmative action initiative, when it was on the ballot during his re-election campaign last year, although he insisted today that he had opposed it "every time I was in California and every time I was asked about it."
"Where was the President when the issue was engaged?" William Bennett, the conservative strategist, asked on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." "He was not going to anger anybody in California by coming out on the wrong side, or the right side, so he was silent. That's not political leadership."
It is also the case that Mr. Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it" helped unleash public demand for an overhaul that eventually led him to sign a Republican bill far more extreme than any he had originally envisioned.
And his support for the Republican goal of balancing the budget has left little money available for new Federal social programs of any sort, even though the President and his advisory board say they expect to end this year with proposals for programs to expand economic and educational opportunity, to improve housing for the poor and to end housing discrimination.
"He has painted himself into the corner where he has nothing he can do but exhortation," said Roger Wilkins, the Robinson Professor of History at George Mason University. "And I don't believe that exhortation -- when you are dealing with the poorest people in this society and the historical forces that created their desperation -- is going to do it."
But Mr. Clinton always keeps his critics -- on the left and the right -- - off balance, and his effort is just beginning. He has given himself a year to start changing the mood and attitudes of the country. He has lately been referring sporadically to the Democrats as the "progressive party," which could be a signal that he is on the ideological move once again. And today, in an appearance on CNN, he dismissed the idea that the big question that faces him in his second term is a fiscal one: preparing the Social Security and Medicare systems for the retirement of the baby boom generation.
"That's a serious issue, but it's largely a mathematics issue," he said, almost dismissively. "And I believe it'll be dealt with. I believe the most profound question facing us is whether we can become the world's first truly mutliracial democracy."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 19, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about a speech by President Clinton on race relations misstated the timing and events leading to creation of the National Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission. The commission investigated the causes of the urban riots of the summer of 1967 and issued its report on March 1, 1968. The assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. occurred after the report was completed.

HEADLINE: 5 Years After Environmental Summit in Rio, Little Progress

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, in the largest gathering of its kind in history, world leaders meeting at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro signed binding treaties designed to prevent dangerous human interference with the earth's climate system and to protect living species. They also adopted a nonbinding blueprint to guide countries in protecting a deteriorating global environment while at the same time promoting economic well-being.
Next Monday, 70 heads of state or government will gather at the United Nations to take stock of progress since Rio and to discuss where to go from here. But United Nations reports prepared for the meeting have already rendered a judgment: with some important exceptions, environmental trends have changed little since the Rio gathering. 
 The most notable exception, interestingly, is in an area not dealt with at Rio: population growth. Thanks to factors like contraception, education and the enhanced status of women, fertility rates are declining more rapidly than had been expected in all regions of the world. The latest United Nations projections show that the populations of many countries, including some developing ones, will stabilize within the next generation or two. But other countries still face high growth rates that will strain their resources, and the world population as a whole is expected to reach 11 billion before stabilizing some time in the 21st century. It now totals about 6 billion.
At the same time, according to the United Nations assessment, food production continues to rise, and most people are living longer and healthier lives. These gains are threatened, however, by a growing scarcity of fresh water and a loss of topsoil and productive farmland. According to the United Nations accounting, a third of the world's people do not have an adequate supply of clean water, and two-thirds will be deprived of it by 2010 unless action is taken. Some 3.7 billion acres of farmland -- nearly 30 percent of the world's vegetated surface -- are now degraded to some degree.
Air and water quality is generally improving in rich countries. But despite substantial reforestation in those countries and a recent slowing of deforestation globally, forest loss continues worldwide. Each year, according to the United Nations, an area the size of Nepal is cut or burned. Ocean pollution threatens the health and livelihood of the two-thirds of humanity living near coastlines, and about 60 percent of commercial fisheries are overfished or fully fished and in danger of depletion. Toxic chemicals still pose significant threats.
Under the two binding treaties signed at Rio, substantive progress has been scant. The Convention on Biodiversity has been ratified by 161 countries (not including the United States). This treaty obligates governments to take action to protect plant and animal species, but species are being extinguished and their habitats are being destroyed at what the United Nations calls an "unprecedented" rate.
The climate treaty has been ratified by 166 countries, including the United States. But few developed countries, also including the United States, are expected to meet the treaty's initial goal of capping emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide at 1990 levels by 2000. Despite that, talks are under way on even stronger steps that would further reduce emissions of the gases. Two more sessions of the talks are scheduled in Bonn before a final session in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
As the negotiations proceed, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to grow, and mainstream scientists say that if they are not reduced the world can expect a warmer climate and widespread climatic disruption in the next century.
On this page are snapshots of some major aspects of the global environmental picture.

Since the Earth Summit five years ago, most environmental trends have continued, the United Nations reports. A major and surprising exception is that population is increasing at a somewhat slower rate. Other improvements, like food production gains, are threatened by continuing degradation of land and water.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off on Signs That Euro May Turn Out to Be Strong

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against the mark yesterday, hurt by signs that Europe's planned single currency might be stronger than expected.
The dollar also fell against the yen amid anxiety that Japan's trade surplus would be a sensitive discussion topic when leaders of the leading industrial nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- meet in Denver. 
 The three-day Group of Seven meeting starts on Friday, a day after the Commerce Department issues its tally of April trade data, which is expected to show a sharp rise in Japan's exports to the United States. Clinton Administration officials have increasingly complained about the surplus in recent weeks and partly blamed the dollar's strength against the yen for the imbalance.
"The market is wondering if the new news on the trade front will put further downward pressure on the dollar," said Audrey McNiff, vice president for foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
In trading in New York, the dollar settled at 113.52 yen, down from 114.89 yen on Friday. The dollar fell to 1.7320 marks from 1.7386 marks. The pound rose to $1.6375 from $1.6363.
The dollar's weakness against European currencies partly reflected the broad demand for yen because of the anxiety over trade with the United States, as well as a rally yesterday in the Japanese stock market that pushed the Nikkei stock index to its highest level of the year.
But the dollar was also sold after European Union leaders meeting in Amsterdam approved an agreement yesterday on assuring stability in the euro without granting any major concessions demanded by France to stimulate job growth.
Traders had bought dollars last week on speculation that French demands might result in a more flexible stability pact that would undermine the euro's rigid fiscal requirements and make it a weak successor to the mark, the predominant currency in Europe.
"This was a case of buy the rumor and sell the fact," said Stephen Jury, managing director of foreign exchange at the Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. "People bought dollars on anticipation of an agreement. We did get an agreement and the dollar came off a bit."

We've Got to Talk

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Advance publicity said the President's speech on race would be "major." It is hard to guess what remains to be said in a "major" vein about race in the United States, so, not surprisingly, after saying it was a major problem, Mr. Clinton found himself at a loss for a new idea.
In the absence of a new idea, he endorsed an old one (affirmative action), said he was appointing a committee and called for an "honest dialogue." What constitutes honesty in a "dialogue" on this subject? The President let the question pass and lapsed into bromides, as politicians are apt to do when expected to orate in the "major" style about matters on which they have nothing to say. 
 Thus: "Honest dialogue will not be easy at first. We will have to get past defensiveness and fear and political correctness and other barriers to honesty." And, dipping into the Kennedy-Johnson summons-to-greatness style: "Emotions may be rubbed raw, but we must begin."
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson usually wanted us to begin something ambitious; Mr. Clinton summons us only to a national gabfest. He seems to believe this might result in "concerted action," which would help "lift the heavy burden of race from our children's future." As to what that "concerted action" might be, Mr. Clinton did not hazard a guess.
And so, having nothing of consequence to say, he dug into the national cliche anthology. He came up with, among other overworked phrases, "the classic American dilemma," "a great national effort to perfect the promise of America," the attempt "to build our more perfect union" and "one America respecting, even celebrating our differences."
This sounds more like bloviating than the opening of "honest dialogue," but it is only to be expected in the dead political air in which the country is becalmed. The only subject with which Washington is seriously engaged this year is the balanced-budget exercise.
Mr. Clinton had to make a commencement speech, an ancient literary form requiring inspirational rhetoric. A call to balanced-budgetary greatness would hardly fill the bill. Race, on the other hand, always offers excellent rhetorical opportunities.
Well, he was also speaking in California, where people have recently been voting bleak anti-black, anti-immigrant passions. Endorsing affirmative action in this benighted territory, the President could show his critics that there was at least one unpopular issue on which he would take a stand.
The mystery is why the President thinks we lack dialogue on race. A roaring dialogue on race has been going on here for 350 years.
Two hundred years ago the Constitution spoke honestly about the American position on race when it stated that a slave was to be officially considered only three-fifths of a human being. For cruelly honest dialogue on race it would be hard to improve on the Civil War. Lynchings, riots, murders, corrupt trials, unemployment statistics -- dialogue doesn't get any more honest than these.
Mr. Clinton didn't say how we could enjoy a more civilized dialogue. He seems to think that talking across the racial divide can produce genuine changes in people's "hearts and minds."
"Hearts and minds" -- the phrase speaks of the old idea that racial hostility is embedded in a part of the human psyche that cannot be changed by the forces of reason, education, politics or law.
The conviction that government action will never be able to change the human heart was President Eisenhower's reason for not supporting the civil rights movement 40 years ago. Fear that voters would be enraged by an effort to change their hearts and minds accounted for President Kennedy's hands-off policy on the civil rights movement.
When President Johnson boldly supported it anyhow, Richard Nixon's "Southern strategy" exploited the resulting anger to convert a once solid Democratic South into a now solid Republican South. Now Democrats cannot elect a President without a Southern accent, and even he must be wary when tinkering with hearts and minds.
In California Mr. Clinton was a wary President making a wary speech. A committee will now take over, and may even be heard of again.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The City And the Kingdom

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
A letter from the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington:
"Regarding any information we might know of Christian persecution in Saudi Arabia, the answer is -- none. We have many foreign workers in the Kingdom and they are treated as guests, and every consideration is given for their needs, as long as they abide by the Shari'a law." 
 The letter was in answer to a New York Times reporter's inquiry for a story on legislation before the City Council of New York that would bar the city from doing business with companies operating in 15 countries named as persecuting Christians. The list includes China and other Communist countries and Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries.
The assurance about foreign guests was printed on June 15 in an article about business opposition to the legislation. So now -- some facts about religious worship in the Kingdom.
Such information is easy to find about any of the 15. About Saudi Arabia it is impossible to escape. Denial is a lie.
The Shari'a is the Holy Law of Islam, derived from the Koran and Mohammed's teachings. The Saudi section in the State Department's most recent worldwide report on human rights, based on dispatches from U.S. embassies, is a good place to find out how the law is seen and enforced by the royal Government:
"Freedom of religion does not exist. Islam is the official religion and all citizens must be Muslims. The Government prohibits the practice of other religions."
Other information in the report:
For Christians caught worshiping, punishment can be arrest and lashing. Wearing religious symbols is prohibited. Christians wearing a cross or engaging in any other religious practice can be arrested, flogged and deported.
Conversion by Muslims to another religion is considered apostasy. Apostasy is punishable by execution.
Paul Marshall, a specialist on persecution of Christians, writes that occasionally citizens of important countries like Britain or the U.S. are allowed worship within embassy grounds, if they keep quiet about it.
Amnesty International has documented about 350 cases of Christian foreign workers arrested when they tried to worship -- in private, since church services are banned. But arrests of Christians from Asia, the Mideast and Africa, which supply most of the Kingdom's foreign workers, usually go unreported by their relatives and employers. They fear the reprisals: arrest and torture of the prisoners' families.
And, for Americans who think Saudi officials have any more respect for them than laborers from the third world: U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia during the gulf war were not allowed to wear any symbol of their faith. Since the war, religious oppression has increased. Saudi rulers are terrified that thoughts of religious freedom, or any other kind, linger from having had Americans around to protect them from Iraq.
American businessmen never worried about such Saudi ways and morals -- nor do they now. They do worry about the increasing American public revulsion against using government funds and contracts to enrich the persecutors. Nineteen cities and states are considering legislation to use local economic pressure against repression.
The opposition from business and persecutors will be stepped up in organization and funding. The focus will be on New York City, and particular pressure on two men: Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who introduced the legislation, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, sympathetic but uncommitted, who will find it on his desk.
So it is increasingly critical for opponents of religious persecution to insist the evidence be spread out and denials examined instead of simply repeated and passed along.
The businessmen and their lobbyists, Americans who attend Saudi Embassy parties or take those velvet trips to Saudi Arabia arranged by its officials -- they all know about the religious persecution.
Perhaps like Robert Kiley, president of New York's Chamber of Commerce, they will say in public that local action against persecutions is just know-nothingism cloaked in morality. Maybe some will even say that in private, to themselves and God, as they worship. But it will be difficult, won't it, because we really do know, don't we?

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Advance Modestly as Investors Await Price Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose modestly in light trading yesterday, as market participants waited for today's Government's report on consumer prices for last month.
The Consumer Price Index is expected to support recent signs that suggest the economic growth rate is slowing to a sustainable pace, removing any threat of inflation. 
 With the next meeting of the the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee a couple of weeks away, the growing feeling among market participants is that the Fed will not raise interest rates again as it did in March, when it made what Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, called a pre-emptive strike against inflation.
By late in the day, the price of the 30-year bond was up 13/32, to 99 6/32; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, slipped to 6.69 percent, from 6.72 percent on Friday -- the lowest since 6.65 percent on Feb. 25. But as most investors are well aware, thin volume often exaggerates market movement.
There was no significant news during the session; traders were just dealing with the aftermath of last week's rally and positioning ahead of today's data.
Dave Shabelman, Treasury market analyst with Standard & Poor's MMS, a San Francisco-based market research and analysis firm, predicted the market would have a relatively easy week with its full schedule of economic releases.
"The C.P.I. has become less of a threat since last Friday's weaker-than-expected Producer Price Index showed manufacturing prices less than a threat," Mr. Shabelman said. He expects the overall consumer index for May to be up one-tenth of 1 percent, with the core rate up about two-tenths of 1 percent, estimates that were lowered after last week's Producer Price Index.
He expects housing starts will remain at April levels, or about 1.47 million units, while May industrial production will be up about three-tenths of 1 percent.
"The wild card in Tuesday's trade could be the weekly retail sales reports if they show continued strength along the lines of last week's 2.3 percent increase in the Redbook survey," Mr. Shabelman said. "The market's positive tone continues to support price gains, and traders are reluctant to sell into the strength. There is a lot of money to be put to work with some $30 billion in cash management bills maturing tomorrow and upcoming data expected to be market-friendly. The odds that the Fed will announce a monetary policy change on July 2 have been severely reduced following last week's retail sales and P.P.I. reports."
Doug Burtnick, a fixed-income analyst with Technical Data of Boston, noted that the two-year maturity moved inside 6 percent, ending at 5.99 percent, with little fanfare "and for that matter very little investor buying." He said, "It will take some very constructive data to get it to go much further before July's Federal Open Market Committee meeting." But he said there were some factors shaping up positively at the long end of the yield curve, among them added buying by mortgage investors who are starting to get jittery about potential prepayment and early retirement of debt.
Yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills was about average, with the three-month bill sold at an average rate of 4.88 percent, down from 4.94 percent last week. The six-month bill was sold at an average rate of 5.10 percent, down from 5.20 percent.
On Thursday the Treasury plans to sell $13 billion of new 52-week bills. In the corporate market, more than a dozen borrowers are lining up to sell debt this week, while yields are still near four-months lows. Among them are the American Express Company, the Ames Financial Corporation and the Money Store Inc., which are planning to sell more than $2 billion of bonds backed by consumer loans.
The following are the results of the Treasury bill auction of three-month and six-month maturities:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed, With the Dow Falling 9.95

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, with many investors taking a breather from last week's buying spree, which sent all the major indexes to record after record.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 9.95 points to close at 7,772.09 in light trading. That ended a streak of six consecutive record-setting performances. Last week the blue-chip average rose 346 points, or about 4.7 percent. 
 But the Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology issues, gained 8.92 points yesterday, to a record 1,431.95.
Analysts said that activity was light ahead of today's release of several economic indicators, including the May Consumer Price Index, and that investors had grown weary after last week's blistering run.
"This is a little bit of a case of lethargy," said Edward Collins, a market analyst at Daiwa Securities. "It's a little pause after a 350-point move last week."
To demonstrate just how busy last week was, nearly 2.7 billion shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, a 40 percent increase from the comparable week in 1996.
But yesterday, volume on the Big Board dropped to 419.2 million shares, from about 575.8 million shares on Friday.
So it came as no surprise that the Dow dipped slightly, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained a meager 0.63 point to close at a record 893.90.
"It was exactly the kind of market we expected," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm based in Greenwich, Conn.
Birinyi Associates has calculated that the Monday after a big weekly gain is typically weak -- often the Dow loses about 18 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Yesterday's loss was about 13 basis points.
Despite yesterday's pause, the market seems to be benefiting from a stream of good news, including signs that the economy's growth has slowed to a moderate, but sustainable, pace with no sign of inflation.
That has led to an improving interest rate environment. Yesterday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.69 from 6.72 on Friday. Just a few weeks ago, on June 2, the yield was at 6.90. Many analysts now say the Federal Reserve is less likely to raise interest rates than was previously thought.
"A lot of people have taken a stance that the Fed is going to stand pat," said Arthur Hogan, a trader at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. "But today, it's just investors sitting on their hands."
Small stocks, however, rose modestly yesterday. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks was up 0.13 point, to a record 392.20.
After easily outpacing large-cap stocks in May, small-cap stocks have once again surrendered their leadership role to large caps this month. The Dow has risen about 6 percent this month, while the Russell has gained about 3 percent.
Technology issues, while lagging behind the larger market, made a strong showing yesterday.
The Nasdaq gained with the aid of three of its biggest computer names. Microsoft, up 59 percent this year, rose 1 3/4, to 131 3/8. Intel gained 2 1/2, to 147 1/4. And Dell Computer rose 4 1/4, to 115 3/8. On the year, Dell is up 118 percent.
After last week's gain -- the largest point gain ever for the Dow and the eighth largest in percentage terms -- the average was braked yesterday by Procter & Gamble, down 1 3/8, to 141 1/2, and the American Express Company, down 1 3/8, to 75 1/4.
Still, the Dow has climbed 20.5 percent on the year, and only one issue among the 30 -- AT&T -- has lost ground. But in the last month, shares of AT&T have soared 15 percent. For the year, however, the stock is still down 7 percent.
Not surprisingly, as of yesterday, more than two-thirds of the Dow's 30 component stocks were near their 52-week highs.

HEADLINE: An Un-Washington Sort of Guy Longs for Home

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16

 BODY:
Some White House chiefs of staff practically have to be dynamited out of office. Some resign discreetly for the good of the President. But Erskine B. Bowles, President Clinton's current chief of staff, has been advertising his departure for months.
Mr. Bowles is so open about saying that he longs to return to his family in North Carolina that now, just six months into his tenure, speculation about his successor is sweeping the city. Indeed, the constant demurrals of Mr. Bowles, a 51-year-old investment banker, that he is a "creature of the private sector" reached such a volume last month that the White House had to declare that his departure was not imminent. 
 Still, the expectation inside the White House is that Mr. Bowles will be gone as soon as the year's final budget bills are passed, sometime between Labor Day and New Year's, setting off more uncertainty and jockeying for position inside the Administration.
In a city where few people like to relinquish power, many see Mr. Bowles's yearning to depart as symptomatic not only of the toll it takes to work in Mr. Clinton's always embattled White House but also of a strangely deflated mood that has gripped the President's second term despite the continuing economic recovery and the achievement of a balanced-budget deal.
But Mr. Bowles, a multimillionaire who is working for $1 a year, insists that Mr. Clinton knew that he would only be a transitional figure with a list of finite goals.
"There's been no question in his mind since the first day," Mr. Bowles said in a recent interview in his West Wing office, where pictures of his three children line the walls. "This has not changed one iota. I came in for a limited period of time when he thought someone with a rather nonpartisan background could be helpful to him in accomplishing specific things."
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said: "It is classically considered the wrong thing to do in Washington to announce that you're leaving. But Erskine is classically an un-Washington guy."
Mr. Clinton has never been fully comfortable himself with the culture of Washington. And the fact that Mr. Bowles shares that sensibility, many say, has proved to be both the chief of staff's strength and his shortcoming.
Unencumbered by traditional Washington alliances and thinking, Mr. Bowles was able to broker the balanced-budget deal with the Republicans. But, some Democrats say, he is not keenly political enough to help provide an overarching sense of direction for the second term that goes beyond economic issues.
Last fall, when Mr. Clinton began pursuing Mr. Bowles hard to return to Washington, some said the President was searching for a perfect synthesis between the total loyalty of Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the friend from childhood who was his first chief of staff, and the skill of Leon E. Panetta, the former California Congressman who was his second.
Mr. McLarty was considered well-meaning but ineffective. Mr. Panetta had years of Washington experience. But in Mr. Clinton's darkest moments after the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, the President partly blamed his own aides, including Mr. Panetta, for having more allegiance to historical Democratic interest groups than to him.
With Mr. Bowles, White House officials said, the President felt confident that in a time when he wanted to work with a Republican Congress, he would have a tested chief of staff with no agenda but Mr. Clinton's own.
The President had already forged a bond with Mr. Bowles in his first term, in which the North Carolinian served as head of the Small Business Administration and then deputy White House chief of staff before leaving at the end of 1995.
In his 16 months as the deputy, it was Mr. Bowles who insisted that Mr. Clinton needed more private time for thought. And in a White House where staff gatherings too often could deteriorate into talkathons, he was known to run a no-nonsense meeting.
Perhaps more important, he and Mr. Clinton had a certain chemistry. Mr. Bowles, who has shared many a golf game with Mr. Clinton, attributes their rapport to the fact that "we're two Southern guys who are basically the same age, who grew up under vastly different circumstances but we enjoy the same things."
Dick Morris, Mr. Clinton's former political strategist, said Mr. Bowles was attuned to Mr. Clinton's most enigmatic moods.
"I think the President really appreciates that Bowles listens hard for the slightest, smallest, silentest signal from him and takes it as an order," Mr. Morris said.
Mr. Bowles told colleagues he had three prime objectives: to make sure the right people served in the right positions in the second term, to impose discipline on a White House that had a tendency to meander, and most importantly, to broker the balanced-budget agreement with the Republican-controlled Congress.
Unlike Mr. Panetta, who ran a highly centralized White House managed from a list he kept on a yellow pad, Mr. Bowles has delegated responsibility.
"My approach has always been quite different," he noted earlier this year, comparing himself with Mr. Panetta."Not better or worse but different, and that is a more decentralized approach where we believe in delegating authority and responsibility but, by God, holding people accountable.
He has cut back the number of meetings in the White House, beginning each day with a 7:45 A.M. session for about 25 White House aides. Previously there had been a 7:30 A.M. meeting for senior staff members and an 8:15 session for a broader group. Mr. Bowles briefs Mr. Clinton each morning about 9:15 and runs the evening political strategy sessions that still occur every week or so in the White House residence.
Officials say he is in tune enough with the President that there is no longer the kind of confusion that prevailed in late 1995 when Mr. Clinton was moving toward embracing the idea of a balanced budget, when most of his aides were opposing it.
"We probably get a better sense of where Clinton's thinking is from Erskine," Mr. McCurry said, "but on the other hand Clinton got a better sense of what White House staff and Washington thinking was from Leon. There's a little bit of a tradeoff there."
Republicans in Congress have warmed to Mr. Bowles's efficient and direct style. Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican from North Carolina who has so often been the Administration's nemesis, has said of the balanced-budget deal that there were "two words to describe that: Erskine Bowles."
Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Budget Committee, said: "He made it very clear he wanted to get this done."
Even some Democrats with grave misgivings about the budget deal praise Mr. Bowles.
"I find him to be a trustworthy friend with an agenda I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan.
But some other Democrats point to the House Republicans' most recent tax cut plan, with its retreat from major elements of Mr. Clinton's proposals for tax breaks for higher education, as a sign that Mr. Bowles had not been politically skillful enough. Some White House aides and Democrats close to the White House also quietly complain that Mr. Bowles's formality and his concern with memorandums and process, has at times slowed decision-making. And his talk of leaving, they say, is another unneeded distraction to a staff that lost the sense of mission of the campaign and is contending with a steady stream of investigations into campaign finance issues and Whitewater.
Mr. Bowles acknowledges that he himself was troubled when he was called before a grand jury in Arkansas to testify about efforts he made to line up work for Webster L. Hubbell, the former Justice Department official and longtime Clinton friend who left the Government facing allegations that he had bilked his former law firm. He was later convicted of fraud and tax evasion.
But Mr. Bowles denies the accounts of some acquaintances that the grand jury experience sped up his timetable for departure. Instead, he cited the demands of his job: 15-hour days and separation from his wife, Crandall Close Bowles, who has remained in North Carolina where she is president of the textile giant, Springs Industries.
Mr. Bowles will not say precisely when he will go, saying it depends on how fast he accomplishes a list of goals he carries on a card. It is clear that Mr. Clinton's upcoming drive to improve race relations in the nation is an initiative that Mr. Bowles wanted to set in motion.
"This race initiative is something that I am probably as proud of as anything I have done in my life," he said.
At the White House, the names of possible successors are already starting to circulate, including Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser; John Hilley, the President's Congressional liaison; Representative Vic Fazio, Democrat of California, and Jack Quinn, the former White House counsel who is close to Vice President Al Gore. Also mentioned are the budget director, Franklin D. Raines; Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, and John Podesta, a deputy chief of staff.
And in what some White House aides describe as an effort to bring in new intellectual firepower, the political consultant Paul Begala will be returning to Mr. Clinton's side and the journalist Sydney Blumenthal is joining the communications team.
Mr. Bowles insisted that his leave taking would not be disruptive. But other White House officials say the prospect of another change in leadership is distracting.
"It just raises the issue of who will be at the center of the wheel," one Clinton aide said, "who will be at the top of the pyramid, who help keep some sense of order in the place."

HEADLINE: Market Place: REIT's on a Shopping Binge;
Office Buildings Have Become the Latest Objects of Desire

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Steven Roth, chairman of a high-flying real estate trust called Vornado, had lost twice this spring in bidding for properties in what is suddenly every investor's hot market -- Manhattan. He was determined not to strike out a third time.
So on Friday, April 25, when it appeared that a rival had emerged as the leading bidder at 90 Park Avenue, where Sumitomo Trust and Banking was selling the mortgage, Mr. Roth plunged into a weekend of negotiations, landing the 41-story property for $185 million -- $20 million more than Sumitomo originally anticipated. 
 Vornado Realty Trust's decision to shove its way into the winner's circle is but one example of the competition for prime office buildings in Manhattan and elsewhere around the nation -- a battle rapidly propelling prices skyward.
At the heart of the battle are real estate investment trusts like Vornado. REIT's, as they are known, are essentially investment pools. They have been around since the 1960's, mostly as mortgage holders, and have had an up-and-down history on Wall Street. But lately they have begun to own property outright, particularly office buildings, and they have become hot properties themselves -- with investors.
With office space becoming tighter, these so-called equity REIT's have an edge, since they can move faster and raise money more cheaply than old-line real estate moguls, hedge funds and investment banks. And with the number of REIT's specializing in office buildings soaring -- there was just one in 1994 but there are now 15 and at least four more are on the way -- they often push prices beyond the seller's giddiest expectations, even when they do not win.
That has longtime real estate executives and some analysts nervous. Indeed, after a tremendous run-up in the price of office REIT stocks last year, their values are down 5.8 percent this year, John Litt, an analyst with Paine Webber, said, because "investors were worried that office REIT's are paying too much."
The most aggressive trusts are buying properties less for the current return than for the hope of a spike in rents later -- a stark reminder of the bad old days, in the 1970's and then again in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when many trusts and traditional real estate partnerships got into terrible trouble. Those deals were also based on high rent projections, which never came to pass.
In 1985, for example, the prospectus for the real estate trust that held the mortgage on Rockefeller Center predicted that rents would double by 1995, to $75 a square foot. Instead, rents plummeted to about $34 after a devastating recession, and the REIT teetered at the edge of bankruptcy. Goldman, Sachs and a developer, Jerry Speyer, ultimately paid $8 a share to buy out shareholders who had once seen the stock trade at $21.
No one is predicting an imminent collapse now; the real estate markets are too healthy for that. Rents are generally moving upward. But with prices pushed to the limit by the trusts' buying sprees, the days of easy money in commercial real estate are over.
Demand is up and vacancy rates are down, said John Lyons, a founder of Granite Partners, a real estate investment bank. "But as the competition for quality properties has increased due to the vast amounts of capital in the market," he said, "pricing has increased and therefore the returns have decreased."
For real estate operators, the REIT structure provides tremendous access to capital, through either the stock market or private lenders. As long as the trust distributes 95 percent of its income to shareholders, it pays no corporate income tax. And while the private real estate partnerships popular in the 1980's often involved a single risky asset, today's trusts provide individual and institutional investors with a diverse portfolio of properties -- and stock that can be bought and sold at any time. The market capitalization for all REIT's has jumped from $56 billion in 1992 to more than $142 billion last year.
"We've raised over a billion dollars," said Thomas A. Rizk, president of the Cali Realty Corporation, a well-regarded office REIT based in Cranford, N.J. "We can enter transactions without financing contingencies and close transactions very quickly."
Until recently, investors also made out handsomely. In 1996, office REIT's delivered a total return of nearly 50 percent, more than double that of the S.& P. 500, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, a trade group. If the trusts are overpaying for properties now, though, investors who have poured in billions of dollars in the last 24 months could see the once hard-charging stocks falter or retreat further than they already have.
Equity trusts emerged in the early 1990's as REIT's focused on apartment buildings and condominiums, the first properties to show signs of life after the recession. As the recovery spread, trusts appeared for retail, health care and hotel properties.
In 1994, office REIT's appeared in suburban markets on Long Island and in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Texas. Spurring their rise was a decline in office vacancy rates in the United States, which dropped to 12.1 percent at the end of 1996 from 16.2 percent in 1994, according to Oncor International, a real estate data service.
Despite their relative youth, office REIT's have a voracious appetite, gobbling 47.5 percent, or $6.7 billion, of the $14 billion in major office deals nationally so far this year, up from $5.2 billion in all of 1996, according to Granite Partners.
The race to become a big, multibillion-dollar company is fueled by a sense that investors will reward size and diversity. A bigger company, in turn, can command lower borrowing rates, funnel more money into acquisitions and reduce administrative costs. And a bigger company must make bigger acquisitions to sustain a pattern of growth.
Yet real estate is a notoriously cyclical industry, and real estate trusts still control only a fraction of the nation's commercial real estate, which undercuts their ability to impose hefty rent increases when tenants can easily go elsewhere for less.
Many REIT operators and analysts argue that the new trusts will not repeat the sorry history of the poorly managed REIT's of the 1970's. It is also unlikely, they say, that the companies will venture too far out of line with the market this time.
The modern real estate trust, they note, is not heavily leveraged and public companies are required to release reams of financial data, which act to restrain aggressive impulses.
"There are buyers out there who have overpaid," Mr. Rizk said. Still, he added, "I think investors have so much information that they can discern this very quickly and discourage companies from doing anything."
Mr. Litt of Paine Webber suggests that some office REIT's are now a relatively good buy because of the recent retreat in stock prices.
Meanwhile, there are signs everywhere of the trusts' efforts to gain heft rapidly. In suburban Philadelphia, three REIT's accounted for 10 of the 12 largest office deals in the last year, said James Vesey, a broker at Cushman & Wakefield. Stephen Conly, director of Carey Winston Institutional Investment Group, described a "competitive frenzy" in the suburbs of Washington.
In San Diego, Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties outbid 31 prospective buyers for the Smith Barney Building, paying $36 million, or $193 a square foot, the highest rate in eight years, according to Property Information Exchange, a real estate research firm in New York. Equity Office Properties anticipates a jump in rents, though the property provides only a 6.7 percent return. A year ago, many REIT's were looking at 10 and 12 percent returns, before subtracting the cost of capital.
"Prices have now risen by at least 10 to 15 percent in 1997, for the same cash flow you were buying last year," said Michael Kirby, a principal with Green Street Advisors, which follows the REIT industry. "There are probably still some opportunities out there, but if you throw darts at every contest, you'll fall on your face."
In March, Vornado was among the first real estate trusts to plunge into Manhattan, when the company paid $437 million for a portfolio of properties owned by Bernard Mendik, giving Mr. Roth control of four million square feet of New York office space. In the bidding for 90 Park Avenue, Mr. Roth, who has one of the best records of any REIT, went on to outmaneuver Starwood Capital and Leon Black's Apollo fund.
REIT's now consider Manhattan a promising market because there is plenty of room to raise rents. The economy is thriving, but there has been virtually no new construction in five years. So space is tight, while rents are well below what is needed to justify new projects.
The situation, though, is not as sanguine in other markets. "It'll be interesting to see what happens," said Jeffrey Newman of W&M Properties, a landlord in Stamford, Conn., who has watched three REIT's -- Equity Office Properties, Cali and Reckson Associates -- battle for office buildings in Connecticut. "If their growth strategy is based on the continued escalation of rents, it makes me wonder. The rental buck stops somewhere."
Among the first signs that something might be amiss came in March and involved two well-regarded REIT's -- Beacon Properties of Boston and Patriot American Hospitality, a large hotel REIT based in Dallas.
Word appeared on Wall Street that Patriot and Paine Webber had beaten four others in a bid to buy the Chubb Corporation's huge Bellemead office portfolio in New Jersey for $1 billion. Investors reacted negatively, questioning both the high price and the decision to mix two very different kinds of properties, hotels and office buildings.
Though neither Chubb, Paine Webber nor Patriot ever commented publicly, people involved in the discussions say that Patriot backed away in light of the criticism. Recently, a joint venture between Paine Webber and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund II said it had agreed to buy the bulk of the Bellemead portfolio for a reduced price of $649 million.
"The best news may be that Patriot didn't participate," said Mr. Kirby of Green Street Advisors. "It didn't make much sense to dilute the hotels with office."
Also in March, analysts criticized Beacon's purchase of $601 million in office properties in Chicago and Los Angeles that were expected to yield a return of only 8.3 percent in the first year.
Alan M. Leventhal, chief executive of Beacon, which provided a total return to shareholders of 70.2 percent in 1996, more than any other REIT, is unimpressed by the criticism and remains optimistic that continuing job growth will fuel a tightening of the market in many cities and thus a jump in rents.
"Those acquisitions will look better over time," he said.

Graphs: "Conspicuous Consumption"
Real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, are hotter than ever, especially as buyers of commercial office properties. But now, increased competition among buyers is leading to higher purchase prices for buildings. That has hurt many REIT stocks, including these big ones. Graph tracks the stock prices of the following: Cornerstone Properties (since mid-April), Carramerica Realty Corporation (since early 1996), Beacon Properties Corporation (since early 1996), and Cali Realty Corporation (since early 1996).
 REIT's have become big players in commercial real estate, paying high prices and driving up the cost of office space, but investors worry that the REIT's are overpaying. Graphs show the share breakdown of 1997 office building sales over $10 million. They also track the average price paid for office space, over the past year, and the monthly change in the stock prices of five publicly traded office REIT's, since the beginning of 1996.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Undermined Turkish Democracy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Military Meddling in Turkey" (editorial, June 14) is right that every time the Turkish military has intervened in Turkish politics, it has weakened the system it claims to protect. You speak of "serious foreign policy blunders" by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, whom the generals are pressing to leave. However, you fail to mention serious foreign policy blunders by the United States that also contribute to Turkey's problems. 
The Turkish economy has been suffering from the United Nations embargo on Iraq, particularly from the loss of billions of dollars in revenue from the Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline, which was shut down during the Persian Gulf war. Nor have the United States and its allies compensated Turkey for losses during the war, as promised.
The United States has provided no solutions to insure stability in northern Iraq, where it created a "safe haven" for the Iraqi Kurds. Lawlessness prevails in the safe haven. This alone may be sufficient for some in Turkey to justify military solutions to tensions, including costly incursions.

French Concerns Rebuffed As Currency Plan Proceeds
European leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the planned common currency, agreeing to a "stability pact" that requires them to tighten government spending and dismissing French arguments that their No. 1 target should be the reduction of unemployment, not budget deficits.
France's new Socialist Government had demanded public works investments to create jobs, but it retreated after Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, above, and other leaders made clear at a summit meeting that they would not support such spending. Instead, the French won only vague language promising to address unemployment. [Page A1.] 

The dollar slipped, in part because traders bought German marks on diminishing fears that the single currency would be weak. [D17.]
 
Maybe That's Why They're the Big 3
American car makers, inspired by the recent popularity of big cars and trucks, are planning ever larger models with equally gigantic sticker prices. Ford is planning a vehicle that at 19 feet would dethrone the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban by a foot as the longest mass-produced family vehicle ever built. [A1.]
 
Ban on Liquor Ads on TV Delayed
President Clinton's efforts to keep liquor ads off television were dealt a setback when a Republican member of the F.C.C., Rachelle B. Chong, won a delay of at least a month in a proposed investigation into the ads. [A18.]
 
Nasdaq Rises, but Dow Is Off a Bit
Stocks were mixed, after last week's buying spree. The Dow industrials were down 9.95 points, to close at 7,772.09, but the Nasdaq gained 8.92 points, to a record 1,431.95, as a number of its technology stocks rose strongly. [D10.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities rose modestly in light trading. [D20.]$400 Million for Phone Company
 
McLeodUSA, a provider of commercial and residential phone service in the Midwest, said that it would buy Consolidated Communications for $400 million in cash and stock, eliminating a rival. [D6.]
 
Battle Shakes Up Fund Industry
A proxy battle has shaken the normally serene mutual fund industry. Louis G. Navellier, who was ousted as manager of the Navellier Aggressive Small Cap Equity fund in March, blocked an attempt by the fund's trustees to award Massachusetts Financial Services a contract to manage the fund. That opened the door for him to regain control. [D2.]
 
Keycorp to Buy Home-Equity Lender
Keycorp of Cleveland moved to expand its presence in the consumer finance market, agreeing to buy Champion Mortgage, a home-equity finance company, for $200 million. [D2.]
 
Suit vs. Hughes Aircraft Dismissed
The Supreme Court ordered the dismissal of a suit against Hughes Aircraft brought by a former employee who accused Hughes of using misleading accounting practices on contracts for the B-2 bomber and the F-15 fighter plane in the early 1980's. [A18.]
 
A Gold Rush in Congo
With the collapse of Mobutu Sese Seko's three-decade rule, Western business sees a new day in Congo. A number of foreign mining companies, welcomed by the new Government of Laurent Kabila, are lining up for a chance to extract the country's mineral riches. [D4.]

HEADLINE: Start Expanding That Garage For Detroit's Next Generation

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 16

 BODY:
Big is getting bigger on the American road.
American car makers, inspired by the recent popularity of big cars and trucks, are planning even larger models with equally gigantic sticker prices. Take the behemoth being tested by the Ford Motor Company, which, at 19 feet, would dethrone the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban by a foot as the longest mass-produced family vehicle ever built. 
 At more than three tons without cargo, or about twice the weight of a typical family car, this station wagon on steroids will also be one of the heaviest family vehicles. It will have an optional 6.8-liter V10 engine, twice the size of a typical mini-van engine. And it will seat eight adults in three rows and still have a sizable cargo area.
There will be no question who is king of the hill, said one person with knowledge of Ford's product plans. Its customers, this person added, will be people wanting to tow a boat or have the biggest, baddest vehicle on the block.
The Ford vehicle is so large and heavy that it exceeds the Government's weight limits for classification as a light vehicle. That offers two little-known benefits for Ford and its customers. One is an exemption from the Federal luxury tax on high-priced cars and trucks -- those costing more than $36,000. The other is that the vehicle would not be covered by Federal fuel economy regulations written to discourage just the kind of gas guzzler Ford has in mind. (The vehicle, which could cost as much as $40,000, is two years away from mass production and Ford will not discuss it.)
In the meantime, the march of the road hogs will only get bigger.
Chrysler is about to roll out a new Dodge Durango sport utility wagon that is roomier and more than a foot longer than the biggest Jeep. It is also planning an even bigger sport utility for the Mexican market, prompting whispers here that Chrysler may also sell it in the United States. But Chrysler says that is not planned.
Not to be outdone, the General Motors Corporation is planning to redesign the Suburban over the next two years to make it more appealing to families who want to treat it as an oversized car rather than a truck for towing boats and horse trailers. Also, BMW is apparently testing a sport utility wagon it may offer in a few years derived from its 5-series sedans.
Ford has expanded on its successful Explorer sport utility vehicle by building a larger Expedition model that went on sale last fall. And a big, plush sport utility version of its Lincoln luxury brand, called the Navigator, will go on sale in two weeks.
Safety groups are already expressing concern about Ford's plans to build the even bigger, heavier vehicle, saying it could inflict a lot of damage in collisions with smaller, lighter cars. "From a public health vantage point, clearly it's better not to have such a weight mismatch," said Adrian K. Lund, senior vice president for research of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research group supported by insurance companies seeking to reduce the cost of accident claims.
Ford has long made a point of designing vehicles that meet or exceed Government safety standards, but those standards are being reviewed as more Americans are being killed in collisions between cars and heavier vehicles.
Auto makers say they are simply meeting demand with supply. What sells these days are the biggest things in the showroom. Since 1990, sales have climbed more than 60 percent for Suburbans, to 137,171 last year from 83,334 in 1990. And there are waiting lists to buy them. Since Ford introduced the Expedition, its largest sport utility vehicle, it has nearly doubled production, to an annual pace of 240,000, and still cannot satisfy demand. The entire auto market, economists forecast, will have sales of 15.1 million cars, mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles this year.
People buy the big vehicles because they think they are safer, they want to ride above the traffic, intimidate others or simply want something bigger than what friends have.
Auto makers love to sell them because the vehicles generate huge profits; for example, up to $10,000 each for a Suburban whose development costs have long since been recouped, analysts say.
The gigantic new models scheduled to roll out over the next two years are likely to have their devotees and detractors. The Transportation Department released a study last Tuesday concluding that big sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans posed a growing danger to the occupants of smaller cars sharing the same roads. And with fuel economy ratings of 14 miles a gallon or less and generally dirtier emissions, the new sport utility vehicles will generate more pollution and raise the nation's reliance on imported oil, environmentalists warn.
Ford's eight-seater crew wagon -- so called because it can haul a construction crew -- is based on its F-350 model truck. The truck comes in a variety of models, including pickup trucks, cabs for city delivery trucks and flat-bed trucks favored by landscape crews. A redesigned F-350 will go on sale next year.
In Chicago in February, Ford previewed the design of the truck by showing off its Powerforce "concept" vehicle, a high and hefty pickup with power running boards that folded down to help riders step up. That idea is not in production.
The big Ford wagon would not be the first "overweight" vehicle to escape the luxury tax, which is imposed on vehicles costing more than $36,000 but has exemptions for the very heaviest cars and trucks. The Toyota Land Cruiser, among others, is heavy enough when fully loaded to avoid the tax. And the Ford crew wagon would not be the first to escape fuel economy regulations, which exempt vehicles that weigh more than 8,500 pounds fully loaded.
At least two vehicles now escape both the tax and the fuel standards. Those are the heaviest Suburban models and the Hummer, a rough and ready sport utility vehicle adapted from a military transport built by AM General.
People with large or tall families, or who tow boats or trailers, buy many of the biggest vehicles. Pamela R. Staneck, an inn manager in Saugatuck, Mich., said that she and her husband owned a Ford Econoline full-size van, which airports commonly use as shuttle buses, because a mini-van would not be big enough.
"We go to dog shows; I play bagpipes; we travel all over the place," she said, adding that she and her husband, a hospital administrator, would like to buy a Suburban or something similar. "We've always been wanting to get one," she said. "We have a son who is 6 foot 4 inches and two Scottish deerhounds."
In Cheyenne, Wyo., Nick Nickel, a Ford dealer, said the people buying big vehicles in his area were not the farmers and ranchers pictured in some Suburban advertisements. The buyers are "primarily professionals: doctors, lawyers and accountants," he said. Ranchers mostly prefer the more down-to-earth and more practical pickup trucks, he said.
While the ability of large vehicles to intimidate or impress other drivers may be debatable, there is a growing view that big sport utility vehicles provide excellent protection for their occupants and pose a hazard to those in smaller vehicles.
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, death rates in Chevrolet Suburbans are among the lowest for any vehicle on the road. But the institute is beginning a study on whether the proliferation of such large vehicles is increasing death rates in other vehicles that they hit, Mr. Lund said.
Because large sport utility vehicles typically come with four-wheel drive and high bumpers, they also tend to override the strongest sections of a car body and drive into the passenger compartment during collisions, the Transportation Department study warned last week.
Auto industry representatives emphasize the greater protection for occupants offered by heavy vehicles and reject suggestions that their big vehicles pose a safety problem or are impractical. "A lot of people don't use all six seats in six-seat cars," said Barry Felrice, the director of regulatory affairs at the American Automobile Manufacturers Association in Washington.
For Ford, the safety of its crew wagon may even become a selling point. "If you happen to get into a crash with a car, you probably won't even feel it; the car will run into the tires," said the person familiar with the vehicle. "That's kind of a comforting perspective, particularly if you have all your kids inside."
With a gallon of gasoline now selling for considerably less than a gallon of bottled water, the cost of gas has largely disappeared as a worry for buyers of big vehicles. But even if gas prices rise, the Suburbans, Ford crew wagons and other rough, tough land yachts may not disappear.
The reason is simple: the people who can afford to pay $25,000 to $40,000 for a big sport utility vehicle can usually afford to fill their huge fuel tanks even if prices rise. One of G.M.'s envious rivals has done market research calculating that the average Suburban buyer earns $133,800 a year. The average car buyer earns just $67,100 a year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Ahead of Data On the U.S.-Japan Trade Gap

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday on benign United States inflation data, fears of a widened Japanese trade surplus and a Federal Reserve banker's suggestion that the dollar's value had peaked.
Late selling eroded gains the dollar had made earlier in the day after comments from top French and German officials that Europe would get its proposed single currency on time but that its strict fiscal underpinnings might be loosened. 
 Traders said most of the attention as the day progressed turned to a report due today from Japan on May trade flows and to April trade figures, due tomorrow, from the United States.
Both reports were expected to show sharp increases in the Japanese trade surplus with the United States as a result of the dollar's recent strength against the yen.
Traders said the market had already factored in forecasts that the Japanese data would show Japan's May surplus totaled 570 billion yen ($5.03 billion), compared with 229 billion a year earlier.
"If we get much over that, the dollar could fall," said Stephen Flanagan, vice president of foreign exchange at Credit Agricole-Indosuez in New York. "Tokyo's trade data hold the next move in dollar-yen."
In New York, the dollar settled at 113.31 yen, down from 113.52 yen on Monday. The dollar fell to 1.7308 marks from 1.7320 marks. The pound rose to $1.6388 from $1.6375.
The dollar's weakness also reflected United States economic data released yesterday that showed that consumer prices rose only slightly in May and that industrial production and housing construction had slowed. The reports increased speculation that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged next month. Higher rates tend to support the dollar.
Further pressure on the dollar came from Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. He said in a speech in Los Angeles that the dollar's strength had helped contain inflation by suppressing the prices of imported goods, but he also said that such a situation could not be permanent.
"We can't expect the dollar to keep appreciating forever," he said. "In fact, it's recently come down from its highs."

HEADLINE: Tax Break or Tax Headache?

BYLINE: By Leslie B. Samuels; Leslie B. Samuels, a lawyer, was Assistant Treasury Secretary for tax policy from 1993 to 1996.

 BODY:
These are fun days for Congress. As part of the balanced budget agreement, lawmakers now get to decide how to cut taxes by $135 billion over the next five years.
The proposals by the House Ways and Means Committee and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, include child tax credits for middle-income families and tax breaks for college tuition. Both also call for a second type of individual retirement account and for education investment accounts. Under the House bill, individuals could reduce their capital gains tax burden by indexing some assets for inflation. 
 What is missing from this rosy picture? The tax code would be considerably more complicated. Taxpayers would be subjected to more complex forms and computations, and the real winners would be tax lawyers and accountants. The loud call for tax simplification, heard only a year ago, has been silenced.
Developing sound tax policy requires keeping several objectives in mind. The tax system should raise the necessary revenue in a fair manner, the rules should be reasonably easy to understand, and the tax code should foster economic development. These objectives often conflict. When they do, tax simplification usually loses. As a result, the entire tax code has evolved into a complex beast. In many situations, neither taxpayers nor the I.R.S. can easily apply the rules.
The tax-cutting proposals now on the table would turn the tax code into an even bigger beast. For example, under the House plan, the purchase price of some assets would be adjusted for inflation in calculating capital gains (starting in 2001). This simple-sounding idea requires taxpayers to track inflation adjustments for certain assets held more than three years. Individuals would have to know which assets are subject to indexing. Some kinds of stock would be; others would not. Real estate would be indexed only under some circumstances. And because indexing would apply only to assets but not liabilities, it would probably spawn new tax shelters. That, in turn, could lead to complex rules to prevent abuses.
Proposed tax credits and tax deductions for college expenses would require taxpayers to learn yet another set of rules. They would have to figure out which members of the family and what expenses qualified for which incentive. They would have to make sure that the student was carrying at least half the normal course load. Has tuition been prepaid? Does the student have a scholarship? Such factors would affect how much of a tax break the family received.
The tax-cutting plans do include a few tax simplification ideas, like the President's proposal to eliminate the capital gains tax on most sales of residential homes. And the Clinton Administration has recently pushed other simplification proposals, which would result in a small loss of revenue. For example, the standard deduction for children who receive income from savings accounts would be increased, which would mean 1.7 million dependents would not have to file tax forms. These proposals are a laudable start, but more needs to be done.
For example, the standard deduction could be increased for married taxpayers, thereby reducing the number of couples who itemize their deductions and minimizing the so-called marriage penalty. And if each taxpayer could exclude from taxable income $1,000 of dividends, interest and capital gains, instead of having to keep records and report small amounts, filing would be easier for millions of people. Tax simplification would cause a revenue loss, but it could be accommodated within a balanced budget package.
Unfortunately, Congress appears to have missed a rare opportunity to make life easier for taxpayers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Healthy economy shows up in a vital sign: ad spending.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
IF, as the saying goes, a rising tide lifts all boats, you may want to look for some high-riding yachts along Madison Avenue.
The buoyant economy and the continued growth in consumer confidence and spending have led the leading prognosticator of advertising spending to project record, sustained demand from marketers for media time and space. 
 "It's a very strong, healthy marketplace," Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at the McCann-Erickson U.S.A. unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, said yesterday.
"It may change later in the year," he added, "but it's coming in much stronger than we had expected because the economy is stronger."
Ad spending is carefully watched because it is considered an effective barometer of economic health.
"Advertising is a statement of confidence," said Alan J. Gottesman, who follows the industry as managing director at West End Communications/Consulting in New York. "If you're in business, you advertise to get more sales; the risk is that you don't.
"So ad spending is a great indicator," he continued, "especially on the local level, where advertisers tend to be a little more short-leashed."
Mr. Gottesman was among 100 people who attended a seminar, held yesterday at the University Club in midtown Manhattan, at which Mr. Coen offered his predictions.
Mr. Coen forecast that marketers would spend a record $186 billion to advertise this year in the United States. That represents an increase of 6.2 percent from his final figure for 1996 spending of $175.2 billion.
While a gain of 6.2 percent would be the lowest since 1993, when spending rose 5.2 percent, it would be good for a year that comes after one with both the Summer Olympics and a Presidential election.
That is underscored by the fact that ad spending of $186 billion would represent 2.33 percent of the gross domestic product, compared with 2.31 percent last year and 2.25 percent in 1995. Not since 1987 and 1988, when ad spending peaked at 2.35 percent of gross domestic product, has that figure been so high.
In June 1996, Mr. Coen initially projected total 1997 spending of $183 billion, up 5.6 percent from 1996. He trimmed that slightly in December, to $182.9 billion. But he raised his forecast yesterday, he said, because economic growth in the first quarter was "much stronger than we believed likely in December."
It was the 24th annual midyear spending forecast by Mr. Coen, who has been tracking ad trends since 1948. He issues forecasts in June and December, often revising figures from one presentation to the next in response to updated data.
Another reason Mr. Coen gave for adjusting his estimate upward concerned the first-quarter results in many major national categories like national automotive advertising, up 14 percent from the first quarter of 1996, and national drug advertising, up 11 percent.
The gains were more pronounced in secondary national categories, Mr. Coen said, like telecommunications, up 32 percent; computers, up 22 percent, and beer, up 19 percent, as well as in "selected smaller categories" like brokerage firms and mutual funds, up 72 percent.
As a result, he said, the media faring well so far this year include the national broadcast and cable television networks, local radio stations, national magazines and local newspapers (particularly in retail and classified advertising).
Mr. Coen's forecast of $186 billion breaks out into $109.2 billion nationally, up 6 percent from 1996, and $76.8 billion locally, up 6.4 percent.
For 1997 ad spending abroad, Mr. Coen forecast a total of $225.5 billion, up 6.3 percent from his final 1996 figure of $212.1 billion. He cited strong growth in countries like Brazil, Britain, China, Mexico and South Korea. In June 1996, he predicted a figure of $229 billion, which he revised in December to $230.9 billion.
Mr. Coen's worldwide total estimate for 1997, then, is $411.5 billion, which would be an increase of 6.2 percent from $387.3 billion in 1996.
And peeking into 1998, Mr. Coen's initial estimate for spending in the United States is $196.5 billion, which would be an increase of 5.6 percent from 1997. That "could be too conservative," he said, because "we're going to have a Winter Olympics next year" to stimulate spending.
Mr. Coen's first estimate for 1998 ad spending overseas is $240.5 billion, which would be a gain of 6.6 percent from 1997. His worldwide total for next year, then, is $437 billion, up 6.2 percent from his 1997 estimate of $411.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Thalassa Cruso, 88, Plant Lover Who Shared Her Passion on TV

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX 

 BODY:
Thalassa Cruso, an authority on plants who was known as "the Julia Child of horticulture" for her common-sense if often loopy gardening programs on television in the 1960's, died on June 11 at Newton and Wellesley Alzheimer Center in Wellesley, Mass. She was 88 and lived in Marion, Mass.
Ms. Cruso, a witty, acerbic Englishwoman, wrote and starred in the weekly public-television program "Making Things Grow" from 1966 to 1969. In brisk, impeccable diction, she indoctrinated viewers into the mysterious world of cyclamen and spathiphyllum, enjoining them to tend their plants with loving kindness, and to throw them in the dustbin without a backward glance if the little ingrates failed to respond. 
 "If a plant is unbelievably tatty, dispose of it without the least feeling of guilt," she told McCall's in 1971.
Trim and elegant, with dark bangs and a determined chin, Ms. Cruso possessed an uproarious wit, blunt candor and cultivated eccentricity.
"Ha! There's the little brute," she once exclaimed as she flicked an invading slug onto her worktable. Cautioning squeamish viewers to avert their eyes, she raised a flowerpot on high. The pot came crashing down, and the slug was history. WGBH in Boston, which produced the program, was inundated with mail from delighted viewers.
"Making Things Grow" was aimed at the novice, and its appeal lay in Ms. Cruso's role as Everygardener, a true amateur who drew her advice from personal experience rather than formal horticultural training. "I have never studied it, and there is so much I don't know," she once said. "And I'm afraid I'll make some terrible mistake."
Ms. Cruso did not merely handle plants: she communed with them as if they were sentient creatures, pinching them, patting them, sometimes dumping them unceremoniously onto the counter as dirt flew around the set.
In addition to her broadcasting career, which also included a household-advice program, "Making Things Work," in the early 70's, Ms. Cruso wrote a gardening column for The Boston Globe for 22 years. She was the author of several books, including "Making Things Grow" (1969), "Making Things Grow Outdoors" (1971) and "To Everything There Is a Season" (1973).
She was born Jan. 7, 1909, in London, the daughter of Henry and Mildred Cruso. The name Thalassa, the Greek word for "sea," was a whim of her mother's. According to family legend, a paternal ancestor, John Cruso, was a schoolmate of Daniel Defoe, who would later add an "e" to the surname and bestow it on his best-known literary hero. "My mother's maiden name was Robinson," Ms Cruso once said in an interview, "and I am told that the announcement of that engagement was the last thing that made Queen Victoria smile."
The Crusos were passionate gardeners, and Thalassa fondly recalled childhood hours spent doing her homework in the greenhouse.
"When we were given a holiday at school to do a project about our neighborhood, I made a collection of wild plants," she said in an interview. "I bicycled miles to find them. And I found some rare ones." She added: "I didn't win the prize because I presented them sloppily. The girl who won had a collection from her father's garden, neatly pressed. Mine were tied with a boot lace."
Perhaps craving a way to muck about in the dirt and get paid for it, she went into archeology, receiving her diploma from the London School of Economics in 1931. She served as assistant keeper of the costume collection at the London Museum, and later directed an excavation at Bredon Hill, an Iron Age fort in Worcestershire. There she met the American archeologist Hugh O'Neill Hencken; they married in 1935, and she returned with him to Boston.
Mr. Hencken, who was for many years the curator of European archeology at the Peabody Museum of Harvard University, died in 1981. Ms. Cruso is survived by her daughters, Ala Reid of York Harbor, Me., Sophia Stone of New Orleans and Thalassa Scholl of Boston; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
As a wife and mother in Boston, Ms. Cruso was hardly satisfied to confine her days to the garden-club circuit. The inspiration for "Making Things Grow," she recalled, came on a visit to her brother in England: "We would watch the BBC gardening programs and complain about how bad they were. And I had watched and admired Julia Child on TV, and suddenly I thought, 'I could do that with plants.' "
She began with brief snippets tacked onto the end of longer programs. "I used to pop on after the baseball game, or the symphony, or a very serious lecture on birth control," she said.
Ms. Cruso's work led to frequent appearances on the "Tonight" show, where she taught Johnny Carson how to compost eggshells in a closet. As a result of her celebrity, she became an unofficial custodian of the public horticultural trust. "People stop me on the street," Ms. Cruso once said, "and ask what to do with their African violets."

HEADLINE: Royal Caribbean Agrees To Acquire Celebrity Lines

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Consolidation of the cruise industry took a major leap forward yesterday when Royal Caribbean International, a growing line that is still a distant second in size and market share to Carnival Cruises, said it would buy Celebrity Cruise Lines.
Celebrity, a well-regarded upscale line with four modern ships and another scheduled for delivery in October, is considered too small to compete on its own, as the cruise industry expands internationally. 
 Royal Caribbean, which sails to more than 150 destinations worldwide, changed its name last year after almost 30 years as the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. The company, based in Miami, wanted a name that better reflected its growing fleet and greater reach.
"Together, the two brands will enable us to deploy vessels and attract customers on an increasingly global basis, as well as provide opportunities to achieve greater economies of scale," said Richard D. Fain, Royal Caribbean's chairman and chief executive.
Royal Caribbean said it would pay $230 million in cash and some $270 million in stock for Celebrity shares, and assume $800 million in debt. It will issue 7.4 million shares of Royal Caribbean common stock as part of the deal, and said it might issue additional common stock before the close of the transaction to pay for the cash portion of the purchase price. Mr. Fain said he expected the deal to close next month.
Dick Glasier, Royal Caribbean's chief financial officer, said the acquisition was expected to result "in some earnings dilution" in 1998, but should add to earnings thereafter.
"It's a strategically good move," said Peter R. McMullin, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners in Boca Raton, Fla. "Celebrity was one of the jewels out there. It's priced at around book value, but it seems fair if you can make money at it, and the market certainly liked it today."
Stock of Royal Caribbean, owned largely by Anders Wilhelmsen, a shipping company in Oslo, and by the Pritzker family of Chicago, closed at $39.125 a share yesterday, up $2.25. Celebrity is jointly owned by the Chandris Group, a Greek shipping company with headquarters in London, and the Overseas Shipholding Group Inc., one of the world's biggest bulk shipping companies. Chandris also owns hotels in Greece, as well as commercial ships. John Chandris, the chairman of Celebrity, will remain in that position for now.
Cruise Week, an industry newsletter, reported yesterday that Overseas Shipholding Group was disappointed with the financial results of its relationship with Celebrity and wanted to sell its interest in the line.
The acquisition is likely to have little effect on passengers, Mr. McMullin said. "Both companies have a nice image," he added, "and both deliver a good product."
Although Royal Caribbean said it intended to operate Celebrity as a separate brand, by 2000 the combined Miami-based companies will own 20 ships, including five new ones scheduled for delivery to Royal Caribbean by that year. Two of the new vessels will be 130,000-ton so-called mega-ships.
This year, Royal Caribbean will account for about 17 percent of the cruise industry's available berths, and Celebrity will account for about 6.5 percent, according to industry estimates. The Carnival Corporation, including its Holland America, Seabourn and Windstar cruise lines, will account for almost 31 percent. In addition, last week Carnival and Airtours P.L.C., a British tour operator of which Carnival owns 29.6 percent, bought 82 percent of Costa Crociere, an Italian cruise ship operator based in Genoa, for $275 million. Costa's six vessels span the globe.

HEADLINE: That Was Then and This Is the 90's;
Today Looks a Bit Like the Golden Postwar Years Until You Look More Closely

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
With the war barely over, Life magazine laid out, in a 1946 photo essay, a "roseate and wondrous" American dream. A single-story stone-and-clapboard home appeared in the centerfold photo. And spread over the front lawn were the gadgets of the envisioned prosperity: a convertible, a three-burner electric stove, a small television screen embedded in a bulky wooden cabinet, a children's slide, flimsy aluminum lawn chairs, a plastic garden hose, a gasoline lawn mower.
In hindsight, Life's vision was surprisingly modest. The next quarter- century turned out to be a golden age, and as living standards rose, the furnishings of Life's American dream became commonplace, even in the homes of many working poor. 
 Then came 1973, one of the great turning points of the post-World War II era. It was the year in which the dollar came off the gold standard; the oil embargo struck; worldwide grain shortages developed. The widespread rise in prosperity came to a halt. Inflation, stagnant wages, shrinking unions, growing income inequality, spreading poverty and outdated factories all left scars. An economy that had been so plentiful for so many for so long suddenly followed a different path, leaving big portions of the population behind.
Now the United States appears to be at another turning point. Some of the hallmarks of the 1946-73 era are reappearing. Perhaps 1997 will turn out to be as much a landmark in American economic history as 1973. But the new age, if it materializes, is not likely to re-create the postwar sense of bounty. Instead, people are carrying into the future the residue of the stagnant years, and their compromised expectations. Rather than counting on rising prosperity, Americans are betting that by working ever harder, they may manage to cling to leadership in the world economy.
"We are not in any sense back," said Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Nobel laureate in economics. "There may be some economic measures that are equal to or even better than the pre-1973 years. But not the level of well-being."
Three statistics from the old days have reappeared: a low inflation rate, an unemployment rate of less than 5 percent and a return of corporate profits, as a share of the overall economy, close to the hefty levels of the 1960's. Not since the pre-1973 era have such hallmarks of a vibrant economy coexisted so persistently.
Naturally enough, these parallels with the golden era are generating considerable optimism. At McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, William Lewis, director of its Global Institute, declares that America's competitive laissez-faire economy should be the model for all nations.
Wired, the monthly bible of the digerati, proclaims that the global economy, led by the United States, is entering a "long boom," driven by powerful new technologies and the spread of capitalism to nearly every region of the world. And Fortune magazine, in a long article this month, states flatly of America: "These are the good old days."
But for most Americans, it is not like the good old days. Holding onto a job now takes precedence over upward mobility, or getting decent annual raises. Just prolonging an expansion has become more important than generating the robust economic growth that made the pre-1973 period golden. Corporate success in global competition has become an overriding goal, even at the price of greater wage inequality or leaving some groups behind.
Longer hours on the job have displaced the pre-1973 goal of more leisure time to use the lawn furniture in Life's "family utopia." And job insecurity -- "cowed labor," in the phrasing of the economist Paul Samuelson -- has become an accepted means of prolonging the economic cycle, mainly by suppressing wage increases and inflation.
"Before 1973," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's consumer confidence surveys, "there was this deep belief in personal financial progress. In that sense, it is very different today. We don't expect a recession. But we no longer have much faith that our incomes will rise."
While many Americans have clearly acquired more possessions, prosperity itself has a different meaning. The pre-1973 economy often expanded in a given quarter at a 9 percent annual rate, or more. Since 1973, that has never happened. But when growth reached 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 and a rare 5.6 percent in this year's first quarter, it was hailed with glee. "What people once called inadequate growth they are more likely to judge quite positively today," Mr. Curtin said.

 Looking back, 1973 has taken on the watershed status in American economic history of years like 1870, which ushered in the Gilded Age, and 1929, the start of the Depresssion.
In 1973, the year the last American ground troops left Vietnam, the post- World War II generation was suddenly confronted with events that brought home just how much the global economy could alter their lives. Weak world grain harvests and the oil embargo introduced shortages, which fed inflation. So did President Richard M. Nixon's decision to take the dollar off the gold standard, allowing the currency to fall quickly in value. That made American food products more affordable abroad and they were snapped up, particularly by the Soviet Union, in a frenzy of deals that sent domestic prices soaring.
The oil and food price shocks diluted the effectiveness of the wage and price controls imposed by the Nixon Administration in 1970 to counter the costs of the war. By 1973, inflation had become the No. 1 economic issue; the inflation rate doubled that year. And partly as a result, the nation's policy makers, along with many economists, did an about-face in their view of the economy's productive capacity. The national output, once viewed as boundless, now seemed quite constrained.
Until 1973, the big economic issue had been how to generate enough demand to keep the economy growing strongly. The standard measures included tax cuts, public works projects, jobs programs, a higher minimum wage. Supply was taken for granted. The prevailing view was that companies could always jack up production without much strain. "We overestimated how much capacity could grow," said Herbert Stein, who was President Nixon's chief economic adviser in 1973.
That complacency changed by 1973. Economists and policy makers came to attribute the supply shortages, and the rapid price increases, to limited capacity. Supply could not rise to match demand after all, the new view declared, because the nation lacked the necessary productive capacity. And soon attention focused on data that increasingly suggested built-in ceilings on the output of goods and services. "When belief shifted, reality did, too," said David Collander, an economic historian at Middlebury College.
Capacity is three things. It is enough workers to make or provide all that Americans seek to buy. It is enough factories, offices, warehouses and stores, and enough machinery, computers and other equipment to produce all the goods and services that Americans want. Finally, there is productivity, or the amount that workers, using the buildings and equipment, can produce in a given time period. If productivity does not grow fast enough, supply cannot either. Demand can outstrip supply.
From 1946 to 1973, productivity rose, on average, nearly 3 percent a year. But after 1973, the annual advances averaged only 1 percent, well below the long-term trend of more than 2 percent a year in the century after the Civil War.
So, starting in 1973, the nation's policy makers increasingly dealt with the perceived ceiling on supply by restricting demand. The restraint came from the Federal Reserve, whose principal tool for regulating the economy was interest rates. If unemployment got too low, that meant not enough labor capacity, and the Fed, rather than risk wage pressures and shortages, raised interest rates to discourage spending and reduce demand. By the end of the 1970's, with inflation and unemployment rising in tandem, the Fed chose to fight inflation with higher rates, paying much less attention to unemployment.
In this atmosphere, labor's bargaining power came unglued. Corporate profits weakened along with demand. The nation's capital stock per worker -- the machinery and equipment available for each worker to get the job done -- has grown more slowly in each decade since 1973, despite huge investments in computers. And, starting in 1973, the United States entered what is arguably its longest period of slow economic growth since the Civil War.
The official statistics say that economic growth is still modest. But the simultaneous arrival of low inflation, low unemployment and strong profits has some economists -- and many corporate executives -- convinced that the official statistics must be wrong. Solve the mismeasurement, they say, and the nation's economic growth rate in recent years, supported by rising productivity, will come out looking a lot more like the pre-1973 years.
"We are not putting enough resources into getting the right data," said Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania, a Nobel laureate in economics.
The new view is this: After much painful revamping and downsizing, American companies have regained their old efficiency, particularly in manufacturing. New technology and computers have played a big role in all this. So has deregulation, giving the companies flexibility to respond quickly to changing circumstances.
But there is a different, less sanguine, way to explain the reappearance of the symptoms of the 1960's. Productivity has not risen, according to this view. The new technologies, flashy as they are, do not begin to raise output and income as did those of the past -- the railroad, the electric motor, the assembly line, the telephone, the gasoline engine, the jet airliner.
"There are hints every so often," Mr. Solow of M.I.T. said, "that the productivity pace may be picking up, but they are mere hints."
Instead, the new capacity is coming largely from overseas in the form of new factories and skilled, low-wage foreign labor that is quickly at the service of American consumers in an increasingly energetic global economy.
"If a Chinese manufacturer makes something that Wal-Mart then decides it wants," Mr. Lewis of McKinsey & Company said, "it buys in China and distributes massively in the United States."
The second source of more capacity is the American worker himself. In the 1950's and 1960's, most families relied on one earner. Rising productivity pushed up incomes, making that possible. Today two or more people work in most households, and some studies say the typical American is working a greater number of hours, as well.
"People say to themselves, 'There is a possibility a year or two down the line I'll be without a job, but now the economy is booming, and if the boss offers more hours I'll take them,' " said Barry Bluestone, a University of Massachusetts economist and the co-author of one such study. "They have to, to keep up consumption."
Of such trends are turning points made -- not back to the pre-1973 era or some other prosperous period, but to harder days of uncertainty. "It is impossible for anyone to say we have not entered into a new period," said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, "but too soon to say that we have."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photo: "Elusive Dream"
In 1946, Life magazine created this depiction of what it considered the dream to which American families aspired. Today, some economic measures suggest that America is entering another golden age like those postwar years. But a closer look shows that the differences outweigh the similarities.
 
THEN -- In the golden age of 1946-73, the United States was relatively insulated from the global economy and produced most of what Americans consumed.
NOW -- Many more consumer goods are produced abroad, helping to restrain inflation but applying pressure to hold down wages.
 
THEN -- From the late 1940's to the early 1970's, incomes rose sharply, allowing many families with only one earner to afford the American dream.
NOW -- It generally takes at least two earners to achieve a middle-class living standard.
 
THEN -- In the first decades after World War II, productivity gains were strong, providing greater leisure time. NOW Not only are more people working, but 10-hour workdays are common, cutting into family life.

HEADLINE: Legislators Devise Non-Trade Steps to Press China on Rights

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
An informal Republican task force appointed by Representative Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, has agreed on legislation intended to push China toward democracy and human rights without resorting to economic or trade sanctions, Congressional aides said today.
The proposals include increased financing for broadcasts to China and pro-democracy projects there, as well as publication of lists of companies doing business in the United States that are owned by China's military. 
 They could provide an alternative to the increasingly futile yearly debate over revoking normal trading status for China. The group is made up of prominent Republican legislators, including members of Congress on both sides of the issue.
The House is scheduled to vote on June 25, a week before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule, on whether to revoke China's trading status, which is known as "most favored nation" status although it is provided to almost all nations, except those deemed to support terrorism.
Officials of both Congress and the Administration say the threat of revocation is empty, because both houses of Congress will not be able to muster the two-thirds vote required to overturn a presidential veto, should one be necessary.
Still, President Clinton is scheduled to meet tomorrow with 25 or so key House members to urge them not to revoke China's status and to discuss his China policy in general.
Mr. Clinton would like to see the revocation effort die in the House, as it did last year, and the White House is considering the wisdom of embracing some of the proposals of the Porter-Dreier group, like increased financing for Radio Free Asia and Voice of America broadcasts to China, or for pro-democracy projects.
Many members of the House who favor normal trade with China or who know it cannot be revoked still want some vehicle -- more effective than a symbolic vote to revoke China's trading status -- to register their displeasure with China's policies and with the Administration's handling of its own policy of constructive engagement with China.
That is where the Republican task force, which is chaired by Representatives John Porter of Illinois and David Dreier of California, comes in. While some members, like Representative Christopher Cox of California, want stronger trade sanctions against China, the group has agreed, as Mr. Gingrich asked, on a consensus of non-trade legislation. The proposals are based on the kinds of activities Washington used to try to spread Western ideas through the Soviet Union and former Warsaw Pact nations.
The group has agreed, Representative Porter and his staff say, on these proposals:
*Roughly $40 million more for the Voice of America and the year-old Radio Free Asia, to allow them to broadcast to China 24 hours a day in the country's four main languages, including Tibetan. That figure includes roughly $10 million to complete construction on a new transmitter. Currently, Mr. Cox says, Radio Free Asia broadcasts 5 hours a day in Mandarin and 2 hours a day in Tibetan, and is reportedly hard to hear, while Voice of America broadcasts 10 hours a day in Mandarin and 3.5 hours in Tibetan.
*Between $5 million and $10 million more for the National Endowment for Democracy and its projects in China. These projects, performed by non-governmental organizations, promote democratization through work on areas like legal reform, legal education, and village elections.
*An increase in public and private exchange visits between the United States and China.
*A requirement that the State Department maintain a registry of political prisoners in China.
*The publishing of a list of companies doing business in the United States that are affiliated with or owned by the Chinese military.
*A denial of United States visas to Chinese officials who have committed human rights violations or who are involved in the spread of advanced weapons or other sensitive technologies.
*A move to encourage American-based companies to adopt a voluntary code of conduct to insure they are good corporate citizens in China.
Mr. Porter, at a House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade hearing today on China's trading status, said he and other members are eager "to move U.S.-China policy beyond the high-volume M.F.N. debate toward something more productive for all concerned."
Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat and the American Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, urged renewal of China's trade status. "The vote on renewal of M.F.N. is most assuredly not a vote endorsing China's policies," Mr. Eizenstat said. "This vote is about American national interests."
The task force also includes Representatives Douglas Bereuter of Nebraska, Matt Salmon of Arizona, Gerald Solomon and Benjamin Gilman, both of New York; Harold Rogers of Kentucky and Chris Smith of New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Lucent and Philips to Create $2.5 Billion Phone Venture

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Seeking to create a global powerhouse in wireless telephones, Lucent Technologies and Philips Electronics of the Netherlands said yesterday that they had agreed to combine their existing telephone-making operations into a new joint venture with about $2.5 billion in annual revenue.
At Lucent, officials hope the venture will provide a strategy to revive its troubled consumer products business. For Philips, the deal fills a hole in its product line as the company focuses on consumer electronics. 
 Philips, based in the Dutch city of Eindhoven, would own a majority of the new venture. For both companies, the move is a direct challenge to other big makers of wireless handsets like Motorola, Nokia of Finland and Ericsson of Sweden.
"It's a perfect match from a geography and technology standpoint, and from a manufacturing standpoint as well," said Richard A. McGinn, Lucent's president. "We deal a blow to the competition, and we get a chance to advance this business under Philips's aegis and leadership."
Michael McTighe, managing director of the Philips consumer communications division, said: "It's a question of understanding what our strengths are. Communications is becoming a global play. You've got to have those global economies."
The companies expect to complete the transaction by Oct. 1. Mr. McTighe would become chief executive of the new company, to be called Philips Consumer Communications and based in Parsippany, N.J. By 1999, all the new company's products would bear the Philips brand name.
Philips would own 60 percent of the venture while Lucent, of Murray Hill, N.J., would own 40 percent, reflecting the two companies' relative contributions of existing revenue.
About 8,400 of Lucent's roughly 120,000 employees would join the new company, while 4,000 Philips workers would switch affiliation. Mr. McTighe said layoffs would be minimal, falling hardest on administrative staffs. Most employees would work in France, Mexico, Singapore and the United States.
Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the deal yesterday, sending Lucent's shares up $2.125, to $69.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. Philips rose $3, to $66.25.
Lucent said the deal would have no effect on its earnings this year and would enhance its 1998 profit.
"The biggest strategic issue is that consumer products is probably not incredibly strategic to Lucent," said Barry Sine, a financial analyst with SBC Warburg Inc. "Their core relationships were with service providers. Consumer electronics was probably peripheral to them."
The deal would create the world's largest maker of household telephones and answering machines. Lucent, which was spun off from AT&T last year as an independent telecommunications equipment company, is the biggest maker of telephones in the United States, with an annual production of about 16 million, while Philips is the No. 1 phone manufacturer in Europe.
But the main rationale behind the deal is the two companies' desire to compete effectively in the booming global market for digital wireless phones, which are used mainly outside the home.
About half the new company's revenue would come from the sale of wireless phones. The companies expect the wireless phone market to grow much faster than that for traditional home phones. Lucent is one of the world's leading makers of the equipment that forms the backbone of wireless networks. But it just started making digital handsets last year and remains a fledgling in that market. And its handsets conform to standards used almost solely in North America.
When it comes to wireless telephones, Philips is Lucent's mirror image. Philips also began making handsets in 1996, but only makes telephones that conform to the dominant wireless technology outside Canada and the United States.
"It puts these guys in a much beter position to compete against Ericsson," said Gregory S. Geiling, who follows telecommunications-equipment companies for J. P. Morgan. "All of a sudden, they've now got the entire portfolio of products."
Last October, Lucent dispatched a top executive, Carleton S. Fiorina, to repair its consumer products group. Lucent had shut down the 338 retail stores it inherited from AT&T and 1996 revenue for the division, about $1.1 billion, was roughly 30 percent below that in 1995.
"It's clear that Lucent Technologies no longer has a requirement to build a consumer brand," Ms. Fiorina said yesterday. "This is a more productive way for us to participate in the growth opportunity that is consumer electronics."

Economic Data Push Bond Prices Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities slipped yesterday as more reports showed the economy slowing but still moving ahead at a pace that warrants watching for signs of inflation. And while many people expect the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at its next policy meeting, the door is still open to another rise should the pace of growth quicken.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 10/32, to 98 27/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.71 percent, from 6.69 percent on Monday. 
 A report showing stronger-than-expected industrial production and capacity utilization in May put the market under pressure early, as investors took profits after the gains of the last few sessions.
Production was up four-tenths of 1 percent in May, a bit stronger than the consensus estimate of two-tenths of 1 percent. The capacity utilization rate rose to 83.7 percent, its highest level since September 1995.
But concerns that a strong economy was revving up inflation were eased somewhat by the release of the Consumer Price Index for May. The index rose just one-tenth of one percentage point. And the core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, was in line with market expectations too, rising only slightly more, two-tenths of a percentage point.
"We nevertheless see cause for some concern in the data," said Greg Jones, an economist at Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif. He said that some signs of price increases were evident in three key areas: housing, medical care and the service industries.
Still, a third report showed some weakness in home building. May housing starts fell to 1.397 million units from a revised 1.468 million in April. "The housing sector may have been depressed by cool weather and volatility in multi-unit starts in May," Mr. Jones said, but the level of building permits issued remained strong, which suggests that the underlying trend in housing has not changed. Recent readings of the level of mortgage applications also point to strong housing activity, he said.
Gary Thayer, a senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said yesterday's reports showed that the economy was slowing but remained healthy.
He noted that much of the reason for the benign inflation in the consumer price report was caused by a drop in energy prices in the first half of the year. "Going forward, inflation risks still exist," Mr. Thayer said, "but the Fed can probably hold monetary policy steady for a while."
Mr. Thayer said that investors would take a close look at the Fed's report of regional economic conditions today to see whether growth indeed appears to be slowing. If that is the case, it would take the pressure off the Fed to raise rates at the meeting of the central bank's policy-making committee on July 1 and 2.
"We think the Fed will hold steady but are concerned that the tight labor markets and an improving world economy could push wages and commodity prices higher in the second half of the year, possibly leading to another rate hike by the Fed before the end of the year," Mr. Thayer said.
Next week, issues of supply loom, as market participants will also have to contend with the government's sale of two-year and five-year notes, which could crimp demand. The size of the sales is expected to be announced today.
Adding to the new supply, issuers of asset-backed securities, corporate and global debt are lining up to take advantage of the lowest rates in nearly four months.
Mexico priced $500 million of global bonds due in 2007 yesterday through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers International. The bonds, which were priced to yield 9.875 percent, are rated Ba-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Ames Financial Corporation, which plans to sell $500 million of bonds backed by home equity loans, leads a group of companies that plan to sell as much as $10 billion of bonds backed by an assortment of loans this week. And the PNC Bank Corporation may come to market with $1 billion of bonds backed by student loans.

HEADLINE: Rep. Armey to Offer Bill Aimed At Cutting Auto Insurance Costs

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader, says he will introduce legislation today aimed at sharply reducing the cost of auto insurance by giving motorists the option to drop coverage for pain and suffering that results from accidents.
The initiative is both an unusual move by Mr. Armey, a Texas Republican, who has sponsored just two other bills during his tenure, and a big lift for proponents of the option, referred to as auto choice, who need to prove that they can generate political traction. 
 "The train is finally leaving the station," said Michael Horowitz, the director of the Hudson Institute's Project for Civil Justice Reform.
The Senate Commerce Committee is scheduled to hold hearings on a parallel bill sponsored by two Democrats, Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, along with three Republicans, Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Rod Grams of Minnesota and Slade Gorton of Washington.
Trial lawyers have already voiced their opposition, as have some consumer groups. "It wouldn't do anything for the seriously injured," argued Bob Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. Consumer groups also argue that auto choice would be unfair because it would limit access to court based on a driver's ability to pay extra premiums.
But supporters say that auto choice would reduce incentives for fraud and increase victims' prospects for compensation from actual economic losses, even while cutting premiums by an average of $243 a year for each driver, or $45 billion nationwide.
"This is like a tax reduction for middle- and lower-income Americans," said Mr. Armey, who cites estimates by the Rand Corporation's Institute for Civil Justice showing that the savings would be greatest for inner-city drivers.
Auto choice was born from frustrations with the failure of no-fault insurance, introduced in the 1970's, to contain escalating insurance costs. Under the no-fault approach, which was adopted by almost half the states (including New York and New Jersey), those injured in auto accidents are entitled to medical care and lost wages from their own insurance companies, regardless of who is at fault. Victims can sue to recover for pain and suffering only if their losses exceed a threshold, often measured by their medical bills.
But no-fault has done little to stem the costs of insurance, which rose 150 percent in the 1980's in spite of falling accident rates. In fact, there is evidence that no-fault actually increased costs by creating incentives to run up physicians' fees in order to gain access to court. When Massachusetts raised its threshold to $2,000 in 1989, the median number of doctor visits for injury victims rose from 13 to 30.
One alternative, bullet-proof no-fault laws in which victims could receive compensation only for tangible economic losses, would presumably eliminate most of the 40 percent of auto insurance costs now linked to litigation, unneeded medical care and payments for pain and suffering. But outright elimination of claimants' right to a day in court strikes many as unfair. So Mr. Horowitz and Jeffrey O'Connell, a professor at the University of Virginia Law School who helped invent no-fault, proposed to "unbundle" the standard auto insurance package.
Drivers willing to forgo claims for pain and suffering in return for lower premiums could opt for strict no-fault, while others would also pay for "tort maintenance coverage." A driver with tort coverage who is injured by a driver with just no-fault could collect pain-and-suffering compensation from his own insurance company, much the way insured victims are now compensated for injuries caused by uninsured motorists.
George Bush endorsed Federal legislation requiring states to give drivers this choice during the 1992 Presidential campaign, as did Bob Dole in 1996. And a diverse group of political figures, ranging from Republicans like Gov. John Engler of Michigan and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to Michael S. Dukakis, the former Massachusetts Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate, have taken up the cause. But with the exception of State Farm, the insurance industry has remained aloof. And to date, the trial lawyers' lobbies have been able to brush aside auto choice initiatives: a California auto choice ballot initiative was beaten earlier this year, and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was forced to withdraw her own auto choice bill without a vote in the New Jersey Legislature.
But the politics may be changing. Senator McConnell, a Republican with close ties to the Senate leadership, is pressing for a vote on auto choice this session. Representative Armey, who is co-sponsoring auto choice with Representative James P. Moran, a liberal Democrat from the Virginia suburbs of Washington, vows that he "intends to move the legislation along." And scenting a grass-roots issue in the making, Steve Forbes, the magazine publisher who ran for President in 1996, will run supporting radio ads beginning next week.
Personal injury lawyers are also taking the issue seriously. This month Howard Twiggs, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, branded auto choice "a devastating blow to good drivers everywhere," and scheduled an "auto political summit" at the trial lawyers' annual convention in July to "lay out a strategic plan for defeating such a Draconian legislative proposal."
Peter Kinzler, president of the Coalition of Auto-Insurance Reform, a lobbying group, says he thinks the lawyers' concerns are prescient. "With spending locked up and taxes done, auto choice is looking better and better as a way for Congress to deliver the goods," he argued.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall on Inflation News; Dow Off 11.31

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market turned sluggish yesterday despite new data that showed benign inflation.
While yesterday's report on May consumer prices confirmed earlier indications that the economy was slowing, a separate report on industrial production suggested the economy could be gathering momentum once again. Investors, already giddy about what seemed to be a nicely balanced economy, drew a mixed reaction to the reports. 
 After plunging more than 65 points early in the day, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 37 points, only to give up the gains late in the day and close down 11.31 points at 7,760.78.
"I saw the C.P.I. number and it was as expected, and I think the market got used to better-than-expected news," said Jerry Dombcik, managing director of research at McDonald & Company in Cleveland. "But nothing has really changed in the economy."
Despite yesterday's losses, Mr. Dombcik said the market continued to benefit from an ideal economic scenario. "You have to go back to the 1960's to see this kind of environment," he said.
Analysts and economists said the good news about the economy had already been factored in, however, resulting in colorless trading yesterday.
"I don't think these numbers added a lot of new information," said Stuart G. Hoffman, the chief economist at PNC Bank in Pittsburgh. "The market has been up quite a bit in the last week, and these numbers were good, but they weren't enough to propel the market much further."
Technology stocks, however, were among the best performers. The Nasdaq composite index, which is loaded with technology issues, rose 11.16 points, to a record 1,443.11. For the year, the Nasdaq is up 11.8 percent.
Many of its largest computer-related issues gained yesterday on expectations of better earnings and news of stronger demand for high-tech components in the Federal Reserve report on industrial production.
Shares of Dell Computer rose 5 1/2, to 120 7/8, after several analysts reiterated their high ratings of the computer maker.
Microsoft was up 2 13/16, to 134 3/16, and Intel was up 2 21/64, to 149 11/16. Compaq Computer was up 2 5/8, to 107 3/4.
Several other indexes also set records yesterday, but just barely. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.52 point, to 894.42 -- its ninth consecutive record-setting session. And the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks rose 0.35 point, to a record 392.55.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index also reached an all-time high, edging up 0.08 point to close at 465.09. Advancing and declining issues were evenly split in heavy trading of about 542.9 million shares.
Among Dow stocks, Procter & Gamble slid 1 7/8, to 139 5/8, and Johnson & Johnson fell 1 1/4, to 65. The best-performing Dow issue was Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which rose 2 1/4, to 100. For the year, the Dow is up 20.35 percent.
And with so many Dow component stocks trading at high valuations, some strategists are beginning to question whether market valuations are stretched.
But Mr. Dombcik at McDonald & Company said that while valuations were high, the greater threat to the market was inflation and higher interest rates.
"The valuations are high up there," he said. "But you don't have competition from interest rates. Besides, valuations alone don't destroy bull markets."

HEADLINE: Consumer Price Index Rises Only Slightly for 3d Straight Month

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Consumer Price Index rose by a barely noticeable one-tenth of 1 percent in May, the Labor Department reported yesterday. It was the third straight month of such slight inflation, suggesting that the American economy is surprisingly free of pressures for price increases so late in an economic expansion.
Some economists who had warned just two months ago that inflation would soon rise now acknowledge that the country is passing through an unusually mild period -- one in which global and domestic forces are combining to hold down prices. 
 "We still expect inflation to appear in the future, once these temporary factors pass," said David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting service. He had urged the Federal Reserve's policy makers to raise interest rates at their May meeting, but now he and others are backing away from that recommendation when the policy makers next meet, in early July. "For 1997," Mr. Wyss said, "we actually expect inflation to be less than 1996."
The index has risen by only one-tenth of a percentage point in four of the five months so far this year. That has produced an annual inflation rate of just 1.4 percent through May, unusually low for an economic expansion in its seventh year. By comparison, inflation rose 3.3 percent in 1996.
The consumer price report came four days after the Labor Department had reported that producer prices for finished goods, measuring price levels for goods shipped from factories, had fallen in May, for the fifth consecutive month. The two reports, said Janet Yellen, head of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, show "that inflation remains well under control."
An assortment of factors appears to be holding down prices. For one thing, people no longer expect price increases, as they did in the 1980's, and that becomes self-fulfilling, said Patrick Jackman, chief of the C.P.I. division at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Retailers in this atmosphere become reluctant to raise prices, fearing that they will annoy consumers and lose business.
The dollar and imports also play a role. A stronger dollar has reduced the prices of imported goods, just when foreign producers are especially eager to sell to Americans. Weaker economies in Japan and Western Europe have reduced sales in those countries, leaving companies abroad with goods on their hands to sell.
"With so many foreign producers in the wings," Mr. Jackman said, "domestic suppliers think twice about raising prices."
The inflation rate would normally be responding to the 4.8 percent unemployment rate, the lowest since 1973. The expectation had been that such low unemployment would create labor shortages, forcing employers to bid for workers and cover the cost of higher wages with higher prices. But job insecurity has made workers reluctant to press for wage increases, many economists say -- or at least not for wage increases big enough to force price rises.
After two quarters of strong growth, the economy is slowing in the second quarter, and the slower growth is likely to last into the summer, many economists say. That, too, eases the pressure on prices, though other economic data issued yesterday suggested, inconclusively, both weaker and stronger growth.
Industrial production, for example, rose in May by a strong four-tenths of a percentage point, and capacity utilization rose to 83.7 percent -- the highest since September 1995 -- from 83.6 percent in April, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday. Previous readings of more than 85 percent have indicated that the nation's factories, mines and utilities are operating nearly flat out, with little room to increase production and avoid shortages. That measure is less significant today, though, given that many overseas companies, running plants below capacity, can supplement American production.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that housing starts, measuring the start of construction of single and multifamily homes, fell in May by 4.8 percent, to an annual rate of 1.397 million units. It was the third consecutive monthly decline, suggesting a weaker economy.
The consumer price report issued yesterday showed only a scattering of price increases in May, particularly for coffee. Prices also rose for fresh vegetables, beef, poultry, fish and eggs and housing. Gasoline prices fell by 4.1 percent, the largest drop since March 1991, and airline fares and tobacco prices also fell. The so-called core inflation rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose by two-tenths of a percentage point in May.
The index rose by 2.2 percent for the 12-month period ended in May, the lowest such rise in a decade. The annual rate has fallen from a 3.3 percent level in December and 3 percent in January and February. Excluding food and energy, the index rose by 2.5 percent for the 12-month period through May. Since December, the annual rate has ranged between 2.5 percent and 2.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Clinton Proposes Incentives For Free Market in Africa

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Just days before the summit meeting of the major industrial nations in Denver, President Clinton joined with bipartisan members of Congress today to promote a series of trade measures with Africa intended to encourage free-market reforms of the continent's most promising economies.
Mr. Clinton marshaled a group that spanned the ideological spectrum from New York City's former Democratic Mayor David N. Dinkins, to Jack F. Kemp, the defeated Republican candidate for vice president, to demonstrate support for an Africa policy designed to turn countries from dependents into trading partners. 
 Mr. Clinton plans to call on the nations gathered at the summit later this week to take steps to help Africa, including urging the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to forgive some of the international debt burdening some of the poorest nations. Uganda recently qualified for about $385 million in such debt relief.
Africa had received sporadic attention during the first four years of the Clinton Administration. But Hillary Rodham Clinton, the First Lady, visited the continent this year and in the past few months the White House has been working with Congress on legislation, involving little new spending, that would lower tariffs for African countries that are reforming their economies and promote private investment in Africa.
"Our initiative opens the door to real positive change," Mr. Clinton said. "Only nations carrying out serious reforms will reap the full benefits. Those who strengthen their democracies and invest in their people will see their efforts pay off in increased trade that will create new jobs, increase wages, spur growth and improve the quality of lives of people who have suffered some of the world's worst poverty."
White House officials said the measures supported by the President would complement traditional foreign aid for Africa. Such aid amounted to $655 million in the current fiscal year and Mr. Clinton has called for it to rise to $700 million in the coming fiscal year.
Mr. Clinton indicated that he was working with lawmakers of both parties to pass legislation that would give the poorest countries in Africa duty-free access to American markets for an additional 1,800 products.
In addition, a bill sponsored by Representative Philip M. Crane, an Illinois Republican, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, would grant further tariff reductions on additional products for countries that are liberalizing their economies. The measure is expected to be considered in the fall.
Mr. Clinton said the Administration was also using government guarantees through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to leverage $150 million in private funds for investment in Africa and another $500 million for investment in African infrastructure projects like telecommunications projects. He said the United States would also eliminate bilateral debt in the cases of the poorest nations.
The Clinton Administration and members of Congress said the approach was intended to help Africa escape from its dependence on foreign aid.
"Americans want us to move from a donor-recipient relationship with Africa," said Representative Jim McDermott, a Washington Democrat. "They want us to start treating Africa like we treat the rest of the world, as economic partners."
The President's announcement was welcomed by several African nations. "It is going to create an environment that will assist in bringing confidence to American corporations," said the Ugandan Ambassador, Edith Ssempala. "American businesses have not been interested enough."
Seeking to encourage American businesses to step up private investment in Africa, the Administration noted that 30 countries in Africa recorded positive growth rates last year, with some nations attaining growth rates as high as 12 percent.
Officials say a majority of Africa's 48 nations have embarked on market-oriented economic and political reforms in the past decade.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Yeltsin, Shaper of a City

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, June 17

 BODY:
During the cold war, the only thing Denverites expected to see coming from Moscow was a nuclear-tipped missile.
But when Russia's Presidential jet touches down here on Thursday for an international summit meeting, it will bring Boris Yeltsin, and he will find an American heartland city reshaped, in an odd way, by Boris Yeltsin. 
 In the six years since the Russian President faced down a Communist coup attempt, the shock waves of the Soviet Union's collapse have rippled halfway around the globe. Today, with the disappearance of the Soviet threat, four out of Denver's five military installations are being dismantled, destined to become golf courses, suburban housing developments, a medical research center, a biotech industrial park, a college campus and an urban wildlife refuge 20 times the size of Central Park in New York.
"Boris has affected us more than we realize," said Thomas J. Noel, a history professor at the University of Colorado. "During the 1950's, the fear of Russia probably was the biggest single growth stimulant here."
At the time, local politicians eagerly, and successfully, pitched this interior city to Pentagon planners, calling it "the Rocky Mountain Fortress," safe from the reach of Soviet bombers. And so, at the height of the cold war, Denverites made sarin gas for chemical warfare and plutonium triggers for atom bombs. Denver was home to a training base for Air Force bomber pilots and to one of the nation's largest Army hospitals.
But today, as welcoming banners in Russian and other languages of the summit meeting bedeck Denver's downtown pedestrian mall, participants at this weekend's "Summit of the Eight" -- a meeting of the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States -- will see a very different Denver.
At Lowry, an Air Force training base until 1994, a 12-ton steel guillotine has been chopping up runways into concrete chunks that will be recycled to pave streets for a suburban housing development. As a B-52 bomber stands marooned in a static museum display, a nearby hangar is being converted into the Big Bear Ice Arena, complete with two indoor and one outdoor skating rinks.
In a nod to Lowry's military tradition, former base housing is now marketed to renters as a community called "Landings At Lowry."
"In 15 years, we are going to have a mixed-used community with 10,000 residents, 10,000 to 12,000 jobs, and 10,000 students at our college campus," James E. Meadows, executive director of the Lowry Redevelopment Authority, said as he pressed on a visitor a cheery promotional video: "Lowry: Live, Learn, Work and Play."
In Denver, where housing costs have risen by 50 percent since 1990, real-estate developers see a bonanza in the transfer from military to civilian use of three square miles only 15 minutes from downtown. Contracts are being signed for the construction of 3,200 new homes, ranging in price from $100,000 to $600,000. Although no new houses have been built yet, developers are so confident that they agreed last week to make Lowry the site of the city 1998 Parade of Homes, a decorator showcase of new houses.
About one-third of the area is to remain open space, largely golf courses and playing fields. Old Air Force training buildings are being converted into a community college specializing in technology training. Fifteen years and $1.3 billion from now, the only recognizable feature from the old base may be a small white clapboard chapel, known as the Eisenhower Chapel. President Dwight D. Eisenhower served in Denver as a military officer before World War II and was married to a Denverite, Mamie Doud.
The demilitarization of Denver is part of a wider, post-cold-war phenomenon. Since the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, American military spending has fallen by about one-third in constant terms, to about $254 billion today. During the same period, the number of American active duty military personnel has also fallen by about one-third, to 1.4 million today.
Two miles northeast of Lowry, Paul E. Tauer, Mayor of Aurora, jubilantly paced the roof of a massive beige brick building on a recent afternoon. Once the centerpiece of Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center, the 450,000-square-foot building was the largest in Colorado when it was built in 1941. Six weeks ago, the Army leased the building to the city of Aurora, Denver's eastern neighbor and Colorado's third largest city.
"It's going to be a phenomenal economic development engine," said Mayor Tauer. "We are going to have four times the jobs on this site."
The Mayor's prediction is backed by the University of Colorado's decision to move its Health Sciences Center from a congested residential neighborhood in Denver to the one-square-mile suburban site. Committed to occupying about one-third of Fitzsimmons, the university plans to spend $20 million to renovate the main building, and another $23 million to build a cancer treatment center.
"Ten bioscience companies need space as soon as we can give it to them," Robert E. Olson, executive director of the Fitzsimmons Redevelopment Authority, said, referring to a section of the former Army base that is to become a "bioscience research park."
About $1.5 billion is to be invested in renovating Fitzsimmons, leaving untouched only an eighth-floor hospital room where President Eisenhower spent seven weeks recovering from a heart attack in the late 1950's.
There, as in Lowry, officials recognize that the changes in suburban Denver can be traced to geopolitics.
"If those hostilities still existed, this would not be happening," Mayor Tauer said from the rooftop of the old Army medical center.
Three miles to the north, the demilitarization of Denver is even more striking at a 27-mile square expanse once known as Rocky Mountain Arsenal.
"It's up to Hitler and Tojo now," The Denver Post trumpeted in 1943, at the opening there of the Army's main production plant for mustard gas and incendiary bombs. Assembly lines at the Arsenal produced the napalm and phosgene used in the March 1945 firebombings of Tokyo. And during the cold war, the Arsenal was the only production site outside of the Soviet Union for sarin, a highly toxic nerve gas.
Today, the site has been rebaptized the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. Almost halfway through a 20-year, $2 billion cleanup, the former chemical weapons plant is to be reborn by 2010 as one of the nation's largest urban wildlife refuges.
Only 10 miles from downtown Denver, the refuge already has almost 300 wildlife species, including bald eagles, pronghorn antelope, prairie dogs and white-tailed deer. Specializing in environmental education, the refuge is to offer a visitor learning center, an open air-nature tram, hiking and bicycling trails and picknicking sites.
An even more expensive cleanup, costing around $7 billion, is under way in a northwest Denver suburb where plutonium triggers for America's atom bombs were made until 1989. Surrounded by a 10-square-mile buffer zone, Rocky Flats was once Denver's second largest employer. As the collapse of the Soviet Union became an irreversible fact, the plant's mission shifted from standby for production to dismantlement and its name became Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site.
"We are deactivating rooms, we are decontaminating buildings, we are cleaning up disposal trenches," said Jesse Robberson, site manager for the Department of Energy.
Depending on the flow of Federal money, the cleanup will be completed 10 to 15 years from now. As at the chemical weapons factory, a one-square-mile core will remain permanently off limits. But Denver's booming western suburbs will inherit 10 square miles of open space, largely bluegrass prairie.
With four of Denver's military installations converting to civilian use, the metropolitan area's last major military installation, Buckley Air National Guard Base, is now crowded with 23 military tenants, ranging from the Navy to the Marines to the Army National Guard.
Reflecting on the shift, John Spann, the base spokesman, said today, "With everybody shutting down, we are the only military presence in the area."

The nation's colleges and universities need to cut costs dramatically or face a shortfall of funds that will increasingly shut out the poor from higher education and from economic opportunity as well, according to a blunt and far-ranging assessment of American higher education that was made public yesterday.
The report, by a panel of leading public and private university officials and corporate executives, says that rising costs, falling public spending and a coming surge in demand are making the economics of American higher education increasingly unsupportable. 
 If current enrollment, spending and financing trends continue, the report said, higher education will fall $38 billion short of what it needs to serve the expected student population in 2015. To sustain current spending, it said, tuition would have to double by 2015, effectively shutting off higher education to half of those who would want to pursue it.
The report focuses on one of the great unspoken dilemmas in President Clinton's push to make at least two years of college as common as a high school diploma: higher education is expensive, students pay only a small share of their costs and, while bringing increasing numbers of low-income students into higher education will have long-term economic benefits, it will also have enormous short-term economic costs.
On the other hand, the report said, with education increasingly crucial to economic advancement, cutting off access to education -- particularly to the poor and to immigrant groups who increasingly dominate the student population of states like California, Florida, New York and Texas -- would have enormous consequences for the nation's social fabric.
The report, "Breaking the Social Contract: The Fiscal Crisis in Higher Education," calls for a radical restructuring of universities, including an effort to overhaul university governance to limit the power of individual departments, redefining and often reducing the ambitions of different institutions and a sharing of resources between institutions.
The report also calls for more public financing, but it stresses that changes in the system should be prerequisites to any increases.
"The facts are irrefutable," said Thomas Kean, the former New Jersey Governor who is now president of Drew University and is a co-chairman of the panel that wrote the report. "We are heading for a crisis at the very time we can least afford one."
The panel, the Commission on National Investment in Higher Education, is made up of academic and business leaders convened by the Council for Aid to Education, an independent subsidiary of the Rand Corporation.
Experts say that higher education is already being reshaped by such forces as technology or competition from for-profit institutions, so that a straight-line extrapolation from current economic figures is difficult. And higher education is such a varied enterprise in the United States that a crisis for a public college in California does not necessarily mean a crisis for Harvard or Princeton.
Still, Roger Benjamin, president of the Council for Aid to Education, notes that even rich universities like Yale and Stanford have faced deficits and retrenchment in recent years.
And officials in state systems, which educate the majority of Americans, say the gap between resources and costs in higher education is becoming ever more daunting.
Charles Reed, chancellor of the State University System of Florida, said that over the next 10 years Florida would face an increase of nearly 50 percent in students at its public four-year institutions, to 300,000 from 210,000.
Barry Munitz, chancellor of the California State University System, said California was midway through a half-century of population growth and demographic change that would see the number of children in kindergarten through the 12th grade almost double, to about eight million, and go from about 75 percent white in 1970 to about 75 percent minority in 2020.
Population growth will only accelerate the financial problems facing higher education, the report said. It noted that the index measuring the increases in the price paid by colleges and universities for goods and services, like faculty salaries, rose more than sixfold from 1961 to 1995. The annual rate of growth in the cost of providing higher education exceeded the Consumer Price Index by more than a percentage point from 1980 to 1995, the report said.
And, while costs have gone up, public support has not. Since 1976, public support per student has just kept up with inflation, while real costs per student have grown by about 40 percent, the report said.
To make up the difference, tuition has risen dramatically, with tuition and fees doubling from 1976 to 1994. But the report said that a similar doubling between now and 2015 would have a catastrophic effect on access, pricing as many as 6.7 million students out of higher education.
"If you were to announce that, given fiscal pressures, the door to social mobility that was good enough for the old generation is really no longer needed by the new one, you might as well stick a ticking bomb inside the social fabric of this country," Chancellor Munitz said.
While calling for more public support, the report said that a solution to the fiscal imbalance had to start with colleges and universities themselves.
"Given the magnitude of the deficit facing American colleges and universities, it is surprising that these institutions have not taken more serious steps to increase productivity without sacrificing quality," the report said.
The report's recommendations for restructuring -- from sharing a library with other institutions to eliminating weak programs -- are not new, but there are enormous political and institutional barriers in the way of a major economic overhaul of higher education. Still, some experts say institutions have no option but to find ways to operate more efficiently.
"The ability to maximize revenue, given the competitive pressures for state dollars on the one hand and the resistance to future increases in tuition on the other, has about run its course," said Stanley Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, a leading advocacy group, which was not involved in the report. "All of that's putting more and more pressure on the operating side of the budget."

HEADLINE: City's Right to Bar Vendors From Streets Is Upheld

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 17

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani can banish sidewalk food vendors from congested streets in midtown Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, the state's highest court ruled yesterday.
The unanimous decision by the Court of Appeals reversed a mid-level appeals court ruling in February 1996 that said that the city had arbitrarily decided that certain streets in Manhattan and Brooklyn were too crowded to accommodate vendors, who hawk everything from bananas to burritos. 
 The ruling means the administration can now move ahead with a plan to stop vendors from operating on more than 20 midtown streets that a city panel had decided in August 1995 to close to vending either entirely or partly in a campaign to ease crowding in bustling areas of the city.
In a one-page statement, Rudy Washington, the city's Deputy Mayor for Community Development and Business Services, praised the Court of Appeals decision. He said the administration intended to begin enforcing the new restrictions on food vendors, though he did not specify when.
"While the city recognizes the importance of vendors to our economy," Mr. Washington said, "it is vital that restrictions be placed in areas where vending would diminish the quality of life and threaten public safety."
But the decision prompted dismay and anger among the city's 3,000 food peddlers, a group that has provided a service for New Yorkers who are forever on the run. Many vendors have said that the city's policy infringes on free enterprise and would almost certainly drive them out of business.
"I'm ready to move to India," said Jeff Cicio, president of the Big Apple Food Vendors Association, which represents 1,000 food vendors.
"The city has just been given carte blanche to close off streets to vendors and drive us out of New York. I used to believe there was such a thing as justice."
But the ruling was hailed as a victory by many midtown retailers and restaurant owners who have lobbied the city for years to restrict all street vendors, not just those who sell food.
The merchants complain that the vendors block sidewalks and streets, evade taxes and blemish the neighborhood's ambiance and appearance.
"The reason we are happy is that there are some really congested streets in midtown," said Daniel A. Biederman, the president of two business improvement districts, the Grand Central and 34th Street Partnerships.
"Many of the merchants and property owners will be very pleased."
The court's ruling centered on an August 1996 decision made by a city panel, called the Mayor's Street Vendor Review Panel, to restrict or ban food carts on some midtown streets and open new spots downtown and in Brooklyn and Queens.
The decision was reached after the members of the panel conducted a lengthy public-review process that included hearings intended to determine, among other things, the level of congestion on certain streets where vendors operate.
But the Big Apple Food Vendors Association sued to block the city's action, asserting that the panel had not used an objective standard to determine which streets were too crowded for vendors' carts. The lower courts eventually ordered the five-member panel to create a standard method of measuring pedestrian and vehicular congestion.
The courts also ordered the city to use that measure to decide where vendors could set up their carts, just as the city does when it decides where to permit newsstands and sidewalk cafes to operate.
But in the decision released today, the Court of Appeals overturned the lower court, saying that the city review panel was essentially a regulatory agency with the power to regulate the industry as it saw fit so long as it did so in accordance with the 1995 law that created it.
The panel, consisting of four representatives from city agencies and one from the City Council, was set up as part of a compromise between the Mayor and the Council after the Mayor vetoed a bill that would have lifted several restrictions on vendors enacted in 1983.
Today, food vendors reiterated their concerns about the way the panel made its decisions, saying that in the absence of such standards, powerful business groups could use their influence with the city to force vendors out of their neighborhoods.
"These are very powerful businesses," Mr. Cicio said. "In the next few months, you are going to see streets closed to vendors and vendors being pushed out of the city."
But the city has rejected that claim, saying that the panel attempts to balance competing needs and concerns of merchants and vendors when it decides where the vendors can do business.

HEADLINE: Gubernatorial Candidates Give Business Leaders Two Views of the Economy

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., June 17

 BODY:
Appearing together for the first time since the primaries, New Jersey's gubernatorial candidates presented two starkly different assessments of the state's economy to a group of business leaders here tonight.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican incumbent, and her Democratic challenger, James E. McGreevey, chatted as they posed together for photographers at the beginning of the dinner meeting of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, and then addressed the group separately. 
 In her address, the Governor reviewed her record over the last four years and announced that, effective next month, she would reduce the amount that employers must pay into the state's unemployment insurance fund.
Mrs. Whitman, whose first public appearance with former Gov. Jim Florio occurred at a dinner held by the same group four years ago, underscored what is sure to become a familiar theme in the coming months, as she pursues a second term.
"This is where prospective governors come to make promises and sitting governors come to show what they've achieved," Mrs. Whitman told the 600 people at the dinner at a Princeton hotel.
She pointed to statistics that show job gains in the state and asserted that the tax cuts she promised to deliver during her 1993 campaign had enhanced the state's economy.
"I come before you as a governor who made promises and kept those promises," she said.
But Mr. McGreevey, a State Senator and Mayor of Woodbridge, discounted the idea that the 182,000 jobs created in the state under Mrs. Whitman had helped workers.
Citing a downturn in manufacturing jobs, he said New Jersey was "not keeping up with the rest of the nation."
The state's job growth has been primarily low-paying work in the service sector, he said. "We ought not to confuse a new job with a good job," he said. "Swapping high-paying jobs with benefits and a future for low-paying jobs without benefits and devoid of upward mobility is not a tradeoff we should accept."
Mr. McGreevey called on the business leaders to work with schools to develop job skills programs, and he also used the occasion to take some playful shots at his opponent.
"I want to congratulate Governor Whitman on her primary victory," Mr. McGreevey quipped. Mrs. Whitman ran unopposed in the June 3 primary, and Mr. McGreevey emerged by a narrow margin in a three-way race.
"I understand that Governor Whitman was already asleep while we were still waiting on the final results," he said.
With recent polls showing her comfortably ahead, Mrs. Whitman was beaming confidently on the dais throughout the evening, even when Mr. McGreevey was criticizing her administration.

HEADLINE: In Sink-or-Swim Welfare, Pensacola Staying Afloat

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: PENSACOLA, Fla.

 BODY:
As welfare programs across the country enter a new era of time limits, this sunbaked city of sailors and tourists has become the first place where limits have already expired and poor families are being dropped from the rolls.
After years of ideological debate, real-world experience has brought several surprises. So far, the two-year limits here, imposed under an experimental state program that predates the new Federal welfare law, have failed to serve as the motivating force that their supporters envisioned. The ticking clock has not pushed poor families to find jobs faster or leave the rolls earlier. 
 At the same time, however, the loss of benefits has not typically led to the deprivation that critics feared, at least not in the early stages. Most families initially land on their feet, and some former recipients even praise the cancellation of their benefits, saying it offered the motivation they ultimately needed to find a job.
Consider the journey of Denise Riley, a 39-year-old mother who spent two years insisting that she had a cancerous colon that prevented her from working. Her caseworkers asked for a doctor's letter. Ms. Riley failed to provide one. The two sides warred until last September, when her monthly $241 checks ran out.
And then what happened?
"I went to work a week later," she said cheerfully. "I had to."
Ms. Riley told the story at a naval-base pizzeria where even her part-time job stocking the buffet at $5.75 an hour pays better than her welfare check did. Though she still says she has cancer -- it is in remission, she says -- she calls the loss of her welfare check an unexpected blessing.
"It made me wake up and get my priorities back in order," she said. "I'll be honest: I might have leaned on that check a little longer."
Even the Pensacola program's most enthusiastic supporters say it is too early to call it a success. Only about 130 of the 2,700 families in the program have hit the time limit, and they come from that part of the caseload considered most ready to work, like those with a high school education or a history of employment. Those with greater problems face a three-year limit, which, for the earliest enrollees, has just begun to expire.
Still, however preliminary the Pensacola experience, it has taken some local advocates by surprise.
"We were really expecting an increase in homelessness, but there hasn't been the influx we were waiting for, at least not yet," said Anne C. O'Leary of First Call for Help, a referral agency for Pensacola families needing emergency aid. "I think it's kind of a sink-or-swim thing here, and people are paddling away. What we don't know is how long they'll stay afloat."
Indeed, the biggest questions center on the families' long-term prospects. Finding work is easier than keeping it, since children often get sick, child care arrangements collapse, cars break down, and layoffs arise. Ms. Riley is prone to bouts of depression that have cost her previous jobs, and even now she tries to steady herself by toting a Norman Vincent Peale paperback to work.
No one knows how well families will manage without the welfare safety net when setbacks do occur. Ms. Riley recently warned her mother, "Whatever I have to do to keep a roof over my head and keep my baby fed, I'll do it." When her mother said this would surely not include bank robbery or prostitution, Ms. Riley offered no assurances. "I said, 'Mama, whatever it takes.' "
What is more, Pensacola has created the Coupe de Ville of time-limited programs, going to an effort and expense that other places will not copy. Those chosen at random for enrollment find an approach rich in caseworkers, training opportunities and other enhanced services. In one case here, social workers spent more than $4,200 on taxi fares in a failed effort to help a car-less couple find work.
Shirley Jacques, the Pensacola program's director, warns that its most important features are already being sacrificed to budgetary pressures as the program goes statewide in compliance with the new Federal law.
"The intensive case management is the key," Ms. Jacques said, "and that's not going to be there."
 
2 Years Pass Faster Than Many Imagine
Despite those misgivings about the future, the encouraging start in Pensacola echoes optimistic findings elsewhere in the country. Spurred by tough new laws and strong local economies, caseloads are falling at unprecedented rates. And early reports from advocates or researchers in places as varied as Milwaukee, Pensacola and Des Moines have suggested that fewer people than many expected have fallen through the racks.
In Milwaukee, where the caseload reduction has been most dramatic, the city has not yet enforced time limits. Instead, it has created a strict work requirement that allows beneficiaries to stay on the rolls only if they join a work program, ending cash assistance if they do not.
The Pensacola welfare experiment, the Family Transition Program, enrolled its first participants in February 1994, long before the Federal law was enacted last year, making time limits of up to five years a national policy.
To the surprise of Pensacola officials, most recipients appear to have given the limits little thought. Those in the program are leaving welfare no faster than similar families in a control group with unrestricted benefits, according to the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, hired to study the program.
Those facing time limits do seem a bit more likely to work while they get welfare. But the differences are small: 46 percent of those in the program have jobs, compared with 40 percent of the control group.
Perhaps most important, the women whose benefits are limited are just as likely as others to have additional children.
"It's not stopping people from having babies," Ms. Jacques said. "That's real significant."
In a survey by the research group, only 40 percent of the caseworkers said they considered the time limits a "very effective" way to motivate clients.
There are several possible explanations.
Some recipients may be staying on the rolls to receive the additional services, like the chance to go to school. Others say they will not believe that the limits are real until they see friends being cut off.
Still others say they care more about food stamps, which are not subject to the time limit and which, in a low-cash-benefit state like Florida, can be worth almost twice as much as the cash.
Some researchers have speculated that setting a limit may paradoxically encourage people to stay on the rolls.
"It may be that the number sticks in people's minds: 'I'll stay on for two or three years,' " said Dan Bloom, the main author of a report compiled by the research group.
In a recent telephone survey, Mr. Bloom noted, only 44 percent of those facing the time limit said they planned to leave within a year, compared with 65 percent of those with unrestricted eligibility.
 
Scarce Understanding, But Bounty of Problems
While the recipients have mostly ignored the limits, the social workers have not. Many consider their reputations to be at stake, particularly since a panel of private citizens reviews each case in which the limit is reached.
"It really puts pressure on us to get them off," Ms. Jacques said. "When it was an entitlement, there wasn't any pressure."
At its best, that pressure focuses attention on women like Louise Armstrong, 49, who has been on welfare for most of the last two decades. A pleasant woman with a gold tooth that forms the silhouette of a champagne glass, Ms. Armstrong cares for a son and two young grandchildren, who call her Sweet Woo.
As soon as she was enrolled in the program, her caseworker was alarmed. With achievement test scores at the second-grade level, Ms. Armstrong has trouble simply understanding what a time limit means. "They say they're going to cut me off -- something like that," she said.
She also had a large hernia that developed after she had been shot by a former boyfriend, and doctors warned her to avoid work that involved pushing or lifting.
Hearing the clock tick, Ms. Armstrong's caseworker, Lynn Anderson, has poured countless hours into the case. First she recruited a medical specialist to operate on the hernia. Then she placed Ms. Armstrong in a workshop for the developmentally disabled. And she has even arranged three visits from the city bus authority, in what remains an unsuccessful effort to teach Ms. Armstrong how to ride the bus.
Worried because Ms. Armstrong has just 15 months of benefits left, Ms. Anderson is now helping her apply for disability benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program.
"This woman's problems would never have been identified under the old program," Ms. Anderson said. "She would have received benefits until her oldest child is 18 -- and then what?"
 
The Workings Of a City's Safeguards
For those who do lose benefits, the Pensacola program is noteworthy for the safeguards it has tried to include. The citizens' panel reviews each case that nears the limit, offering suggestions to caseworkers and participants. And the program has pledged a public job to recipients who cooperate by seeking work or training but who remain unemployed.
Forty-seven of the 130 people who have exhausted their limits have shown such cooperation. But to officials' surprise, not one has needed a public job. (The average unemployment rate here in Escambia County last year was 4.1 percent, compared with 5.4 percent for the nation.)
In addition, a child welfare specialist reviews each case that hits the limit, to determine whether the loss of benefits will create a risk of foster care. If so, the program can arrange for a "protective payee" to receive a reduced grant and monitor the family's use of it. Of the 130 families who have hit the limit, 3 have protective payees.
Among them is Mickey Parker, the landlord of a trailer park on the outskirts of Pensacola who is helping a former tenant. Mr. Parker had doubts about getting involved, because "you get yourself in trouble when you handle other people's money." But, he says, he felt sorry for his onetime tenant, because her former husband "beat her like a dog."
Though she has reached her limit on benefits, this mother of three still refuses to seek a job, because she does not want to place her children in day care. So Mr. Parker receives her $198 check.
"I give the money to her, and I follow up to make sure the bills get paid," he said.
He has even helped her find subsidized housing, and he provided the deposit she needed for a telephone. "Occasionally I've been known to reach into my own pocket, too," said Mr. Parker, who plays the role of good-hearted curmudgeon with evident relish. "The kids aren't doing without."
Given such precautions, Ms. Jacques said, none of the families that have lost their benefits have placed their children in foster care. But poor single mothers often make short-term arrangements -- landing part-time jobs, or moving in with relatives -- that unravel over time.
Indeed, a recent visit to Pensacola found at least one mother on the verge of losing her children, 11 months after losing her check. This 24-year-old mother, Tatashia Holley, makes no secret of her disdain for the experimental program.
"They just wanted people to go to McDonald's," said Ms. Holley, a high school graduate with three pre-school children. "I got too much pride for that. I didn't go to school for that stinking paycheck."
Ms. Holley declined to cooperate with caseworkers and lost her benefits last June, exactly two years after entering the program. At first, she had a safety net. With subsidized housing, she paid no rent. She earned about $40 a week baby-sitting for her sister's children. And she receives $400 a month in food stamps.
But she lost the child care job when her sister was laid off. And she left her rent-free apartment to live with her brother, who soon left her to live with a girlfriend. By this spring, she was so desperate for shelter that she moved into a dilapidated building that seemed less house than tree house.
The porch had all but fallen in. The walls had holes the size of footballs. Relatives were using the place as a drug den. And the electricity had been cut off.
"It was bad when I lost my check, but it just got real bad recently," said Ms. Holley, who initially declined to talk to a reporter, fearing he was a state worker who had come to take her children.
Convinced that she could no longer cope, Ms. Holley awoke on the morning of May 22 and decided to call the child welfare department herself, to place her children in foster care. At the last minute, her sister talked her out of it, emphasizing that Ms. Holley had hated her own years in foster care.
Instead, Ms. Holley persuaded her mother to care for the children, despite objections from her mother's boyfriend. But that plan too seems fragile. Within a week, her mother had become ill and returned the youngest of Ms. Holley's children, a 10-month-old boy named Kierre.
"I think we won't see the end result for a while," said Mary Allegretti, who supervises the program's child welfare reviews. She was speaking not only of Ms. Holley but also of the thousands of others who, exhausting benefits, enter the post-welfare world.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On the 25th anniversary of the Watergate break-in, let's imagine how today's very different media might cover the scandal.
The Miami Herald, after discovering in focus groups that readers are not that interested in national or world news, ignores the story, fearing it will turn off those looking for a pleasant reading experience. 
 U.S. News & World Report decides to put "Best Mutual Funds" on the cover instead of Nixon. Explaining this decision, the editor, James Fallows, says: "The Watergate story is just another case of the mainstream press putting tactics ahead of substance. Instead of worrying about the maneuverings of the White House staff, the news should treat the Presidency the way it does the scientific establishment, judging it by public pronouncements and not looking too far behind the veil."
ABC's "World News Tonight" plays the Watergate story third, after an in-depth look at how you can be fit even if you're fat and an expose about the American Kennel Club peddling pedigrees to undeserving dogs.

Bullets and Rockets Fly In Capital of Cambodia
Heavy fighting broke out in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, between bodyguards loyal to the country's feuding co-Prime Ministers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen. At least one person was killed and several were wounded, including an American journalist. The fighting was not directly connected to the reported confrontation between factions of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla leadership, in which the movement's founder, Pol Pot, is said to have killed a top aide, Son Sen.

Mr. TerreBlanche was released after his extremist supporters paid his bail in large bags of coins. A4
 
Japan Allows Organ Donations
Japan's Parliament approved a bill that would allow heart or lung transplants, but only in cases where the donor has given prior consent. The bill did not give a new legal definition of death, which in Japan has been understood to be the point at which the heart stops beating, making transplants impossible. The bill gives the donor's family the right to veto the patient's wish. A6

HEADLINE: G.O.P. IN SENATE OFFERS A MEASURE FOR CUTS IN TAXES

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
Less than a week after House Republicans pushed a package of tax cuts through their committee without a single Democratic vote, their Senate counterparts proposed a version today that the Clinton Administration said was a slight improvement but still tilted too much to the wealthy.
Although the Senate proposal addressed some of the concerns of the White House and Congressional Democrats, it did little to clarify the prospects for passage of a tax-cutting bill without a prolonged partisan standoff with President Clinton. 
 William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, included in today's proposal the main provisions that his party has promised for years, including a tax credit of up to $500 per child and a reduction in capital gains taxes.
But unlike Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Senator Roth appeared to have a good chance of winning some Democratic support. His bill has several measures favored by Democrats on the committee, including a plan to link the child tax credit to a college savings program.
In one indication of how Mr. Roth had wooed Democrats, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the Finance Committee's ranking Democrat, issued a statement listing 11 provisions that were included in the tax bill at his behest. They ranged from a permanent extension of the tax exemption for employer-provided educational assistance to additional financing for Amtrak and a reduction in the excise tax on draft cider sought by apple growers in New York and Vermont.
Democrats said they were unlikely to introduce an alternative to Senator Roth's bill in the Finance Committee, but left open the possibility that they might push for a vote on a competing plan when the measure reaches the Senate floor.
Administration officials said they were pleased that Mr. Roth had taken account of some of their concerns about the House bill. But they said the Senate proposal, which will be taken up by the Finance Committee on Thursday, remained unacceptable to them, largely because it would benefit the wealthy far more than lower- and middle-income people and because it did not provide as much in tax breaks for college as Mr. Clinton wanted.
Administration officials have stopped short of threatening to veto the legislation, but they reiterated today that they would demand substantial changes before the President could sign it.
"The Roth bill improved on the Archer bill in certain important areas," said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. "But having said that, we still have serious concerns with the Roth bill."
The Senate bill is likely to be amended somewhat by the Finance Committee, and it will no doubt face many attempts by members of both parties to amend it further when it reaches the floor. It would then have to be reconciled with the House bill, which is likely to face a vote on the floor next week. All the while, the Republican leadership will have to make delicate political judgments about how far they are willing to go in pursuing their own agenda at the risk of prompting a veto from Mr. Clinton and another partisan standoff.
The Roth bill differed from the House version in several important areas. Mr. Roth's bill allocates somewhat less to capital gains tax reductions than Mr. Archer's bill -- unlike the House bill, the Roth measure would not allow investors to factor out the effects of inflation in calculating their gains or reduce the capital gains rate for corporations -- but it provides more generous reductions in Federal inheritance taxes to business owners and farmer, and contains more measures to expand the Individual Retirement Account and similar savings programs.
Both the House and the Senate versions contain a $500-per-child credit for many families, but the Senate version would require parents to put the proceeds into an educational savings account for children 13 through 16 years of age.
Mr. Roth's bill does not include any version of a $10,000 deduction for college expenses that the President has fought for -- a modified and stripped-down version of the proposal was contained in the House bill -- but it has other provisions with bipartisan support, including making interest payments on student loans deductible.
In an effort to soften Mr. Clinton's opposition, Senator Roth expanded his original provision for a tax credit for the first two years of college. The credit is one of Mr. Clinton's priorities in the bill. He had initially proposed a credit of $1,500. Mr. Archer's plan scaled it back to 50 percent of up to $3,000 in tuition and book costs after taking account of financial aid. Mr. Roth's plan tracks the House bill, but adds a provision that the credit could be 75 percent of up to $2,000 in expenses -- or $1,500 -- for students at community colleges and technical schools.
While acknowledging Mr. Roth's compromises, Administration officials again argued today that both the House and the Senate bills failed to live up to the terms of the balanced-budget package agreed to last month by Congress and the White House.
Administration officials said the budget agreement explicitly provided about $35 billion for the President's package of college tax breaks over five years, while the Roth bill allocates less than $21 billion and completely strips out the Clinton plan to make up to $10,000 a year in college expenses deductible.
Treasury officials said their preliminary analysis showed that the Roth plan was skewed toward the wealthiest taxpayers, with the top 20 percent getting 65.5 percent of the tax cuts, and the top 1 percent getting 13.1 percent of the cuts. By contrast, they said, the bottom 60 percent of the population by income would get 12.7 percent of the benefits.
Republicans defended the plan as targeted toward helping middle-class taxpayers who most need relief from rising tax bills.
"Republicans, Democrats and President Clinton can all claim authorship for various parts of this proposal," Senator Roth said in a statement.
"This debate should not be partisan," he added. "It should not be about class warfare. It should be about working together to help the American taxpayers save, invest, pay for college and keep more of what they earn."

A comparison of the tax bill passed last week by the House Ways and Means Committee and its Senate counterpart, which was released today by Senator William V. Roth Jr. the chairman of the Finance Committee.
 
Tax Credits for Children
House -- A credit of up to $500 per child up to age 17, phased out for couples filing jointly with incomes above $110,000. The credit would be $400 next year, rising to $500 the following year. Many lower and middle income families who already claim the earned income tax credit or the dependent care credit would not receive the full child credit.
Senate -- A credit of up to $500 per child up to age 17 through 2002, and then up to age 18, subject to the same income limits as the House bill. For children aged 13-16, the proceeds of the credit would have to be placed in an educational savings account modeled on an Individual Retirement Account.
 
College Education
House -- For the first two years of college, a tax credit of up to 50 percent of $3,000 in tuition and book costs, after accounting for financial aid. Deductions of up to $10,000 a year for college costs when money is saved through several varieties of savings plans, and would allow penalty-free withdrawals from IRA's for college and graduate school.
Senate -- For first two years of college, a tax credit or up to 50 percent of $3,000 in tuition and book costs, after accounting for inflation, or up to 75 percent of $2,000 for costs of community or technical colleges. Would make up to $2,500 a year in student loan interest payments deductible for five years. Would create educational savings accounts and allow penalty-free withdrawals from IRA's college and graduate school.
 
Capital gains
House -- Would reduce the top rate for individuals to 20 percent from 28 percent and set a bottom rate of 10 percent. Would allow investors to factor out the effects of inflation in calculating gains starting in 2001. Would allow profits on sale of a primary home to be exempted up to $500,000 for couples filing jointly, $250,000 for single filers. Would reduce the top corporate rate to 30 percent from 35 percent.
Senate -- Would reduce the rates for individuals in the same way as the House bill, but would not allow indexing for inflation and would not reduce the corporate rate. Would include the same provisions as the House bill for sale of a home. Would also provide special capital gains reductions for small businesses and venture capital.
 
Retirement Accounts
House -- Would create new form of IRA open to taxpayers regardless of income level. Contributions would not be tax deductible, but would accrue interest tax free and could be withdrawn tax free after retirement or for buying a first home.
Senate -- Would expand income limits for traditional IRAs and would create new accounts similar to those in the House bill.
 
Inheritance taxes
House -- Would increase the exemption from Federal estate taxes from $600,000 to $1 million over 10 years.
Senate -- Would increase the exemption to $1 million over 11 years, and would provide an additional $1 million exemption immediately for many family-owned businesses and farms. (pg. D22)

HEADLINE: A Tragically Fallen Star Smolders in Memory;
Hollywood's Tryst With Dorothy Dandridge Inspires Real Love at Last

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
When Dorothy Dandridge played a 1953 engagement at the glamorous Mocambo nightclub in Los Angeles, cigarette girls sold copies of Charles Alfred Kinsey's "Sexual Behavior of the Human Female" as a publicity stunt. That was one small measure of Dandridge's phenomenal sultriness, thanks to her rare mix of poised elegance and voluptuous beauty. Reviewing her great triumph on the movie screen, The Hollywood Reporter put it succinctly: "Dorothy Dandridge in 'Carmen Jones' -- Wow!" Describing another of her nightclub appearances, Time said aptly that she "came wriggling out of the wings like a caterpillar on a hot rock."
Like her acquaintances Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner, Dandridge had allure that could bewitch an audience and demolish all memory of the nice girl next door. She had looks, talent, ambition, everything -- everything except a career. As an enticing black star of the 40's and 50's, she fell victim to bigotry, personal tragedy and one of Hollywood's great failures of imagination: after "Carmen Jones" in 1954, the year of Brown v. the Board of Education, there were no worthy follow-up roles for its incandescent star. She died at 42 in 1965, an apparent suicide, with $2.14 in the bank and much more than her share of regrets. 
 Adored in her day especially by black audiences ("She was our queen," said Nichelle Nichols, who later went on to "Star Trek" fame), Dandridge later fell into relative obscurity. "Carmen Jones" is a television perennial, and filmmakers including Spike Lee (in "Girl 6," whose heroine dreams of Dandridge as a role model) have offered glowing homages to her memory. But in David Thomson's "Biographical Dictionary of Film," an invaluable reference book with 1,000 entries, where the D's go deep enough to include Mark Donskoi, Basil Dearden and Harry d'Abbadie d'Arrast, she does not even rate a mention.
Now her memory is revived by "Dorothy Dandridge," Donald Bogle's splendid and highly readable new biography (Amistad Press), and by a two-week retrospective (enterprisingly programmed by Mr. Bogle and Bruce Goldstein) at the Film Forum from tomorrow through July 3. In charting the course of her life, both the book and the film series also offer considerable insight into the racial climate that shaped Dandridge's rise and fall.
And her story, which also has the makings of an extraordinary soap opera, will be heard again. Whitney Houston's production company is helping to present the series now that Ms. Houston has won a much-publicized battle for film rights to the biography. Others eager to star in the story reportedly included Halle Berry and Janet Jackson. (Among contemporary black female stars, it is Ms. Berry who comes closest to Dandridge's sexy insouciance and stately beauty.)
 
From Churches To the Movies
Dandridge's story begins at a time when no mass-market movie about an alluring, tragic black heroine would have been undertaken. Born in 1922, she grew up well aware of segregation thanks to her career as a singing child star. First as part of the Wonder Children and then with the trio called the Dandridge Sisters (only one, Vivian, was actually her sister), she performed on the church circuit and then at the Cotton Club, where black singers were instructed not to mix with white patrons. Pushing her vigorously into show business were her mother, the character actress Ruby Dandridge, and Ruby's female lover, who cruelly disciplined the children. Dorothy had two stage mothers.
As a young performer, Dorothy appeared in little films known as "soundies" that were made for video jukeboxes of the 1940's, with titles like "Congo Clambake" and "Lazybones."
This was also the time of so-called "race movies" for black audiences, made on low budgets with energy, unself-conscious attitudes and a surprising sense of freedom. (This era in black American film history is currently being explored at the Museum of Modern Art, with the May series "Within Our Gates: American Race Films 1918-1949" being reprised from June 24 through July 28. There will also be a panel discussion on June 24. And on June 28, the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, will revive a related artifact, the 1928 musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin.")
On the Film Forum's July 1 composite program billed as "Dandridge: The Early Years," her fresh, flirtatious talent is much in evidence. This show includes an incredible excerpt from the Sonja Henie musical "Sun Valley Serenade," in which the very white Glenn Miller Orchestra performs a sunny musical number in a ski lodge setting. Then, completely incongruously (so that the sequence could be excised by theaters in the South), out comes Dandridge in slinky black satin, beaming coyly and tap-dancing with the Nicholas Brothers as she asks the musical question, "Pardon me, boys, is that the Chattanooga Choo-Choo?" The Glenn Miller part of the sequence looks awfully Tyrolean next to that.
Dandridge went on to marry one of the brothers, Harold Nicholas, in a brief union that brought her lingering grief. She went into labor with the couple's only child, Harolyn, on a day when Harold rushed off to a golf game and left her stranded without car keys. The baby was born brain damaged, and, rightly or wrongly, Dandridge always ascribed the trouble to a delay in the baby's delivery. She was unable to raise her daughter herself and placed her in foster care. When, late in life, Dandridge became too impoverished to pay Lynn's expenses and the child became a ward of the state, it was one of the last and worst humiliations contributing to her decline.
But first came the glory days: nightclub triumphs (even in hotels that banned her from using their coffee shops or elevators), ardent admirers and increasingly interesting movie roles. She played a kindly, sensitive schoolteacher opposite Harry Belafonte in "Bright Road" in 1953 and then a year later floored both him and movie audiences with "Carmen Jones."
 
First Love, Then Isolation
This blazing colloquial adaptation of Bizet's opera (with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2d and Dandridge lip-synching wonderfully to Marilyn Horne's voice) holds up extraordinarily well thanks to Dandridge's prescient sexual confidence. Brazen, teasing and exhilaratingly free, she was a vision of womanly power well ahead of her time.
Always proud and even royally haughty, Dandridge loathed the flagrant way in which "Carmen Jones" was promoted. (Ad copy: "That man crazy, dazzle dancing gal -- sultry and savage -- incendiary -- whirling through a jungle world in Bizet's pulsing beat and blood-surging musical!") But she fell for Otto Preminger, the film's director, who had initially deemed her much too ladylike for the role.
Her long, surreptitious affair with Preminger was one of Dandridge's many liaisons with white lovers, romances that served to separate her from black Hollywood. (Eventually, she would contemptuously refer to her second husband, a white restaurateur who ruined her financial stability, as "the headwaiter.")
As a mocha-skinned woman whose features suggested Caucasian looks, Dandridge found herself ever more isolated as the civil rights and black power movements took on momentum. Nobody, black or white, seemed to know where she belonged.
She was nominated for a 1954 best actress Academy Award along with Audrey Hepburn ("Sabrina"), Judy Garland ("A Star is Born"), Jane Wyman ("Magnificent Obsession") and Grace Kelly ("The Country Girl"). And there were many who thought her Carmen deserved to win. (Kelly did.) But after that professional peak, there were surprisingly few job offers, and even those presented her with either supporting roles or characters of ambiguously mixed race. Politically aware and at times outspoken, she regarded the latter parts as demeaningly incomplete.
When Darryl F. Zanuck tried to coax her into the supporting role of Tuptim in "The King and I," Dandridge openly rebelled. "I can't play a slave," she said. And with that, she took on a reputation of being difficult and relegated herself to more iffy roles.
Splashiest among these is her performance in Robert Rossen's 1957 "Island in the Sun," a lurid tropical romance that stands out today for its currents of racial tension. There were open hints of attraction between characters played by Joan Fontaine and Mr. Belafonte. ("At least I have made them agree that Harry and I can drink out of the same coconut," Ms. Fontaine said.) But it took elaborate negotiations to allow for a scene in which John Justin, a white man, vaguely expresses love for the woman Dandridge played. A kiss was out of the question.
That same year, she wound up making "Tamango," an obscure French film that is this series's most interesting oddity, since it anticipates the blaxploitation era and plays upon Dandridge's own ambiguous racial identity. As the refined mistress of the white captain of a slave ship (Kurt Jurgens, another of her lovers), she is gradually awakened from her benighted ways and enlisted to join the brewing black mutiny on board. In this film and especially in the noirish 1960 "Malaga" with Trevor Howard, Dandridge's private evolution is evident on screen. The confidence and delight are on the wane, replaced by jaunting sadness and self-doubt.
There had been loose talk of a Dandridge "Cleopatra" and a Dandridge "Lady Sings the Blues" directed by Orson Welles. But roles like those proved tantalizingly unavailable, and professional disappointment only made her private problems more consuming.
 
Descending to Drink And Disappointment
She drank too much and took antidepressants, drugging herself so heavily that she fell asleep at the reception for her second wedding. The costs of keeping up glamorous appearances as a nightclub star became prohibitive, but economic pressures and problems with the I.R.S. forced her to keep working. Essentially shy and even reclusive, she had always hated the pressure to perform for live crowds.
By the end, she had been reduced to playing Anita in a Chicago company of "West Side Story" and auditioning for the role of a black sidekick to Debbie Reynolds's Singing Nun. (She did not get the part.) In an epiphany tailor-made for a movie biography, she appeared humiliatingly as a lounge act in a hotel that had once featured her in its main room.
Beautiful and relatively young as she still was, she reminded one suitor of Gloria Swanson in "Sunset Boulevard." As Mr. Bogle writes, "Her fall from grace oddly had made her all the more a haunting and romantic figure."
In better times, Dandridge said, "If I were Betty Grable, I could capture the world."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Real G-7's

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Tomorrow in Denver the Group of Seven major industrial democracies, along with Russia, will gather to discuss the global economy and any other issue they can rustle up to make their tired annual summit meeting seem relevant. The G-7 has to really scrounge for a role today because as a group it no longer represents the most important powers shaping the world economy. I mean, would you look to Canada for economic advice? Hockey yes, but not money. With that in mind, I offer my biennial listings of whom you'd invite to the G-7 if you weren't stuck with the U.S., Germany, Japan, Italy, France, Canada and Britain.
I. If you wanted to have a fascinating discussion about how the global economy really works -- but with all the participants wearing bags over their heads -- you would have the all-criminal G-7. After all, the lowering of borders and improvements in communications and financial transfers have made the movement of illicit funds and drugs some 8 percent of the global economy. "Crime has become the global growth industry," says Louise Shelley, an American University expert on global corruption. 
 A summit of the G-7-Most-Wanted would bring together representatives (and their lawyers) from the Russian-Ukrainian Mafia, the Chinese Triads, the Cali Cartel, the Mexican drug Mafia, the Nigerian Mafia (any government official would do), the Italian Mafia and the Japanese Yakuza. Heading the meeting (for a small fee) would be a representative of the Swiss banks who launder all their money (for a small fee).
II. A more legitimate gathering would be the All-in-the-Family G-7. It would discuss how some cyber-tribes, big billionaire families, now span the globe and are becoming as powerful as small countries. Around the table would be: the Wallenbergs of Sweden ($36 billion in Swedish companies alone), the Riadys of Indonesia (banking, real estate), Tata Sons Ltd. of India (80 companies, 250,000 workers), the Toyodas of Japan, Kim Woo Choong's Daewoo Group from South Korea ($52 billion in annual revenues), Mexico's Carlos Slim and family (telecom and retailing), with Rupert Murdoch as chairman. (No Americans in this group, but they all depend on our market and technology.)
III. If you insisted on inviting nations, you'd have the U.S., Germany, Japan and China. In addition, one chair would be shared by the world's three most dynamic regions: northern Italy, where entrepreneurs and manufacturers have created the richest district in Europe; Bangalore, India, the Silicon Valley of South Asia, and the Singapore-Malaysia-Indonesia high-tech triangle. The sixth chair would go to the Netherlands, where a novel deal between industrialists and labor unions has found a way to maintain many European-style social benefits while doing U.S.-style downsizing, privatizing and loosening up of labor rules. It's given the Dutch faster growth than Britain, France and Germany, with only 6.5 percent unemployment. The last seat would go to Chile, whose strong economy is a Dutch-like growth model for developing countries.
IV. If you wanted the rising economic powers you would invite Intel, whose chips are to the post-industrial revolution what coal was to the industrial revolution; Microsoft, because once it's done linking software, media, banking and the Internet it will play a role in virtually every human interaction; Cisco Systems, which makes the black boxes that tie the Internet together, and the more the Internet expands the more will Cisco; Citic, the state-owned Chinese trading company that has its finger in every piece of China's development, from airlines to telecom; and Unocal, the oil company whose foreign policy counts for far more in Afghanistan, Central Asia and Myanmar than the State Department's.
This group would also include an anonymous 23-year-old currency trader, who would sit at the summit table trading on a computer screen, never saying a word to anyone else. He would represent the brutal and anonymous disciplinary force of the global market, and he would short the currency or stock of anyone at the table who says anything bad about Alan Greenspan. He would have to share his chair, though, with a French truck driver, who would speak for all those workers who feel squeezed by globalization. The French trucker would insist the summit's sessions last only 90 minutes a day, with three hours off for lunch, and with all three days counting toward his pension.

HEADLINE: House Panel Says C.I.A. Lacks Expertise to Carry Out Its Duties

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency and the rest of the nation's intelligence services do not have "the analytic depth, breadth and expertise to monitor political, military and economic developments worldwide," a House committee that wants to increase intelligence spending reported today.
The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, whose chairman, Representative Porter J. Goss, a Florida Republican, is a former C.I.A. officer, said the intelligence services had "a largely inexperienced work force," often unable to speak foreign languages and unfamiliar with the countries they analyzed. 
 In addition, the committee reported, the agency has an "uncertain commitment and capability to collect 'human intelligence' on a worldwide basis through espionage." The panel said the United States should spend more money on that task.
The committee wants to increase secret intelligence spending by at least 5 percent, bringing it to more than $30 billion, several Government officials said. If approved by Congress, that would be the biggest budget in five years.
About one-tenth of the money goes to the Central Intelligence Agency and almost all the rest goes to military intelligence services like the National Security Agency, which spies on the telecommunications of allies and enemies alike; the National Reconnaissance Office, which builds spy satellites, and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which coordinates military intelligence.
The committee's annual report with its budget authorization for intelligence is classified, as is the budget itself, but the panel published an unclassified version of the report today. The report is a combination of scolding and encouragement -- a critique of the intelligence agencies' intellectual abilities and derring-do, and a spur to do better, with the help of more money. A C.I.A. spokesman said the agency had not seen the panel's report and could not comment on the criticisms it contained.
The report said the intelligence agencies continued to spend billions of dollars on advanced photo reconnaissance satellites and electronic-eavesdropping equipment, but lacked the brainpower to analyze the information collected by these technologies. A former director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Noel Gayler, has compared trying to get hard facts from the undifferentiated flow of data to trying to take a drink of water from a fire hose.
The nation "no longer needs, nor can it afford, to continue pouring vast amounts of money into expensive, high-tech collection platforms if the data collected is not exploited," the panel said. "Collecting information that is not processed and analyzed is a waste of taxpayer dollars."
The committee said it was "very concerned about the criteria and techniques used in the process of declassifying intelligence documents," because it feared that too much information might be released. Historians awaiting the declassification of intelligence records from the 1950's and 1960's have strongly criticized the slow pace of the C.I.A. in releasing those documents, which are supposed to be made public after 25 years.
But the intelligence panel said it was "highly skeptical that the true costs of declassification have been determined accurately." Those costs, it implied, can be measured in dollars and in the potential damage to national security from opening up the C.I.A.'s archives.

HEADLINE: The Endangered Bookshop

 BODY:
The demise at month's end of the Doubleday Book Shop on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street will leave more than a physical void. For upward of a century, midtown Fifth Avenue was the premier showcase of Publishers' Row. Generations of authors strove to appear nonchalant as they looked for their new progeny in the gleaming windows at Scribner's and Brentano's. No more. Soaring rents years ago doomed both bookstores, and B. Dalton as well. The corridor's sole survivor will soon be the giant Barnes & Noble outlet at 48th Street.
In this respect, Fifth Avenue resembles a hundred humbler Main Streets. Just over half of American readers now buy their books in chain stores. Out of some 30,000 American bookstores, chain outlets accounted for 13,500 last year, and their number is growing. Barnes & Noble, to cite the most visible example, has 439 "superstores" and 569 mall-based stores, and is planning to open 70 new outlets annually for the next three years. 
 Optimists point to the excellence of many superstores, with their seemingly huge stocks, coffee bars and regular readings by authors. Sprouting around these giants are new niche bookstores, catering to special audiences -- readers of mysteries, women's studies, New Age and so forth. Moreover, Amazon.com has sold books to readers through the Internet with enough success that the chains are now scrambling to sell their wares in cyberspace. Amazon not only sells obscure academic titles, but offers book reports by customers.
To pessimists, though, the real problem is the leverage that superstores exert on publishers by displays that concentrate only a few titles for a few weeks at the front of the store. If a book does not take off instantly, unsold copies will most probably be returned to the publishers, as happened to 35 percent of all adult hardcover copies last year. The system is good for celebrity books, how-to manuals and romance novels. It is not good for serious titles that sell fewer than 10,000 copies.
Moreover, booksellers worry that sales have not kept pace with a thriving economy, possibly because of competition from other media. Sales of hardcover books for adults fell 4.4 percent last year, while paperback revenues grew only 1.8 percent.
Independent booksellers complain that the playing field is not level, alleging that chains use their market share to obtain unfair discounts, a practice that has already provoked litigation. This is not simply a commercial concern, since books are essential to the nation's intellectual life.
It may well make sense to encourage the countervailing power of independent booksellers, in some cases with special concessions. Columbia University, for example, has helped establish Labyrinth Books, specializing in academic titles, by turning over 7,000 square feet of space at affordable rent. If other educational institutions emulated this benign synergy with commerce, it would sharpen competition and palpably benefit common readers everywhere.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Finds 'Pockets of Weakness'

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
A few "pockets of weakness" have emerged in the nation's booming economy, the Federal Reserve said today in a report presenting what analysts saw as fresh support for keeping interest rates steady.
In a survey of regional conditions and compilation of anecdotal reports from its 12 district banks, the Fed portrayed an economy shifting to a more sustainable pace after hitting a decade-high annual growth rate of 5.8 percent in the first quarter. 
 "All 12 district economies expanded in May and early June, although there were pockets of weakness," said the survey, known as the beige book because of the color of its cover.
Jobs are going begging and that is leading to some wage increases, but so far higher pay has not forced companies to raise retail prices, the survey said. "Retail and manufacturing prices were being held in check by heavy competition," it said.
The survey's comments about prices were echoed in a separate report from the Labor Department today that suggested strong productivity gains as a reason for the small increase in consumer prices.
In the first five months of this year, consumer prices have advanced at an annual rate of only 1.4 percent. Meanwhile, nonfarm productivity grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6 percent in the first quarter, double the 1.3 percent rate of the fourth quarter, the Labor Department report said. The 2.6 percent gain was revised from a 2 percent rise reported earlier. It was the best performance since a 2.6 percent gain in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Robust increases in productivity -- a measure of the time and effort of producing goods and services -- mean that businesses can raise wages without increasing their prices because workers are producing more in each hour of work.
The Federal Reserve's report appeared to support most economists' belief that Fed policy makers, due to meet July 1 and 2, won't need to quash inflation by dampening the economy with higher interest rates.
"It's clearly a signal for the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates unchanged in the near term," said Lynn Reaser, an economist with Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla. "It confirms other reports the economy is still growing, but at a moderate pace."
Fed policy makers nudged short-term interest rates higher on March 25 for the first time in two years. But, amid signs the economic growth was moderating, they did not touch rates at their May 20 meeting.
The beige book, based on information collected through June 9, found construction and real estate strong across much of the country, despite weak growth in some areas.
It said retail sales were weaker in many Fed districts but manufacturing remained at high levels and growing. That has resulted in some unwanted pileup of inventories, it said, noting a sizable rise reported by an auto manufacturer in the Chicago district. Ms. Reaser said the overhang of unsold goods should act as a brake on growth this summer.
At the same time, the beige book found many examples of the impact of the booming job market, which pushed the nation's unemployment rate to a near 24-year low of 4.8 percent in May.
Companies were having trouble hiring skilled professionals in the high-technology, construction and energy industries. And some districts -- Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco -- reported shortages of both skilled blue-collar and entry-level workers.
Temporary help firms in the Cleveland district have had to turn to marginally qualified workers and spend more on training. A Wisconsin contractor reported paying wages to an idle crew between jobs for three weeks just to avoid losing workers to competitors.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Some Slowdown in Growth Is Seen"
A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday.
 
Minneapolis -- Retail sales of cars and general merchandise were brisk. Unemployment rates remained low.
 
Chicago -- Most industries expanded moderately. Labor markets continued to tighten. Loan demand was strong.
 
Cleveland -- Construction activity slowed because of wet weather. Businesses reported labor shortages but little change in wages.
 
Boston -- Retailers and manufacturers reported sales growth and increased hiring. Prices were mostly stable.
 
New York -- Retailers reported slower sales, due in part to poor weather. Banks reported rising loan demand.
 
Philadelphia -- Retailers reported steady sales as factories noted increased shipments and orders.
 
Richmond -- Manufacturing and service sectors grow rapidly. Retailers reported rising inventories.
 
Atlanta -- Factory activity and demand at retailers weakened. Continued labor shortages reported.
 
St. Louis -- Car dealers and retailers reported slowing sales. Manufacturers reported moderate sales and job growth.
 
Kansas City -- Manufacturing remained strong. The only sign of weakness was a slowdown in construction activity. Labor was tight.
 
Dallas -- Labor markets were tighter, and the shortage of workers pushed wages up. Price reports were mixed.
 
San Francisco -- Growth was strong in most areas. Manufacturing remained strong, led by the aerospace industry. Companies reported widespread shortages of skilled labor.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Higher Despite Japan Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar dropped yesterday after a surging Japanese trade surplus was reported, but the United states currency recovered to end higher after top American officials hinted they would not confront Japan over the imbalance at the Group of Seven meeting in Denver this weekend.
Rising military tensions on the Korean peninsula and further indications that Europe's planned single currency will be a weak successor to the mark also helped the dollar. 
 "The dollar is now stuck in a tight range, and this lack of movement will continue toward the end of this week because everyone's anxious to see how the G-7 turns out," said Tatsuya Enomoto, chief foreign exchange dealer at Sumitomo Bank in New York. The Group of Seven major industrial nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
The dollar fell to an intraday low of 112.90 yen in early dealings before recovering to settle in New York at 113.65 yen, up from 113.31 Tuesday. The dollar settled at 1.7333 marks, up from 1.7308. The pound cost $1.6388, unchanged.
Data released by Japan's Finance Ministry overnight showed the Japanese trade surplus in May totaled an unexpected 738.27 billion yen, or $6.5 billion, tripling the level of a year earlier. The surplus with the United States nearly doubled to 322.87 billion yen, or $2.8 billion, the eighth consecutive monthly increase.
Jeffrey Frankel, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said such monthly statistics were misleading and did not necessarily signify a trend.
"The trade data has been pretty well discounted in the market," said Bill Bertha, foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
The dollar was also helped by a flare-up of antagonism between North and South Korea that raised demand for dollars as a safe haven investment. In an unusually strong statement, North Korea's defense ministry accused United States and South Korean forces of secretly planning for war.
Against European currencies, the dollar's strength reflected further indications that the European Union will have to loosen the strict criteria on deficit reduction designed to keep the euro strong when it makes its debut in January 1999.

HEADLINE: Security Is Tight for Denver Meeting of Industrial Nations

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, June 18

 BODY:
It sounds like a scene for pulp fiction: A week after a jury in Denver hands down a death sentence for the deadliest act of political terrorism on American soil, the same city is host to the leaders of eight of the world's most powerful nations.
Plausible or not, that is the real-life scenario faced by security planners as foreign leaders start converging here on Thursday for an annual meeting, this year called "The Denver Summit of the Eight." The Group of Seven leading industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- has invited President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to attend the meeting, and some people are now calling the gathering the "Group of Eight." 
 As eight-foot chain link fences and concrete barriers rose today around the downtown meeting site, security officials declined to detail their plans, much less draw links to the death sentence imposed last week by a Federal jury on Timothy J. McVeigh, the far-rightist convicted of carrying out the bombing that killed 168 people in Oklahoma City in 1995.
But although protests are planned by a plethora of groups, including a march by 6,000 Iranian exiles to demand a trade embargo against Teheran, official fears are directed at an algebra equation of the far right: "G8 = N.W.O.." In translation, the Group of Eight equals the New World Order, a phrase coined by President George Bush after the collapse of Communism that has become shorthand among militia and other conservative groups to refer to an elite, international cabal designed to oppress and enslave individual Americans.
"It sounds like the New World Order to me," James L. Pate, a Soldier of Fortune magazine editor with strong militia contacts, said today when asked about the summit meeting. "But have I heard any rumblings out in militia land? No, I haven't."
Still, without a lot of advance publicity, Denver's three-day summit conference does not seem to have registered on the radar screens of far-right radio commentators, who often claim the title of "patriots."
"I monitor the patriot reporting on shortwave radio, and, to my knowledge, there have not been any references to the summit," said Lawrence Myers, a free-lance writer on far-right groups.
Starting last winter, before the Oklahoma bombing trial began here, the authorities have paid close attention to far-right groups working in Denver.
In the spring, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation attended public meetings that John Trochmann, a founder of the Militia of Montana, a right-wing group, gave here. In May, The Denver Post reported that the F.B.I. had investigated attempts by this group to recruit new members among security guards at Rocky Flats, a former nuclear weapons plant in suburban Denver, where 14 tons of plutonium are stored.
In the most decisive action to date, on May 1 F.B.I. agents arrested three local men who claimed to be part of "the Colorado First Light Infantry, North American Liberation Army."
According to a Government inventory of material seized in the raid in Aurora, a Denver suburb, the three men stored in their house five illegal machine guns, 22,000 rounds of ammunition, a pipe bomb, a mortar, a hand grenade, 100 feet of fuse, and stocks of chemicals that could be used for making explosives, including ether and black powder.
As of today, bond had been set for only one man, Kevin I. Terry, 24. The other two men, Ronald D. Cole, 27, and Wallace Stanley Kennett, 33, are being held without bond.

HEADLINE: With 6,138 Lives, 'Cats' Sets Broadway Mark

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
Like Grizabella rising to the Heaviside Layer, "Cats" ascends to Broadway heaven tonight, when it overtakes "A Chorus Line" to become the longest-running show in Broadway history, with 6,138 performances.
The musical, which opened at the Winter Garden theater on Oct. 7, 1982, has been an audience favorite, seen by more than 8 million people in New York, roughly equivalent to the total population of the five boroughs. A financial juggernaut, with ticket sales totaling $329 million in New York, it was the first in a wave of megamusicals that reshaped Broadway in the 1980's, redirecting the Broadway market toward blockbuster hits and foreign tourism. It also made Andrew Lloyd Webber, the musical's composer, a global brand name and established Cameron Mackintosh, its producer, as a theatrical mogul. 
 Big, spectacular, laden with special effects and not dependent on stars, "Cats" has been presented and marketed from the outset as a special event. It was the first musical to develop an internationally marketed logo, the now-famous pair of yellow cat eyes against a black background, and it has never quoted reviews in its advertisements. The show itself is the star, and like a certain kind of celebrity, it managed to become not only famous but also famous for being famous.
" 'A Chorus Line' ushered in a new kind of American musical, and 'Cats,' in its own way, also gave us a new kind of musical, the pop opera," said Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, whose theaters have been host to both shows. "It has sustained the theater in this country in a very important way, especially outside of New York, and I hope it continues for a very long time into the future."
Along the way to its longevity record, which applies just to Broadway shows, "Cats" has piled up some big numbers. It has provided employment to 231 actors, two of whom, Marlene Danielle and Susan Powers, have been with the musical since it opened. (Nineteen cast members have died.) The magical tire that carries Grizabella heavenward has clocked more than 114 miles in its nightly voyage to the Heaviside Layer. "Memory," the show-stopping song that ends the first act, has been recorded by more than 180 artists. The New York production has used more than 1.5 million pounds of dry ice and 2,706 pounds of yak hair for wigs. It has sold 390,000 T-shirts, 130,000 sweat shirts, 147,000 lapel pins and 1.14 million souvenir books.
More seriously, "Cats" has pumped a lot of money into the New York economy. A recent study done for "Cats" by Audience Research and Analysis found that the musical had contributed $3.12 billion to the city's economy, most of it through foreign tourism, and more than $195 million in state and local taxes.
"Compare that to the economic impact of the World Series last year, which was $34 million," said George Wachtel, who carried out the "Cats" study and who has surveyed audiences at the musical over the years.
Outside New York, "Cats" almost single-handedly revived the sagging road business, which was suffering withdrawal pains as "Evita," "Annie" and "A Chorus Line" left the scene. The show has had four national touring companies. The remaining national tour, Cats National IV, has been on the road for nine years and traveled more than two million miles, returning as often as yearly to major cities like Atlanta. In North America, the road companies have grossed more than $400 million. Worldwide, the musical has grossed more than $2.2 billion and has played to more than 50 million people in 42 productions seen in more than 30 countries.
Tonight, "Cats" will celebrate its milestone with an early performance attended by invited guests, including Lord Lloyd Webber and Trevor Nunn, the show's director, as well as former cast members and employees. After the curtain rings down, actors and audience will pour out of the theater and onto Broadway, which will be closed between 50th and 51st Street, where the members of the original creative team will address the crowd.
The street party will conclude with a laser light show projected on the Winter Garden theater and a procession up Broadway and east to the Grand Ballroom of the New York Hilton, where the cast members, crews and personnel of all the shows on Broadway have been invited to a party.
Not everyone will be celebrating. When "A Chorus Line" swept into first place as the longest-running musical on Broadway, it displaced "Oh! Calcutta!" No tears were shed. But the thought of "A Chorus Line" slipping into second place is too much for some theatergoers.
"It's heartbreaking," said Gary Stevens, the co-author of "The Longest Line," a history of "A Chorus Line." "I can't believe it's becoming a reality."
Mr. Stevens has devoted much of his life to "A Chorus Line" since first seeing it when he was 12. He has transformed the foyer of his Manhattan apartment into a "Chorus Line" museum crowded with artifacts from the musical. He is taking the "Cats" triumph hard.
"I think it's a shame that 'Cats' is what's going to represent Broadway," he said. " 'A Chorus Line' was savvy and sophisticated, not flash and trash. 'Cats' is a theme park. It's all about branding and marketing."
That is a common assessment among the detractors of "Cats," and there are more than a few who see the "Cats" phenomenon as the theatrical equivalent of the rise of the megabudget Hollywood action film. For them, "Cats" is a soulless money machine.
Others disagree. "I refuse to believe that if it's as awful, boring and horrible as some people say, that it would have run 15 years,' said Ken Mandelbaum, the author of " 'A Chorus Line' and the Musicals of Michael Bennett." "By running so long, it has built up a certain resentment, but it represents a little more than the triumph of the megamusical."
"People forget, but it was an original and daring musical," he added. "Putting poems by T. S. Eliot to music was odd. You have to give credit to the composer for creating 25 songs about different kinds of cats. Not many people would be up to that."
For Ian Hamilton Fisher, whose musical revival series in London inspired the Encores! series in New York, the rise of "Cats" marked a turning point in taste. "It put to bed once and for all the kind of musical that fascinates me, and has made it difficult for more traditional book musicals to open and sustain a run," he said. "We can't really go back."
In the beginning, the smart money was not betting on "Cats." "We had almost everything going against us," said Lord Lloyd Webber, who proceeded to tick off the negatives: No one could see the future for a musical based on cat poems by Eliot. Mr. Nunn had never directed a musical. Neither Lord Lloyd Webber nor Mr. Mackintosh were the important producers they later became.
"We couldn't get the investment companies interested," Lord Lloyd Webber said. "People were intrigued by it, but the word around London was that the show was, to put it mildly, a risky enterprise."
For his part, Mr. Nunn felt like a man who had drawn the short straw. "I was cursing my ill luck," he said. "Hal Prince gets the show about a South American dictator and upheaval in an entire country, and the other fellow gets the crucifixion. I get to do a show about pussycats. I thought the best I could hope for was to avoid humiliation."
Soon after the show opened in London, Mr. Schoenfeld and his partner, Bernard Jacobs, were on the plane to London. "We saw it immediately and we wanted it immediately, Mr. Schoenfeld said. David Geffen, at that time the president of Geffen Records, became a co-producer of the New York version, supplying most of the $2 million needed to renovate the Winter Garden.
In New York, the show repeated the success and the pattern of the London production. Critics were lukewarm, but audiences embraced the show.
Writing in The New York Times, Frank Rich described "Cats" as a "collection of anthropomorphic variety turns" lacking in emotional power and devoid of ideas. He also predicted that it would linger long on Broadway. "Whatever the other failings and excesses, even banalities, of 'Cats,' it believes in purely theatrical magic, and on that faith it unquestionably delivers," Mr. Rich wrote. "Cats" went on to win seven Tony awards, including best musical.
Fifteen years later, a largely out-of-town audience with a large proportion of foreign visitors continues to buoy the musical, which took in $352,000 last week at the box office, a healthy number for a musical late in its run. Somewhere in the course of those 15 years, "Cats" became the musical that visitors to New York had to see. Some came to New York, in fact, with the primary purpose of seeing it.
Why?
Mr. Nunn and Lord Lloyd Webber listed several reasons. First, a lot of people like cats. Lord Lloyd Webber recalled being warned early in the development of the musical that half the world loves cats and half loathes them. "I said, 'I would be very happy to play to half the world,' " he said.
Then there's the source material. Eliot's "Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats" has enough literary quality to hold the attention of adults and enough whimsy and fantasy to charm children. "You must remember, we are dealing with fabulous pieces of verse," Lord Lloyd Webber said.
Mr. Nunn said: "It's very visual with some intellectual ingredient for those that want it. It's a very literate set of lyrics with all sorts of classical references, but it's immediately understandable."
Understandability is perhaps the most important reason of all. Mr. Wachtel said that his audience surveys had shown that about 80 percent of the "Cats" audience came from out of town, and 40 percent from outside the United States, with visitors from Brazil, Germany and Japan predominating. Even those who speak no English can enjoy the show.
Mr. Wachtel discounted the marketing explanation for the show's success. "All the marketing, hype and publicity in the world will not help if you don't have word of mouth," he said. "This show has, to an unprecedented degree, multi-generational and multinational word of mouth."
For Mr. Nunn, it has been a long, rather peculiar trip. "Anybody who does a musical in England never really feels they've done it until it goes to Broadway and survives or fails that test," he said. "That is the journey. Now, when I walk past the theater, with that big sign, I do feel a little strange at times, because it's so much a part of the New York landscape."

HEADLINE: Study Says Pataki's Welfare Plan Will Increase Deep Poverty

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 18

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's proposal to overhaul the state's welfare system, combined with stricter Federal welfare rules, would double the number of families living far below the poverty line, according to a study by Columbia University's School of Social Work.
Over five years, the number of families in the state living in deep poverty -- defined as an annual household income below 75 percent of the poverty line, or $9,975 for a family of three -- would rise to 290,000 from 140,000, the study found. 
 The report's conclusions are likely to give ammunition to local government officials and advocates for the poor, who say Mr. Pataki's plan would create greater poverty and shift the cost of caring for the poor from the state to local governments. The findings may also strengthen the hand of Democrats and some Republicans in the State Legislature, who have expressed grave misgivings over key elements in the Governor's welfare plan.
The study concluded that more than 48,000 families would be pared from the welfare rolls over five years, with about half taking low-wage jobs and the rest turning to their families or charities for help.
The Pataki administration dismissed the study, which used 1994 data, as faulty. The administration said that the population on welfare has changed since then, partly because of a steep decline in the welfare rolls. The administration also argued that economic opportunities for people coming off welfare had improved in the last three years.
"It's outdated," said Dan Hogan, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Social Services. "Our job is going to be a lot easier, because the remaining universe of welfare recipients is much smaller."
Mr. Hogan also said that the study failed to take into account an assurance that the Governor has made to local governments: if they spend more on welfare than their basic state grants will cover, the state will pay half the cost overruns.
Mr. Pataki's plan is intended to bring New York into compliance with the Federal welfare law enacted last year, which ends decades of guaranteed government help to the poor. The Federal Government no longer provides states with money based on the number of welfare recipients they have, but offers them fixed sums, called block grants, and gives them greater responsibility for tailoring their poverty programs.
The Governor's plan would make the most extensive changes in five decades in a system that serves 1.4 million welfare recipients, most of them in New York City. It calls for cutting cash benefits by 45 percent over five years for poor families with children. It would also abolish Home Relief, the state's own cash-assistance program for poor, childless adults, replacing it with vouchers for essentials like food, clothing and shelter. Legal immigrants and others who no longer qualified for cash benefits under the Federal law would be included in the voucher plan.
The authors of the Columbia report -- Jane Waldfogel, an assistant professor of sociology, and Irwin Garfinkel, a professor of sociology -- arrived at their projections through an analysis of Census and State Department of Social Services data.
The Columbia study looked at the families on public assistance in New York at the end of 1994, roughly 600,000; the number of families on assistance has since dropped to 446,000.
For those who remain on welfare, the study concluded, the situation will worsen largely because of Mr. Pataki's benefit cuts.
The Federal law alone would increase the number of families in the state living in poverty -- defined as an annual income of $13,300 or less for a family of three -- from 432,000 to 462,000 in five years, the study found. The Governor's plan would do almost nothing to mitigate that impact, resulting in 461,000 families living in poverty.
More striking, the study said, is the effect that Mr. Pataki's plan, combined with the Federal law, would have on the number of people living in deep poverty. The Federal rules alone would raise that number from 140,000 to 228,000, the study said, and adding the Governor's changes would push it to 290,000.
In New York City, the study said, the number of families in deep poverty would grow from 97,000 to 210,000.
The authors of the study contend that the problem lies in the central elements of the Governor's proposal: the voucher program and the cuts in cash benefits. The Governor would distribute $1.2 billion to the counties and cities for the voucher program, the same amount now spent on Home Relief. But the pool of recipients would be larger, swelled by thousands to whom the Federal law had denied cash assistance.
"The $1.2 billion would have to be stretched further, so everybody would end up getting less," Ms. Waldfogel said.
The Pataki administration dismissed this criticism, stressing that the Governor's plan requires the state to share any additional expense that local governments might incur beyond the $1.2 billion. But the study's authors argued that local governments, with budget woes of their own, were unlikely to spend more than their basic state grants.
The Columbia study also criticized the Governor's proposal to cut cash benefits for families in stages, so that in the fifth and final year a family received benefits, it would get 55 percent of the starting benefit.
Mr. Pataki and his aides contend that the cuts would be offset by allowing people to keep up to $1,080 a month from their salaries without deducting any portion of their welfare grants, thus providing an incentive for work. Currently, the state cuts benefits by one dollar for every dollar a household earns above $667 a month.
But the authors of the study found that while some families might lift themselves out of poverty by combining welfare grants and job salaries, the average family on welfare would lose between $500 and $600 a year because of the combined impact of the benefit cuts and other provisions in the Governor's plan.

A Columbia University study based on 1994 data predicts that Governor George E. Pataki's welfare cuts will increase the number of very poor people. Graph shows the households earning no more than $9,975, or %75 of the povery level, for 1994 and 1999 with and without Pataki's welfare cuts. (The poverty level is $13,000 for a family of three).

HEADLINE: How the F.B.I. Got Its Man, Half the World Away

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
Just before 4 A.M. on Sunday, five F.B.I. agents sneaked into a hostel in Afghanistan, where Afghan informants had told them they would find Mir Amal Kansi, one of the world's most wanted men, the suspect in a deadly 1993 rampage outside C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va..
Senior law-enforcement and intelligence officials said Mr. Kansi, who had been asleep in bed, drowsily answered the knock at his door, then spat out a stream of expletives when the door was flung open. 
 But he did not put up a fight as his flight from the law came to an end.
"Once he knew the jig was up, there was no resistance," one official said.
Later, after a grueling overland trip to Pakistan to an air base at an undisclosed location, the agents and their captive boarded an American military aircraft, painted in camouflage markings with an American flag on the tail.
Mr. Kansi switched from Pathan obscenities to polite English, the officials said. He had grown a beard since the attack, but when an agent showed him a wanted poster with his photograph, Mr. Kansi examined the clean-shaven likeness and said, "Yes, that's me."
Today Mr. Kansi, a 33-year-old Pakistani with a graduate degree in English and, the officials said, an unexplained grudge against the Central Intelligence Agency, was brought before a judge in Fairfax County in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. He was ordered held without bond by a judge in the shooting deaths of Lansing H. Bennett, a doctor, and Frank Darling, a communications engineer, both C.I.A. employees, on the morning of Jan. 25, 1993.
He did not enter a plea because does not yet have a lawyer.
The Afghans' decision to help the Americans ended a quest that had caused United States law-enforcement, intelligence and diplomatic officials years of frustration. And the capture of Mr. Kansi followed many failures, which were described by Government officials.
F.B.I. agents, some disguised in burkas, the head-to-toe gowns women wear in religious communities of the region, had been searching for Mr. Kansi to no avail in and around Quetta, Pakistan, his home town, on the Afghan border.
There was a bad tip that Mr. Kansi, whose name is also spelled Mir Aimal Kansi and Mir Aimal Kasi, had fled to Thailand in 1994. There was a botched raid four years ago, when Pakistani military and intelligence officials, acting on a equally bad tip from the F.B.I., stormed the homes of Mr. Kansi's family in Quetta. They came up empty-handed, but not before offending local political sensibilities.
But with the strange coalition of C.I.A. operatives, F.B.I. detectives, Pakistani spies and Afghan warriors on his trail, it was only a matter of time before the United States captured Mr. Kansi, Government officials said today.
The breakthrough in the hunt came about two weeks ago through the C.I.A.'s Near East division via the intelligence agency's station in Pakistan. The agents there had maintained some paid informants among the Afghan tribal headmen, guerrilla fighters, religious leaders and village elders it had supported in a $3 billion covert operation against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980's.
Mr. Kansi, Government officials say, spent much of his time as a fugitive moving from mud-walled fort to mud-walled fort among the many members of his extended family on both sides of the lightly policed border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Afghans in the border region, where the economy is largely based on opium and smuggling, knew Mr. Kansi from his travels through Spin Buldak, a depot town on the only passable road linking Quetta with Afghanistan.
Government officials said the Afghans decided to help apprehend Mr. Kansi in the hopes of a $2 million reward offered by the United States. The reward has not yet been paid, the officials said.
The Afghans put out the word that they could deliver Mr. Kansi to a hostel near the border. United States officials hinted today that Mr. Kansi was lured to the hotel by a ruse.
"I don't think he thought he was going to be arrested," said one official. "He showed up and we arrested him."
The exact details of Mr. Kansi's capture are being withheld by United States officials, who would not say precisely where he was arrested or disclose other details. Their demurrals, one official said, were mostly in deference to Pakistan, the staging area for the arrest. Pakistan is an Islamic Republic and its officials do not want to be seen by some of its citizens as Washington's ally.
Without Pakistan's cooperation, the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. could not have worked the case. But that cooperation followed some pressure brought to bear on Pakistan under a June 1995 Presidential Decision Directive, a secret order in which the United States resolved to "induce cooperation" from foreign nations where suspected terrorists and criminals reside.
The arrest lifted spirits at the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., two battered agencies whose past feuds are legendary. Today F.B.I. agents introduced to C.I.A. employees received a standing ovation -- probably the first time the bureau's agents had ever experienced such affection from their cousins at the intelligence agency.
The F.B.I. agents "put their lives on the line," the acting Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, told the audience gathered in "the Bubble," the C.I.A.'s auditorium. He also praised officers from the C.I.A.'s Counterterrorist Center and its Near East operations division for "a daring job well done."
As the C.I.A. officers applauded, Mr. Kansi was being arraigned a few miles away in Fairfax, Va. Wearing a dark green prison suit, he appeared for two minutes at the Fairfax County court house, where he told Judge J. Howe Brown that he understood the charges against him.
"Do you have a lawyer?" the judge asked.
"No, I don't," Kansi replied in faintly accented English. "I don't have money to pay the lawyers, sir."
Mr. Kansi, the son of a Pathan tribal leader who died in 1989 -- a death that some of his friends and relatives have said left him mentally unstable -- faces the death penalty if convicted on the murder charges.

HEADLINE: New Suitor May Emerge For Barney's

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
At least one new potential investor has emerged for Barney's Inc., the luxury retailer now in bankruptcy, including one whose most recent deals are far removed from the world of handbags and haberdashery.
The Texas Pacific Group, an investment firm with holdings in nursing homes, airlines, canned fruit and motorcycles, has expressed an interest in Barney's and has signed an agreement of confidentiality to review the retailer's books, people close to the creditors committee in the bankruptcy proceedings said yesterday. 
 The group, based in San Francisco and Fort Worth, is led by David Bonderman, an astute investor known for taking on an odd lot of companies through leveraged buyouts or recapitalizations. A spokesman for the group declined to comment.
The emergence of Texas Pacific as a potential investor changes the tenor of the bidding process for Barney's, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year and which just this week announced it would close four stores, including its original store at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street in Manhattan. Until now, parties that have expressed interest in Barney's have been other retailers, including Saks Holdings, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, and Dickson Concepts (International) Inc., which is based in Hong Kong and owns the Harvey Nichols store in London.
The winning bidder was expected to buy the company outright and run the Barneys stores as part of its own retail operations, extending at least part of its management team into the executive offices.
But a financial investor with deep pockets, like Texas Pacific, might be more likely to keep the Barneys stores as an independent retail operation and to hand over management to a fresh team, should it choose not to keep on Bob and Gene Pressman, Barney's co-chief executives.
Saks Holdings has offered $290 million for the company and Dickson Concepts has bid $240 million.
But those offers represent an outright purchase. A financial investor who is interested less in running the company than in owning a large chunk of it could put up the money to settle administrative claims and the like and convert some or all of the creditors' claims to equity. Some of the claimants could prefer that to getting a pounded-down recovery on their original investments or claims.
Unlike Saks or Dickson, which would probably look to create synergies with their existing stores, financial investors would most likely try to attract a highly regarded chief executive with a desire to run his own company, perhaps by offering an equity stake in the company. The ultimate exit strategy for such a buyer might be a sale or an initial public offering of a revitalized and growing concern.
Last week, in an effort to attract higher bids for Barney's, a bankruptcy judge approved a deal that would allow the retailer to offer an $8.5 million breakup fee to a potential suitor. The fee would be paid if a deal was reached but not completed.
This has brought out several new interested parties, the person close to the creditors committee said, including Texas Pacific, which recently put together $2.5 billion to go shopping with.
Just last week, Genesis Health Ventures Inc. said that it had agreed to buy the Multicare Companies for $1.06 billion in cash, with backing from Texas Pacific and another investor group. In April, the Belden & Blake Corporation, an oil and gas exploration and production concern, said it would be bought by Texas Pacific for $315 million in cash. In March, investors led by Texas Pacific agreed to buy the Del Monte Foods Company, the nation's largest producer of brand-name canned fruits and vegetables, in a deal reported to be worth about $800 million.
In October, Cagiva S.p.A. of Italy agreed to sell 51 percent of its Ducati motorbike division to the group. And in 1995, with another investment group, it bought Kraft Foods' caramel and marshmallow business.
But Mr. Bonderman is perhaps best known for his role as a principal of Air Partners of Fort Worth, which led Continental Airlines out of bankruptcy in 1993.
The diversity of Texas Pacific's holdings illustrates how the group's strategy, should it pursue a bid for Barney's, might differ from that of other bidders whose focus is the art of selling shoes and lipstick. For instance, while Saks would certainly look to get economies of scale with apparel vendors, it is unlikely that Texas Pacific would attempt to peddle marshmallows and pineapples off the fancy dishes in the Barneys housewares department.

HEADLINE: Goldman Profits Highlight Boom On Wall Street

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
The Goldman, Sachs Group yesterday reported a 19 percent rise in earnings before taxes to $1.52 billion for the six months ended May 31, highlighting the surge in profits that has flowed to Wall Street in recent years as brokerage firms and investment banks have moved to the forefront of the nation's richest companies.
Goldman's earnings dipped in the second quarter of this period as the investment firm was buffeted by the turmoil that hit financial markets in March and April. Nonetheless, Goldman, which is Wall Street's biggest private partnership, has improved significantly in recent weeks and appears to be on track to earn as much as $3 billion this year. 
 With such gigantic earnings, Goldman -- along with its big competitors like Merrill Lynch & Company and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company -- is securely placed these days among the nation's most profitable companies.
By comparison, Microsoft made annual profits after taxes of $2.2 billion in the year ended June 30, 1996. (Microsoft's pretax profits were $3.4 billion.) Unlike Microsoft, Goldman's earnings before taxes are the more important figure because its 190 partners settle their taxes individually. Merrill Lynch made net profits of $1.62 billion, and $2.6 billion before taxes, in 1996. The company with the largest overall profits last year was Exxon, which earned $7.5 billion on revenues of $119.4 billion.
In recent years, the stock brokerage business has been one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing industries in the country. John Keefe, an analyst at Keefe Worldwide, a financial consulting firm in New York, said that since the late 1970's, Merrill Lynch, the Travelers Group and other brokerage and financial companies have climbed into the ranks of the country's most profitable companies. He cited numbers from the Commerce Department showing the astounding rise in the profits of securities and commodities brokers over the last 20 years: in 1975 the industry made profits of $4.8 billion, and by 1994 that annual profit had grown to $69.5 billion.
The record results of Goldman for its first half are expected to be a harbinger of robust financial results from other Wall Street firms, which are to report their second-quarter earnings in the coming weeks. The newly merged Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, and Lehman Holdings Inc. will be the next to report second-quarter financial results. Like Goldman, their financial years end on Nov. 30. Most of the other big firms will report next month, as their second quarters end June 30.
As if taking their cue from Goldman's results, the prices for the stocks of Wall Street firms rallied late yesterday, with Merrill's shares rising $2.625, to $62.625, and Salomon gaining $1.625, to $58.25. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette rose $2.875, to $60.125, on continued speculation that it may merge or be acquired.
In its most recent quarter, Goldman's earnings before taxes fell 14 percent, to $610 million, reflecting the slower financial markets of March and April and a rise in expenses. Revenues for the firm's second quarter were $1.674 billion while expenses totaled $1.064 billion, compared with revenues of $1.67 billion and $961 million in expenses for the second quarter of 1996.
For the six-month period, Goldman's earnings of $1.52 billion on revenues of $3.63 billion compared with $1.27 billion during the corresponding period a year ago on revenues of $3.13 billion.
"It was not the best quarter, but it was a great half," John A. Thain, Goldman's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview yesterday. Wall Street, Mr. Thain said, currently has "all the positives you could want for in the financial industry." He listed low interest rates, low inflation, good company profits and positive market sentiment. "It's hard to imagine it getting much better," he added.
"The trading environment in March and April was somewhat slower than it had been," Mr. Thain said, but that "slowdown in customer activity has basically gone away -- stock markets have rebounded and then some."
The increase in Goldman's expenses, Mr. Thain and his colleagues said, was a result of the addition of several hundred new employees, giving the firm 9,500 employees.
According to the Securities Data Company, a statistics and research company, Goldman ranked second to Merrill Lynch as a manager of public debt and equity issues from Jan. 1 to June 16 this year, handling 492 issues worth $57.9 billion. It also led the rankings of firms managing initial public offerings and advising companies on mergers and acquisitions.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Gains Posted By Treasuries As Fed Buys

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices gained yesterday, as the Federal Reserve Bank entered the market as an active buyer while a survey of business conditions showed pockets of weakness. Investors saw the survey as further reducing the chances that Fed policy makers will raise interest rates when they meet in two weeks.
The price of the 30-year bond ended up 13/32, to 99 8/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.68 percent, from 6.71 percent on Tuesday. 
 The Fed's appearance as a buyer, called a coupon pass, was surprisingly large and drew buyers into the market. The Fed bought $1.64 billion of mostly two-year and five-year maturities with coupons running from June 1999 to May 2002. The Fed regularly makes such purchases to add money to the banking system.
But it was the Fed's survey of regional business conditions, known as the beige book, that chiefly bolstered bonds. The survey said that while all 12 Fed districts expanded in May and early June, "there were pockets of weakness." The survey saw labor markets tight, but with little or no wage pressure.
Bond investors saw the survey as providing more evidence that the economy was slowing. Most market participants expect the Fed will hold rates steady at the July 1-2 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making panel.
Still, "You couldn't call it broad- based participation," Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., said of the rally. "The beige book failed to present anything new that would keep the Fed from remaining neutral," he said. "It could have gone the other way, as the market chose to ignore some of the negatives and concentrate on the positives."
Increases in interest rates are expected for later in the year and into 1998 for two reasons, said the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting company in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. First, the second-quarter slowdown in growth is in all likelihood just a temporary pause, with growth likely to rebound strongly in the second half of the year. Second, and more significant, tight labor markets seem likely to result in larger wage increases and more rapidly rising labor costs, which are then likely to make their way into consumer prices and somewhat higher inflation.
As a result, WEFA forecast that the Fed's target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, will be increased to 6 percent from 5.50 percent by year-end and to 6.50 percent by the middle of next year.
Elsewhere, the Treasury announced the size of its two-year and five-year note auctions for next week. On Tuesday the Government will sell $15.5 billion of new two-year maturities and on Wednesday, $11.5 billion of notes with a five-year maturity. In when-issued trading ahead of the auctions, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.02 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.28 percent.
Today the Treasury will sell $13 billion of new one-year bills through auction. By late yesterday, the rate of a one-year bill was 5.32 percent.
In the municipal bond market, prices were little changed as states and local governments sold a total of about $2.3 billion of new securities, led by Los Angeles County's $1.3 billion of one-year tax and revenue anticipation notes through Merrill Lynch. The notes were tentatively priced to yield 3.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Southern Baptist Convention Calls for Boycott of Disney

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, June 18

 BODY:
The Southern Baptist Convention called for a boycott of the Walt Disney Company today to protest that the creators of Mickey Mouse and an animated Snow White have gone astray, profiting from a liberated Ellen and offering health benefits to employees' homosexual partners.
Reinforcing an initially proposed boycott of only the company's theme parks and stores, the 12,000 delegates here voted to shun the entire Disney empire, including movie studios, cable television channels, book publishers, trade magazines, newspapers, television and radio stations and the ABC network. 
 Gay rights groups called the measure an attack on homosexuals that would fail, while Disney said only that the company was dedicated to providing family entertainment.
Southern Baptist leaders at their annual convention here pointed to their numbers, with their 15.7 million members forming the nation's largest Protestant denomination. They said they had focused on Disney because it had moved away from the wholesome entertainment it once, under its founder, provided.
"When Disney crosses to the other side of the street, there's a sense of betrayal and outrage," said Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist morals and ethics panel, which has monitored Disney since the convention issued a warning last year. "You can't walk the family side of the street and the gay side of the street in the Magic Kingdom at the same time."
Disney, one of the largest communications companies, is only one of many corporations providing benefits to gay partners. But Baptist leaders also pointed to violence in Disney movies like "Pulp Fiction" and sex on its screens large and small.
ABC's brassy staging earlier this year of Ellen DeGeneres's coming out as a lesbian while her "Ellen" sitcom character came out as well rallied gay groups but further provoked the Southern Baptists.
Mr. Land said Disney and his organization had had little direct contact. "On good days they ignored us," he said. "On bad days they contemptuously gave us the back of their hand."
The Southern Baptists are growing rapidly outside their home region, diversifying to include black and Hispanic congregations, but individual congregations are not required to follow the convention's lead.
Even as the communications giants, concentrated on the coasts in the nation's largest cities, have become more accommodating to gay issues, the Southern Baptists have affirmed their convictions about homosexuality.
"We believe homosexuality is a choice and that it's a bad choice," Tom Elliff, the Southern Baptist Convention president and pastor of the First Southern Baptist Church of Del City, Okla., said in an interview. "But as with all bad choices, there's hope and help in Christ."
Mr. Land said the impetus for the boycott came from Florida, where the values of Hollywood and mid-America collide. Disney World "Gay Days" organized by homosexual groups aroused Baptist rancor, although the company has said it had nothing to do with the gay events.
"When you got 1.6 million Southern Baptists in Florida in close juxtaposition to 80,000 gay and lesbian people at the theme park, you got an explosion," Mr. Land said.
Mr. Land and his committee recommended a narrower boycott as easier to explain and enforce. To inform delegates about all they should boycott, the convention handed out a list with more than 100 properties, including the Walt Disney and Miramax studios, the ESPN and Discover cable networks and dozens of trade journals.
Several delegates who favored the broader measure said it might be symbolic most of all.
"Will a Southern Baptist boycott change the Disney company?" Lisa Kinney of Largo, Fla., asked the convention. "I don't know. But it will change us. It will affirm to us and the world that we love Jesus more than we love our entertainments."
Although the convention's vote was so overwhelming that no count was taken, dissenters included Jim Henry, the convention's immediate past president and the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Orlando, Fla. In Disney World's home, his church has hundreds of Disney employees as members.
"If you're the people who are going to boycott us, don't talk to me about coming to church," Mr. Henry recalled some of his members as saying.
Gay rights groups said the boycott was out of touch with most Christians, who favor toleration, and might even backfire.
"What we're challenging is their use of economic power to bully a company into discriminating," said David M. Smith, senior strategist for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay political group. "This would be a good time to go to Disney World or Disneyland if you're planning a vacation."
The boycott plans appeared to at most nick Disney's stock, which fell 1 1/2 points to 82 1/2 today as the broader market also dropped.
Tom Wolzien, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, called Disney an easy target but added that a boycott was unlikely to succeed. Mr. Wolzien said he had organized focus groups in which religious conservatives said they resented some Disney subjects.
"But on the other hand," he added, "they were having a heck of a time telling their kids they couldn't take the trip to Disney World."

The chief Republican tax writer in the House dropped a provision today from his tax-cutting bill that had drawn heavy criticism from Democrats, saying he hoped the Clinton Administration would offer a compromise in return and help avert partisan warfare over the plan.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he would delete a measure that would keep some low- and moderate-income taxpayers from receiving the full benefit of a proposed $500 per child credit if they also claimed a tax credit for child care expenses. 
 Mr. Archer said that he hoped the White House would respond by dropping its opposition to a measure that would limit the benefits of the child tax credit for many families with incomes from $16,000 to $25,000 a year. Mr. Archer said the White House should also agree to have the $500 tax credit cover children up to the age 17, instead of up to 13 as the Administration originally proposed.
Although they welcomed some aspects of Mr. Archer's statement, neither the White House nor Congressional Democrats let up in their attacks on Mr. Archer's bill and a similar Republican proposal being taken up by the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.
"It seems the Republicans are having trouble fulfilling promises made to their wealthy constituents and still trying to look good to average, hard-working people," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.
The Democratic attacks centered on how Mr. Archer's proposal would affect people claiming the earned income tax credit, which is designed to reduce tax burdens of low- and moderate-income working people.
Families with income in the range of $16,000 to $25,000 often have little or no Federal income tax liability after claiming the earned income tax credit. Mr. Archer argues that the $500 child tax credit should be granted only to offset an actual Federal income tax liability.
The Administration is demanding that the full child credit be granted to families who have no Federal income tax liability after claiming the earned income tax credit, even if it means the Government would actually pay them the money.
"Writing Government checks to people who don't pay taxes means taking money away from people who do," Mr. Archer said in a letter he sent today to President Clinton. "I don't believe middle-income taxpayers support such a proposal."
Administration officials welcomed Mr. Archer's decision to drop his link between the child credit and the child care credit, and they said they had already decided to support an expansion of the child credit to cover teenagers. But they continued to demand that the child credit plan be revised so it would benefit people receiving the earned income credit.
"These are the working families with children that are trying hardest to get financial security and find a secure place in the middle class," said Gene Sperling, the chairman of the White House's National Economic Council. "The child credit should be designed to help them, not single them out to get no relief."
Administration officials said Mr. Archer should instead drop his proposal to cut the alternative minimum tax for corporations by $11 billion over the next five years. They said he should use the $11 billion instead to extend the child credit to teen-agers and to remove the limit on the child tax credit for people claiming the earned income credit.
