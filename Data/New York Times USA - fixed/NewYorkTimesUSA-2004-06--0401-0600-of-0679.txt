HEADLINE: Courts Plan to Waste Less of Jurors' Time

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Since 1995, when automatic exemptions for jury duty were lifted, the reverse Darwinism of picking juries in New York has been slowly ending. 
 The hapless or the unemployed are no longer the ones dragooned onto juries, but everyone is summoned and may be called -- rich and poor, doctors and journalists, even the occasional state legislator.
 Yesterday, the other shoe of jury reform dropped. A special commission recommended changes that addressed a single issue: now that everyone serves, how can the state stop wasting jurors' time? 
 The commission -- which reports to Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, who has been pressing for jury reform -- recommended several proposals, including one that would provide subway and bus passes for jurors or parking near the courthouse that was free or discounted. 
 Another proposal would offer free Internet access for jurors stuck in a hot, airless courthouse. Still another would let jurors awaiting a trial leave the courthouse if they are not needed, as long as they agreed to be available by cellphone or pager and could return within two hours.
 Under another proposal, lawyers could be penalized for ''multiple unexcused latenesses,'' a common juror complaint. A suggestion that is expected to draw some criticism would require a settlement conference in all trials before jury selection could begin.
 ''The commission heard testimony that some parties, particularly those represented by insurance carriers,'' the report said, ''do not engage in serious settlement discussions until they see the whites of the jurors' eyes.''
 Mark C. Zauderer, chairman of the Commission on the Jury, a 29-member group, told reporters, ''We don't believe citizens should be pawns in the process.'' 
 The report is available online at www.nycourts.gov/press.
 Unlike the first phase of jury reform, most of the proposals can be put in place by the courts without legislative approval, the chief administrative judge, Jonathan Lippman, told reporters yesterday.
 One proposal needing legislative approval has already been passed, he said, and is being considered by Gov. George E. Pataki. The bill increases the time between jury summonses to six years from four years and as long as eight years for jurors who served in long trials.
 One significant earlier proposal, all but banning the sequestration of juries, was opposed by the court officers union because it hurt members' overtime. The proposal passed when other overtime opportunities were found.
 This time, Dennis W. Quirk, president of the New York State Court Officers Union, described all of the commission's proposals as excellent, except one.
 ''When it comes to parking,'' he said, ''my members come first.'' Mr. Quirk noted that two-thirds of the system's 4,500 officers -- the police of the courthouse -- work in New York City. 
 ''They need to work on the court employees' parking problems,'' he said, ''before they need to work on the jurors' parking problems.'' 
 While much of the commission's plan does not require legislative attention, it may get it anyway. State Senator John A. DeFrancisco, a Syracuse Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he did not like the requirement of a settlement conference before jury selection.
 ''It's just another useless meeting,'' Mr. DeFrancisco, a trial lawyer, said.
 The commission did not offer proposals to solve one of the biggest objections to jury duty. More than 600,000 potential jurors show up every year, yet more than 80 percent are never chosen. 
 The principal reason, the commission found, is prosecutors and defense lawyers need as many as 90 in the pool to select 12 jurors and a few alternates. Both sides in a trial, including civil cases, typically prefer having large jury pools, the commission found. New York State allows some of the highest number of challenges to jurors of any system in the country, as many as 20 for the prosecution and for each defendant in the most serious felonies.
 The commission found no solution to this issue. ''A certain amount of discretion'' has to be left to lawyers, Mr. Zauderer, the commission chairman, said.
 One of the biggest deterrents to jury duty may be insoluble. 
 ''The building conditions of courthouses are horrendous,'' Mr. Quirk said. ''They're dirty, they're decrepit and the air-conditioning doesn't work properly. The court is not a pleasant place to be.''

HEADLINE: Budget Talks Between Mayor And Council Go Nowhere

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Negotiations on a city budget for next year have hit a snag over roughly $350 million that the City Council wants to add to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's $46.9 billion spending plan, officials on both sides of City Hall said yesterday.
 Talks between the Council and the Bloomberg administration broke up on a sour note, with representatives of each side expressing frustration over the other's bargaining positions. The Council is focusing on restoring much of the $220 million that the mayor proposes to cut from current spending levels, and adding another $129 million for seven-day library service, smaller class sizes, legal aid for the poor, day care and job training for the long-term unemployed. 
 Council officials said that while those initiatives make up the core of their spending priorities, the number of programs to be financed, and the dollar amounts involved, remain highly fluid and could change by the time a budget agreement is reached.
 After yesterday's conclusion of talks among staff members for the Council and mayor, Councilman David I. Weprin of Queens, chairman of the Finance Committee, said it was unlikely a deal could be struck before the State Legislature adjourns next Tuesday. Albany's adjournment looms larger than usual this year because the mayor needs state approval of his plan to give a $400 property tax rebate to homeowners, and he would prefer to have it before the Legislature recesses, although the city can still adopt a budget and secure the state approval later.
 Reflecting the tensions surfacing in City Hall, Mr. Weprin also said the Council was prepared to adopt its own version of a city budget, without the mayor's ideas, if necessary. A spokesman for the mayor, Edward Skyler, discounted that possibility, saying, ''We continue to believe we'll have a budget by the end of the month, so that won't be necessary.''
 One reason for optimism that a deal could be reached soon is that, aside from the dispute over spending, the Council has all but agreed to the mayor's plan for a property tax rebate, although council and administration officials say it is possible that the amount could be shaved from $400 to about $375 or $380. The money saved would help finance a tax credit for the working poor favored by the Council speaker, Gifford Miller. Embracing the rebate means the Council would effectively jettison Mr. Miller's alternative proposal for a 2 percent across-the-board property tax cut.
 Budget negotiations have moved slowly in recent weeks, as council members tried to winnow down a long list of spending priorities.
 For instance, the council members Lewis A. Fidler of Brooklyn and Gale Brewer of Manhattan are among many pushing for $30 million to expand hours of service for public libraries. But both have other priorities as well: Ms. Brewer wants $4.5 million for a housing program to help low-income tenants facing eviction, and Mr. Fidler has asked for $3 million to open a new shelter for runaway and homeless youths.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Greenspan Term

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17 

 BODY:
The Senate late Thursday approved President Bush's nomination of Alan Greenspan to serve a fifth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. The approval came on a voice vote. 
 It came hours after the Senate Banking Committee endorsed the nomination, with only Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, voting against. 
 Mr. Greenspan, 78, has guided the Fed since 1987, when he was chosen by President Ronald Reagan to succeed Paul A. Volcker. 
 Friends say Mr. Greenspan has told them he plans to serve less than half of the new four-year term, choosing to retire on Jan. 31, 2006, when his separate 14-year term as a Fed board member is to end. That decision would give the next president the chance to select Mr. Greenspan's successor.
 Senator Bunning said he opposed the nomination because he believed that Mr. Greenspan did not move quickly enough to lower interest rates in 1992 and 2000. Senator Bunning also said he objected to Mr. Greenspan's voicing opinions on subjects outside of the Fed's jurisdiction, like tax and budget issues.

HEADLINE: How the Holy Warriors Learned to Hate

BYLINE: By Waleed Ziad. 
Waleed Ziad, an economist consultant, contributes to The News, a Pakistani daily.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
''Afghanistan is no longer a terrorist factory sending thousands of killers into the world,'' President Bush announced on Tuesday, as he stood in the White House Rose Garden next to his Afghan counterpart, Hamid Karzai. And, true, Afghanistan has been a success story, at least compared with Iraq. Still, the offensive against militants who fled into northwestern Pakistan continues, and Osama bin Laden remains on the lam. Achieving lasting peace and democracy in this trouble spot will take more than Special Operations troops -- we must gain a far better understanding of the militants and their motivations. 
 A good place to start is a hand-scrawled inscription I saw on a crumbling wall in a border town in northern Pakistan that read, ''Jihad of the sword, like prayer, is a religious obligation.'' Most Westerners probably assume that this is an ancient dictum -- and I bet the man who wrote it did, too. But the fact is, the slogan was conjured up no more than 25 years ago. 
 Here's the point: contrary to popular theories, the fight against militant religious groups in South Asia is not a clash of age-old civilizations or a conflict between traditionalism and modernism. Rather, it is a more recent story of political ineptitude and corruption, and of a postcolonial class struggle between the disenfranchised poor and these countries' elites. 
 The story begins early in the 19th century, in the religious schools called madrasas. For centuries under India's Muslim rulers, madrasas were centers of learning, open to all classes, concerned with teaching law, the sciences and administrative subjects. As British rule grew stronger, however, a system of colonial education was established for wealthier, urban children. Its purpose, as Lord Macaulay put it in 1835, was to create ''a class of persons Indian in blood and color but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and intellect.'' 
 The madrasas were sidelined and many leading scholars, or ulema, were persecuted. In Delhi, madrasas were razed. It was left to the urban and rural poor, neglected by the colonial schools, to support the increasingly decrepit madrasas. The curriculum shrunk, and by the mid-20th century most taught only the rote learning of scripture and a dogmatic version of Islam.
 During this period of degeneration, several schools of thought aimed at educational revival emerged, the largest being the Deobandi school, in 1867, and the Barelvi school later that century. Over time, these apolitical movements not only established madrasas but became de facto representatives of self-declared religious groups. Various factions -- representing Sunnis, Shiites and radical Wahhabists -- began to enter politics. Still, there was no real concept of a ''religious'' political party.
 Throughout the 20th century, the leaders of these groups desperately tried to enter the political mainstream by jumping onto any ideological bandwagon, but none ever secured more than a handful of National Assembly seats. When India was partitioned in 1947, the major Deobandi party in Pakistan, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, began to call for ''Islamization'' (a mysterious term no one quite knew how to define at the time). 
 The party initially demanded new laws -- based on false scriptural readings -- covering superfluous issues like women's dress, and bans on interest and popular entertainment. In the 1950's, its catch phrase was ''Islamic Constitutionalism''; by the 1960's, it was ''Islamic Democracy''; and in the early 1970's ''Islamic Socialism.'' By the end of that decade, it was back to ''Islamic Democracy.'' In any case, no slogan translated into a mass following. The leadership engaged in occasional diatribes against rivals religious sects or alcohol, but foreign politics and militancy barely entered the ideological equation. 
 So where did the ''Islamic'' political parties and their militants emerge from?
 The turning point was the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The West and its allies decided the best resistance to Moscow would come through presenting the war as a religious struggle. While Pakistani religious leaders had little political power, they did have considerable influence over the madrasas in Pakistan's northwestern frontier region and in Afghanistan. Even the most benign found this to be an opportunity to finally win recognition (and a fortune), and they set up their own militant subsidiaries. Madrasas were converted overnight into training grounds for mujahedeen. In exchange for political power and global recognition, these impoverished students readily became cannon fodder in Afghanistan.
 Of course, the eventual Soviet withdrawal meant an end to all that Western attention and money. The mujahedeen needed a new cause. International events -- including the Persian Gulf war and the Palestinian intifada -- provided one: hatred of America. An ethnic Pashtun militia, which metamorphosed into the Taliban, provided a rallying point for the unemployed mujahedeen. The rest is history. 
 Today, Western politicians, academics and intelligence experts continue to search through the annals of history to determine the sources of this jihadist mindset. But the truth is, it is just another ideology adopted by so-called religious parties in the former British Empire for short-term political gains, and fueled by the frustrations of a disaffected lower class.
 To battle this phenomenon, then, we need to open a new front on the war on terrorism. Permanently dislodging these extremists calls for educational, economic and cultural development. A first step should be working with Afghanistan and Pakistan to move the focus of the madrasas away from holy war. Equally important is providing more Western money for new schools to provide functional education, coupled with real economic opportunities for graduates. Education and jobs, not rooting out some faux-religious doctrine, are the means by which the disenfranchised may be brought back into the fold. 
 Considering the vast populations of the underclasses in these countries, changing their lot may take longer than war, but it would be cheaper and is the only long-term solution. And in doing so, America would be seen not as an occupier but as a purveyor of prosperity, winning the hearts and minds of generations to come.

HEADLINE: Plan for Indian Casino Splits Illinois Town

BYLINE: By JO NAPOLITANO

DATELINE: LYNWOOD, Ill. 

 BODY:
A Wisconsin Indian tribe's proposal to build what would be the largest casino in Illinois -- a windfall that the mayor and a local congressman are eager to have -- is drawing ire from some local residents, who are organizing to oppose it. 
 Ann De Boer said the proposed casino would shatter her home's tranquillity. The casino, part of a sprawling entertainment complex to be built on 432 acres that now hold farms and single-family homes, would abut her three-acre property on two sides. 
 ''It will bring in transient people, so you won't feel as safe,'' Ms. De Boer said on a recent afternoon. ''We love it here. It's very peaceful. The casino will change all of that.'' 
 But Lynwood, a racially and economically diverse suburb of 8,000 people 28 miles south-southeast of Chicago, is hard up for jobs, and while some might prefer another employer, the entertainment complex is the only big business eager to come to town. The tribe that has proposed it promises 5,000 jobs, with an average annual salary of more than $45,000. 
 ''We're struggling,'' Mayor Russell Melby said of Lynwood's financial status. ''This would be a big economic engine for us.''
 The facility, proposed by the Ho-Chunk Nation, a tribe that has already built several casinos in Wisconsin, would include a water park, an 8,000-seat amphitheater, four restaurants, a nightclub, an Indian cultural center and a museum. But the most contentious part of the proposal is a 220,000-square-foot casino that would have 3,000 slot machines and 100 gambling tables. That would dwarf the state's nine riverboat casinos, which by law can accommodate only 1,200 gamblers each.
 The Ho-Chunks, formerly known as the Winnebagos, are a sovereign nation based in Black River Falls, Wis., and as such they do not have to apply for a state gambling license or adhere to any state restrictions. Instead they must deal with the federal government, and they have already had some success. 
 Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois, said he supported the plan and would submit a bill calling for the parcel to be placed in a federal trust. That would allow the Ho-Chunks to retain proprietary management of that land and to build a casino. If Congress approves Mr. Jackson's proposal, the tribe may then approach Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich to work out the details. 
 If the governor rejects their request, the Ho-Chunks can appeal to the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, which would then determine whether the proposal was in the best interest of the tribe and the surrounding community. The tribe, which has already bought up almost all the land, is pursuing both routes. 
 A spokeswoman for the governor said he had not yet reviewed the Ho-Chunks' proposal.
 Riverboat owners cringe at the notion of the Ho-Chunks competing for what is now their business. 
 The Ho-Chunk Nation would have tremendous advantages, they say. It would have no limit on the number of gambling positions, would not have to adhere to state regulations and would not pay taxes, allowing it to put more money into advertising and promotions, luring customers away from two nearby riverboats.
 The Rev. Tom Grey, executive director of the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, said he was troubled by the proposal for different reasons. Mr. Grey said he was worried about an increase in vice. 
 ''I think they are in for a hard fight,'' he said. ''This is an addictive product that has a cost to it. And who pays for that? The taxpayers.'' 
 Some local residents share Mr. Grey's concerns and have established a group called Citizens for Our Community. A recent group meeting drew some 700 people. Among them was Carl Smits, a 35-year-old farmer who lives four miles from the site of the proposed casino. 
 ''It's bringing our youth into close proximity to gambling and setting them up to be gamblers when they grow older,'' Mr. Smits said in a telephone interview.
 But Tom Vierk, 71, who owns a bowling alley here, said he welcomed the jobs that the casino would bring, and he dismissed claims that it would promote gambling addiction. After all, he said, there are several casinos nearby in Indiana; why not keep those dollars in Illinois? 
 ''If you go to Indiana,'' Mr. Vierk said, ''all you'll see are Illinois license plates.''

HEADLINE: Current Account Deficit Grew to a Record in the First Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The current account deficit widened to a record $144.9 billion in the first quarter as companies imported more to meet the demands of a stronger economy, the Commerce Department said in Washington yesterday. 
 The deficit, the broadest measure of trade because it includes investments, comes after a $127 billion gap in the prior three months. Imports to the United States are rising after the economy grew 5 percent in the first quarter from the period a year earlier, the biggest increase since 1984. The nation has to borrow about $1.6 billion a day from foreigners to finance the current account shortfall. Failure to do so would cause the value of the dollar to drop and interest rates to rise, economists said. 
 ''Over time there may be a lack of confidence on the part of foreigners that the U.S. will be able to pay back these ever-widening deficits,'' said John Shin, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. Until then, ''the U.S. is still widely perceived as the place to invest, and there isn't much competition from the rest of the world.'' 
 Economists had forecast a first-quarter deficit of $141 billion, according to the median of 42 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey, from an initially reported $127.5 billion shortfall in the last three months of 2003. The previous record deficit was $138.2 billion in the first quarter of last year. 
 The deficit reflected a wider trade shortfall in goods and services, a decrease in net income receipts and an increase in net transfer payments. 
 A deficit in the balance of trade accounts for about 94 percent of the current account shortfall. Americans imported $136.9 billion more goods and services than they exported in the first quarter compared with a $125.5 billion trade gap the previous three months. The trade deficit widened to a record $48.3 billion in April on record imports of cars and consumer goods, the Commerce Department reported this week. 
 ''If the trade data for April is any indication, there is no sign the current account deficit will be narrowing,'' said Lara Rhame, a senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.

HEADLINE: Soft Financing Causes Arts Groups to Make Hard Choices

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The Oakland Ballet has canceled its 2004 fall season. The Nebraska Repertory Theater will perform ''Lend Me a Tenor'' instead of a newer, more experimental play. The Santa Fe Opera has sold land.
 Arts organizations are scrambling to keep themselves afloat. While theaters, ballets, museums and operas perpetually live hand to mouth, as do most nonprofit groups, fundamental changes in the nature of arts financing suggest that they will continue to struggle even as the economy and capital markets recover.
 ''The traditional combination of government, foundation and corporate funding is pretty much shot,'' said Robert Marx, vice president of the Fan Fox & Leslie R. Samuels Foundation, which supports performing arts. ''The only area with some potential for growth right now is wealthy individuals, and they are all feeling besieged.'' 
 States, staggering under enormous budget deficits, have slashed their total appropriations for the arts 39 percent this fiscal year, to $272.4 million from a high of $446.8 million in 2001.
 Mergers and acquisitions have also reduced corporate financing, as has an emphasis on using corporate philanthropy more strategically to promote business.
 Foundation endowments have begun to recover, but foundation grant-making has changed and is now emphasizing measurable results. This trend often favors organizations, like those in health care and education, that can demonstrate in numbers the effects of financial support.
 Income from ticket sales and admissions fees has also been weak.
 ''I don't want to make it sound worse than it is, and we're all just guessing what the impact will be over time,'' said Alberta Arthurs, an independent arts consultant who formerly ran the arts program at the Rockefeller Foundation. ''But I think there is reason for the arts to be concerned.''
 Last month, San Francisco's arts organizations were shocked when Mayor Gavin Newsom announced that he planned to cut support for the city's symphony, ballet, opera and museum of modern art by 25 percent to help close a looming deficit.
 ''We certainly knew the city was grappling with a budget problem because in many ways the challenges it faces are mirrored by what many arts organizations have experienced,'' said Brent Assink, executive director of the San Francisco Symphony. ''But we didn't expect this.''
 The cuts will eliminate a little more than $200,000 from the symphony's budget. Over the last few years, Mr. Assink estimated that the symphony has lost $500,000 in support from foundations and corporations at the same time that its costs, particularly for health insurance, have increased.
 Arts organizations have become accustomed to shrinking government support. ''There's a triage going on here,'' said Lee Halterman, president of the Oakland Ballet in California. ''Code blue is feeding people and taking care of them medically. Education funding is the equivalent of stopping the bleeding. There are just lots of competing claims on government budgets and philanthropists.''
 The ballet's problems began in late 2002, when its production of ''The Nutcracker,'' year in and year out a stable source of income, brought in only 40 percent of projected revenues, resulting in a $300,000 deficit.
 The next year, revenue from the state, foundations and ticket sales all fell. The state cut its support by roughly 87 percent, to $2,000, and one of the ballet's biggest foundation supporters, the David & Lucile Packard Foundation, was forced to cut off the Oakland company completely as its endowment slipped to less than $5 billion from a high of $13 billion. Last year Packard spent only $4.4 million on arts organizations; in 2001 it gave them almost $15 million.
 The ballet's corporate support, however, has increased with the addition of board members who work for Kaiser Permanente and Chevron, and the organization has hired a fund-raiser to help it cultivate individual donors. ''The company did not have a history of going after personal contributions,'' Mr. Halterman said, ''and that support should be dramatically higher than it is.'' 
 But the ballet's experience with corporate donations runs counter to that of other arts groups. In addition to a shrinking number of potential donors, corporate financial performance has been weak until recently, and companies, like foundations, are directing their philanthropy ever more strategically. 
 CliffsNotes, for instance, was a staunch supporter of the Nebraska Repertory Theater until John Wiley & Sons bought the business five years ago. Then Home Services of America Inc. acquired two local real estate companies that had traditionally bought evenings at the theater for their best clients; Home Services did not continue that practice.
 Jeffery Elwell, the theater's executive artistic director, said its corporate support had dropped 75 percent since 2000, even more than state support, which is down 15 percent. 
 But the theater's earned income has also slipped. Sales of season tickets have dropped 30 percent, and sales of individual tickets, 10 percent.
 Historically, about 5,700 people have bought tickets to the annual musical that is jointly produced by the theater, the University of Nebraska's music school and the Lied Center for Performing Arts. Those sales have produced a $20,000 profit that is split three ways.
 But only 4,000 people saw this year's production, ''Guys and Dolls,'' and there was no profit.
 This led to the decision to offer ''Lend Me a Tenor'' instead of spending money on a new production. ''The financial situation has a whole host of effects that go beyond the institution,'' Mr. Elwell said. ''It affects actors. It affects directors. It affects new works, which won't be produced because they aren't a safe bet financially.''
 Many arts organizations have relied on one-time rescue measures to stave off deficits. The board of the Santa Fe Opera was largely responsible for helping it avoid a $500,000 deficit last year, when members contributed roughly $150,000 to help the company out of its straits. But the opera also had to sell a piece of property, reluctantly dipping into its assets. 
 Many arts organizations in New York and California -- states that together received about 30 percent of what foundations spent on the arts in 2001 -- say that they are now receiving less from these sources.
 In New York City, at least, that reduction will probably be offset by a proposed 10 percent increase in the city's cultural budget to $103.5 million, a figure that the City Council might even raise. But the city's arts organizations, among the wealthiest cultural groups in the country, still contend that that is not enough to ease the pain inflicted by weak endowments, donations and revenue. 
 Michael Janeway, the director of the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, is worried that foundation support for the arts will not recover, even if their endowments do. ''They all want to say the market improvement will improve their endowments and lead to more grants, but they're all under pressure from their boards to show more bang for the buck, to show measurable results,'' he said. ''It's going to be harder for them to measure results in our field.''
 Other shifts have also occurred. In 2001, for instance, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, established by the Knight family of the Knight Ridder newspaper chain, changed its approach to arts financing, so that decisions about its spending in the 26 cities where Knight Ridder has newspapers are directed by community leaders rather than by the foundation and its board.
 In Philadelphia and Detroit, money from the Knight Foundation has been directed at increasing access to the arts, while in Charlotte, N.C., and San Jose, Calif., its grants have gone to encourage joint marketing programs for local arts organizations. 
 Knight has continued two national arts programs: a retreat for 15 symphonies that encourages them to share experiences and an art-lending program in collaboration with Pew Charitable Trusts.
 ''I don't know that our total giving to the arts has shrunk as much as we've just changed the way we distribute it,'' said Bud McKnight, the foundation's spokesman.
 At the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, arts grants were cut by half in 2002, partly because of a decline in its endowment but also because the foundation added another program area (child protection) and began supporting the museums opened in Ms. Duke's various houses, as mandated in her will.
 ''That was a pretty precipitous fall,'' said Olga Garay, the foundation's program director for the arts, ''and since then it hasn't recovered, even though the stock market has improved a bit, because the drop wasn't entirely due to the stock market. I'm hoping we'll be able to add a million or two as the years go by, but I don't think it's ever going to get back to where it was.'' 


CORRECTION-DATE: July 3, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in Arts & Ideas on June 19 about choices faced by arts groups because of reduced financing misstated the name of the spokesman for the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. He is Larry Meyer, not McKnight; Bud is his nickname.
 The article also misstated the number of Knight Ridder daily newspapers and of those in cities where the foundation makes contributions. The chain has papers in 21 of the 26 cities where the foundation makes contributions; over all, it has daily newspapers in 28 cities.
 The article gave an outdated title for Michael Janeway, who expressed concern over the decline in foundation support. He is the former director of the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia. (The current director is Andras Szanto.)

HEADLINE: In Chicago, Hometown Support for the Airline but Doubts About Government Aid

BYLINE: By JO NAPOLITANO

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 18 

 BODY:
For some it is a workers' issue. For others, it is a hometown issue. And for even others, the question of a loan guarantee for United Airlines is an issue the government should stay out of. 
 While some say United, a unit of UAL, deserves government assistance because it is making substantive improvements, others say the company, which is based in Elk Grove Township, has long been mismanaged and needs to work out its own problems. 
 Critics of the company say the government has already spent billions of dollars helping the airline industry recover after the Sept. 11 attacks and that the bailouts should stop. 
 Craig Johnson, the mayor of Elk Grove for eight years, said he supported the government's decision to deny the loan guarantee. He said that many of his 35,000 constituents are United employees or retirees and that they are tired of seeing their wages and retirement funds dwindle as the company continues to flounder. 
 ''You can't throw good money after bad,'' he said. ''I'm glad to see that the federal government woke up. I don't think we should be using taxpayer money to bail them out.''
 Mr. Johnson said the company's priorities were ''out of whack'' and that United was too eager to expand at the expense of its employees. 
 ''We have a saying around here: pensions before pavement,'' he said, describing the community's disdain for United's desire to grow before taking care of its current and former employees.
 Keith, a United Airlines baggage handler who refused to give his last name, said that his salary had dropped to just more than $21 an hour from more than $25 an hour because of the company's financial turmoil. Still, he does not think the federal government should step in. 
 ''It wouldn't be fair to American or Delta,'' he said, standing inside O'Hare International Airport on Friday afternoon. ''I'll just have to wait and see what happens.'' 
 But the airline has a loyal following among Chicagoans who hope the company can become financially viable again. They say United provides generally good service and is a Chicago staple worth saving. 
 Matthew Gilson, a photographer headed to Michigan on Friday, said he was troubled to learn the loan request was denied. 
 ''It's the same reason you develop an allegiance to a hometown baseball team,'' he said. ''It's a family issue in the broader sense.''
 James Balodimas, a photographer also headed to Michigan, said the government should not be financially responsible for an individual company's economic woes. 
 ''If you make your bed, you've got to lie in it,'' he said, looking out onto a long line of passengers at United's ticket gate. ''It's not like people have stopped flying.''
 But Evan Turek, a food engineer and frequent United customer, said the loan denial was a hard blow that was undeserved. 
 ''I'd like to see the airline recover from bankruptcy,'' he said, standing in the baggage area at O'Hare. ''The employees have taken great efforts to keep the company solvent. If federal loan guarantees would help them, that would be a good thing.'' 
 Allen Holste, who flew on United from Knoxville to Chicago on Friday afternoon, said the government had set a precedent of bailing out troubled companies, including Chrysler, so it would be inconsistent to treat the airlines differently. 
 ''But then again, you have to wonder, where does it stop?'' said Mr. Holste, as he stood at baggage claim, hoping the airline did not lose his luggage. ''Does the little guy who runs the grocery store down the street get the same thing?'' 
 James Petri, who worked for United Airlines from 1952 until 1997, said that although the company has had a checkered past, it deserved the government's help. United employs tens of thousands of people, so it is important for it to survive, he said. 
 ''I wasn't surprised that they were not going to get it, but I was disappointed,'' said Mr. Petri, 70, who worked as a manager for technical support and disaster recovery. 
 Mr. Petri follows United closely because it controls his retirement package, which already took a hit of $310 a month because of the company's financial shortcomings. The union agreed to another reduction last week and Mr. Petri does not know what that could mean for his retirement plan. Still, he remains optimistic, hoping the airline might cut back on its less-profitable endeavors and stop reducing employee pay and benefits. 
 ''United has made some bad decisions over the years,'' he said. ''But it looks like with some changes, they are turning things around.''

HEADLINE: In a Digital Era, the Darkroom Is Fading as a Photographic Hub

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
In the tradition of the Rolodex, the vacuum tube and the roll-film camera, the communal darkroom -- a Manhattan institution that has long sustained a subculture of professional photographers and print-making artists -- is yielding to the digital imperative.
 After 17 years, the Latent Image Workshop Inc., with its 23 rent-by-the-hour darkrooms, will close its doors by the end of the month. Other rental workshops are losing business or scrambling to upgrade their digital services to survive.
 To regulars who practically lived at Latent Image, this imminent shuttering marks the end of an era. 
 ''For 150 years, photography remained pretty essentially the same, and the darkroom was a critical part of it all,'' said Jessica Burstein, who, as photographer for the various ''Law and Order'' television series since 1994, printed all her pictures and title shots at Latent Image. But now, thanks to digital technology, ''we are at the last generation of film photographers,'' she said. 
 Some called the lab, with its eau-de-darkroom raffishness, home. ''I was around almost every day,'' said Carol Fonde, a photographer and printer. In the early 1990's, she began using Latent Image to make exhibition-quality prints of work by Richard Avedon, Bruce Davidson and Gilles Peress. 
 Professionals and amateurs alike once swarmed to the workshop, on the fourth floor of 135 West 26th Street. Open 11 hours a day every day, it rented 12 color and 11 black-and-white darkrooms for $10 to $11 per hour. 
 The staff customized the clients' setup of photographic chemicals (the pungent developer, stop bath and fixer) and offered darkrooms with enlargers, red safe-lights, timers, easels and work tables. 
 But the social interconnection meant as much as the service. ''It's a shame that the place is closing -- it had a good vibe,'' said Jim Megargee, a darkroom practitioner and teacher who was a personal printer for Annie Leibovitz. 
 Only four years ago, reservations had to be made days in advance, regulars said, and the staff seemed in perpetual motion. ''You could never get a table here, photographers were fighting for space,'' said Dominick Avellino, a freelance photographer, printer and designer. 
 Ed Young, who opened Latent Image in 1987 with David Wong, said that after Sept. 11, 2001, business declined as the economy did. ''Then that Christmas,'' he said, ''digital cameras were the No. 1 holiday gift.'' 
 As more photographers bought into digital technology -- or were forced to adapt by their employers -- darkrooms began to go dark. ''Ultimately,'' Mr. Young said, ''we decided to close, rather than struggle through the summer.'' 
 When she read the lab's recent Dear John letter to clients, ''I was shocked, very upset,'' Ms. Burstein said. ''I started crying, actually.'' 
 Until the digital revolution, the alchemy of image-making required that art photographers invest hours in the lab as they orchestrated the full complement of tones, colors and visual elements animating each individual print. Making just one perfect print could, in fact, take a day.
 ''The chemicals make the average person sick, but photographers love the smell of them,'' Mr. Megargee said. ''They love the physicalness of touching the paper and handling the chemistry.'' 
 The communal print-washing pans and the color-printing setup at Latent Image ''made it possible for you to see other people's work,'' Ms. Burstein said. ''You could be fabulously inspired by it, or feel jealous when someone else printed very beautifully.'' 
 Sometimes perfectionist lab rats hung there from opening to closing time. Blinking in the light, photographers and printers bonded; networking flourished. Business cards were exchanged. Jobs were brokered. Girlfriends and boyfriends were acquired and reacquired.
 And despite intense competitiveness in the profession, information and advice were freely shared. Ms. Fonde, who these days teaches at Parsons School of Design, conducted color-printing seminars for others at Latent Image. 
 ''I was very confused when I started color printing, but Carol held my hand,'' said Ed Watkins, who specializes in photographing works of art for clients like the Knoedler & Company gallery and the Frick Museum. ''When Carol would say things like 'this is too cyan,' I could begin to get it,'' he said of a bluish hue. 
 Some competitors of Latent Image are suffering as well. Patricia O'Brien, president of Photographics Unlimited Dial-A-Darkroom Inc., said business ''has really tanked this year.'' 
 ''We'd been seeing the competition from digital for a while,'' she said, ''but at the first of this year, digital caused a major downturn.'' 
 Gerard Franciosa, owner of My Own Color Lab, said that his company had kept customers by focusing on the quality and low cost of traditional chromogenic prints, or C-Prints, since high-quality digital prints are still very expensive. 
 Another competitor, the Creative Darkroom, has already added six digital workstations to its 17 conventional darkrooms. ''You can make digital a problem,'' said Beth Schiffer, the owner, ''or you can make it an opportunity.'' 
 But Mr. Megargee argued that ''the overall quality of digital is inferior,'' adding: 
 ''The tonal range and the resolution are not as fine as in traditional film. The silver emulsion gives a three-dimensional quality that digital cannot match.'' 
 And Mr. Hutchinson noted that digital photography was still more expensive than conventional photography. ''But when the digital quality goes up and the price goes down,'' he said, ''that might be the end of conventional photography. We have five years left.''
 The digital trend has affected other photographic businesses. Mr. Megargee said his 15-year-old, custom black-and-white film laboratory, MV Labs, which did not rent its facilities to others, had taken a digital hit, ''and in terms of dollars, it has cut in pretty heavily.''
 Leonard Kamsler, a freelance photographer who shoots both digital and film images, said that ''the professional labs are dying off,'' adding: ''The smart ones have moved into digital services. Otherwise you're on the mule-drawn plow -- and everyone else is on the tractor.'' 
 Many who have made the digital transition, like Mr. Kamsler, are happy to have stepped out of the darkroom. ''You can do a lot more with Photoshop than you can with a darkroom,'' said Mr. Kamsler, referring to a software program. ''But, of course, there are the diehards who are the equivalent of the high-fi enthusiasts who insist on vacuum tubes.'' 
 Mr. Avellino is one of them. ''I am the kind of guy who, when I went to buy a saute pan and I could only find the nonstick coating, I was upset,'' he said. ''I shoot film.''
 And looking forward, Mr. Megargee hopes that the darkroom will endure. ''Platinum printing is still around, despite the convenience of silver printing,'' he said. ''What we do in the lab here, in 15 years, may be a very specialized area, like platinum printing. But it will still be viable. I don't see the craft not being here.''

HEADLINE: New in Liberal Arts: Intro to Job Market

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Matthew Santirocco is a scholar of ancient Greek and Latin poetry, and a strong advocate of the liberal arts. But as dean of the College of Arts and Science at New York University, he is also under siege from parents paying mammoth tuition bills who want to make sure their children will land the right jobs.
 So, in a concession that would have been unlikely 20 years ago, Dr. Santirocco has begun to invite liberal arts students to sign up for vocational courses in N.Y.U.'s School of Continuing and Professional Studies. 
 They will not dilute their liberal arts studies, he says, since they will not receive credit toward their degrees. But he expects the program, ''Professional Edge,'' to help prepare students for the job market. An art history major, for example, might learn how to appraise art. A foreign language student might take courses in how to become a translator. 
 ''I don't want to sell out the liberal arts to vocationalism,'' Dr. Santirocco said. ''But then, I say, I'd like to do add-ons, create some interschool programs.''
 N.Y.U. is one of a growing handful of colleges and universities taking this approach; still others are talking about it. After years of sending students out for internships to give them a taste of a possible career, college officials are beginning to look for ways to turn their faculty and classes to bolstering the career prospects of their liberal arts students. 
 The phenomenon takes many forms. Some universities, like the University of Southern California and Columbia, are letting students take career-oriented classes in their professional schools -- classes on finance or public health, for example -- and giving them academic credit. N.Y.U., which already allowed liberal arts students to take courses in its professional schools, is now also letting students take classes at its School of Continuing and Professional Education to provide even more specialized vocational classes. Colgate will be offering introductory career courses during vacations. And the University of Virginia, which had offered a postgraduation immersion program in business in the summer, began offering similar courses during the school year last fall. (Students pay extra.) But while some see these courses as a sensible extra that will ultimately help protect the liberal arts degree, some liberal arts educators vehemently oppose the idea of trying squeeze professional training into students' schedules.
 Anthony Marx, the president of Amherst College, said that if students had more time they should ''go deeper into the liberal arts, because that is the seed corn of an intellectual life and informed citizenship.''
 ''To dilute the power of the liberal arts with premature professionalism will deprive our society of the thoughtful leadership it needs,'' Mr. Marx added.
 Dr. Santirocco said students and parents at N.Y.U. seemed to like the idea that the professional training was ''an add-on, not in place of a liberal arts education.'' 
 The belief that college should train students for a career is widely held. When more than 1,000 adults were asked about the primary purpose of a college education in a survey four years ago, 64 percent said it was to prepare students for specific careers, 16 percent said it was to prepare students for work in general, and only 19 percent said it was to provide students with general knowledge. (An additional 2 percent said they did not know.)
 The survey was conducted among working adults and those looking for work by the Center for Survey Research and Analysis at the University of Connecticut.
 The increased focus on careers has developed in the last few decades. As recently as 1968, nearly half of all bachelor's degrees were in the arts and sciences, said Sarah E. Turner, an economist at the University of Virginia and a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation. But by 1983, they had fallen to 25 percent, and they have stayed below 30 percent since then.
 The decline has occurred even at liberal arts colleges, said David Breneman, dean of the Curry School of Education at Virginia. Of 541 private liberal arts colleges that he studied, only 212 were giving at least 40 percent of their degrees in the arts and sciences in the late 1980's.
 ''In the 1960's, the dominant thing kids wanted to develop was a philosophy of life,'' Dean Breneman said, citing the annual freshman survey conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles, and the American Council on Education. ''They were going to college for idealistic reasons. Then making money just shot to the front.''
 College officials are well aware of these attitudes, but are trying to protect liberal arts education. 
 Five years ago, Columbia University decided to allow undergraduates to take up to four courses for credit at its professional schools; previously, seniors had been allowed to take one course in the business school.
 Kathryn B. Yatrakis, dean of academic affairs at Columbia College, said there had been accusations that the college was giving up its commitment to liberal arts education, but ''that was ridiculous.''
 This year, Colgate University is introducing a ''Gateway Program,'' which will offer short, noncredit courses in fields like law, journalism, marketing and finance, during winter break and the summer.
 ''We continue to think that a liberal arts education is valuable in the new economy,'' said Adam Weinberg, a dean at Colgate. ''But it is important for students to know the language -- the jargon -- when they go on the job market.''
 Richard J. Light, a professor of education at Harvard and author of ''Making the Most of College'' (Harvard University Press, 2001), said that the topic of doing more to help students acquire job skills came up on all the campuses he visited. ''The administrators get it,'' he said. ''But they are struggling with what to do.''
 Some professors, like James Shapiro, a Shakespeare scholar at Columbia, have begun to devise their own ways to help their students make the transition from the liberal arts to careers. Dr. Shapiro introduced a course on book reviewing last fall, to steep his students in the genre and instruct them in the craft.
 ''I'm as committed to the liberal arts as anyone,'' he said. ''But there are ways of rethinking the curriculum that will help them with their careers after graduation. This was an experiment for me that confirmed that there are ways of bridging the kind of writing that people want to do after school, with the kinds of things they are studying as English majors.'' 
 At the University of Washington in Seattle, liberal arts students are permitted to take courses in the university's professional schools for credit. Tim Washburn, assistant vice president for enrollment services, said he expected interest in the N.Y.U. program to be high.
 ''Students are looking for an edge,'' Mr. Washburn said. ''If you have two or three majors and an internship and a certificate, your resume is going to be a little thicker.''
 At the University of Southern California, Joseph Aoun, dean of the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, said that after the university revamped the undergraduate curriculum six years ago to encourage students to take double majors and minors, the number of liberal arts students taking minors in the university's professional schools ''increased phenomenally.'' 
 The minors include liberal arts disciplines, but also more vocational fields like music recording, occupational therapy and advertising.
 ''It is becoming the culture,'' Dean Aoun said.
 N.Y.U. is limiting its new program to its strongest students: juniors and seniors with a 3.5 grade-point average or above. They will not receive academic credit for the courses-- or be charged for them -- but will be eligible for certificates if they take enough courses, perhaps five or six in one area. 
 N.Y.U. is offering 25 certificates, including graphic design, real estate finance and intellectual property law. Courses might be offered once a week for a semester, over a weekend, or in a couple of evenings. 
 Toni J. Nicolino, who hopes to work at a magazine after graduation and is an intern at ''American Cheerleader Magazine'' this summer, plans to take two of the N.Y.U. courses in the fall, on magazine advertising and marketing and on magazine production.
 ''I don't know how much it will benefit me,'' said Ms. Nicolino, who is entering her senior year. ''But I am really interested in magazine editing and I figured I want to learn this stuff. So even if it doesn't benefit me, hey, it's free, and I'm sure I'll love it.''

HEADLINE: Congress's Embarrassment of Pork

 BODY:
With all the subtlety of finger-painters, the House produced a masterpiece of bad legislation this week: a study in grease, pork and blubber, to use lawmakers' descriptions of a stunning special-interest bonanza for all manner of American businesses. The blubber -- a tax break affecting native Alaskan whalers -- was a last-minute inclusion in a bill that began as a simple $5 billion fix for a tariff problem but was transformed into a $143 billion juggernaut of special-interest favors. 
 The frisson of lobbyists was palpable as goodies were voted for bow-and-arrow makers, dog-track owners, sonar fish-finder makers and scores of other businesses that have nothing to do with the trade issue at hand. That problem -- a modest substitute for a tax subsidy for exporters that was ruled illegal by world trade courts -- remains uncorrected. So the meter has been running since March as the European Union levies billions of dollars in retaliatory sanctions on a wide range of American products. 
 The penalties grow each month, yet the outlook is for even more pork-barrel bargaining. The Senate's rival $167 billion business cornucopia awaits a compromise with the House version, and lawmakers estimate that September is their earliest chance to haggle seriously over the final product.
 All sense of urgency and proportion has been lost in Congress's frenzy. The House even dared to adopt an unjustifiable payoff of almost $10 billion for tobacco farmers, whose deadly products can no longer be propped up by price supports. One $3.6 billion amendment lets residents of states with no income taxes start deducting their sales and local taxes on federal returns. 
 The Bush administration has stood by as Congress seized the tariff issue to bend the business tax code out of shape. Clearly, the two houses' dueling Christmas trees should be scrapped in favor of a simple, limited tariff fix. But Congress shows no will to do that as long as there is one more corporate lobbyist to be comforted and campaign coffers beckon.

HEADLINE: It's a Dirty Job, But They Do It, Secretly, in Iraq

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 18 

 BODY:
It was an engineering success on the order of stringing the first cables for the Brooklyn Bridge or coaxing the first glimmer of starlight through some giant telescope to unravel the structure of the universe. 
 But when it occurred late last month, the achievement remained cloaked in absolute secrecy, marked only by a quiet celebration among participants who may remain forever unknown to history.
 Raw sewage was treated in Baghdad.
 The stream of treated water that eventually found its way into the Tigris River was hardly more than a trickle, roughly 20 million gallons a day from a city that produces raw sewage at something like 10 times that rate or more. But the accomplishment is all but epoch-making in a city where the sewage plants are in such disrepair that for the last 10 to 15 years, every drop of that muck was poured untreated into the river, fouling everything from boat landings to drinking water systems downstream. 
 Successes like this one were just what Congress envisioned when it appropriated billions of dollars to rebuild Iraq, hoping the improvements would convince Iraqis of America's good will.
 But for what those in charge of the work, the United States Agency for International Development and its major contractor, Bechtel, curity reasons, the sewage breakthrough remained secret. A reporter from The New York Times agreed not to give the location of the plant in exchange for receiving a general description of the work from the engineers involved. The reporter also agreed not to use the names of the engineers and to print no photographs of their faces.
 A.I.D. and Bechtel say the breakthrough occurred in a dangerous part of Baghdad where any publicity could make the project a target for saboteurs, who struck again on Wednesday, killing a senior Oil Ministry official and damaging another oil pipeline. That argument and the bizarre concept of a secret sewage project have generated frustration among some of the engineers, who say secrecy defeats the original purpose of the work.
 This is the first sewage treatment in Baghdad in 15 years but ''we can't get the word out,'' said one American government engineer on the project. To the suggestion that publicity could lead to bombings and the like, the engineer said, ''Well, guess what -- we're getting bombed anyway.''
 Just three days before, he said, terrorists had lobbed a concussion grenade at a car carrying an electrical engineer working on one of the three huge sewage treatment plants that are being rehabilitated in Baghdad. (Two of them have not yet started processing sewage.)
 Of course, sewage plants are hard to hide, a fact that complicates the effort to keep them secret from those who would like to destroy them. Probably not by accident, though, they do tend to be on less populated outskirts. And except for the big tanks where anaerobic bacteria munch away on sludge, there are few structures that poke very far above the perimeter walls.
 To date, Congress has set aside roughly $24 billion for rebuilding Iraq's electrical, water, sewage, oil, transportation and security installations, among other areas, according to an analysis by the George Soros-backed Iraq Revenue Watch.
 In a desert land where water is society's lifeblood, the need for the work is unquestioned. Ghazi J. Maghak, 68, a civil engineer whose mind is a vast compendium of detail on the Baghdad sewers, which he has worked on for three decades, said in an interview that there were 4,000 miles of sewer lines, most overstressed and falling apart.
 Parts are receiving a thousand times more waste than they were designed for, creating the rivers of sewage that stream through the streets in many neighborhoods, Mr. Maghak said. And under Saddam Hussein, who was no friend to civil infrastructure that did not have a palace sitting on it, repairs were undertaken capriciously and always with the dark threat of punishment.
 Those crumbling sewer lines then feed Baghdad's three great sewage plants, which have fared even worse. In the last decade or two they became so decrepit that engineers simply shunted the raw sewage through jury-rigged pipes and dumped it into the Tigris with no treatment whatever. Then, after the American-led invasion last year, the plants were looted to the ground.
 Left behind were grotesquely dysfunctional graveyards of sludge and ransacked buildings. Initial work to clean them up, largely with shovels and wheelbarrows, began late last year.
 A trip approved by Bechtel and the development agency to one of the plants on June 13 gave some insight into the parlous security situation that has given rise to the secrecy. As a car carrying a reporter, an interpreter and a driver approached the plant, it became apparent that a huge bomb had gone off a short time before -- probably intended for a line of cars, now charred and crumpled, that had been waiting for gasoline in front of a nearby station.
 A group of agitated Iraqi civilians tried to direct the car away, then relented, before blue-shirted Iraqi police officers waved their handguns to get the car to stop again. Finally, heavily armed American soldiers who were clustered around an armored vehicle told the driver to go through.
 Inside the plant, the big round clarification tanks had been cleaned out and were ready for sewage, new filtration screens were soon to be put in place and augurlike screw pumps were lifting sample sewer water into the air for its ride through the system.
 At one point a sand-blasting machine was suddenly turned on somewhere and two of the people in the party, including the American government engineer, hit the deck, thinking it was a mortar attack.
 The plant was all quite impressive, but somehow unsatisfying, since nothing was actually being treated yet. The company and the development agency said the other plants were in areas too dangerous to visit.
 But the next day the First Cavalry Division, which is charged with guarding sites like the sewage plants around Baghdad, agreed to transport two visitors to another plant, using a three-vehicle convoy laden with weaponry. 
 Inside, under the blazing afternoon sun, was a scene that perhaps only the combination of occupied Iraq and a secret sewage plant could produce -- a Turkish site manager who did not seem to speak either English or Arabic, Iraqi engineers with strict orders not to show anyone the treated sewage without permission from the front office, and a compound mostly deserted except for some low-level staff members and managers and the few engineers.
 After some hasty cellphone calls, the permission came through. Accompanied closely by the soldiers, their rifles at the ready, the visitors walked past the blue-gray murk spilling over a ledge in clarification ponds, above scum-covered holding pools toward three little concrete canals that merged at one corner of the site.
 There, near an empty guard tower and some sparse plants called adgal, was a strange but tangible glint of hope on the outskirts of Baghdad: treated sewage, swirling around a corner and out of sight into a pair of mismatched tunnels on its way to the Tigris.

 BODY:

SOLDIER KILLED -- A soldier with the First Cavalry Division was killed and a contractor working for the American firm Kellogg Brown & Root was wounded in a mortar attack in Baghdad. In Baquba, five Iraqi gunmen were killed, and one American soldier was wounded in fighting between American soldiers and Shiite and Sunni insurgents. [Page A7]

GOOD VS. EVIL -- President Bush and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, appeared together at a campaign rally in Reno, Nev., and defended the American-led effort in Iraq, calling it a struggle between good and evil. [A7]

PIPELINE REPAIRS -- The progress made on repairing two sabotaged oil pipelines near Basra in southern Iraq could mean that oil will be flowing again as early as Sunday, government and military officials said. The assessment of the repairs raised hopes that oil exports, the basis of Iraq's economy, could be back to normal within a week. [A7]

REBUILDING IRAQ -- In an example of the thankless task of rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure, the Army Corps of Engineers has been rehabilitating a decrepit sewage-treatment plant in Baghdad in secrecy, fearing it could be a prime target for insurgents. [A1]

EARLY ABUSE CHARGES -- American military officials in Baghdad say there are documents citing complaints of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison starting in November, roughly two months before top military officials say they were first alerted to the abuse. [A6]

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Rules Against U.S. Cotton Subsidies

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, June 18 

 BODY:
In a landmark decision, the World Trade Organization ruled against American cotton subsidies in a case brought by Brazil, officials from the two countries said on Friday.
 The decision could eventually lead the United States to reduce subsidies for its entire farm sector and encourage other countries to challenge such aid in wealthy nations, analysts said.
 The W.T.O. report, which was not made public, upheld a preliminary ruling in April that supported Brazil's claim that the more than $3 billion in subsidies the United States pays its cotton farmers distorts global prices and violates international trade rules.
 ''We are very satisfied with the panel's decision,'' Roberto Azevedo, who heads the trade disputes department at Brazil's foreign ministry, said in a phone interview from Brasilia. ''Once this is all over with, we expect the United States to comply with the ruling.'' 
 In Washington, Bush administration officials criticized the decision, arguing that the best way to address distortions in world agriculture trade was through negotiations, not litigation. The officials also said the United States would appeal, a process that could drag on for months, and possibly more than a year.
 ''We believe U.S. farm programs were designed to be, and are, fully consistent with our W.T.O. obligations,'' Richard Mills, a spokesman for the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, said in a telephone interview.
 ''We will defend U.S. agricultural interests in every form we need to, and we have no intention of unilaterally disarming,'' he added, referring to the $19 billion in annual subsidies paid out to American farmers.
 The W.T.O. ruling is not expected to be made public until late August. An arbitration panel will then decide what damages are due and to what extent Brazil can retaliate if the United States does not comply with the ruling. In another recent case involving steel, President Bush chose to lift subsidies rather than face penalties.
 In its complaint, Brazil, the world's fifth-largest cotton producer, used data from the United States Department of Agriculture to argue that the subsidies led to increased American cotton output, robbing Brazil of potential export markets and undermining the livelihoods of its farmers.
 If Washington scrapped the subsidies, Brazil estimated, American cotton exports would fall 41 percent and production would drop 29 percent. That, in turn, would lead to a 12.6 percent increase in world cotton prices, helping struggling cotton farmers from Brazil to West Africa.
 Brazil also claimed that the United States was providing illegal export subsidies to American agribusiness companies, who were given $1.7 billion to buy American cotton from 1999 to 2001, the period covered in the W.T.O. challenge. The combined aid has helped make the United States the world's top cotton exporter, with more than 40 percent of the world market.
 As the first successful challenge of a wealthy nation's agricultural subsidies, the cotton case could help energize global trade talks, which have been stalled for more than a year over agriculture. 
 The decision also sets a precedent that could encourage more W.T.O. complaints from other developing countries that feel unfairly punished by the $300 billion in annual farm subsidies and supports paid to farmers in the world's richest nations.
 ''This has a value as a precedent that goes very far and broad,'' said Gary Hufbauer, a trade specialist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''It opens the doors for countries who are affected by agricultural subsidies to challenge a lot of other subsidies: sugar, corn, almost any product.''
 Brazil was joined in the case by Argentina, Australia, Benin, Canada, Chad, China, the European Community, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Paraguay, Taiwan and Venezuela, all of which were third parties.

HEADLINE: Flow of Oil May Resume On Sunday, Officials Say

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ and SOMINI SENGUPTA; James Glanz reported from Basra and Somini Sengupta from Baghdad for this article.

DATELINE: BASRA, Iraq, June 18 

 BODY:
Oil could be flowing as early as Sunday through one of two major pipelines that were sabotaged a few miles from this southern Iraqi city earlier this week, government and military officials said Friday. The assessments raised hopes that oil exports, the basis of Iraq's economy, could be back to normal within a week, if there were no further attacks.
 But one of those officials, Dominic d'Angelo, a spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in southern Iraq, cautioned that one of the pipelines was still submerged in a slough of oil-fouled desert sand around the damaged area. Mr. d'Angelo said the timetable would be uncertain until workers had uncovered the line.
 ''Then they'll be able to say exactly how bad the break is,'' he said. 
 Also on Friday, pressure continued to mount on the Bush administration to file charges against Saddam Hussein, as New York-based Human Rights Watch said it would be unlawful not to do so once Iraq was declared sovereign on June 30. Unless criminal charges are filed, the Geneva Conventions require a country to release prisoners of war at the end of a war or an occupation.
 A soldier with the First Cavalry Division was killed and a contractor working for the American firm Kellogg Brown & Root was wounded when mortars hit a American base in Baghdad on Friday afternoon, the American military said in a statement. Fierce clashes continued in Baquba, 35 miles north of Baghdad, as American military snipers posted on rooftops battled what appeared to be a united force of Shiite and Sunni gunmen. Five Iraqi gunmen were killed, and one American soldier was wounded, a spokesman for the Army's First Infantry Division said. 
 The fighting was concentrated in a tribal neighborhood in the southern section of Baquba, a stronghold of anti-American resistance, where American soldiers arrived Thursday morning and arrested more than 50 people, according to a witness speaking from Baquba by telephone. When American troops returned later in the day, they were met by fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles, the staples of the insurgency here. By Friday, civilians had cleared out of the neighborhood, the witness said.
 No charges have been brought against Mr. Hussein, who has been in custody at an undisclosed location since Dec. 13, and American officials have said nothing about when they plan to hand him over to Iraq's interim government. The American military has said it will continue to hold 4,000 to 5,000 detainees after June 30. 
 In a statement issued Friday, Human Rights Watch said that to hold Mr. Hussein without charges past June 30 would flout international law. 
 ''The Bush administration can't have its cake and eat it too,'' said Kenneth Roth, the group's executive director. ''If the occupation is over, so is the U.S. authority to detain Iraqis without criminal charges.'' 
 The group urged that Mr. Hussein be charged with genocide and crimes against humanity.
 The attacks last Monday and Tuesday on the oil pipelines near Basra shut down exports from Iraq's southern oil fields, by far the most important and productive in the country. Oil has continued to flow through mostly smaller pipelines from oil fields to Iraq's web of refineries and petrochemical plants.
 Maj. Trina C. Patterson, an officer with the Army Corps of Engineers, said sabotage of critical infrastructure had been far less common in the south than elsewhere in Iraq, where oil pipelines, electrical transmission lines and other facilities had been repeatedly hit.
 Still, Major Patterson said, the big oil lines to export terminals in the Persian Gulf may have been too tempting to pass up for the insurgents.
 Before the latest attacks, Iraq had been exporting something close to the roughly two million barrels of oil a day that it had averaged before the American-led invasion last year. The great majority of that output came from the southern fields. Analysts have warned that a long-term disruption of oil exports from the south could destabilize world markets, but Ken Miller, vice president of Purvin & Gertz, an international energy consulting firm based in Houston, said the effects on the price per barrel of oil had been minor so far.
 ''Over the last few days we've had a little volatility, up and down a dollar or something,'' he said, ''but nothing dramatic.''

HEADLINE: Kerry Says He Supports Minimum Wage Increase to $7 an Hour by 2007

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va., June 18 

 BODY:
Asserting that ''right now our economy is not working for the average American,'' Senator John Kerry on Friday promised to increase the federal minimum wage to $7 an hour from the current $5.15 by 2007 if he is elected.
 ''You put in a week's work, you ought to be able to take care of your family, you ought to be able to pay your bills,'' Mr. Kerry, the Democrats' White House hopeful, told a small audience of union workers here at Northern Virginia Community College. ''If we're going to say to people, 'Go to work,' if we're going to say to people, 'work is a value in America,' and if we're going to say to people, 'You ought to be able to go to work and be able to do better,' then we've got to make it real.''
 Mr. Kerry has spoken generally about raising the minimum wage throughout the campaign and supports legislation making it $7 sponsored by his colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, but Friday was the first time he put the proposal into his presidential platform. His aides circulated a report by nine labor economists showing that the raise would affect 7.4 million minimum-wage workers, 61 percent of them women. 
 Both the experts and Mr. Kerry pointed out that the minimum wage has been flat since 1996, the second-longest stretch since it was established in 1938, and that its inflation-adjusted value is now $4.18, below the $4.25 rate that prevailed in the early 1990's. ''We've got the biggest gap we've ever had between the haves and the have-nots,'' Mr. Kerry said, noting that $5.15 is one-third the nation's average wage, the lowest ratio since 1949, ''when Harry Truman was president.''
 Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for President Bush's re-election campaign, said the incumbent was ''willing to consider any reasonable proposal that phases in an increase over an extended period of time -- provided it would not place unreasonable costs on small businesses or other job creators.''
 That unusually agreeable statement was followed by a note about the good economic news of late, including the creation of 1.4 million new jobs over the last nine months, followed by a slap at the Democratic challenger. ''John Kerry's pessimism and his attempts to talk down the economy won't create a single job in America,'' Mr. Schmidt said.
 With the minimum-wage proposal, Mr. Kerry turned the focus of his two-week economic swing from the middle-class to the working poor, before heading to his home on Nantucket Island for the weekend. He also headlined a pair of Washington fund-raisers on Friday, one that drew more than 2,000 women and another for the Asian-American community.
 The wage study circulated by the campaign showed that 1.8 million of the nation's minimum-wage workers have children, 36 percent of them serve as the sole provider for their families. Campaign aides said they picked $7, a 35 percent increase phased in at about 12 percent a year, because it would bring a family of four with one minimum-wage earner above the poverty line with food stamps and other assistance.
 The economists said the $3,800 windfall over a year would pay for 10 months of groceries, eight months of rent, or a year's tuition at community college.
 ''This is not some trivial program about pocket change for kids after school, it's a working-parents' issue,'' said Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, one of the authors of the campaign report. Eileen Appelbaum of Rutgers University echoed that thought, saying, ''they're not working for pin money, their families depend on this.''
 Mr. Kerry could not find anyone in his 75-person audience who actually earns the minimum wage. ''I'll tell you why they're not here, they're out working on their minimum wage,'' he quipped, but a woman named Wendy spoke of her struggle to get by on the $7 an hour she makes at Food Lion. Wendy told Mr. Kerry that she had just graduated from high school and lacks health insurance, though her two children are covered through her boyfriend's grandmother. 
 ''So you're living with the Bush plan, which is, 'Pray you don't get sick,''' Senator Kerry said. 
 ''Don't you think as an American value of fairness that if a president can go out and fight for four years to provide over a trillion dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America, we can fight for a few years to raise the minimum wage for the poorest people in America?'' he asked the crowd. ''For the past four years, this administration has given a bad name to our priorities. They've put wealth ahead of work, really. They've put something for nothing ahead of responsibility.''
 At the women's fund-raiser, which brought in $1.3 million, Teresa Heinz Kerry said her husband would ''make the best nursery school teacher in the world'' and would go to the United Nations upon election to ''represent this country with great pride but no arrogance.''
 ''He actually does feel at ease in the world,'' Mrs. Kerry said, her face beamed over a dozen large screens in the makeshift basement ballroom. ''He likes people, in spite of whatever people might think.''
 Taking his turn at the microphone, Mr. Kerry said, ''It is now more obvious than it ever was before that I married up.''

In His Own Words
Senator John Kerry
 Speaking to a small audience of union workers at the Alexandria campus of Northern Virginia Community College yesterday, he proposed pushing the minimum wage to $7 an hour from its current $5.15 by 2007, saying: 
 ''You always hear politicians talk about traditional American values, and we should -- it's important to us. But what greater traditional American value is there other than work? Work. Work is a value, and work is supposed to pay something in return. You're supposed to get your value back. You put in a week's work, you ought to be able to take care of your family. You ought to be able to pay your bills. Twenty years ago in America, one person could buy a home, and pay for college, working in a family. Today you're lucky if two people could pull it off. 
 ''And I think there's a sense of fundamental fairness about how people work and get into the work force and work their way up the economic ladder. That's why we put a minimum wage in place in the first place. And every time we have an argument about the minimum wage we have the same arguments. Guess what folks? Some people stand up and say, 'Oh gosh, don't raise the minimum wage, that's going to hurt us in this small business.' But you know what? It never has. America has grown, America has gotten stronger. Every time you hear people say, 'Oh, gee, we can't afford to do that, we won't be competitive,' guess what? We stay competitive. We grow our economy. America has gotten wealthier and wealthier. But today, eight years since we raised the minimum wage, the minimum wage today, ladies and gentlemen, is worth less than it was worth when it was $4.25. It's worth about $4.18 and it's 33 percent, today -- its value is about 33 percent of the average wages in America. That's not acceptable.''

HEADLINE: Publisher Tries to Stop Leaks From the Clinton Memoirs

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
Lawyers for Bill Clinton's publisher scrambled yesterday to block leaks from his memoirs before its official release next week. But legal experts said a publisher had scant hope of keeping the contents under wraps after a copy fell into a reporter's hands.
 The Associated Press reported yesterday that it had obtained a copy, disclosing several details about Mr. Clinton's account of his affair with Monica Lewinsky and its consequences. The New York Times independently obtained another copy. 
 As soon as The A.P. released its report, lawyers for Mr. Clinton's publisher, Knopf, sent a letter to it arguing that the news organization had violated copyright laws and demanding that it stop. The A.P. rejected the contentions. 
 ''We disagree completely with their legal conclusions concerning our story,'' a spokesman, Jack Stokes, wrote in an e-mail message.
 The brinksmanship is the latest battle as publishers try to fight off news organizations to protect an elaborate publicity campaign around the release date of blockbuster books. Seldom have the circumstances surrounding the publication of a book received as much attention -- from the publisher and the public -- as Mr. Clinton's.
 Knopf, part of the Random House division of Bertelsmann, paid Mr. Clinton a record advance of more than $10 million for the right to publish his memoirs.
 To help ensure maximum attention, Knopf reached agreements with a host of news media outlets to interview Mr. Clinton, including America Online, Infinity Radio, ''60 Minutes,'' ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ''Today,'' ''Good Morning America'' and three programs on National Public Radio. 
 Although additional leaks from the book might appear to increase the hoopla, publishers say premature disclosure of the most newsworthy elements can sometimes lead news organizations to cancel those agreements. Publishers are typically desperate to keep their most sensational manuscripts under lock and key until a designated publication day, scheduled weeks in advance. 
 Knopf has guarded Mr. Clinton's memoirs especially tightly, in part because of the enormous curiosity the book has aroused. Although most publishers eagerly sell rights to excerpt such books to a major newsweekly as a chance for more publicity, Knopf declined to sell any excerpt in the United States, to avoid giving away any of the contents. 
 Paul Bogaards, a spokesman for Knopf, said that it had sold first excerpt rights in other countries besides the United States, and that the premature disclosure of compelling details from the book could jeopardize those agreements as well. 
 In an interview yesterday, Jon Fine, a Knopf lawyer, cited two precedents. In a 1985 decision over an article in The Nation magazine that quoted about 300 words from the former President Gerald Ford's memoirs before official publication, the Supreme Court ruled that the magazine had violated his publisher's copyright by printing his words before the book's scheduled release. And in a case in 1918, Mr. Fine argued, the court found a right to protect proprietary ''hot news'' from early release in a case involving The A.P. and another wire service.
 But in an interview yesterday, Jane Ginsburg, a professor of intellectual property law at Columbia, noted that copyright protected only an author's forms of expression, not facts. The A.P. mainly reported facts from Mr. Clinton's memoirs verbatim without quoting at length, potentially avoiding infringement. Without direct quotes or close paraphrases, Professor Ginsburg said, ''there is no copyright claim, even though there could be considerable economic consequences.''
 Roger Zissu, a copyright lawyer who sued The Nation in the Ford case, said he doubted the ''hot news'' precedent would apply. ''People are not going to read the paper and then not buy the book,'' Mr. Zissu said.
 Mr. Bogaards said Knopf would press its claims. 
 ''We are going to vigorously pursue any person or organization making public disclosures in violation of the embargo,'' he said. 
 Last year, Simon & Schuster threatened to sue The A.P. after it had reported details of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's book. 
 Yesterday, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, Adam Rothberg, said that dispute remained unresolved.
 As for whether leaks have damaged sales of Mrs. Clinton's book, which became a best seller, Mr. Rothberg declined to comment.
 Mr. Bogaards declined to comment on whether the leaks might hurt sales of Mr. Clinton's book, either. Knopf has printed 1.5 million copies, most of which will be in stores on Tuesday. Most news media organizations are sticking to their plans. ''The only thing surprising is that it took A.P. so long to get the book,'' said James Kelly, editor of Time, which will publish an interview with Mr. Clinton next week.
 Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, appears eager to help sell the book. Knopf has told stores that, unlike most other celebrity authors, Mr. Clinton wants to visit only one location a day so he can sign copies for everyone who wants one.

HEADLINE: Old Armories Don't Die, They Get Makeovers

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AS the Connecticut National Guard continues to reorganizes for a post-cold-war world, it is closing many of the armories that have long been backdrops in larger towns and cities. After closing armories in Ansonia and Hartford last year, the Guard would like to close two more this year and a dozen or more over the next 10 to 20 years.
 As the armories close, many communities have found it's not always bad news when the National Guard pulls out because the buildings are often turned over to the towns. When the Danielson Armory closed in the early 1990's, for example, the state transferred it to the town, which leased it to Deary's Gymnastics. Deary's spent $100,000 improving the building in exchange for lease-free space the first 10 years, after which the town gets $1,000 a month and the right to raise the rent 8 percent a year for the next 10 years, said Elsie R. Bisset, the economic development coordinator in Killingly, where the borough of Danielson is located.
 ''It's been there six years now, and it's still a very thriving business,'' Mrs. Bisset said. ''It's been a great thing for the downtown because of the pedestrian traffic that it generates. Moms bring their kids in for a class, then stay and do their shopping during the class.'' 
 In Middletown, where the armory was also closed in the early 1990's, the town turned it over to New York developers to do a $10.2 million renovation and expansion to turn it into a 100-room hotel, with a restaurant that seats 160 people and 3,000 feet of office and meeting space. The original part of the building dates to 1810, but Richard C. Kearney, Middletown's economic development specialist, said the addition was faithful to the original architecture.
 ''You walk in the front door and you wouldn't know where the new and the old meet,'' Mr. Kearney said. He said the Inn at Middletown, as it is now known, has been doing a brisk business since it opened in January, and one commercial real estate agent told him that one guest who stayed there in May, who owns a software company in England, is considering opening a satellite office in town.
 ''He came here to see clients and was so impressed with the city he decided it would be a good spot for his next office,'' Mr. Kearney said. ''Now he's going to go off and lease space, and we're going to have a new business in town. That's the kind of thing a hotel in the downtown can do for us.''
 In Ansonia, the state transferred the armory to the town last October, and it was immediately pressed into service as a community center, used mainly as a gymnasium by the town's Recreation Department and the Assumption School, a Catholic school next door.
 Linda M. Gentile, an assistant to Ansonia Mayor James T. Della Volpe, said only parts of the armory can be used now because the building is more than 100 years old and requires some renovation so it can meet modern health and safety codes. She estimated it could take more than $2 million to make the entire building usable.
 ''But it's still a very solid building, wonderful in terms of architecture, and it provides us with space for a lot of youth sports and activities that we never had before,'' Ms. Gentile said. ''At some point the whole building will be used as a community center, but probably not for several years.''
 James Finnucan, Ansonia's recreation director, said the building provides his department for the first time with its own building. Previously, it used some of the local school gymnasiums for its programs.
 ''We used to have to schedule all the town recreation activities around the school activities,'' Mr. Finnucan. ''With the Armory, we have first priority, so we're moving a lot of our programs there.''
 At Brainard Field in Hartford, the Guard vacated its armory and the Connecticut State Police aviation unit moved right in, from leased space across the tarmac. 
 ''We went from a cramped one-room office to a building that has enough room to accommodate a professional aviation operation,'' said Sgt. J. Paul Vance, spokesman for the State Police. 
 Now the pilots have a waiting room, there is a separate briefing area and offices for administrative personnel. The department is also moving some homeland security operations to the building, and it already served in May as the headquarters of a statewide disaster training drill, he said.
 More towns may soon get the chance to put their own armories to other uses. Many of the Guard's older armories are too small for modern military units, and Maj. Gen. William A. Cugno, adjutant general for Connecticut, announced four years ago ''Operation Bold Move,'' which is overhauling the nature of the Guard in Connecticut, so it needs different types of buildings than it has now.
 ''I'm trying to bring us into the 21st century,'' he said. ''Rather than spending money on a lot of individual armories, we need to get down to our core armories, and put the money we save towards things like our Urban Warfare Training Center at Stone's Ranch or the conference center and distant learning center at Camp Rowland.''
 Lt. Col. Gerald J. Lukowski, construction and facilities management officer for the Connecticut National Guard, said it has not built a new armory since 1982, existing armories average 56 years old and many are just too small.
 For instance, armories in Rockville, Putnam, Naugatuck and Westbrook, all built in the early 1960's, are each about 14,000 square feet, which make them too small to justify a full-time maintenance staff. If the Guard builds an armory today it would probably be 20,000 to 30,000 square feet, he said.
 ''The buildings have been maintained and are in good shape, so we could get 10, 20, maybe 30 years out of them, but we could build one new facility and replace all of them and save money,'' he said.
 And it is not just the size of the buildings, he said. Under General Cugno's plan for restructuring the Guard, the state gave up the 192nd Field Artillery unit, which has no training site in Connecticut anyway, and got approval to establish four chemical warfare units, four military police units, a transportation company and two engineer fire-fighting teams.
 ''The general came up with these plans a year before the 9/11 attacks, but it's exactly the configuration the federal government wants post-9/11,'' Colonel Lukowski said. As a result, the federal government is underwriting much of the cost of the new operations.
 For instance, in East Lyme, the Guard plans a $2.5 million, 5,500-square-foot firehouse at its 2,500-acre Stone's Ranch training complex, which will be paid for entirely with federal funds. Initially, it will be staffed by about 40 people who will be on call to respond to major emergencies around the state, but it will also be available for local fire calls and local firefighters can train on the equipment there.
 ''It makes no sense not to be able to share it with as many others as possible -- shared use benefits all parties,'' General Cugno said. ''Doesn't that make sense for all taxpayers?''
 Also in East Lyme, there are plans for expanding Camp Rowland by almost 200,000 square feet of new construction, including 47,000-square-feet of housing for visiting soldiers and a 92,700-square-foot training academy that will be linked electronically to other training sites. Connecticut has become the designated training site for the six New England states, New York, and New Jersey, but in the last year soldiers from Arizona, Nevada, California, Delaware and Florida have traveled there as well. Because the training complexes at Camp Rowland and Stone's Ranch are used by more than just the Connecticut Guard, the federal government underwrites the cost.
 The Guard's long-term plan, covering the next 10 to 20 years, calls for about $250 million of construction in Connecticut, about one-third of it on new or expanded armories in Southington, Middletown, New Haven, Newtown, Windsor Locks and East Lyme, one-third on improvements at Camp Rowland, and one-third on maintenance of existing buildings, Colonel Lukowski said.
 ''Our goal is to replace multiple armories with each new one,'' he said. ''At least two armories, and probably three in some cases, can be closed every time we put a new building in operation.''

HEADLINE: Cheap Date: The Last New Car Under $10,000

BYLINE: By JEFF SABATINI

 BODY:
WITH a starting price of $9,995, the Chevrolet Aveo has the lowest sticker of any new car sold in the United States. That is only about a third the average retail selling price of a new vehicle, which reached a high of $27,550 in 2003, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Or to look at it another way, there are televisions that cost more than this econobox.
 So what do you get for the 10 large that could otherwise put a 50-inch Sony plasma set in your living room? 
 You really do get an entire fully functional automobile, including the delivery charge, though taxes and such will bump the cost into five digits. 
 There are actually two Aveos, a four-door sedan and a five-door hatchback. Both are powered by a 1.6-liter, twin-cam, four-cylinder engine that makes 103 horsepower. A five-speed manual transmission is standard, and that's about all that is worth mentioning unless you get excited about intermittent wipers.
 Yes, this is a cut-rate, no-frills subcompact, the closest thing to a disposable car. 
 But the Aveo (pronounced ah-VAY-oh) is more fun to drive and more practical than most of the bloated status symbols that pass for transportation these days. It is, in fact, so entertaining that I can imagine Aveos being sold to people who aren't forced into them strictly because of the price. 
 While no other window stickers start quite this low, other cars sell for similar money, including the Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio and Toyota Echo. But after the new-car sheen wears off, this triumvirate of boredom is likely to leave owners wishing they could have afforded something more. The Aveo has more personality than those three combined: just think of it as a minimalist mini-priced alternative to a Mini Cooper.
 My test car was a five-door hatchback, which is more than a foot shorter than the sedan, and more attractive, too. The five-door has one of the most distinctive looks of any small car on the road today, courtesy of Italdesign, the renowned design firm headed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Italdesign is also credited with the shape of the Maserati Coupe and Spyder, and while this Chevy is no Maser, its European looks are indeed athletic: the Aveo resembles nothing so much as a stylish basketball shoe. 
 The Aveo's weight, just under 2,350 pounds, is the biggest reason for my joy behind the wheel. The lack of heft not only makes up for the small engine, but helps in the handling and braking departments, too. This is no sports car, but it is nimble, with surprisingly good feedback through the steering wheel. While I wouldn't choose to drive one cross-country, the Aveo is the ticket for city dwellers; it is easy to dart in and out of traffic, and even easier to park. 
 As you expect of a hatchback, the five-door has a fold-down rear seat that creates a cargo hold big enough to swallow most anything you might be tempted to throw in. 
 If that's the upside, well, the downside is where this simple car gets complicated. The Aveo is not actually a Chevy in the strictest sense. It's a Daewoo Kalos, manufactured in South Korea and imported to the United States, a byproduct of General Motors' 2002 deal for assets of the bankrupt Daewoo.
 Regardless of its nation of origin, a car this inexpensive is bound to feel cheap and certain to be loud. The Aveo qualifies on both counts.
 I can forgive most of the rough edges, like the balky shifter and jerky driveline, but the Aveo still has some shortcomings that I find inexcusable. The stereo system is without question the worst-sounding factory-installed unit I have ever heard. Not only is the bass virtually nonexistent, but my test car's CD/MP3 player had problems reading CD's I had burned on my computer. 
 Every Aveo should come with a discount coupon good at the local car audio installer.
 The plastics are awful, with pieces as hard and poorly molded as anything that graced the interior of a 70's-era Chevette. The covering of the windshield pillars in my test car was warped like a phonograph record left in the sun on a summer day. I'm not asking for a dashboard covered in Connolly leather, but it would be nice to see G.M. and Daewoo get closer to the fit-and-finish standards Toyota achieves in the Echo. 
 Then there's the old bait-and-switch on the window sticker. See, to get the under-$10-grand Aveo, you have to forgo such things as air-conditioning, antilock brakes, automatic transmission, CD player, power door locks, power windows and sunroof. These are available only on Aveos with a higher level of trim. If you want all the toys, you'll pay dearly for them, as a loaded Aveo tops out at $15,445 -- a 55 percent premium over the stripper.
 But trust me, you don't need all those toys. Not in this car.
 Yes, some will disagree with this assessment, insisting that antilock brakes are a necessary safety feature, to which I would suggest that so, too, are the high-quality season-specific tires that few consumers are willing to buy. 
 Some also insist on an automatic transmission, a power-robbing convenience for which this car is just not suited. 
 And if you're tempted to roll some power amenities into the financing, that's the point where you're just plain better off buying more car with more standard features and a higher base price. At $14,000, you are in Honda Civic or Mazda 3 territory, which is a nicer place to be.
 No, the way to best enjoy the Aveo is to pay your $10,000 and change, and drive it as if you stole it. At $9,995, you did.

INSIDE TRACK: Cheap fun that's worth every penny.

HEADLINE: A Town in Oregon Decides It Is Going to the Frogs

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

DATELINE: MILTON-FREEWATER, Ore. 

 BODY:
A town struggling to stand out, desperate to court tourists and hot to rescue a near-dead economy has to get really creative these days.
 It cannot, as this northeastern Oregon town did in sleepy eras past, merely come up with a slogan, say call itself the ''Sweet Pea Capital,'' the ''Apple Capital'' or ''Home of the Low Cost Utility.'' It cannot simply hang a few banners on Main Street and expect people to notice, let alone visit, spend money or move in.
 Apple capitals are a dime a dozen in Oregon and over the border in Washington, a state even more famous for apples, and the orchards here are barely productive anymore. Sure, having one of the lowest electricity rates in the nation is nice, but tourists never flocked here to read the meters. 
 That is where the frogs come in. Milton-Freewater, one of a growing number of the nation's towns and cities to embrace a strategic staple of corporate America, is reinventing itself completely and branding itself like a product. The brand here is frog-related. Milton-Freewater is now ''Muddy Frogwater Country'' and a ''Toadly Awesome Place to Live.'' But its new identity goes far beyond slogans and mottos. 
 ''I couldn't sell this town,'' said Delphine Palmer, the city manager of Milton-Freewater, a town of 6,500 people. ''We're having a lot of problems like other cities. And we can sit here and do nothing, or we can try something different.''
 The branding, discussed at civic meetings over the last year, envisions frog festivals, frog art, frog T-shirts and statues of frogs on skateboards at the skate park. At the bar on Main Street, cartoons of frogs sipping draft beer, and at the town chiropractor, a frog on crutches -- frogs on everything, and an advertising campaign to let the world know. 
 The city hopes to attract tourists already drawn to the area's many new wineries. In a letter explaining the branding process to residents, which was included in their inexpensive utility bills, Ms. Palmer wrote: ''We are at a crossroads where we can either move forward and try something different to increase the viability of our city, or we can sit back and watch more businesses close down while we silently say, 'Milton-Freewater just isn't thriving like it should, and SOMEBODY should do something!' Now is your chance to be that SOMEBODY.''
 The concept guiding officials in this town, where the deep woes of the agriculture industry, Oregon's budget troubles and an 8 percent unemployment rate have left its economy moribund, is called municipal branding. The idea, being tried across the country, builds on national efforts in the 1990's in struggling countries like Poland and Croatia.
 Branding a place can be a bumpy endeavor and it requires deep soul-searching, a commitment to changing everything from the town motto to its entire image, experts say, and, most important, it requires creating a new product, a brand that does not exist elsewhere. 
 (Wrinkle for Milton-Freewater: A Louisiana town has recently branded itself as the nation's frog capital.) 
 Almost every place has a slogan or a motto. Phoenix, Ore., is ''The Other Phoenix.'' Conneaut, Ohio, is ''Ohio's Sharpest Corner.'' Dove Creek, Colo., is ''The Pinto Bean Capital of the World!''
 But the slogan, said Greg Stine, president of Polaris Inc., the marketing firm working with Milton-Freewater and Oakridge, Ore., a dying lumber town, has to promise something appealing and then deliver. 
 Like Milton-Freewater, other towns in the last few years have hired marketing consultants who specialize in brand identity to help them revamp their images. Milton-Freewater, which has an annual budget of $22 million, has spent $2,800 so far on its branding, mostly for Mr. Stine's services.
 ''It takes a lot of commitment by the people at the top in the city,'' said Jonathan Baltuch, president of MRI, a Florida consulting firm hired by St. Cloud, which found itself overshadowed by Disney World, to help brand that city with the theme ''Celebrating Small Town Life.''
 ''It can be a little painful,'' Mr. Baltuch said. ''But when you create a successful brand, you have something for the long term.''
 Some towns, like Leavenworth in the Cascade mountains of Washington, devastated by the closing of a major saw mill and reinvented as a Bavarian village, have had great success. But other efforts face resistance and other practical obstacles, as in Soap Lake, Wash., which was once a Mecca for medicinal treatments in its waters and now hopes to become the ''Lava Lamp Capital.'' 
 In Milton-Freewater, most shop owners and residents say they support the frog brand, which grew out of a popular summer event here, the ''Muddy Frogwater Festival,'' featuring frog-jumping contests and country music. But a few are ambivalent about being identified with slimy amphibians, and note that except for a few tree frogs, frogs are not indigenous to Milton-Freewater. 
 ''If it helps bring business to this town, great,'' said a restaurant owner who insisted on anonymity, saying she feared retribution for her frog opposition. ''But I'm not painting my building green.'' 
 She added, ''Some people here really hate this frog thing. Besides, we're fruit -- cherries and apples -- not frogs.''
 But others were more enthusiastic, and along North Main Street, hardly a storefront lacks a frog. City officials said they planned to advertise the frog brand in local newspapers and in brochures for visitors to the growing number of wineries in the Walla Walla River Valley, which includes Milton-Freewater. 
 Jeannette Powers, owner of the What Knot Shop, an arts and crafts and consignment store on North Main Street, said she had been plugging frogs to her crafters and consigners. Ms. Powers is already selling frog finger puppets, frog fly swatters and frog beanbags. 
 ''I tell them, 'If you crochet, crochet a frog. If you paint, paint a frog -- I want some frogs in here,''' she said. ''If you want to save any kind of economy, you have to do something creative. I think the whole town is going to have to do a frog thing if they want it to be our identity.''
 Ms. Powers said she was aware of the opposition among some of the other shop owners to frog branding. ''They want apples,'' she said. ''But people think of Washington State. And other people think of New York City -- the Big Apple. We can't compete with that.''
 Ms. Powers recently heard of the Louisiana town, Rayne, which is calling itself the frog capital, where bullfrog murals and frog festivals abound and where tourism is on the rise. An antifrog Milton-Freewater resident brought an article about it into the store, she said.
 ''I looked at that and I said, 'If they're making it on frogs, why can't we?''' Ms. Powers said. ''Besides, that's clear in Louisiana. Maybe we can be the frog capital of the Northwest.''

HEADLINE: What's a Life Worth?

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
LAST week, the federal government announced that it had wrapped up its work on the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund. It granted a total of approximately $6 billion to almost 3,000 victims' families. 
 The fund's task was not easy: determining the value of a victim's life. Decisions were based partly on salary and age and the potential of future earnings. 
 If the families received life insurance and/or other benefits, the fund reduced the net awards. Payments ranged from $250,000 to $7.1 million. The median payment was almost $1.7 million.
 The process was no mere mathematical exercise. It was a painstakingly personal, complicated task, subject to a seemingly infinite number of economic and emotional variables.
 The Times asked several lawyers who represented families to provide sketches of their cases, shedding light on how difficult it is to set a value on a human life. DAVID W. CHEN

HEADLINE: A Cri de Coeur for Customers

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
Last year was a nerve-racking one for William Vaschetta who, with his mother and grandmother, runs Chez Napoleon, a tiny French bistro on 50th Street near Ninth Avenue that is popular with the theater crowd. Between the blackout in August, the Broadway musicians' strike in March, the sluggish economy and simmering anti-French sentiment related to the Iraq war, he watched as the restaurant began slowly dying. 
 Unable to afford the high costs of advertising, Mr. Vaschetta, 32, did something most New Yorkers rarely do: he pleaded. He placed cards on each table that began, ''Dear Customers and Friends,'' and went on to say, ''We simply cannot survive as a small French restaurant for very much longer.'' In lieu of ''donations, higher checks or even larger appetites,'' he asked longtime customers to spread the word: ''Tell people that an 82-year-old French grandmother is the chef here. Tell them about the food, the music, etc.'' 
 ''I took a shot,'' said Mr. Vaschetta, who was manning the restaurant's one-seat bar on Tuesday night. On his lapel was a red and blue cocarde symbolizing the French Revolution. ''Things were getting really scary, and we don't want to close.'' 
 The placards, which have since been removed, found their way around the city through enterprising customers (one was spotted at a copy shop on West 86th Street), and, according to Mr. Vaschetta, the efforts have created a moderate boost. ''But business is still not to where I thought it would be,'' he said, looking around the near-empty 45-seat restaurant. In some ways, the mere survival of Chez Napoleon is a victory. A number of the city's French restaurants have closed this year, among them Lutece, Chez Suzette, and, most recently, La Caravelle. Chez Napoleon opened in 1959, taking its name not from the general but from its diminutive first owner, who was nicknamed Little Napoleon. 
 Mr. Vaschetta's family came to America in 1975 and bought the restaurant in 1982, filling it with photographs and bric-a-brac and imbuing it with the musty but warm ambience of a grandmother's home. The grandmother in question, Marguerite Bruno, now 83, still works several days a week, preparing traditional dishes like bouillabaisse and sipping a Dewar's at the bar when she needs a rest. 
 Mr. Vaschetta spent his childhood at Chez Napoleon, but lately he can't help dwelling on all that it isn't -- big, modern, bustling. Sometimes, he walks past the Olive Garden in Times Square and thinks wistful thoughts. ''That place is always humming,'' he said. ''If I could just get some of those people to come here.''

HEADLINE: With More in the City Coffers, Council Adds to Its Wish List

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
James Oddo, a Republican councilman from Staten Island, had only one item on his budget wish list this year: $300,000 more for city planners to curb over-development in the boroughs outside Manhattan. 
 But when other Council members started putting in several different budget requests, each for millions of dollars, Mr. Oddo was not to be left out. He increased his own request, to $500,000. 
 ''They were asking for millions, so I asked for a little more,'' said Mr. Oddo, who is one of only three Republicans in the overwhelmingly Democratic Council. ''Watching my colleagues attempt to agree on cutting programs is like wrestling a book of matches or a lighter out of the hands of a pyromaniac.''
 Even as New York City's economy rebounds, many of its 51 Council members are proposing to empty the government's coffers just as fast as they are being replenished. During budget talks in recent weeks, members have fought for money to subsidize all manner of causes and pet projects, ranging from $10,000 for a center for the elderly in Queens, to $4 million for teachers to specialize in the sciences, to $20 million for a citywide study on chronic unemployment among minorities.
 This year, the Council's list of budget priorities -- known as its wish list -- has grown as high as $930 million before being chopped to less than half of that amount, members say. The exact contents of that list remains under wraps, with copies circulated among members only during budget meetings and then collected immediately afterward to prevent any leaks.
 Mr. Oddo and other Council members say they have become increasingly frustrated with the lack of restraint shown by some of their more free-spending colleagues. They say that the growth in budget requests from members this year -- frequently at the behest of an advocacy group or lobbyist from their district -- has fueled a more chaotic and contentious budget than in years past.
 ''It seems that every one of these silly suggestions has been given equal footing, and it's up to the rational Council members to sift through the junk,'' said one member, who has reviewed more than 300 budget requests during marathon Council meetings that have spilled into nights and weekends. 
 But other members contend that their primary responsibility is, after all, to try to meet the needs of their districts. And if they are feeling expansive this year, they are not alone. Both Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Council Speaker Gifford Miller want to return money to residents through their competing proposals for, respectively, a $400 tax rebate and a 2 percentage-point rollback of last year's 18.5 percent property tax rate increase.
 Councilman Charles Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat, said he started out with 15 budget priorities, including the $20 million for the study on unemployment among minorities and tens of millions more to restore cuts to scholarships, community colleges, summer jobs and day care programs in the mayor's $46.9 billion spending plan.
 ''We're putting things back to what they were originally,'' Mr. Barron said. ''It's not like people are getting extra stuff. It's not like we're sitting here in luxury.''
 Councilwoman Margarita Lopez, the chairwoman of a committee on mental health, said many Council members are pressing their luck because there is suddenly more money available. She has requested $1 million to pay for psychiatric and health services for young children, and $1 million for treatment and counseling for crystal methamphetamine addicts and a public awareness campaign about the dangers of the drug.
 ''There is more initiative taken by members who see opportunity now,'' said Ms. Lopez, of Manhattan. ''It's like when my mommy is not home, and I'm the only one there. I invite everybody for a party but I know she's coming home.''
 Councilman Michael McMahon pointed out that because of term limits, members have less time than they used to for winning over constituents in their districts and making a name for themselves. 
 Yet Mr. McMahon, who represents Staten Island, also echoed the frustration of other members in spending so much time on things ''that I'm quite sure are not going to survive.'' He requested $1.4 million to increase garbage collection in commercial areas in the boroughs outside Manhattan, and $200,000 for a consultant to study the city's solid waste management options.
 Marcia Van Wagner, chief economist for the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, said that recent economic gains have lulled some Council members into a false sense of security, especially given the city's looming budget problems in the next few years. ''The Council members should be putting their energy into how to shave spending, instead of larding it on,'' she said.
 But other longtime observers of the Council said that the current turmoil among its members is merely a reflection of the larger democratic process at work. 
 ''What looks like chaos to some is fighting for your constituents to others,'' said Gene Russianoff, a senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''It's what I would expect my own Council member to do.

HEADLINE: Oh, Dad! So Glad You Had This Lad. A Job, Too? Not Bad.

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring

 BODY:
Those flower-bedecked cards being showered today on the male of the parental species may encourage one to ponder, in the mushiest language possible, what it means to be a dad. 
 But here is a more practical definition: Being a father means being more likely to have a job. 
In 2003, the unemployment rate for men with children under 18 was just 4.1 percent, versus 6 percent for all Americans and 7.5 percent for men with no children, reports Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm.
 And if the children were 6 to 17, all the better: the rate fell to 3.9 percent.
 The chicken-and-egg question, of course, is this: Are men more likely to be fathers because they are employed, or vice versa? A bit of both, presumably. 
 Lest this seem too rosy, remember the glass-half-empty perspective: no paychecks for more than half a million fathers of young children. Hubert B. Herring

HEADLINE: Growing More Oil Dependent, One Vehicle At a Time

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
AFTER the energy crises of the 1970's, United States oil consumption dropped sharply, partly because of successful efforts to improve automobile fuel efficiency and partly because of increased conservation. 
 Over the last two decades, however, consumption has risen steadily and is now higher than it was at the peak of the crises. 
The transportation sector has been responsible for all of the increase, rising 36 percent from 1980 to 2001, while all other sectors declined 19 percent over the same period. 
 More trucks transporting more goods has accounted for part of the growth, but changes in consumer behavior have been even more important.
 The growing popularity of sport utility vehicles and other light-duty trucks, which are less fuel efficient than most cars but which now account for more than half of all new vehicle sales, has really had an impact. More than half of the growth in transportation consumption has been among light trucks.
 Driving habits have also changed as people are driving more often and over longer distances. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

If anti-Americanism is on the rise around the world, no one told the kids in the student visa line at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. The quest among Chinese students for visas to study in America, say U.S. Embassy officials, has become so intense that it has spawned Internet chat rooms, where Chinese students swap stories about which arguments work best with which U.S. consular officials and even give them names like ''Amazon Goddess,'' ''Too Tall Baldy'' and ''Handsome Guy.''
 Just how closely Chinese students strategize over the Internet on how to get visas to America -- at a time when fewer are being given for security reasons -- was revealed to the embassy recently when on one day one consular officer had scores of students come through with the same line, which some chat room had suggested would work: ''I want to go to America to become a famous professor.'' After hearing this all day, he was surprised to get one student who came before him and pronounced, ''My mom has an artificial limb and I want to build a better artificial leg for my mom and that is why I want to study in the U.S.'' The consular officer was so relieved to hear a new line that he told the young man: ''You know, this is the best story I've heard this morning. I really salute you. I'm going to give you a visa.'' 
 You guessed it. The next day every other student who showed up at the embassy said he or she wanted to go to America to learn how to build ''a better artificial limb for my mother.'' Said one U.S. official: ''We have to be so careful what we say, because it gets into the chat rooms right away.'' 
 Hearing stories like this, you have to wonder: are Bush officials right when they dismiss all of this talk that President Bush has made America more unpopular in the world now than at any other time in postwar history? Do people really hate us? Don't those visa lines say otherwise? This is worth a closer look.
 To begin with, there a few ''technical'' reasons why anti-Americanism generally does not have the same edge in Asia as in Europe and the Middle East. Asia's leaders, as a group, have much more legitimacy than leaders in the Arab world, either because they have come to power through free elections or because they have delivered on their core promise to their people of economic growth. Because of that, they don't need to demonize America regularly to deflect their people's anger from them. Also, Asia generally is focused like a laser on economic development -- and countries like China see investment and technology transfer from America as critical to their growth. ''People in Asia do not hate the United States,'' Singapore's elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew, said to me. ''Big countries like China and India are focused right now on their economic development and they see in America an enormous well to draw technology and economic growth from.''
 But here's the problem: Young people want American education and technology more than ever, but fewer and fewer want to wear our T-shirts anymore -- want to be identified as ''pro-American.'' As one former U.S. diplomat in Beijing put it to me: ''They want to cherry-pick us, not line up with us. We've lost prestige.''
 The idea of America as the embodiment of the promise of freedom and democracy -- not just of technology and high living standards -- is integral to how we think of ourselves, but it is no longer how a lot of others think of us. They are now compartmentalizing. The unilateral war in Iraq, the postwar mess there, the walk-away from Kyoto and other treaties, the Abu Ghraib scandal have taken a toll. The idea of America as embodying the charisma of democracy has been damaged. As the political theorist Yaron Ezrahi put it, ''America as the do-gooder has been hurt, but America as the goods-doer is still there.''
 Fortunately, this situation is not irreparable. The longing for an America that exports hope, not fear, and that is an example of the best global practices and values, runs really deep in the world. In fact, it is one reason that some people abroad are so angry with President Bush -- because they blame him for taking that America away from them. I'm convinced a different approach or different administration would elicit a big response from the world. But for now, we will pay a price, because when people want to line up for our visas but not for our policies, it means Americans alone will have to bear the burden and the price of those policies.
 That is not good for us. When you lose your status as a power with values, you weaken your ability to fight those powers without values.

 BODY:
Back in 1990, Geoffrey Canada was just your average do-gooder. That year, he became the president of a nonprofit charitable organization based in Harlem called the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, and he set out trying to improve the world, one poor child at a time. It was a bad moment to be poor in New York City. Harlem, especially, was suffering under the simultaneous plagues of crack cocaine, cheap guns and rampant homelessness, and Canada's main goal at Rheedlen, in those years, was to keep the children in his programs alive. The organization had an annual budget of $3 million, which it spent on a predictable array of services in Upper Manhattan: after-school programs, truancy prevention, anti-violence training for teenagers. The programs seemed to do a lot of good for the children who were enrolled in them, at least in part because of Canada's own level of devotion. He was obsessed with his job, personally invested in the lives of the children he was helping and devastated when they ended up in prison or on drugs or shot dead on the street. 
 But after he ran these programs for a few years, day in and day out, his ideas about poverty started to change. The catalyst was surprisingly simple: a waiting list. One Rheedlen after-school program had more children who wanted to enroll than it was able to admit. So Canada chose the obvious remedy: he drew up a waiting list, and it quickly filled with the names of children who needed his help and couldn't get it. That bothered him, and it kept bothering him, and before long it had him thinking differently about his entire organization. Sure, the 500 children who were lucky enough to be participating in one of his programs were getting help, but why those 500 and not the 500 on the waiting list? Or why not another 500 altogether? For that matter, why 500 and not 5,000? If all he was doing was picking some kids to save and letting the rest fail, what was the point?
 At around the same time, he was invited by Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense Fund, to join a group she had recently founded called the Black Community Crusade for Children. Once a year, she brought together two dozen leaders from across the country who were trying to solve the problems of poor black children. They met down at a farm in Tennessee that had once been owned by Alex Haley, the author of ''Roots,'' and they spent a few days comparing notes on the crisis in America's poor neighborhoods. For Canada, the good news at these discussions was that he wasn't alone -- but that was the bad news, too. All across the country, in big cities and in small towns, well-meaning nonprofits were finding the same thing: they were helping a few kids, getting them out of the ghettos and off the streets and sometimes even into college, but for the masses of poor children, and especially those who were black, nothing was changing; those children were still falling behind in school, scoring below average on reading tests and staying poor. 
 Most of the men and women who were meeting in Tennessee were from Canada's generation -- he is 52 -- and they had come of age in the hopeful period following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, when things seemed as if they were about to improve for poor black Americans. But as Edelman convened her group, life in the ghettos was getting worse, not better. To Canada, it felt as if he and his peers were losing more children more quickly than they had ever lost before. For the first time, he felt a sense of hopelessness, and he found himself thinking that the kids he was seeing in kindergarten in Harlem were already doomed, destined to spend the rest of their lives stuck at the bottom.
 Canada knew there were success stories out there. There were always reports in the newspapers about ''special'' kids who ''overcame the odds.'' Some brilliant teacher or charity or millionaire went into the ghetto and found 100 kids and educated them and turned their lives around. But those stories seemed counterproductive to Canada. Instead of helping some kids beat the odds, he thought, why don't we just change the odds? When he looked around, though, he couldn't find anyone who knew how to do that. Experts in his field had figured out how to educate one disadvantaged child, or one classroom full of kids, but the benefits were localized, and usually temporary. And no one had any idea how to change a whole school system or a whole housing project, or for that matter a whole neighborhood. So, in the middle of the 1990's, that's what Geoffrey Canada decided he would do. And now, 10 years later, he has become a very different kind of do-gooder, one with a mission both radically ambitious and startlingly simple. He wants to prove that poor children, and especially poor black children, can succeed -- that is, achieve good reading scores, good grades and good graduation rates -- and not just the smartest or the most motivated or the ones with the most attentive parents, but all of them, in big numbers. Three years ago, he chose as his laboratory a 24-block zone of central Harlem, now expanded to 60 blocks -- an area with about 6,500 children, more than 60 percent of whom live below the poverty line and three-quarters of whom score below grade level on statewide reading and math tests -- and he named it the Harlem Children's Zone.
 After welfare reform passed in 1996, the national debate on poverty seemed simply to shut down. Most conservatives explain poverty by looking to culture and behavior: bad parenting, high out-of-wedlock birth rates, teenagers who don't know the value of an honest day's work. To most liberals, the real problems are economic: underfinanced public schools and a dearth of well-paying semiskilled jobs, which make it nearly impossible for families to pull themselves out of poverty. Canada says he believes that both assumptions are true. He agrees that the economy is stacked against poor people no matter how hard they work, but he also thinks that poor parents aren't doing a good enough job of rearing their children. What makes Canada's project unique is that it addresses both problems at once. He keeps the liberals happy by pouring money into schools and day-care centers and after-school programs, and he satisfies the conservatives by directly taking on the problems of inadequate parenting and the cultural disadvantages of a ghetto home life. It's not just that he's trying to work both sides of the ideological street. It's that Canada has concluded that neither approach has a chance of working alone. Fix the schools without fixing the families and the community, and children will fail; but they will also fail if you improve the surrounding community without fixing the schools.
 Canada's new program combines educational, social and medical services. It starts at birth and follows children to college. It meshes those services into an interlocking web, and then it drops that web over an entire neighborhood. It operates on the principle that each child will do better if all the children around him are doing better. So instead of waiting for residents to find out about the services on their own, the organization's recruiters go door-to-door to find participants, sometimes offering prizes and raffles and free groceries to parents who enroll their children in the group's programs. What results is a remarkable level of ''market penetration,'' as the organization describes it. Eighty-eight percent of the roughly 3,400 children under 18 in the 24-block core neighborhood are already served by at least one program, and this year Canada began to extend his programs to the larger 60-block zone. The objective is to create a safety net woven so tightly that children in the neighborhood just can't slip through.
 At a moment when each new attempt to solve the problem of poverty seems to fall apart, one after the next, what is going on in central Harlem is one of the biggest social experiments of our time. Social scientists and poverty advocates are watching carefully to see if Canada can pull it off. Many are skeptical; they have seen too many ambitious anti-poverty programs collapse because of budget overruns or administrative hubris, and Canada acknowledges that his work has just begun. But the sheer scale of Canada's project has created a palpable excitement among foundation officials, poverty scholars and business leaders. Marian Wright Edelman said that though there are a few other good neighborhood-based programs around the country, ''none are as comprehensive as the Harlem Children's Zone, and none of them hold as much promise.'' 
 David Saltzman, executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation, concurred: ''If it works, it'll be the best thing that's happened in a long time. Man, if Geoff can make this thing work, it's huge.''
The programs that the Harlem Children's Zone offers all seem carefully planned and well run, but none of them, on their own, are particularly revolutionary. It is only when they are considered together, as a network, that they seem so new. The organization employs more than 650 people in more than 20 programs; on a recent afternoon, I spent some time walking around Harlem, dropping in on one program after another. At Harlem Gems, a program for 40 prekindergarten students at a public school on 118th Street, Keith, who had just turned 5 and was missing a front tooth, sat at a computer working away at ''Hooked on Phonics,'' while Luis, a 19-year-old tutor, gave him one-on-one instruction. A few blocks up Lenox Avenue, at the Employment and Technology Center, 30 teenagers in T-shirts and basketball jerseys, all part of the organization's new investment club, were gathered around a conference table, listening to an executive from Lehman Brothers explain the difference between the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq. At P.S. 76 on West 121st Street, fifth-grade students in an after-school program were standing in front of their peers, reading aloud the autobiographies they had written that afternoon. And over at Truce, the after-school center for teenagers, a tutor named Carl was helping Trevis, a student in the eighth grade, with a research project for his social studies class, an eight-page paper on the life of Frederick Douglass. In a nearby housing project, a counselor from the Family Support Center was paying a home visit to a woman who had just been granted legal custody of her two grandchildren; in other apartments in the neighborhood, outreach workers from Baby College, a class for new parents, were making home visits of their own, helping teach better parenting techniques. A few blocks away, at the corner of Madison Avenue and 125th Street, construction was under way on the organization's new headquarters, a six-story, $44 million building that will also house the Promise Academy, a new charter school that Canada is opening in the fall.
 While the new building is going up, Canada works on Park Avenue between 130th Street and 131st Street, in a small office in a six-story building that always seems to be under renovation. When I visited him on an icy afternoon in February, the radiator in his office was hissing constantly; when the room got too hot, Canada propped his window open with a book about community revitalization. That cooled things off, but it also created a new distraction. Directly outside Canada's second-floor window, no more than 20 feet away, are the elevated tracks that carry every Metro-North train heading out of Grand Central Terminal toward Connecticut and Westchester County. Each time a train passed, full of commuters on their way back to the suburbs, a rumbling filled the room, and Canada leaned a little closer so that I could make out what he was saying.
 He is a tall, lean, athletic man with rounded shoulders and long limbs, and on this afternoon he was wearing a dark suit and a light blue shirt with his monogram sewn over the breast pocket. His graying hair was cropped close to his scalp. His office is spare -- a desk with a phone and a computer and a few piles of mail. There's a coat rack for his suit jacket, a bookshelf and a small round table with four chairs where he holds meetings. On his desk is a big picture of his 5-year-old son, Geoffrey Jr., from his second marriage. On the wall behind his desk are photographs -- Canada with President Clinton, Canada with Mayor Bloomberg -- as well as a portrait of a dozen or so of the young people he has trained in tae kwon do, which he has been teaching two nights a week for 21 years. A framed citation on the opposite wall certifies him as a third-degree black belt.
 Although Canada likes to say that he is sick of against-the-odds success stories, he is one himself. He grew up on Union Avenue in the South Bronx. His father left when he was 4, and his mother reared him and his three brothers herself, sometimes supporting them with wages from menial jobs and sometimes relying on welfare and food from local charities. In his memoir ''Fist Stick Knife Gun,'' Canada describes the rituals and codes of violence that governed life for children like him, growing up in the inner city in the 50's and 60's. As a teenager, he drank and fought and smoked pot and carried a knife, but he also stayed in school, worked in a factory in the evenings and won a scholarship to Bowdoin College in Maine, and from there went on to earn a degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
 Bowdoin doesn't have many black alumni, and so when a promising black high-school senior is applying to the college from New York, the admissions office often sends the student to Canada for an alumni interview. When I arrived at his office, Canada was firing questions at Julian, a 17-year-old from Brooklyn who attends a magnet school. Canada made notes on a clipboard as Julian talked, answered a few of his questions about Bowdoin and Maine and then shook his hand and showed him out.
 ''He's a good kid, and I think he'll be terrific at Bowdoin,'' Canada said as he sat back down. ''But he's not my kid.'' Not a Harlem Children's Zone kid, he meant. ''He comes from a family, they've got it together, his parents are both educators. That's not us. We want those other kids, the ones who don't have two parents, whose parents haven't gone to college, who haven't got a chance statistically of making it.'' 
 This distinction -- between children who are ''his kids'' and children who aren't -- is one that Canada draws all the time, and it goes back a long way in his own personal history. In ''Fist Stick Knife Gun,'' published in 1995, he describes a summer night when he was 14. He and half a dozen friends were sitting on someone's stoop drinking Rheingold when a car came screeching up and a man they didn't know got out and challenged one of them to a fight. The fight started, and at first it went according to the rules of Union Avenue, meaning no weapons and no one else gets involved. But then the stranger pulled out a gun, which was almost unheard of in 1966. Canada was ready to run, but instead he and his friends slowly converged on the older, bigger, better-armed man and scared him off the block through the strength of their numbers. What he learned that day, he wrote, was that he and his friends ''loved one another enough to be willing to die.''
 When Canada talks about ''my kids'' now, he means the 6,500 children who live in the Harlem Children's Zone. But even more than that, he means the least successful children in the neighborhood. When he talks about them, it feels personal, as if his real objective is to work with children just like the cold, tough, frustrated boys he grew up with on Union Avenue, most of whom are now dead or in prison -- to make amends for the past by saving Harlem's children today.
 Still, Canada's approach to poverty is not sentimental. When he considers any given poor family living in the Harlem Children's Zone, he divides their problems up in his mind into the ones he needs to solve and the ones he doesn't need to solve. The ones he needs to solve are the ones that are keeping the child from succeeding in school. Everything else, he has decided, he can leave alone. ''Do we think that it would be better for our parents to be married?'' he said, tilting back in his chair. ''Absolutely. Why? Because two-parent families have more income. Children tend to do better when they have two parents in the house.'' In fact, he knows that the great majority of births in Harlem are to single mothers and that most of the parents whose children he serves are unmarried. ''But what ability do we have to make an impact on that?'' he asked. ''None. Right? If we tried to do that, we'd spend all our time just doing that.''
 Canada admitted that he is engaged in a kind of triage. He described for me an imaginary Harlem parent. ''You can be 20 years old, with a job that doesn't pay you enough money to survive on,'' he said. ''You're underemployed. You've got a kid. The kid's not doing well in school. You've got no place for the kid to be after school. Well, we'll provide services for that child. But we're not going to solve the problem of you being underemployed. That's not going to go away.''
 He is, in other words, sidestepping the macroeconomic solutions that some advocates insist are the only way to solve the problem of poverty -- better wages, a national jobs program, a bigger earned-income tax credit -- in favor of programs that in one way or another directly affect the performance of the neighborhood's poor children. 
 Canada's educational philosophy emphasizes accountability and testing, and in that way it is similar to the dominant idea in public education today. The doctrine of accountability -- the idea that if students do poorly on standardized tests, schools should lose their financing and teachers should lose their jobs -- first emerged in the late 80's and early 90's in the Houston public schools. It then moved to the White House as the basis of the No Child Left Behind law when Rod Paige, the superintendent of the Houston schools, became the education secretary under George W. Bush. In the past year, though, news reports and lawsuits have revealed that when schools are compelled to meet certain numbers -- graduation rates, standardized-test scores -- their administrators often succumb to the urge to cheat. In Houston and New York, principals have shoved troubled students out of school, often under an administrative sleight of hand, in order to keep their schools' numbers artificially high. Canada has set the same rigorous goals for his own organization, but for him, the urge is the opposite: not to push the worst kids aside, but to recruit them even harder. 
 On this afternoon, Canada was worried about a set of internal statistics he had just uncovered: some of his students seemed to be doing too well. Last fall, his organization started a new program in four Harlem public schools called the Fifth Grade Institute, an after-school program for 160 fifth-grade students designed to begin catching them up to grade level before the charter school opens in September. Canada wanted to calculate how much the program was improving the reading ability of these students, so he asked to see their scores on the previous year's citywide fourth-grade reading test for comparison. Reading scores in New York City public schools are delivered in four categories, the higher the better. A 4 means the child is reading above grade level; a 3 means the child is reading at grade level; a 2 means below grade level; and a 1 means significantly below grade level. In most of the city, 2's and 3's predominate, with some 4's thrown in. In schools in Harlem, though, about three-quarters of the students score either a 1 or a 2; there are a few 3's, and 4's are rare. 
 But when Canada looked at the scores for the children in the Fifth Grade Institute, he found a lot of 3's -- more than a random sampling of Harlem students would have drawn. And on the day I visited, he was worried that the process of recruiting students for the Fifth Grade Institute had somehow been selective. He was sure it wasn't conscious on the part of his administrators, and, in fact, when he later received more detailed scores, they seemed more in line with the neighborhood patterns. Still, it was only natural, he knew, that parents who would bother to sign their children up for an ambitious after-school program would tend to be the better-organized, better-educated ones, and so it wouldn't be surprising if their children were better readers. Maybe his kids, the 1's and 2's, hadn't heard about the program, or maybe their parents hadn't managed to get it together in time to sign them up. 
So what do you do? If you offer a new program, the best students will naturally enroll first, but you want the worst students. How do you get those parents to apply? Sometimes, in Canada's experience, it happens by accident. In 2001, the first year the Harlem Children's Zone offered Harlem Gems, its Head Start-like program for 4-year-olds, the organizers were behind schedule and didn't manage to send out fliers and start recruiting until August, just a few weeks before the program began. All the well-organized parents had already made their child-care plans for the year, and the last-minute, overburdened parents were the ones who signed up. That gave Canada the demographic he wanted, and he was able to get concrete results. When the 4-year-olds started Harlem Gems in 2001, 53 percent were scoring ''delayed'' or ''very delayed'' on the Bracken Basic Concept Scale for school readiness. At the end of the yearlong program, 26 percent were delayed. 
 In that case, the search for the most delayed kids worked because the organizers got lucky. Usually, though, it involves a lot of knocking on doors. I went out one morning with two outreach workers, Francesca Silfa and Mark Frazier, as they searched through central Harlem for new parents to enroll in Baby College. They knocked on the door of every apartment in a 21-story building on 118th Street, looking for parents with children under 4, leaving fliers under the doors if no one answered. They didn't meet with any resistance or hostility, although they did get a few skeptical looks. Mostly the process seemed slow and painstaking. Whenever they ran into Baby College graduates in the halls, they stopped to chat, prodding them for suggestions of good candidates in the building or elsewhere on the block. In addition to the door-to-door approach, recruiters visit laundromats, supermarkets and check-cashing outlets to look for new mothers. On the day I was with them, Silfa approached one woman pushing a stroller down 118th Street and managed to sign her and her daughter up on the spot.
 For most parents, the attractions of a program like Baby College are obvious: useful information, the relief of spending Saturday morning getting to know other mothers instead of being stuck in a cramped apartment and free child care during class time. But if those aren't enough of a pull, there are raffles at the end of each class for $50 Old Navy gift certificates and a big drawing at the end of the course in which one parent wins a month's rent.
 This combination of door-knocking, cajoling and offering incentives seems to work, and each nine-week session of Baby College draws a class of more than 100 parents, all of whom receive weekly follow-up visits at home. More than 95 percent of the parents -- 677 so far -- have successfully completed the course. The real test of this approach, Canada said when we spoke in February, will come when the Promise Academy opens its doors. By law, the charter school will be open to students from anywhere in the city's five boroughs, which means a lottery to choose the incoming classes from a broader pool of applicants. But the only students Canada really wants in his school are the ones from central Harlem, and especially the lowest-performing ones, exactly those whose parents, he said, are least inclined to apply to send their children to a special school.
 ''I will make sure that every single poor-performing school and parent in Harlem knows about this program,'' Canada said back in February. ''And if we don't get more 1's and 2's than 3's, then we haven't done our job properly.'' What that will require, Canada said, is persistent recruiting. ''We're going to have to go and force some of these parents to come and fill out the application,'' he said. Even once he finds the 1's and 2's, he added, ''their parents may say no, which means we have to go back and figure out a way to bribe them and get them to say yes. And I hate to put it like that, but that's what we'll end up doing. We'll end up saying, 'If you get your kid to apply, you'll get free movie passes.'''
 The point of all of this intensive recruiting is to amass evidence -- indisputable data that show exactly what it will take to level the playing field and get poor children performing on the same level as the city's middle-class children. ''If we just end up saving a bunch of kids in Harlem, that will be good for them, but it won't mean an awful lot to me in the long run,'' Canada said. ''We want to be able to say that thousands of poor children can learn at high levels and perform at rates that are the same as middle-class children if they are given the opportunity to do so. But I want to be clear when I say we've got an answer that we really have an answer.''
 The answer that Canada wants to provide is in fact very much in demand. There are plenty of examples of programs that didn't work: in 2000, for example, the Heinz Endowments abandoned as a failure a $59 million, five-year program to provide early-childhood care and education for 7,600 low-income children in and around Pittsburgh. The program's costs soared, and four years in, when Heinz pulled the plug, only 680 children were being served. What is most startling about the current study of poverty is how little conclusive evidence there is about which cures do work. There are no more than a dozen studies in the field that track how successful various interventions are over the long term, and the evidence from those studies tends to be spotty and subject to debate. 
 To William Julius Wilson, the Harvard sociologist who is one of the country's leading thinkers on urban poverty, this is precisely the significance of the Harlem Children's Zone. ''It is very, very important for policy makers to be able to cite examples of how you can improve the life chances of disadvantaged kids,'' he said. ''There are so many people who feel that whatever you do, it's not going to work. They want to say, 'Well, there's just a culture of poverty out there, and you can't really change it.''' If Canada's project is successful, though, Wilson said, it will ''provide the ammunition to policy makers who want to do something to address the problems of poverty.'' It will allow them to say: ''Here are kids who would ordinarily end up as permanent economic proletarians, and here is a program that has been able to overcome the cumulative disadvantages of chronic subordination. So why not commit ourselves across the nation to try to duplicate what he's done?'' 
 Canada has a vivid picture in his mind of a judgment day to come -- 8, 10, 12 years down the road. Children who are now entering the system as infants will be taking their third-grade citywide math and reading tests, and they'll be scoring at or above grade level. Children who entered the system as Harlem Gems will be graduating from high school -- he expects that 90 percent of his students will graduate on time. It is only at that point, he explained, that he will be able to say to the rest of the country: ''This isn't an abstract conversation anymore. If you want poor children to do as well as middle-class children'' -- not necessarily to be superachievers but to become what he calls ''typical Americans,'' able to compete for jobs -- ''we now know how to do it.'' If he's right, the services he will provide will cost about $1,400 a year per student, on top of existing public-school funds. The country will finally know, he said, what the real price tag is for poor children to succeed.
Canada first came up with the idea for the Harlem Children's Zone in the mid-90's, but it wasn't until a few years later that he was ready to propose it officially to the board of the Rheedlen Centers (as the organization was then known). Crime had dropped sharply in Harlem, as it had everywhere in New York City, and Canada was no longer overwhelmed by the daily anxiety of trying to prevent the children in his programs from being killed. The national economy was booming, housing prices in the neighborhood were climbing and the first signs of gentrification were appearing, but for children in Harlem, the situation hadn't improved much. The unemployment rate there was still very high. (Even now, after the arrival of new middle-class residents, it stands at 18.5 percent.) It was in this context that Canada went before the Rheedlen board in 1998 and said that he wanted to remake the organization completely, to set up a kind of project that had never been tried before. 
 Canada had recently brought on a new board member, a fellow Bowdoin alumnus named Stan Druckenmiller, who, while running George Soros's Quantum Fund, became one of the most successful hedge-fund managers in the history of the stock market, amassing a personal fortune estimated at more than $1 billion. After Canada laid out his proposal to the board, Druckenmiller took him aside and told him that in his opinion he had the right plan but the wrong board. Canada agreed, and the two men politely deposed the chairman and replaced him with Druckenmiller, who set about raising money and recruiting new board members from the higher echelons of Wall Street.
 The organization now has a lot more money than it did a few years ago. Druckenmiller paid for about a third of the cost of the new headquarters himself, and board members contribute about a third of the annual operating budget. (The rest comes from foundations, the government and private donors.) In April, the organization held a glittering fund-raising dinner at Cipriani 42nd Street, a cavernous former bank building converted into a restaurant, and raised $2.8 million in a single night, mostly from bankers and stockbrokers. (The 2003 fund-raiser, by comparison, pulled in $1.5 million.)
 Financiers and C.E.O.'s are drawn to the Harlem Children's Zone not just because of its mission but also because of the way it is run. In fact, the relationship the organization has with its donors is as unusual, arguably, as the program itself. In the late 90's, Allen Grossman, then the president of Outward Bound U.S.A. and now a management professor at the Harvard Business School, began studying the nonprofit sector from a business perspective. It was a mess, he concluded: in an article in The Harvard Business Review in 1997, he described a hopelessly dysfunctional relationship between foundations and nonprofit organizations, in which foundations made short-term grants to pet projects, nonprofits spent all their time chasing money and each side had a vested interest in maintaining the reassuring fiction that failing programs were actually succeeding. Grossman proposed that philanthropists start thinking more like venture capitalists: searching out nonprofits with innovative long-term ideas, financing them early, insisting on transparency and frequent evaluation and nurturing them along the way with expert advice and continuing infusions of capital. 
 One of the first foundations to take Grossman's ideas seriously was the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, which had been financing Rheedlen for years. In 1999, Nancy Roob, the foundation's grant manager, approached Canada and offered him $250,000, plus the dedicated services of a new management consultancy for nonprofits called the Bridgespan Group, to write a new business plan. This was unheard of: when philanthropists give away a quarter of a million dollars, they generally want the money to go directly to poor people, with as little overhead as possible. Clark, by contrast, was inviting Canada to spend the foundation's money -- first the $250,000, and eventually another $1 million -- entirely on overhead: on developing the business plan; creating a new, more hierarchical management structure; buying new technology for an internal communication system; and constructing a rigorous and continuing process of self-evaluation. 
 The business plan that Canada's team came up with proposed a steady increase in the annual budget over nine years, from $6 million to $10 million to $46 million. (This year, four years in, it is $24 million.) The plan reads more like a corporate strategy document than a charity prospectus. It refers to ''market-penetration targets'' and ''new information technology applications,'' including a ''performance-tracking system.'' In practice, too, the organization feels more like a business than a nonprofit, which offers comforting visuals to donors: everyone at the headquarters wears a suit, every meeting starts on time and there is a constant flow of evaluations, reports and budgets. ''Geoff could be a C.E.O. at any S.&P. 500 company,'' Druckenmiller said, and he meant it as a compliment.
During the months I spent visiting Canada, the issue of education took up more and more of his time and attention. When we first spoke, almost a year ago, he described all of the organization's programs -- an initiative to combat asthma, an organizing campaign for tenants -- as equally important. But as the months wore on, it seemed, all he could think about were the problems in the schools. He was pouring more and more resources into Harlem's public schools, paying for in-class tutors and after-school reading programs, and scores had barely budged. He was beginning to see it as a systemic problem, he said, something that couldn't be solved by the kind of supplementary services he was offering. ''We've got to really do something radically different if we're going to save these kids,'' he told me in the fall. ''If we keep fooling around on the fringes, I know 10 years will go by, and instead of 75 percent of the kids in Harlem scoring below grade level on their reading scores, maybe it will be 70 percent, or maybe it will be 65 percent. People will say, 'Oh, we're making progress.' But that to me is not progress. This is much more urgent than that.''
 So at the same time that he has been working inside the school system with a greater intensity than before, he has also begun to try to opt out of it, by establishing charter schools. Beginning in September, the Harlem Children's Zone plans to start educating its own students at two locations. The Promise Academy, which will eventually be a kindergarten-through-12th-grade charter school, will start with a kindergarten and sixth-grade class in September. The sixth grade will be housed in the organization's new headquarters on 125th Street; the kindergarten is expected to open inside an existing public school. The academy will expand over the course of seven years into a school of 1,300 students. The curriculum will be intense: classes will run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., five days a week -- an hour and a half longer than regular city schools. After-school programs will run until 6 p.m., and the school year will continue well into July. 
 Although charter schools are regulated by the state, and are outside the city's control, Joel I. Klein, the city's schools chancellor, has supported Canada's charter-school efforts. Canada said he sees Bloomberg and Klein as his allies, which is a strange feeling, he said, because for so long he felt as if he were at war with the school system. Soon after Klein was appointed, in the fall of 2002, he called Canada and set up a meeting. Canada said that the proposals Klein laid out for the entire school system -- greater accountability, more charter schools, more involvement for outside groups -- were exactly what Canada had been waiting to hear. In the summer of 2003, Klein appointed Lucille Swarns to be the regional superintendent for Upper Manhattan, and when Canada met her, he was once again pleasantly surprised. 
 ''When I first came here in the early 1980's,'' Canada said, ''we felt that District 3'' -- which stretches from the Upper West Side into central Harlem -- ''ran a system almost of apartheid, where below 96th Street, the schools were doing great, and the schools we cared about were doing lousy.'' Even after his organization began spending a million dollars a year in the district's schools, he said, he never once got a call from the district superintendent. With Swarns things were different right away. 
 The most surprising aspect of the new collaboration between Klein and Canada is that the chancellor is encouraging the Harlem Children's Zone's plans to convert existing public schools in Harlem into charter schools. Canada has received conditional approval from Klein to start a slowly expanding charter school, beginning this fall with the Promise Academy's kindergarten class. As those children move through the school, the organization will take over control of an additional grade each year, sharing the building with the public school while gradually supplanting it. In six years, Canada explained, ''we're going to put the existing school out of business'' -- and he said he hopes that that school is only the beginning.
 All of which makes skeptics, especially those in the teachers' union, wonder about Canada's motivation. Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said that she used to be friendly with Canada, even attending his fund-raisers, until Bloomberg and Klein came into office and started making threatening noises toward her union. ''Since the mayor became mayor, Geoff Canada has stopped having any relationship with us,'' she said. 
 In her opinion, Canada's new attitude comes down to politics: ''I think what's happened is that they've decided that they'll work with the mayor, and that they won't work with the public-school system except through the mayor and the chancellor'' -- meaning that they won't work with the teachers' union. Canada often speaks of the opposition that his charter-school plan is going to face from the teachers' union and what he calls the educational establishment, but to Weingarten, it's the other way around: it's Canada who is picking this fight, demonizing the teachers' union in order to score political points with the mayor. ''They are working very secretly with the Board of Education and the Bloomberg administration'' on the charter-school plan, she said, a strategy that she said was shortsighted, not least because it is far from certain that Bloomberg will be re-elected. ''If you truly want schools to succeed,'' she said, ''you work with the people who represent the teachers.''
 The battle between the teachers' union and City Hall has been going on for decades, but it has reached an unusually high pitch under Bloomberg. Canada clearly feels a genuine ideological kinship with the mayor, and with Klein, but there's also an immediate advantage to his alliance with them: his charter schools will use nonunion teachers; they will be paid more than public-school teachers, he said, but they will also work longer days, and for 12 months a year. Canada also wanted a free hand to fire teachers who weren't performing up to his expectations -- authority Canada said he felt sure the union would not give him. At his new school, he will have it. 
In the days and weeks leading up to the charter-school lottery, the organization's outreach workers did exactly what Geoffrey Canada said they would do: they went door-to-door in housing projects, they tracked down recalcitrant mothers and fathers, they solicited applications from the parents of children in every one of their programs. And by the evening of the lottery, a rainy Tuesday in April, they had received 359 applications for just 180 slots -- 90 in the kindergarten class and 90 in the sixth grade. Legally, they could have held the lottery behind closed doors and simply mailed out acceptance letters, but Canada wanted it to be a real event, so he arranged to hold the lottery in public, in the auditorium of P.S. 242 on West 122nd Street.
 By the time the lottery began, the place was packed. Every seat was filled with a hopeful parent or a prospective student or a patient sibling, and late arrivals were standing in the aisles or cramming themselves into the back of the room. Multicolored helium balloons were tied to the end of each row of seats, which gave the room a festive air, but more than anything the place felt nervous. 
 Canada took the stage. On a long table next to him, a gold drum held a jumble of index cards, each one printed with the name of a child. ''We are calling our school Promise Academy because we are making a promise to all of our parents,'' Canada said from behind a lectern. ''If your child is in our school, we will guarantee that child succeeds. There will be no excuses. We're not going to say, 'The child failed because they came from a home with only one parent.' We're not going to say, 'The child failed because they're new immigrants into the country.' If your child gets into our school, that child is going to succeed. If you work with us as parents, we are going to do everything -- and I mean everything -- to see that your child gets a good education.''
 And then the drawing began, starting with the kindergarten class. Doreen Land, the charter schools' newly hired superintendent, read the first name into a microphone: ''Dijon Brinnard.'' A whoop went up from the back of the auditorium, and a jubilant mother started edging her way out of her row, proudly clutching the hand of her 4-year-old son. Land smiled and took the next card: ''Kasim-Seann Cisse.'' Another whoop, some applause and then another name.
 At the front of the auditorium, Canada greeted each mother (or, occasionally, father) and child. Proud parents shook his hand and introduced their children, beaming on their way back to their seats. In the second row, a woman in her 40's, wearing an ''I Love New York'' T-shirt and a red nylon jacket, sat with her head bowed and her eyes shut tight, her lips moving in an anxious prayer. And then Land called the name ''Jaylene Fonseca,'' and the woman's eyes flew open. She made her way to the front, shook Canada's hand and then told me that her name was Wilma Jure and that Jaylene was her niece, a 4-year-old already enrolled in Harlem Gems. As her eyes filled with tears, she explained that Jaylene's mother, Jure's sister, was living in the city's shelter system for homeless families. Most nights, Jaylene slept with her mother in a shelter on 41st Street, then spent the day in Harlem Gems. ''It's an amazing program for people like us who really don't have the means to send our kids to get such a good education,'' Jure said. ''I mean, she's learning French,'' she added, a little incredulous. Now Jaylene was guaranteed a spot in the Promise Academy from kindergarten through the end of high school. It was hard not to feel that her life had just changed for the better, with the draw of a card.
 As the evening wore on, though, the mood in the auditorium started to shift. The kindergarten lottery ended, the chosen students trooped out to the cafeteria for a group photo and the sixth-grade lottery began. In the front row, Virainia Utley sat with her daughter Janiqua, listening to the names being called. Utley is something of a model parent in the Harlem Children's Zone. Janiqua is in the Fifth Grade Institute at P.S. 242, and her three younger siblings -- Jaquan, Janisha and John -- are all enrolled in the computer-assisted after-school reading program. Utley is the vice president of her tenants' association, which was organized by Community Pride, the community-organizing division, and she is a regular presence at Zone events. When I first met her, months earlier, she was already talking about Janiqua going to the Promise Academy. But now the lottery numbers were rising -- 54, 55, 56 -- and her name hadn't yet been called. 
 After Land read out the 90th name, Canada took the stage again and explained to the remaining parents that it wasn't likely that there would be room for their children in the sixth grade. Land would read out the rest of the names and put them on a waiting list, he said, but this part wouldn't be much fun. He encouraged everyone to go home. Land went back to reading names, and Utley and Janiqua sat and listened, still in their seats, as the waiting list grew and the number of cards in the drum dwindled. By the time Land got to the 80th place on the waiting list, Utley told me, she and Janiqua were just waiting to make sure her name was called. Maybe her card got lost, she said, or stuck to another card. The room was thinning out, and the only remaining parents were angry ones. One by one they were letting Canada know how they felt. A line of parents came up to him to find out what could be done to get their children into the school, and he had to tell each one the same thing: nothing could be done. One woman, who was too angry to give me her name, spat out her complaint. ''It's not fair,'' she shouted. ''And I don't like it.'' Why drag everyone out on a rainy night, she wanted to know, just to sit in a public-school auditorium and feel like losers? 
 Finally, at No. 111 on the waiting list, Janiqua Utley's name was called, and her mother rose, took her by the hand and started up the aisle to the backdoor. As workers began sweeping up coffee cups and popped balloons, I sat down next to Canada. He looked exhausted, overwhelmed not only by the evening but also by the enormity of the task ahead of him. His eyes were watery, and as we talked, he dabbed periodically at his nose with his folded-up handkerchief. ''I was trying to get folks to leave and not to hang around to be the last kid called,'' he said. ''This is very hard for me to see. It's very, very sad. These parents feel, Well, there go my child's chances.''
 It was a waiting list, I reminded him, that had started him on the path toward the Harlem Children's Zone more than a decade ago -- and now, despite all the millions of dollars, and the staff of 650 and the backing of the mayor, he is still setting up waiting lists. He nodded. ''We've got to do more,'' he said. ''We've got to do better.'' He sighed and looked up at the stage, where Land had just reached No. 150.

HEADLINE: The Battle of Kings Park

 BODY:
We like smart growth. It perfectly fits our editorial creed, which is never support anything stupid.
 The term and its sister buzzword, New Urbanism, have been popping up all over Long Island lately, attached to various developers' plans to transform forlorn, neglected properties into artfully compact arrangements of homes, businesses and public amenities, with lots of open space left over.
 The rebel apostles of smart growth make no small claims for their approach, which has gained converts around the country but struggled to gain a beachhead on Long Island, the fortress of Old Suburbanism. With supreme self-confidence, they promise to rebuild community ties, ease the housing crisis, rev up the tax base, bolster schools, preserve woods and ball fields and make a profit, all while rescuing our souls from the evil grip of the automobile and the mall. They even throw in an obesity remedy: in smart-growth projects, you walk a lot. 
 Sounds smart to us, if a little messianic. But others are not so sure. To them, ''smart growth'' is what developers say when they want to coat greedy projects with a glaze of pure intentions. These are the doubters who leapt to the barricades in Kings Park recently to fight back a proposal to build a New Urbanist settlement of townhouses, apartments, cottages, shops, offices and a college campus on the site of the Kings Park Psychiatric Center.
 The 370-acre site is a tarnished gem -- a lush, green brownfield, full of crumbling buildings tainted with asbestos and lead paint. When LAMB Acquisitions, the investors behind the project, hired one of the country's most prominent New Urbanist firms, Duany Plater-Zyberk, to create a master plan, the stage was set for a mighty clash of visions.
 At least that was how Andres Duany, a Miami architect and a principal in Duany Plater-Zyberk, portrayed it at a public forum at Kings Park High School in April. He lamented the evils of arterial highways and cookie-cutter subdivisions. He said his ideas would ''help you stop spoiling this beautiful island the way you've been doing for 50 years.''
 Long Islanders are not used to hearing developers deplore the barren anonymity of their tract-house lives. (Pimply teenagers and childless yuppies are supposed to do that, not developers.) So the Kings Parkers bristled. How smart is a project, they asked, that brings more than 4,000 new residents to a quiet little corner of the North Shore? What about cars, noise and congestion? Won't it overwhelm the schools? No thanks, they said. That's why we're in Kings Park. Take your blueprints and go away.
 And on Monday, LAMB did. 
 The developer pulled out, blaming -- not very convincingly -- the state's inability to clear up complications over New York City's claim to the property under a 19th-century deed.
 The Old Suburbanists are celebrating victory, but how sweet is it? The Kings Park contamination will still have to be cleaned up -- a $40 million job. High-density development, Mr. Duany insisted, is the only feasible way to make that work. Then there is the urgent need for housing that young people and the empty-nester elderly can afford and that the Kings Park project promised in relative abundance. 
 Finally, there is the smart-growth trump card, repeatedly played by Mr. Duany in testy public forums. It is that growth is unavoidable, and that the only choice is whether to have it smart or dumb. This is particularly true in Nassau, which has no place left to sprawl.
 New Urbanist proposals have always struck us as wholly admirable, if a little fussy, heavy on pastels and blind to the merits of sloppy anarchy. (Imagine what Long Island might look like if Martha Stewart, not Robert Moses, had run the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority all those years.) 
 But we hope that the New Urbanists won't strike their tents after the Battle of Kings Park. If a critical mass of smart-growth projects, sensitively designed, can win over Long Islanders to a new, sensible vision, that would be a good thing. We're looking optimistically at other projects, like one in Brentwood on the site of the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center, and Old Plainview, recently unveiled in Nassau by the software mogul Charles Wang. 
 If Mr. Duany and his allies want to lift the curse of William Levitt and banish his ghost to wander the pine barrens forever without a plat map, then let them keep trying, and bless their fervent hearts.

HEADLINE: Heritage Area Plan Gets Little Interest

BYLINE: By DAVID WINZELBERG

 BODY:
SUPPOSE they gave a heritage area and nobody came?
 After several starts and stops, an eight-year effort to turn the North Shore into a state heritage area is battling apathy and will require an extension from state lawmakers for the looming deadline that could put an end to the plan. 
 The Long Island North Shore Heritage Area planning commission, including representatives of the state parks department, local governments and environmental and cultural groups, began to develop a management plan in 1999, and will eventually try to get both counties and the 63 municipalities within the area to adopt it.
 But attendance at dozens of public input sessions has been sparse, and many local officials are still not sure what the heritage area is. A bill to extend the September deadline for adoption of the designation to Dec. 31, 2006, was placed on the Assembly's agenda this month and was still pending as of Wednesday afternoon. 
 The heritage area, originally outlined as north of Route 25A from Great Neck to Port Jefferson, was expanded in 2000 to include everything north of the Long Island Expressway (or Route 25, whichever reaches farther south) to the Connecticut line and east to Orient Point. It is supposed to increase tourism by promoting the region's historic sites and facilitating economic revitalization around them. 
 The heritage area designation would also make it easier for a village or town to get grant money from the state for things like lighting improvements, street signs and other enhancements. An east-west ferry service for Long Island Sound, shuttle transportation to connect points of interest to the Long Island Rail Road and a ''regional destination'' experience center in Calverton are some of the proposals advocated by the planning commission.
 ''We're not saying that it all has to look like New England or it all has to look like Port Jeff, but we want to get Long Islanders to look at their neighborhoods in a whole new way,'' said one commission member, J. Lance Mallamo, executive director of the Vanderbilt Museum in Centerport.
 There are already 16 heritage areas in the state, ranging in size from a few city blocks in Buffalo to an area covering eight counties in the Mohawk Valley. (A proposal for a South Shore Heritage Trail is languishing in Albany.) More than $35 million in grants have been awarded for projects within the areas since 1986, according to Wendy Gibson, a spokeswoman for the state parks department, and commission members want the North Shore to get its share.
 ''Becoming a heritage area means extra points on grant applications,'' said John Coraor, a commission member and director of cultural affairs for the Town of Huntington. ''Without it, the money will go someplace else.'' Mr. Coraor said the heritage area designation would also encourage regional cooperation across local government jurisdictions and help Long Islanders recognize the marketable resources they have in their own backyard. 
 Assemblyman Steven Englebright, a Setauket Democrat, sponsored the legislation that created the North Shore Heritage Area in 1996. ''It will provide a sense of place,'' he said. ''I am also delighted that we will be eligible to get money for Long Island. With so many historic sites, we deserve it.''
 But confusion about the heritage area remains high. Some officials from villages within the area who were asked for comment on the plan mistakenly thought the heritage area management plan included only Route 25A, either in what the local tourism industry has taken to promoting as the highway's role as a conduit for espionage activity against the British forces that controlled the area during the Revolutionary War or as part of George Washington's route during his tour of the Island in 1790. Some had never heard of the plan at all.
 Commission members met with officials and planners from about two dozen local municipalities on Monday at the Muttontown Preserve in an effort to get more people up to speed on the heritage area plan.
 ''It's been frustrating to us that we're not engaging the public more,'' said Bernadette Castro, the state parks commissioner and a member of the heritage area commission. But Ms. Castro, who lives in Lloyd Harbor and has been a central player in bringing the heritage area idea to Long Island, said the designation elevated an area and gave people a sense of pride as well as a sense of place. ''What this really means,'' she said, ''is tourism dollars.''
 So far, the heritage area initiative for the North Shore has been financed mostly by the state through $320,000 in grants to the Town of Huntington, and commission members are raising $200,000 more from private sources to help pay for the planning firm, Peter J. Smith & Company of Buffalo. If the heritage area is adopted, administration offices and staff workers would probably be supported with funds from the state real estate transfer tax.
 ''There has been staggering development on the North Shore in recent years,'' said Mayor Richard P. Goodwin of Brookville. ''Anything that preserves what they have, people will look at favorably. We would hope most people will support it.''
 So far, just getting people to come out and hear about the heritage area proposal has proved daunting. ''People are really busy and it's not controversial,'' Mr. Mallamo said. But he added that the proposal was worthy. ''Long Island is building out,'' he said. ''We just want to preserve the quality of life.''

HEADLINE: Priced Out of Town

BYLINE: By DAVID KAPELL. 
David Kapell is the mayor of Greenport.

DATELINE: GREENPORT 

 BODY:
THERE is a housing crisis in Greenport as there is throughout Long Island. From 1980 to 2000, 25 percent of our housing stock was converted from year-round to vacation homes, and thus unavailable to local families. The average house price has risen to more than $400,000 from $30,000 in 1980. Meanwhile, median family income was just $36,333 in 2000. 
 These trends are accelerating, turning longtime residents into dinosaurs in their hometown. Only bold steps to promote high-density growth can offer hope that average families will be able to afford homes here. 
 Over the last few years, Greenport has emerged from economic depression to become a popular tourist destination. Boom times are nothing new here; the last involved shipbuilding during World War II. But until now, the booms didn't threaten our diversity and the well-being of longtime residents. Today, both are squarely on the line.
 The big difference between then and now has been the enactment, beginning in 1957, of increasingly exclusionary zoning laws by the Town of Southold, which includes most of the hamlets and farmland on the North Fork. The current law calls for every new house to be on at least a two-acre lot, which effectively prices out most local working people. It also draws an ever-tightening noose around Greenport, a densely populated incorporated village of 2,100 within Southold Town that has its own zoning laws allowing up to 10 housing units per acre. We long ago reached our municipal boundaries, and Southold's laws prevent market-driven growth beyond them.
 Recognizing an emergency, our village board proposed that Southold Town and the village together study the idea of allowing Greenport to expand by annexing adjacent vacant land. The idea is that Greenport's zoning laws and sewer services would induce private development of affordable homes. In a region of worsening traffic problems, it makes sense to encourage the growth of villages, where cars are needed least.
 Regrettably, the Southold Town Board rejected the proposal with no serious consideration. Instead, it has seen the village as an adversary and embarked on convoluted initiatives like a "housing fund" without any source of financing and an "inclusionary" zoning law, which would impose the burden of creating affordable housing on developers rather than providing incentives. These initiatives, pushed through without rigorous study or public debate, will at best produce only token new housing.
 The Greenport case is a metaphor for the region. According to a poll in The Long Island Index, published annually by the Rauch Foundation, 53 percent of island residents aged 18 to 34 are considering moving away because of high living costs. Albany is now considering the Long Island workforce housing bill, which would compel municipalities to require that 10 percent of new housing be priced affordably. The bill shows a recognition that our policies have failed, but I worry that state-mandated change would undermine home rule without solving the problem. Real change occurs at the local level only when public opinion is mobilized in support of common interests. What more common interest is there than keeping a roof over your head? 
 The answer is for local officials to take risks. Guided by careful analysis, they should lead the kind of spirited public debate that can produce consensus capable of withstanding the ''nimbyism'' that typically kills housing proposals. A proper role for the county, state and federal governments would be to provide financing for this participatory approach.
 In Greenport, we will look for solutions within our control. Given our lack of land, this may mean thinking of single-family starter houses as an idea whose time is gone. We may have to think differently about the American Dream and consider more development of apartments. And if our studies show that even this would fail to meet our needs, we will again look at annexing adjacent land.
 The important thing is that no responsible suggestion be dismissed without thorough consideration. Otherwise, we will have only ourselves to blame when we face economic extinction in our own towns.

HEADLINE: Fed's on Deck: How Hard A Swing?

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
INFLATION and interest rates aren't the only issues affecting the financial markets these days. It only seems that they are.
 Federal Reserve policy makers are widely expected to raise short-term interest rates when they start their two-day meeting on June 29. But how high will rates and inflation go, and how will the Fed's moves affect the economy and the financial markets? As the meeting draws closer, investors are sifting through omens and portents. 
 Of course, the economic reports due this week won't provide conclusive answers to the bigger questions about inflation and interest rates, but considerable attention will be paid to the reports anyway, and they may well move the markets.

MEASURING HOME SALES -- Wall Street economists have been weighing in, for example, on the number of new-home sales for May. That figure will be announced by the Commerce Department on Thursday. The current consensus, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets, is 1.125 million new units, which would mean a jump of 2 percent from April.
 Such a number -- or an even higher one -- would probably be seen as a reaffirmation of the strength of the housing sector, despite rising mortgage rates. 
 For Fed watchers, however, the implications of a high number would be fuzzier. It would probably give comfort to those who are convinced that the Fed will act aggressively at its next meeting -- by raising short-term rates by half a percentage point -- to choke off inflation before it chokes the economy. Those who think that the threat of inflation is only modest, and that the Fed will act with restraint, are expecting an initial rate increase of only a quarter of a point. Further rate increases are expected, but there is wide disagreement over how many there will be and how quickly they will come.
 A lower-than-expected number for new-home sales might suggest a weakening in the housing sector, a bulwark of the economy for the last few years.
 If such suspicions are raised, extra attention will be focused on a report on Friday by the National Association of Realtors on sales of existing homes, a much larger category. The Wall Street consensus calls for sales of 6.5 million existing homes in May, according to Bloomberg. That would mean a decline of about 2 percent from the previous month. 
 Home buyers usually lock in interest rates for at least 60 days, so most economists believe that the May numbers won't show much effect from rising rates. So a steep decline in this number for May might worry the markets -- and bolster arguments for restraint by the Fed.

HOW CONFIDENT ARE CONSUMERS? -- A fairly complete and current picture of consumer attitudes toward the economy may be revealed on Friday, when the University of Michigan issues the final figure for its consumer confidence survey for June. Bloomberg says Wall Street expects a high reading, 95, close to the preliminary figure of 95.2 last week, and much stronger than the 90.2 from May. For Fed watchers, that might tilt the scale toward a bigger rate increase.

HEADLINE: The Passion of Henry James

BYLINE: By Daniel Mendelsohn. 
Daniel Mendelsohn, a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books, is the author of a memoir, ''The Elusive Embrace.''

 BODY:

THE MASTER
By Colm Toibin.
338 pp. Scribner. $25.
 For a while, during the Gay Nineties of their respective centuries, the American writer Henry James and the Irish writer Colm Toibin -- whose remarkable new novel is about James -- were faced with the same embarrassing problem. It was a problem that touched both their personal and professional lives; to both writers, it seemed to be a problem that fiction alone could solve. 
 Early in 1895, James had been asked by his friend Mrs. Daniel Sargent Curtis, a great American hostess who lived in a great Venetian palazzo, to write an appreciation of the writer John Addington Symonds, the aesthete, Italophile and early crusader for the rights of homosexuals, who had died a couple of years before. Mrs. Curtis had appealed to James not out of any awareness (or, at least, any conscious awareness) of his deeply submerged sexuality, but rather because James and Symonds famously had another passion in common: Italy. (More than a decade earlier, he had sent to Symonds a copy of an essay he'd written about Venice, with a note declaring -- the phrasing strikes us now as almost comically suggestive -- that ''it seemed to me that the victim of a common passion should sometimes exchange a look.'') In his reply to Mrs. Curtis, James was careful to distance himself from that other, unmentionable, passion, what he called Symonds's ''strangely morbid and hysterical nature,'' even as he acknowledged that to write about the dead author without referring to it would be ''an affectation; and yet to deal with it either ironically or explicitly would be a Problem -- a problem beyond me.'' 
 But the subject matter that was an insoluble problem for James the critic and essayist had already proved to be a godsend to James the master of fiction. In his notebook entry for March 26, 1884, James, who was fascinated by gossip about Symonds's unhappy marriage to a prim woman who detested his writings, wrote down the framework of a short story about a similarly unhappy couple: ''the narrow, cold, Calvinistic wife, a rigid moralist, and the husband impregnated -- even to morbidness -- with the spirit of Italy, the love of Beauty, of art, the aesthetic view of life.'' A few months later, James published the short story ''The Author of 'Beltraffio,' '' a small masterpiece of delicate luridness in which the conflict between the aesthete (whose book, like Symonds's essay in defense of homosexuality, had provoked a scandal) and his disapproving wife for possession of their small, ''extraordinarily beautiful'' son ends with the mother allowing the boy to die rather than belong to his father. 
 Almost exactly a century after James, acting out of a profound discomfort at the possibility of self-exposure, turned down the occasion to write explicitly about homosexuality, the Irish journalist and novelist Colm Toibin did more or less the same thing, for more or less the same reasons. In the preface to the British edition of his 2001 collection of essays about gay writers and artists, ''Love in a Dark Time: And Other Explorations of Gay Lives and Literature,'' Toibin describes how he recoiled after being invited in 1993 by an editor at The London Review of Books to write about his homosexuality: ''I told him instantly that I couldn't do that,'' Toibin recalls. ''My sexuality . . . was something about which part of me remained uneasy, timid and melancholy. . . . I told him I couldn't do it. I had nothing polemical and personal, or even long and serious to say on the subject.'' Not to be discouraged, the editor simply resorted to another method of -- the language is suggestive -- ''enticing'' Toibin: he started sending him books by or about gay writers, some of which Toibin found ''too interesting to resist.'' Because of his own timidity and melancholy, he goes on to say, the figures to whom he was attracted were not contemporary authors like Edmund White and Jeanette Winterson, ''whose novels had done so much to clear the air and make things easier for gay people,'' but rather ''other figures from an earlier time, whose legacy was ambiguous, who had suffered for their homosexuality.'' 
 And yet the writer from an earlier time whose legacy is, famously, perhaps the most ambiguous of all with respect to the vexed issue of secret sexuality, of how the ''silence and fear'' can affect an artist's life and work, is the one artist whom Toibin chose not to include in his collection. This is not to say that Henry James isn't present in ''Love in a Dark Time'': a large part of the introductory chapter is, in fact, devoted to James. But for Toibin, he stands as the negative example -- a figure who, because of his self-repression, not only didn't have a ''gay life,'' but had no life at all. At the end of a discussion of James's great story ''The Beast in the Jungle'' (1903), which is about a man who spends his life convinced that some ''rare and strange, possibly prodigious and terrible'' destiny awaits him, only to realize that he's missed what life has had to offer while he's been waiting, Toibin argues that the story ''becomes much darker when you know about James's life. . . . You realize that the catastrophe the story led you to expect was in fact the very life that James chose to live, or was forced to live. . . . In 'The Beast in the Jungle,' James's solitary existence is shown in its most frightening manifestation: a life of pure coldness.'' 
 For Toibin, this coldness, this evasiveness, cripples rather than enhances notoriously ambiguous works like ''The Author of 'Beltraffio,' '' whose coded implications of unnamed moral dangers he finds frustrating rather than (as with many readers and critics) tantalizing. James, he writes, ''left himself with no opportunity to dramatize the scene he imagined since he could not even make it clear.'' This failure to be clear seems to have frustrated Toibin when he was preparing ''Love in a Dark Time,'' and so he didn't include James in the collection itself. For him, it would seem, James as both a man and an artist was something prodigious and terrible -- something, in a word, of ''a Problem.''
 It now appears that the problem Toibin couldn't solve in nonfiction prose is one he, like James, has labored to resolve in a work of fiction: ''The Master.'' (The title refers to the nickname that the rather overpoweringly impressive and oracular James acquired from a reverential younger generation; it should be said at the outset that Toibin's novel, with its crisp, almost tactile scene-setting, is anything but overpowering or heavy in the way many people think James's work is.) As with James in ''Beltraffio'' and, indeed, ''The Beast in the Jungle,'' Toibin in ''The Master'' has grafted a novelist's imaginative sympathy and human insight onto the armature of real-life events. As with James, the result is both aesthetically and psychologically potent -- and weakened only, perhaps, by certain limitations that tell us more about the author than they do about his ostensible subject, which in this case is, in fact, the ''pure coldness'' that for Toibin was James's life. 
 Whatever Toibin's literary-critical and ideological interest in James, ''The Master'' is unquestionably the work of a first-rate novelist -- one who has for the past decade been writing excellent novels about people cut off from their feelings or families or both. Of these, ''The Blackwater Lightship'' -- a finalist for the Booker Prize that was made into a film for television earlier this year -- is the best known, although ''The Heather Blazing'' (1992), whose protagonist is an emotionally remote Irish judge, has best expressed Toibin's preoccupation with the theme of tragic lack of self-awareness -- at least until now.
 Like some of the earlier novels, ''The Master'' seeks to build its portrait of an emotionally hobbled person by moving back and forth between a crisis in the character's present to illuminating episodes from his past. In the new novel, the present consists of the ''treacherous years'' in England (so described by Leon Edel, James's greatest biographer), from January 1895, the month when ''Guy Domville,'' the historical drama in which James had placed his hopes for commercial success, resoundingly flopped, to October 1899, when James's competitive older brother, the philosopher William James, came with his family for an extended visit. (This reunion results in a final, poignant illumination of the ''coldness'' at the heart of James's writing.) In each of the novel's 11 chapters, some incident triggers a memory in Henry -- as Toibin refers to James throughout -- and this oscillation between past and present allows the author to paint a detailed portrait not only of the claustrophobic anxiety of the late 1890's (not least the paranoia engendered by the trial of Oscar Wilde) but also the whole of James's life, from his supremely privileged Yankee childhood to his Atlantic-hopping young manhood right up until his late middle age, a period of crisis that turned out to be the threshold of his richest, densest work: ''The Ambassadors,'' ''The Wings of the Dove,'' ''The Golden Bowl.'' 
 Toibin, of course, has more on his mind than just painting a novelistic portrait of Henry James. What he seeks to illuminate is the opacity, the failure of passion, that he sees at the core of James's work, as well as of his life. In each chapter, the present-day incidents and the memories they evoke are linked ingeniously to the genesis of Henry's art. There is, for instance, a scene that takes place early on in ''The Master'' in which Henry listens attentively to a remark made by the archbishop of Canterbury's son, about a pair of children he'd once heard of, abandoned on an old estate; this was, in fact, the real-life genesis of ''The Turn of the Screw.'' Toibin faithfully recreates this scene, but makes it the stimulus to a flashback about Henry's early life, his invalid sister Alice and their childhood see-sawing between Europe and America. For Toibin, this was the beginning of James's ''coldness'' as well as of Alice's hysterical hypochondria. ''Both of them,'' Toibin's Henry muses, ''had somehow been abandoned as their family toured Europe and returned, often for no reason, to America. They had never been fully included in the passion of events and places, becoming watchers and nonparticipants.'' Even as Henry realizes he failed Alice, now dead, he sees how she might become part of the story he has begun thinking about: ''Now, as he began to imagine a little girl, it was his sister's unquiet ghost which came to him.'' 
 Similarly, a visit from Henry's boyhood acquaintance Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. leads to recollections of his cousin, the pretty and spirited Minny Temple, whose early death traumatized not only James but many other young men of his circle, including Holmes and the Harvard jurist John Gray. By the 1890's, James had already reincarnated her as Isabel Archer in ''The Portrait of a Lady,'' and a decade later would summon her once again from the dead, even more powerfully, as Milly Theale in ''The Wings of the Dove.'' A post-Civil War idyll in the countryside, peopled by Minny and Henry and the other youths, is beautifully evoked by Toibin in the course of a long and richly detailed section of the book that captures the lost Minny -- surely one of the most important if unwitting muses of 19th-century fiction -- far better than any biographer has been able to do. Here again, we see the process by which sentimental memory is alchemized into art in James's ever-churning mind: 
 ''During the time since Holmes's visit and in the midst of all his worry and suffering, his interest in the picture of a young American woman slowly dying, which he had noted down, had intensified. It was the story of a young woman with a large fortune on the threshold of a life that seemed boundless in its possibilities.'' 
 And so ''The Master'' proceeds, wending its delicate way between the middle and end of the 19th century, offering rich, darting, almost impressionistic glimpses of the moments of James's life that made him the ''Master.'' The most extended, and most tragic, of these shimmering episodes is, inevitably, the flashback to James's friendship with the novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson. A grandniece of James Fenimore Cooper and a woman of great intelligence and uncommon independence of mind and habit, Woolson was in many ways James's most intimate friend; her suicide in 1894, in Venice, could well have been the result of his inability to respond to her desire for a greater intimacy. (She killed herself during a particularly bleak Venice winter after it became clear that James wasn't going to be joining her there, as he indicated he might.) As Colm Toibin's Henry James faces the 20th century, it is clear he must come to terms with the losses, and failures, of the 19th; the author's evocation of an artist confronting his inadequacies as a man is, for much of the novel, delicate, complex and moving. 
 ''The Master'' is not, of course, a novel about just any man, but rather a novel about a figure from the past about whom we know an extraordinarily great deal, through both his own and others' memoirs, books and letters. As Toibin well knows, ventriloquizing the past is a dangerous affair for a novelist who wants to be taken seriously: just to remind you, he has an indignant Henry tell his supercilious and critical brother (who has suggested he write a novel about the Puritans) that he views ''the historical novel as tainted by a fatal cheapness.'' Toibin himself gets around this pitfall in two ways. First, he avoids the obvious trap of trying to make his Henry James sound Jamesian: to try to ''do'' James would inevitably end up sounding comical (see, for instance, Gore Vidal's hilarious sendup of James in his historical novel ''Empire''). From this novel's haunted and haunting first line -- ''Sometimes in the night he dreamed about the dead'' -- ''The Master'' is wholly of the present, and stylistically belongs to Toibin alone, who achieves a new level of terse economy both in his descriptive passages and particularly in the dialogue. Everything you need to know about James's disdain for Oscar Wilde (whom, predictably, he detested: a ''fatuous cad,'' he told Henry Adams's wife, Clover) is summed up in his remark about Wilde's mother, who was said to be jubilant about his trial: ''It is difficult to imagine him having a mother.'' 
 The ''fatal cheapness'' of many historical novels lies in the way they show off their own hard-won verisimilitude, as overrich detail congests the narrative. Of meticulous detail ''The Master'' lacks none: nearly every page bears witness to a prodigious amount of research, from passing references to the appearances of James's room in Mrs. Curtis's palazzo, with its ''pompous painted ceiling and walls of ancient pale green damask slightly shredded and patched'' -- almost a verbatim quotation of James, as it happens -- to the way Henry complains to himself, after the failure of ''Guy Domville,'' that he'd failed to ''take the measure of the great flat foot of the public'' -- another verbatim quotation. And yet while this dazzling embedding of bona fide Jamesian nuggets throughout his narrative will delight James scholars, they never obtrude into the smooth and elegant flow of the novel's movement. (Toibin's major departure from the known facts is temporal: a number of events that occurred after 1900 are shepherded into the preceding decade.) 
 The deft wielding of the facts by (as it were) Toibin the journalist and critic would be mere window dressing without the acute psychological perceptiveness that informs the author's portrait of his subject. This intelligent sense of the bigger picture enables Toibin to come up with sensible solutions to some famous conundrums in James scholarship. I am not as persuaded as Toibin was by the assertion, in Sheldon M. Novick's 1996 biography, ''Henry James: The Young Master,'' that the young James had a homosexual affair with Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. when Holmes returned from the Civil War -- a scenario supported in Novick's book by a reading of the existing documentary evidence that has the same relationship to rigorous scholarship that ''A Sunday on La Grande Jatte'' does to high-resolution digital photographs. (Much hangs on a Freudian reading of an allusion to an ''obelisk'' that occurs in proximity to a description of the Holmes residence.) 
 Toibin, however, finds the story ''oddly convincing'' -- and indeed makes it much more convincing in his novel, where it provides a scene of almost unbearable tension between the two young men, the one blandly curious, the other immobile with a desire he is too terrified to act on. (Or perhaps not: it seems entirely Jamesian to be in the presence of a scene that you can read again and again without being able to determine just what, if anything, has happened.) What's important is the way Toibin the novelist uses such scenes to suggest the sources of James's distinct artistic consciousness -- to show why he is the father of the psychological novel: ''He wondered at how, every day, as they moved around each other, each of them had stored away an entirely private world to which they could return at the sound of a name, or for no reason at all.'' 
 ''The Master'' will inevitably be compared to another recent novel -- ''The Hours,'' by Michael Cunningham, which was, at least in part, about Virginia Woolf as she set out to write ''Mrs. Dalloway.'' But Toibin's book is concerned less with the creation of a single work than with something at once much bigger and much more elusive: the nature of an entire artistic consciousness (and a very great consciousness at that). Here is where ''The Master'' is both most suggestive and most problematic. 
 For as you make your way through ''The Master,'' with its impressionistic ambling between past and present, a distinctive and perhaps too repetitive pattern begins to emerge: each memory that is triggered or captured may lead to the creation of a work of literature by Henry the artist, but each memory tends also to lead you to a scene of moral failure on the part of Henry the man. There's a passage early on in which the young Henry, working up one of his first short stories, uses an incident from his home life and is enthralled by the ''feeling of power'' that a ''raid on his own memories'' can produce when they are transformed into art; but this kind of artistic parasitism is increasingly held up to ruthless scrutiny -- and judgment -- by both the author and his characters. One friend suggests quite blatantly that Henry's shrinking from Constance Woolson drove her to self-destruction; Henry's use of the Symonds marriage as fodder for ''The Author of 'Beltraffio' '' shocks another friend, the writer Edmund Gosse. ''He insisted that writing a story using factual material and real people was dishonest and strange and somehow underhand.'' And Holmes flatly accuses Henry of responsibility for Minny Temple's death. (She'd hinted that she'd have loved to join him for a healthful vacation abroad, but he didn't respond.) By the end, remembering Minny, Henry shocks even himself. ''He felt a sharp and unbearable idea staring at him, like something alive and fierce and predatory in the air, whispering to him that he had preferred her dead rather than alive, that he had known what to do with her once life was taken from her, but he had denied her when she asked him gently for help.'' 
 This emphasis on James's alleged responsibility for Minny's death is, as it happens, one of Toibin's rare departures from the documentary record about James's life: although he cites part of a letter that the real-life Minny wrote to James (''Think, my dear, of the pleasure we would have together in Rome''), he doesn't cite the postscript she added, in which it's clear she knows her fantasy of traveling with him in Europe was just that: ''I am really not strong enough to go abroad with even the kindest of friends.'' Toibin can't acknowledge that James may have been ''the kindest of friends,'' because it interferes with his larger vision of James the cold fish, the artistic vampire living off the lifeblood of his innocent and truly suffering victims. ''The Master'' is, of course, a novel, and Toibin isn't bound by the facts; but the way that he's loaded the dice against James here suggests what is, to my mind, a larger failure of sympathy. 
 This is strange, because sympathy is something Toibin the critic, the chronicler of gay lives, has thought a great deal about. ''The gay past is not pure,'' he writes in ''Love in a Dark Time,'' referring to the way in which the homosexuals of an earlier generation were forced to lead double, lying lives. ''It is duplicitous and slippery, and it requires a great deal of sympathy and understanding.'' But ''The Master,'' Toibin's fifth novel, made me wonder whether he fully understands only a certain kind of suffering, and has only a certain kind of sympathy. For Oscar Wilde, with his extravagant public sufferings and real physical abasement, for the scholar F. O. Matthiessen, with his tortured closetedness and eventual suicide, Toibin -- who has acknowledged what he feels is the ''abiding fascination of sadness . . . and, indeed, tragedy'' -- clearly has great sympathy in his essays. And it is for this 19th-century, operatic sympathy that he has sympathy in the new novel, too: Minny and Constance and Alice James, with their Pucciniesque sufferings, their illnesses, premature death and suicide. 
 But it may be that Toibin's very nature, his own fascination with high tragedy and his admirably fierce moral objection to the kind of secretiveness and closetedness that once ravaged him, as it did so many of us, makes him unable to get to the deep opaque heart of Henry James -- the elusive and frustrating thing that got him going about James in the first place. It's possible that James just didn't suffer in the way Toibin understands suffering. From everything we know, he was indeed quite a happy person (by his own standards, rather than ours) for most of his life -- productive, sociable, well loved and remarkably kind. And, of course, a very great artist for whom art was the highest satisfaction. Yet Toibin never explores what it might feel like to be satisfied by art alone in the way that most of us want to be satisfied by love and sex; he just keeps showing you the damage that art causes without really suggesting what its compensatory value might be -- for James or, indeed, for us. There is an early story of James's in which a young American asks himself whether ''it is better to cultivate an art than to cultivate a passion''; for James in real life, at least, it seems clear what the answer was -- just as it seems clear what Toibin thinks, too. The last page of ''The Master'' provides one final memory, one final illumination of why James was ''cold,'' why for him there was a kind of emotion in art that nothing in ''life'' could match. A closing image of the lone artist, anxiously culling moments from life to be preserved in art, is meant, I suspect, to come off as melancholy, if not tragic. 
 But what if James wasn't tragic? That a life without passion as we think of it could still be a fulfilled life is one paradox that Toibin's artful, moving and very beautiful novel doesn't seem to have considered; and so he does not dramatize it because it isn't clear to him. What we get in ''The Master'' is, instead, the intricate and wrenching drama of James's ''victims.'' The Master himself remains, ultimately, unknowable -- a problem that perhaps no artist could ever solve.

HEADLINE: Dodging Bullets

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
OVER the last several years, a proposed professional sports arena the centerpiece of Mayor Sharpe James's vision of a redeveloped downtown Newark -- has taken more turns than a jockey at Monmouth and dodged more bullets than one of Tony Soprano's crew.
 Those life-saving maneuvers included any number of contortions as the proposal evolved from a politically iffy, state-financed notion in 1999 to one that could largely be locally financed in 2002.
 The idea showed a lithesome grace in emerging whole from the disputes last year that engulfed the owners of the Nets basketball team and the Devils ice hockey team as the two clubs looked for a way out of the Continental Arena in the Meadowlands. And then the plan survived when the owners of the Nets decided to flee to Brooklyn rather than stay in New Jersey.
 ''How many times has it lived and died?'' said Don Eisen, executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate brokerage company. ''It doesn't matter because getting it done is the most important element, and once that happens everyone forgets how many bullets it had to dodge.'' 
 With the sale of $200 million in bonds earlier this month to finance the endeavor, the arena, with seating for 18,500 fans, seems poised once again to move forward.
 And so it is fitting to assess what potential bullets may be heading its way.

FINANCING -- The city plans to use the sale of $200 million worth of bonds through the housing authority and $100 million of the team's money to pay the arena's estimated price of $310 million.
 While negotiations continue on the details of the contribution from the hockey franchise, the city last week secured its share with the sale of the bonds. Those bonds are secured by annual payments of $12.5 million a year, which the city is guaranteed as a supplement to the annual rent it receives from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to operate Newark Liberty International Airport.
 The new lease arrangement, arrived at in the summer of 2002 with the help of Governor McGreevey, was timely. And it provided Newark with substantial lump-sum payments in settlement of long-standing litigation with the Port Authority after the State Legislature had repeatedly refused to provide state funds to help the city proceed.

BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION -- Months ago Mayor James acknowledged to aides that he perhaps lacked objectivity about the project and its goals of downtown renewal. At that point, said Richard Monteilh, the city's business administrator, Mr. James decided to appoint a commission, including some skeptical officials, to evaluate the financial arrangements and the plan's promise of broader downtown redevelopment.
 ''Someone else should evaluate to see if it is a fair deal for the city in light of other similar projects around the country,'' Mr. Monteilh said, referring to the job of the 12-member commission. ''They need to answer the questions of whether the city's contribution is reasonable and whether the impact we envision is realistic.''
 After eluding legal challenges led by two council members opposed to the arena, the commission, which was originally scheduled to complete its work last week, received a one-month extension. The chairman of the commission, Patrick Hobbs, the dean of Seton Hall University Law School, said that some elements of the financial package for the city were ''fluid'' and that the panel members wanted to get the most timely information. In addition, Mr. Hobbs said they wanted to examine similar arrangements in other cities more carefully.
 ''This 24-acre arena site is a critical piece of downtown, and if done right it could be tremendous for the city,'' he said. ''We just have to say whether we believe in light of the arrangement that they are negotiating with the Devils, they will create the sports and entertainment complex that they want.''
 Asked whether the successful bond issue last week suggested that lenders were warming to the redevelopment of downtown Newark, Mr. Hobbs said that the market's reaction was more likely a result of the confidence borrowers had in the Port Authority.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CONSTRUCTION ISSUES -- Mr. Monteilh said that the city and the owner of the Devils were conducting environmental surveys to make certain that the proposed arena site -- bounded by Market, Broad, Lafayette and Mulberry Streets -- did not pose significant problems. An aging industrial city, Newark is littered in some sections with old oil tanks and other chemical wastes that must be cleaned up before construction can begin.
 Because the city and the owner of the Devils, Jeffrey Vanderbeek, are seeking a builder who will take on the project at ''a guaranteed maximum'' price, clearing the way of any costly and time-consuming cleanup problems is essential.
 ''We cannot afford cost overruns on this because we then lose faith with the taxpayers,'' Mr. Monteilh said, noting that construction of the infrastructure for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta was done on the ''guaranteed maximum'' basis.
 And five years ago the cost of developing a minor league baseball stadium here ballooned to $34 million from $22 million, partly because of the cost of cleaning up the site.

LITIGATION -- Opponents of the proposed arena -- who include some council members as well as residents and businesses that will be displaced and others who believe that available revenue should go into the city's neighborhoods -- have so far failed to slow the proposal's movement in the courts and administrative agencies.
 Two weeks ago, a state appeals court threw out a challenge that sought to force a public referendum on the financing plan for the arena. Opponents were also rebuffed when they challenged the bond issue before the state's Local Finance Board, which must approve such forays into the borrowing markets by New Jersey municipalities.
 Ira Karasick, a lawyer who represents some of the groups opposed to the arena, said he planned to appeal both rulings as well as to renew a suit that contends that the use of any Port Authority money to build the arena is improper.

POLITICAL -- After all the legal and environmental issues are addressed, the plan must be approved by the City Council, where Mayor James appears to have won over a majority.
 But it must also battle a faint yet still-audible chorus of those around the state who doubt that Newark can attract suburbanites to sporting and other events. Many say that the Continental Arena, where the Devils and the Nets now play, is a more hospitable venue, and they have pressed Governor McGreevey to use his influence in terms of regional efforts or Port Authority financing to keep the Devils there rather than building a new arena.
 For a time this year, the governor and his appointees to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority appeared to be adopting that view as they soft-pedaled the idea of demolishing the Continental Arena and highlighted the slow progress of the Newark arena proposal.
 But city officials and others note that as Governor McGreevey approaches re-election he will need a strong performance in Bergen County, home of the Continental Arena. He has already acknowledged that moving the hockey franchise from the site of Giants Stadium and a planned $1.4 billion sports and entertainment complex might be unwise.
 Still, Mr. Monteilh and others say they do not expect Mr. McGreevey to block the arena, which he has endorsed through much of his political career. The proof of that, Mr. Monteilh said, was the administration's decision two weeks ago not to rule out the bond issue when it came before the state's Local Finance Board for approval.
 ''He could have stopped it then,'' Mr. Monteilh said. ''But he did not. We think that he is working in our interest.''

HEADLINE: Think Globally, Educate Locally

BYLINE: By J. MICHAEL ADAMS. 
Dr. J. Michael Adams is the president of Fairleigh Dickinson University.

 BODY:
WHEN Harvard runs an idea up the flagpole, the education community is usually quick to salute. So when a faculty and student panel recently called for critical changes in the undergraduate curriculum, more than a few people took notice. 
 The committee, which undertook the first comprehensive evaluation of Harvard's undergraduate curriculum in nearly three decades, most significantly urged that greater opportunities be provided for students in international studies. 
 William Kirby, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, wrote that Harvard must prepare students to be ''citizens not only of their home country, but also of the world, with the capacity not only to understand others but also to see themselves, and this country, as others see them.'' 
 Dean Kirby and the committee are right on target. Schooling global citizens is the educational imperative of the 21st century. Groundbreaking developments in communication and transportation technology have transformed our world. The networking and spread of information, production, finance, trade and, unfortunately, disease and terrorism, weave together the fates of billions. 
 But while the forces of globalization bring people closer together, education has largely failed to keep pace, and the result is that we still do not know one another very well. The result of such misunderstanding and ignorance can often lead to tragic results. 
 This is why Fairleigh Dickinson University -- with two campuses in northern New Jersey and a third in England -- made global education the cornerstone of its institutional mission more than fours ago. Like Harvard's panel concluded, we believe that in a world marked by interdependence, diversity and rapid change, we need graduates who are comfortable in foreign environments, familiar with different cultures and skilled in drawing connections between the local and the global. 
 It is crucial that Harvard approve and enact the committee's recommendations, for the benefit of not only Harvard students but all of higher education. Because of Harvard's significant influence, its actions will be emulated. Such inspiration is desperately needed because too many universities either ignore the importance of global lessons or offer only lip service.
 According to a study last fall by the American Council on Education, only 28 percent of the 752 institutions surveyed included internationalization as a top strategic priority, and only 21 percent had allocated funds to help faculty members internationalize their courses. 
 But if Harvard can inspire greater global lessons, the specific pathways are up to individual institutions. Harvard's antidote to the shortcomings in international education includes the expectation that all students study or work abroad. It's true that there is no substitute for becoming immersed in another culture. 
 That is why Fairleigh Dickinson has owned and operated Wroxton College in England since the 1960's and has partnerships and programs with more than 20 educational institutions around the world. 
 But more must be done close to home as well. Foreign language studies should be enhanced. Global perspectives and global issues must be integrated and infused throughout the curriculum. The reality is that the overwhelming majority of American students do not venture abroad. So we must make sure that while we provide learning opportunities afar, we also bring the world to our students. 
 Technology, especially the Internet, can help connect students to new worlds. At Fairleigh Dickinson, we believe that the Internet can be a fundamental learning and educational tool, and we also believe it can facilitate collaborations and help educate global citizens. That is why, in 2001, our Fairleigh Dickinson became the first traditional university to require that all undergraduates take online courses (one for every 32 credits).
 One particularly powerful part of our distance-learning initiative is the creation of a Global Virtual Faculty. These scholars and practitioners (now numbering nearly 50) from around the world partner, on line, with campus-based faculty to contribute diverse views and perspectives by way of e-mail. 
 At the same time, profound lessons can be conveyed without such technology. The key is to expose students to different ways of looking at the world. Through Fairleigh Dickinson's close relationship with the United Nations, for example, we regularly invite foreign ambassadors and other dignitaries to speak with students. 
 The point is, there are many ways to school global citizens. And the lessons should start at the earliest ages possible. The ability and knowledge to make global connections is fundamental not just for personal enlightenment, nor solely for professional success in the global economy, but, ultimately, for the very preservation of our planet. 
 Understanding problems through the eyes of others helps reduce fears and misunderstandings that breed contempt, conflict and terror. Learning to work together across geographic and cultural borders helps counter international crises and insidious forces that threaten humanity. 
 Whether or not society is up to the task of combating global challenges will be determined by the caliber of global citizens and global leaders our schools and colleges produce. Fairleigh Dickinson is rising to the challenge. Harvard is ready to take its familiar leadership role. Who else will follow?

HEADLINE: Reports on Attacks Are Gripping, Not Dry

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS; John Files contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19 

 BODY:
In contrast to the plodding or self-promoting style of so many government documents, the staff reports of the commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks have provided something truly rare in official Washington: a good read.
 In 17 crisply worded reports, the commission staff laid out facts from the events that shook and marred the lives of millions. Using a style that is remarkably free of artifice, the authors achieved a high point in detail, clarity and coherence.
 It is early yet to know if readability translates into influence. And staff members warn that there is still time for commissioners to clutter their prose before next month's final report and recommendation. But the reviews of the reports, including three more released this week, have been favorable. 
 ''People are reading them,'' said Kristen Breitweiser, of Middletown, N.J., whose husband died in the World Trade Center. ''I have been very surprised about how much interest there has been and how closely people are following along. We have received e-mails from all over the world.''
 A publisher, PublicAffairs, has already compiled the first 12 staff reports in a book.
 ''There are two points that make these reports unique,'' said Mark Danner, a professor at the Graduate School of Journalism of the University of California, Berkeley, and a contributor to The New Yorker. ''One, there's a solid, clear narrative that provides a sense of drama, which makes it easier for reporters to do their jobs. Second, they not only have narrative drive, but they have official standing.''
 Commissions have been writing reports since government began. There are heavy tomes summing up the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Warren Commission's investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the Iran-contra scandal and the independent counsel's inquiry into the Clinton administration. But usually it has taken historians, biographers and filmmakers to make the topics come alive.
 The Sept. 11 staff reports, in contrast, offer a gripping story the first time around. They are richly detailed and colorful, peppered with actual dialogue, gleaned from audiotapes, that provides an intimate view of that day's events.
 The reports eavesdrop on a hijacker. (''Nobody move please. We are going back to the airport; don't try any stupid moves.'') They visited an air traffic controller being pressed for a momentous decision. (''Uh, you know, everybody just left the room.'') And they sat at Vice President Dick Cheney's elbow when he reported, coolly but mistakenly, that his order had downed two airplanes. (''That is correct. And it's my understanding they've already taken a couple of aircraft out.'')
 Being presented in installments gave the reports a real-time excitement that was enhanced by the public hearings that accompanied them. For those truly steeped in the mysteries of the investigation, the incremental unveiling of the facts was akin to watching a television serial.
 Peter Osnos, the publisher of PublicAffairs, said the chapter-like reports provided an unusual glimpse into an investigation still in progress.
 Also rare for government documents on sensitive matters, the reports are mercifully devoid of redactions. Their language is precise, economical and highly authoritative.
 For example, one report dismisses the Bush administration's assertion of an encounter in Prague between a Qaeda operative and an Iraqi intelligence official. (''We do not believe that such a meeting occurred.'')
 Mr. Osnos said the reports reflected the frank and nonpartisan style of the commission's chairmen, Thomas H. Kean, a former Republican governor of New Jersey; and Lee H. Hamilton, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana.
 ''We were fortunate to have two absolute straight-talkers in the second row,'' Mr. Osnos said. ''They're not grandstanders.''
 Philip D. Zelikow, the commission's executive director, said the authors wanted their reports to be read.
 ''We wanted to draft material that people will want to read themselves,'' said Mr. Zelikow, who managed dozens of investigators researching and writing about Sept. 11. Part of the challenge, he said, was to produce a text from numerous authors and to make it uniform.
 ''You're both writing by committee and trying to avoid all the vices of writing by committee,'' he said.
 Mr. Zelikow is a professor of history at the University of Virginia and a former State Department official and National Security Council staff member. He has written books based on the taped recordings of the Kennedy presidency and on German reunification. 
 His co-author on the second book, which is now a decade old, was Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, and that collaboration raised concern among some Sept. 11 family members about a potential conflict of interest.
 Working at Mr. Zelikow's side was a deputy, Chris Kojm, a former aide to Mr. Hamilton, who was a writer and editor with the Foreign Policy Association in New York; and Daniel Marcus, the commission's general counsel, who is a former Justice Department official.
 ''There is no single, literary giant lurking behind our shoulders,'' Mr. Zelikow said.

HEADLINE: The Incredible Shrinking Daniel Libeskind

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
ON Feb. 27, 2003, Daniel Libeskind stood on a podium under the palm trees in the Winter Garden's soaring glass atrium -- the American flag behind him, some 300 members of the press before him -- and entered the architectural history books as master planner of the World Trade Center site. A model of his plan was dramatically unveiled, praised by Gov. George E. Pataki as ''an emotional protection of the site of ground zero itself'' and by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as restoring ''lower Manhattan to its rightful place in the world.'' Mr. Libeskind quickly became a media darling and a bona fide cultural icon, from his spiky hair and funky rectangular glasses down to his elk-skin cowboy boots.
 Yet last week -- just over a year later -- when ground zero's cultural tenants were announced in the same spot, Mr. Libeskind was far less visible. He sat in the audience, one row behind officials from the city, state and Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Governor Pataki praised the new transportation hub designed by Santiago Calatrava; the memorial, designed by Michael Arad and Peter Walker; and the Freedom Tower, which is being designed by David M. Childs, although Mr. Libeskind is collaborating with him. The governor only remembered to mention Mr. Libeskind at the last minute, after spotting him in the audience, saying that of course it all started with Mr. Libeskind's design. 
 Mr. Libeskind, smiling back at him, seemed satisfied. But people involved with the redevelopment of downtown say he has ample reason to be disappointed; in the year since he was anointed Architect on High, his influence, control and stature have steadily diminished. ''Where is Daniel at this point?'' said Robert Ivy, editor in chief of Architectural Record. ''Has he been marginalized? How many of his ideas remain?''
 Not many, it seems. The signature elements of his master plan -- the Wedge of Light, the Park of Heroes, the exposed slurry wall -- indeed, the very components that made Mr. Libeskind the emotional favorite among those competing for the job, have been altered, reduced or eliminated. With Governor Pataki determined to break ground on July 4, work is moving ahead on the Freedom Tower, but the planning is now dominated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, and by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the architectural firm hired by Larry A. Silverstein, the site's leaseholder. 
 According to those with knowledge of the proceedings, Mr. Libeskind does not even attend the meetings at which the plans are currently discussed. His once gushy press has lately been dominated by controversy: his power struggle with Mr. Childs; his battle with Mr. Silverstein over his fees. Governor Pataki still publicly praises him. But the shift in the architect's position suggests that the governor may no longer be an active champion of his cause.
 To be sure, certain broad elements of Mr. Libeskind's ''Memory Foundations'' remain: a site divided by Fulton and Greenwich Streets into unequal quadrants, a memorial precinct in the southwest corner and an L-shaped array of office towers along Church and Vesey Streets, the highest pinnacle at the northwest corner. But in part that's a function of the political mandate to preserve the original tower footprints, limiting the number of ways the site could be arranged.
 Arguably the sole remaining trace of what made Mr. Libeskind's ideas distinctive is the spire on the Freedom Tower -- and some of the people involved in downtown redevelopment say even that may not survive.
 How did it happen? How did Mr. Libeskind plunge from dominant visionary to supporting player? Several theories are currently in circulation: Mr. Libeskind had too little experience in the world of large-scale office buildings and profit-seeking New York City developers. Or he was politically savvy enough to know which battles can and can't be won. Or by nature he's less an executor of plans than a dreamer.
 To this last, Mr. Libeskind said: ''Dreamers are not impractical. The world has been made by practical dreamers.''
 In a recent interview at his Rector Street office near the World Trade Center site, the architect said that his plan had not so much been eclipsed as it had evolved -- just as he intended it to do. ''I think the plan has been going extremely well,'' he said. ''We are absolutely on track.''
 He added: ''This is not one of those master plans that are going to be forced on people like the Rome of the dictators. It has to be robust enough to withstand all the complexity and all the negotiations.''
 Asked whether he felt he needed to protect his original design, he said: ''I'm not a guard dog. I'm a participant and I have to work with everybody.''
 It's a gracious stance, but distinctly at odds with the one he took in December 2003, when Mr. Childs's design for the Freedom Tower was announced. Mr. Libeskind told The New York Post that his role from then on would be to maintain the ''guardianship of the master plan.''
 ''When the politicians and architects and investors are long gone,'' he said at the time, ''I'll still be on Rector Street making sure that every building on this site is dedicated to a very special moment in our history.''
 Ironically, his ability to compromise -- although it has only lately come into full view -- may have sown the seeds at the beginning of the design process for his eventual marginalization. He was smart enough to propose a flexible plan, one that could change in response to the needs of developers and politicians. That choice made him the favorite candidate for the job, but it also made him expendable.
 MR. LIBESKIND first emerged on the scene as something of a savior. An initial round of planning for ground zero produced six designs -- most of them by the firm Beyer Blinder Belle -- that were generally deemed uninspired. Public disappointment in those results sent the development corporation back to the drawing board, and in Round Two Mr. Libeskind, who was supposed to serve as a juror, submitted his own designs to much acclaim. He conceived of the major components with a careful eye toward symbolism -- a spiral of five towers, including one 1,776-foot spire echoing the Statue of Liberty; a Park of Heroes; a waterfall; a memorial descending down to bedrock.
 For the public -- in particular, the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks -- the plan was a welcome antidote to a process that had seemed chiefly concerned with maximizing office space. And for Mr. Pataki, according to several downtown redevelopment officials, championing the plan (over the arguably more popular proposal by the architectural team Think) was a chance to make his mark in a period otherwise dominated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. ''Daniel Libeskind created a plan for the 16-acre site which would both remember loss and celebrate life,'' said Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki. ''His vision continues to guide the rebuilding process -- from providing a cultural framework around the memorial to reconnecting the site with surrounding neighborhoods to creating the height of the Freedom Tower.''
 Mr. Libeskind had a moving pedigree -- his parents had survived the Holocaust; he had designed the Jewish Museum in Berlin -- and a way of talking about both his own experience as an immigrant and his ideas for the site that was heavy-handed but affecting. Kevin Rampe, the president of the development corporation, said Mr. Libeskind's delivery was as crucial to his success as his ideas. ''The one thing that people will never forgive in this city is a lack of passion,'' Mr. Rampe said. ''He certainly relayed that passion and energy which I think helped drive the process forward.''
 But Mr. Libeskind's post-selection honeymoon didn't last long. Before two months had passed, pundits and architectural experts began calling his plan pie in the sky. Douglas Durst, a Times Square developer, told The New York Times: ''I would expect the developer will negotiate what the buildings will look like. Ultimately, it would resemble the conceptual plan only in spirit.''
 Sure enough, little by little, the pieces began to change. ''It very quickly began to morph,'' Mr. Ivy said. ''Committees have come in and modified. The site became less deep, it became'' -- he paused -- ''less.''
 The first major change was to the Park of Heroes, which was cut roughly in half by a redesign of the Freedom Tower and an attached office building.
 In February 2003, Mr. Libeskind was asked to raise the floor of his memorial. It was originally to be 70 feet deep, so as to place visitors right on the foundation of the original towers; now it would be raised by about 40 feet, so as to accommodate several floors to shore up the slurry walls and provide parking for tourist buses.
 As for Mr. Libeskind's suggestion of a waterfall up to 100 feet tall, somewhere in the process it just went away.
 Perhaps the most emotionally resonant element of Mr. Libeskind's original design was the plan to orient the memorial in such a way that each year, on the morning of Sept. 11, ''the sun will shine without shadow.'' But in May 2003, the architect Eli Appia published a study showing that this so-called Wedge of Light would be in shadow much of that time from a building across the street. And Mr. Calatrava's design for the Path terminal, announced in January, moved the station north into the center of the plaza, which Mr. Libeskind had reserved for his Wedge.
 Then came the battle over the Freedom Tower, the tallest building designated for the site. In May 2003, Mr. Silverstein announced that Mr. Libeskind would inspire but not actually design the buildings on the site. Mr. Libeskind said he was unconcerned. ''I've been assured by Larry, whom I like, that I'll be meaningfully involved in the design of the building,'' he said at the time.
 In July 2003, Mr. Silverstein persuaded the Port Authority to consider several changes to Mr. Libeskind's vision and hired Mr. Childs, an architect he had worked with extensively, to draw up plans. The Port Authority asked Mr. Libeskind to study the effect of moving his tallest tower to the eastern portion of the site, closer to a planned transit hub, and to consider adding an office tower above that. ''Mr. Silverstein needed to build a building that had rentable floor plates,'' said Elliott Sclar, a professor of urban planning and public affairs at Columbia University. ''Libeskind represents this vision that's floating above it all.''
 Mr. Libeskind fought back, together with his wife and business partner, Nina. If Mr. Libeskind is the artist with his head in the clouds, people who have worked with them say, Ms. Libeskind has her feet firmly on the ground, fiercely guarding her husband's interests. ''I try to back Daniel whenever he's defending anything,'' she said in an interview. They hired Edward W. Hayes, who was a law school classmate of Mr. Pataki's and a model for the lawyer Tommy Killian in ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' to negotiate with Mr. Silverstein.
 Mr. Silverstein's office sent a letter to the development corporation and the Port Authority, claiming that delayed decisions could cause him to miss the deadline that the governor had set for groundbreaking. In April, Mr. Pataki made it clear that he was handing over much of the responsibility for the rebuilding to Mr. Silverstein, the only person on the scene with money who could actually build something. ''As the governor said when he outlined his ambitious plan for rebuilding Lower Manhattan,'' Lisa Dewald Stoll, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said at the time, ''this process leaves no room for error or delay, for parochial concerns or unnecessary legal battles.'' She added: ''Quite simply, you're either part of the team or you're not. The schedule will be met.''
 The wrestling for control of the Freedom Tower became daily fodder for the news media for several weeks running. ''Libeskind's Luster Eclipsed by SOM,'' said The New York Sun, referring to Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. ''An In-Spired Shift at WTC,'' said The New York Daily News. As Mr. Sclar put it, ''There was something admirable about the way he defended the integrity of his plan, but you have all these players with all these other interests.''
 Some started to sense blood in the water. On June 4, 2003, The New York Post gleefully introduced readers to ''Fishing From the Pavement,'' a book of poetry that Mr. Libeskind had published in 1997, which included ''10-dollar words and deliberately obscure references to radishes, bodily functions and genitalia.'' That same month, as Mr. Libeskind was struggling to retain his image as a serious architect, a pullout ad for Audi appeared in 15 Conde Nast magazines, featuring him posed inside a cardboard box.
 One afternoon the next month, Mr. Silverstein and Mr. Libeskind holed up together and hammered out a truce; when they emerged, in the wee hours of the following morning, Mr. Childs was the lead architect, Mr. Libeskind was his collaborator. He defended his continued role: ''It's not a matter of just moving a building here or there. It can change the views, the light and wind conditions, the composition of the entire site.''
 By fall 2003, the buzz downtown was that at its most basic, without all the symbolic flourishes, Mr. Libeskind's plan had turned out to be not so very different from the original six designs that were so roundly rejected. Joseph Seymour, the executive director of the Port Authority, told The New York Times in September: ''When we roll it out, the land-use plan is going to be almost exactly what Beyer Blinder Belle proposed.''
 On Dec. 19, 2003, when the two architects appeared at the Federal Hall National Memorial to reveal a glistening, nine-foot-tall acrylic model, it was clear that Mr. Childs's vision had prevailed. The new tower eliminated some of the angular shapes in Mr. Libeskind's original drawings and devoted upper stories to office space rather than to the proposed gardens. On paper, the tower would still be topped by an off-center, 276-foot spire, but in Mr. Childs's lengthy discussion of the design, he scarcely mentioned that feature. Even so, Kent L. Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society, blessed the unlikely couple. ''Though it was a forced marriage,'' he said at the time, ''I think it worked out astonishingly well.''
 Mr. Pataki, who appeared with them at the presentation, has been careful not to take sides officially in their negotiations. ''The governor tasked both Libeskind and Childs to collaborate and create a compelling design for the Freedom Tower which would work with the Libeskind master plan,'' Ms. Rasic said recently, ''and they succeeded in doing so.'' But behind the scenes, had he in fact changed horses? Those close to the process say his loyalty was consistent: not to a particular aesthetic vision but to whoever could guarantee a groundbreaking in time for the opening of the Republican National Convention. 
 On NBC's ''Today'' show the day before the unveiling, Katie Couric asked Mr. Childs about his ''rocky relationship'' with Mr. Libeskind. ''Creative minds have different thoughts about how you do things,'' Mr. Childs responded. ''I wouldn't want to work with somebody who would just say yes.'' Asked more recently to describe his current working relationship with Mr. Libeskind, Mr. Childs declined to comment.
 In an interview after the unveiling, Mr. Libeskind distanced himself from the project. ''I'm not the architect of this building,'' he told The New York Post. ''You have to ask Mr. Childs.''
 IN January 2004, Mr. Libeskind's plan was further eroded with the selection of a memorial design. Mr. Arad's plan called for the memorial to be brought level with the surrounding terrain. Mr. Libeskind's hallmark, the memorial pit, was now to be flat.
 Since then, as the development process has moved forward, it has necessarily skewed toward the nuts and bolts: assessing environmental impact, solving technical problems and hiring people to begin construction, areas in which Mr. Libeskind, unlike Mr. Childs, is not an expert. Mr. Libeskind resettled himself somewhat outside of the spotlight he had once occupied and began to focus on other projects -- a 350,000-square-foot multimedia building at the City University of Hong Kong, a shopping center in Switzerland and a performing arts complex in Dublin. People working on the project say that officials were tired of hearing about the creative conflict between him and Mr. Childs. ''The Port Authority has told him clearly, 'Get on board,' '' someone with knowledge of those communications said. 
 To be sure, he is now spoken of as though the sun has set on his real contribution. Madelyn Wils, a director of the development corporation, said, ''He's done a great job with designing the master plan and now he needs to work with the future architects, making sure their buildings make sense.''
 Meanwhile, Mr. Libeskind and his employer are engaged in a dispute over the value of that work. Mr. Libeskind had already been compensated by the development corporation for his work on the master plan. But he gave Mr. Silverstein a bill for $800,000 for his subsequent work on the Freedom Tower. Mr. Silverstein countered with an offer of $125,000, in part because Mr. Libeskind had not kept time sheets and could not substantiate his bill. The dispute has yet to be resolved.
 ''The attitude is very different in Europe,'' one architect familiar with the dispute said. ''Architects demand much higher fees than in New York and people don't question the costs. They're the gods.''
 Some believe downtown officials ought to have stood by their master planner. ''Others should have fought for him,'' Mr. Ivy said. ''This is a case where the forces that be were inadequately cohered. We needed someone with the governor's power, the mayor's moxie to bring the parties together.''
 To others, the dimming of Mr. Libeskind's glow is inevitable, a function of both a culture with a short attention span and the proper progression from overall design to individual detail. If there is less excitement about the design for the World Trade Center now than there once was, said Frederic M. Bell, the executive director of the American Institute of Architects' New York Chapter, it is ''not through any diminishment of respect'' for Mr. Libeskind. ''When the actual buildings get designed, they supplant the drawings of what they might look like with what they will look like, and that's natural.''
 For his part, Mr. Libeskind is resolutely positive about the changes he and his master plan have been through. ''With each new piece, something good has happened to the plan,'' he said. ''It's an amplification and an accomplishment of the fundamental ideas of the site and in many cases it's an improvement.''
 ''I don't approach this as my plan,'' he continued. ''It's the plan of New York. That's why the plan won, because it's very practical.'' He added: ''True art, you have to work with business. We are living in a market economy.''
 The once feisty architect seems to have concluded that it is easier to work within the system than to fight it. Whatever the case, he is already reaping the benefits of his newfound prominence, having been asked to build several skyscrapers in Europe. And perhaps whether Mr. Libeskind proves to be the most influential designer of ground zero doesn't really matter; he was the first, and first impressions count for a lot.
 ''He provided the vision,'' Mr. Rampe of the development corporation said. ''Has that vision changed? Sure. But he allowed us to see our way out of the darkness of Sept. 11 and to figure out what to do with the site.''

HEADLINE: For Graduates, the Freebies Disappear

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
THE annual migration of newly minted college graduates to New York City has begun, with the class of '04 arriving with jobs but in need of apartments. This year, they are learning something that probably isn't taught in classrooms at Wharton or Indiana: that incentives used to lure their older siblings or friends just a few months ago may no longer be available, and that they probably will have to pay more than their friends who have already settled in. 
 ''There is a disconnect in what we see in the current apartment seekers whose friends entered the marketplace a year or even six months ago,'' said Gary L. Malin, chief operating officer of Citi Habitats. ''They expect that they can negotiate everything they want, get rents down and get some rent free. They will say, 'But a year ago my friend got that.' '' 
 But with a strengthening economy and a growing demand for rental units, many landlords have eliminated the month or two of free rents they had been giving. Similarly, they have stopped paying the brokers' fees.
 Last year, there was a dearth of new graduates in the apartment market because there were so few jobs to be had. ''This year, major corporations are recruiting many more first-year associates than in previous years,'' said Douglas Wagner, president of Benjamin James Real Estate. ''We do have a more stable economy, requiring a greater work force, which has finally worked its way down to the first-year research analysts, investment bankers and management consultants being invited to come to work.'' 
 For young people who are willing to share, large apartments can work out to be cheaper than studios.
 ''If a studio in a new doorman building is $54 a square foot per year and the typical studio is 415 square feet, that works out to $1,870 a month,'' Mr. Wagner said. 
 ''Generally you need $75,000 a year to qualify,'' he said, referring to the standard requirement that income be at least 40 times the monthly rent. ''But starting salaries are not all that high, so if you get two people, who between them earn $160,000, they qualify for a $4,000 two-bedroom in a doorman building. Then they often end up recruiting a third roommate who pitches a wall in the living room.'' 
 Adding a wall is what Leah Zamkow, Marcy Saranik and Stacey Wiener, who graduated from Indiana University, planned to do when they moved into their two-bedroom unit on East 44th Street on June 10.
 Their goal had been to find three bedrooms in Murray Hill. ''Anything we liked was taken even before we saw it,'' Ms. Zamkow said. ''We finally saw a two-bedroom we liked and the broker suggested we add a wall to cut the living room in half. We thought it would be too small, but she showed us an identical apartment where that had been done and it looked fine.'' 
 The rent was $3,675. ''For what we are getting, it is reasonable,'' she said. ''But this has not been fun at all. It's been like having two full-time jobs.''
 Still, there is no shortage of people who want to make a clean break with dormitory living, and Sean Oakes, a sales associate with Halstead/Feathered Nest, said there are reasonably priced studios to be had for those willing to move fast.
 ''I have noticed backup application upon backup application for studios,'' he said. ''I have one client, a Boston College graduate, who liked a walk-up on East 34th Street. It was gone before we could even start the application. Then we saw another studio he liked on East 51st Street, called immediately and again found two applications ahead of ours. So as leverage we offered just a bit more than the asking price: $1,250, which got us the apartment.'' 
 Benjamin Naftalis and Charles Glass, new graduates from Columbia Law School, began looking in April for what Mr. Naftalis called ''a real two-bedroom downtown.''
 ''We wanted an adult apartment, and everything we saw was too kid-y,'' he said. After a few days of looking with brokers, they saw a three-bedroom with two decks in the meatpacking district.
 Learning that other prospective tenants had tried to negotiate below the asking rent, $3,750, they agreed to pay it in full. ''Then the broker spoke to the leasing agent, who told her, 'The landlord is leaning to other people, but you could sweeten the deal if you raise that.' There was silence for a day or two and then we got the news that the rent had gone to $4,000.'' 
 They acquiesced and moved in on June 1. ''This is definitely a high-pressure game,'' Mr. Naftalis said. ''It just makes you want to buy an apartment.''

HEADLINE: Big Claims And Questions Surround Plan For a Stadium

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
According to the New York Jets, the stadium the team wants to build on the West Side of Manhattan will be an economic whirlwind, attracting 60 football games, soccer matches, concerts, trade shows and conventions a year. An Ernst & Young report commissioned by the team estimates that the stadium will generate $72.5 million in annual tax revenue. 
 But a close reading of the report and an examination of the track records of other combined stadium-exhibition halls suggest that the Jets' projections may be too optimistic. No other similar stadium has attracted anywhere near as many events as the Jets are predicting. The most successful convertible stadium, in St. Louis, drew 32 events last year, only eight of which did not involve sports.
 There are also unresolved questions about how the stadium would avoid competing for bookings with the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center next door, and how the team would juggle the demands of trade shows with a National Football League schedule. 
 Any shortfall in the number of bookings would throw into question the projected number of jobs that would be created and hotel rooms that would be reserved in connection with the stadium, as well as the revenue it would collect. All of those estimates have formed the economic and political rationale for the proposed $600 million investment by the city and the state in the hotly contested $1.4 billion project.
 ''It'd be the most expensive N.F.L. stadium ever built,'' said Mark S. Rosentraub, a sports economist and the dean of the College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University. ''To justify the public investment, you'd have to have a range of economic and intangible benefits that no community has ever been able to realize.''
 The Jets have said they will invest $800 million in the structure, which would stand as tall as a 30-story building and feature electronic displays embedded in the glass walls, twirling wind turbines that would not only generate power but also glow at night and expensive restaurants on the club level. 
 Its glass and steel exoskeleton, mimicking the George Washington Bridge, would embrace a football field that could be converted to a 210,000-square-foot exhibition hall.
 The Ernst & Young study, which has been adopted by the Bloomberg administration without an independent analysis, identifies the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis as a comparable facility, home to what it says are ''40 to 50 expositions/conventions'' in 2002. The Dome is clearly the most successful of the three stadium-exhibition halls in the country, but a spokeswoman for the complex, Marie E. Portel, said it held only 34 events in 2002, including 18 sports-related contests and seven consumer shows. 
 Last year, the Dome held 32 events, including 10 football games, she said. There were only eight nonsporting events, or one-fifth of the 38 trade shows, conventions and consumer shows that the Jets predict they will book into the stadium every year. And most of the nonsporting events in St. Louis -- car and boat shows -- are what economists call consumer shows, low-impact events that draw people from the surrounding area but do not usually generate hotel and restaurant bookings.
 The difference between trade and consumer shows is an important one. Industry analysts estimate that people who go to a car show spend about $75 a day, compared with the $362 a day spent by convention and trade show attendees over three days, according to the Ernst & Young report. Economists use those numbers to estimate the indirect impact of a stadium when attendees use nearby restaurants and hotels, which then hire additional employees.
 Officials for the city and the Jets dismiss any comparison to St. Louis, noting that the Javits Convention Center has to turn away hundreds of millions of dollars in business each year because it is too small. (The center has 720,000 square feet of exhibition space; a planned expansion would increase that to 1.1 million square feet.)
 ''In terms of the ability to attract conventions and events, you simply can't compare New York and St. Louis,'' said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. "We have 10 times the number of hotel rooms and 10 times as many people in the metropolitan area. That's why, even with a too-small Javits, we attract seven times as many events and conventions.''
 The Jets report contends that the team will be able to book 17 ''stadium events,'' including the team's 10 football games, as well as 38 trade shows or conventions and only two consumer shows, in contrast with St. Louis.
 ''We cite St. Louis to prove the point that these kind of facilities work,'' said Thad Sheely, the Jets' vice president for development. ''New York is significantly underserved with exhibition space. You only need to look at the Javits, the show piers and the Park Avenue Armory to understand that New York needs this kind of space.''
 According to the Ernst & Young report, the stadium would generate more than $72 million in annual tax revenues, a great deal more than the estimated $42 million a year it would cost the city and the state to pay for $600 million in bonds.
 To back up their claims, the Jets brandish letters from top trade show producers like Reed Exhibitions, stating that there are 15 to 20 shows that it cannot bring to New York because of a lack of adequate exhibit space. Earlier this month, the team also announced that it had created and booked the Big Apple Bowl, a college championship for the Big East Conference that would be played at the stadium if it is built.
 Critics do not doubt that the Jets would be able to attract trade shows or consumer shows to the stadium, but they do question whether the team would be able to generate as much business as it claims. The convention business has been plagued in recent years by a nationwide abundance of exhibition space, a decline in demand and fierce competition among cities.
 And the rather dismal performance of the newly built $850 million Boston Convention and Exhibition Center illustrates the gap that can emerge between projections and reality. A 1997 feasibility study estimated that the Boston center would book 34 large-scale events in its first full year of operation. But with the complex scheduled to open next month, it has only 43 confirmed bookings through 2010.
 ''The question is: How much will it cost, and what is the price for getting what will likely be a modest increment in activity?'' asked Heywood T. Sanders, a professor of public administration at the University of Texas and a leading researcher on the economics of convention centers. ''In the current environment, where convention centers are discounting rates, providing incentives or literally giving space away for free, expressing an interest in coming and actually turning up are two very different things.''
 One leading trade show producer in New York -- who takes a more optimistic view of the city's convention business -- said he favored the planned $1.4 billion expansion of the Javits convention center. But he expected that he would book no more than three shows a year into the Jets complex.
 ''Nobody thinks the Jets stadium makes sense as a convention hall,'' he said. ''It is true we need more exhibition space. I just don't know how well it's going to work. We'd be far better off with an expanded Javits.''
 The producer requested anonymity because he did not want to offend the Bloomberg administration. ''It was explained to me,'' he said, ''if you want the Javits expansion, you have to get on board. It's a loser for me to make noise.''
 The producer as well as many critics wonder whether the Jets will cooperate or compete with the Javits. Mr. Sheely, the Jets' vice president for development, said the ''untapped market is really in conventions and trade shows, because the Javits has locked up the consumer market.''
 But the Javits has been moving away from consumer shows and increasing the number of trade shows and conventions. Javits executives and members of the hotel industry have said that the center would be better able to attract conventions after expanding both its exhibit space and the number of meeting rooms.
 Jets officials are meeting with Javits representatives to discuss management issues, but it is clear that the Jets space will be more expensive, given the costs of converting from a football configuration and the expense of air-conditioning a stadium.
 Paul Sajovec, senior vice president of HVS, a convention and sports consulting firm, conducted a study of St. Louis, Atlanta and Indianapolis -- the three places where there are stadium-convention centers -- for Madison Square Garden. The garden vigorously opposes the Jets stadium for competitive reasons. Mr. Sajovec said that each of the three facilities averaged 11.3 nonsporting events per year. 
 ''They've greatly overshot the number of convention and trade shows that they'd be able to attract and accommodate at an enclosed football stadium,'' he said. ''Stadiums are occasionally used for overflow or auxiliary space for a car show and boat show. But the number of stand-alone events is almost nonexistent.''
 Although the Ernst & Young report does not consider the economic impact of a Super Bowl, it does predict that the Jets stadium will be home to the football championship every five years. But the Super Bowl has been awarded to 12 cities, and the number is growing.
 L. Jay Cross, president of the Jets, dismissed doubts about the Super Bowl, saying that New York would be in a regular rotation with Miami, New Orleans, Phoenix and possibly Los Angeles. However, he conceded in an interview that contrary to the Ernst & Young report, there was no hope of attracting professional basketball or hockey all-star games.

HEADLINE: Father Outsources Best

BYLINE: By Bruce Stockler. 
Bruce Stockler is a media relations consultant and author of ''I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets.''

 BODY:
Dear A., J., B. & H.:
 Thank you for the book, DVD and James Gandolfini beach blanket, but I will forward them to Mr. Gupta, your new father, who lives in Bangalore, India (see attached map).
 Please don't cry or throw tantrums -- I don't want Mr. Gupta to take over the family under the wrong paradigm. I will always love each of you with all my heart, but it just isn't practical for me to continue the work of being your daddy in today's global economy. 
 Every organization must adapt to changes in the marketplace, and our family is no exception. To remove the unfair tax burden on Daddy's domestic middle-class income, I will be generating offshore revenue streams that will provide all of you a higher standard of living. This is not to say that I expect you to grow up and sidestep any of your economic responsibilities, only that hard work does not always yield the intended reward.
 Many Daddy-intensive activities, like jumping on the bed, disgusting-noise marathons and string-cheese spitting won't be possible anymore. On the other hand, Mr. Gupta and his staff will be available 24/7 for technical and moral support.
 I know you'll miss the cuddling and snuggling, but recent studies have shown that too much hugging can lead children to join organized- crime families, and I'd rather you develop eating and sexual disorders like everyone else. Sure, the next 10 to 15 years will be rough, but they will go by pretty quickly if you sleep a lot.
 Please believe me when I say that these awkward circumstances are unrelated to your actions -- despite the bickering, tattling, back talk and ghastly disregard for personal property, you are the most wonderful children imaginable. But even the net total of our familial happiness cannot overcome the aggregate inertia of global labor demands.
 Mr. Gupta will read bedtime stories over the family intranet. Even though you will be sitting alone in your beds, listening to the disembodied voice of a near total stranger, remember that you are lucky to live in America, home of Ben Franklin and Willie Mays and Hilary Duff, and that you could be growing up in France, where you'd have no father either, and be forced to listen to Edith Piaf, smoke cigarettes and make excuses for terrorism. So bedtime won't be the same, but, then again, you always complained that bedtime was boring. 
 Please remember to set the burglar alarm if Mommy has been drinking her special pink soda and hide her car keys in the frog basket. Christmas, Thanksgiving and birthdays will be disappointing, but I want the four of you to pull together. Abraham Lincoln said that a house divided cannot stand, and, even though this may feel like a textbook example of a divided house, that's not true. We are a house reconfigured. Studies have shown such houses may stand up to 46 percent longer than regular old houses, so keep up the good thoughts.
 This Father's Day will be hard, given that you are waking up to find an incomprehensible letter in lieu of your actual daddy, but remember that most children see their dads only a few hours a week anyway, time usually spent yelling and screaming about where the power tools went. Given the extraordinary quality time we have already enjoyed, you've accrued gross hours of paternal affection equal to that of the average 24-year-old. Sure, you can't hug a statistical model, but Mr. Gupta can e-mail you relevant links, and information is more valuable than hugs. When all else fails, Google ''Daddy'' and I'll know you're thinking of me, because I pull down all the latest data from the 100-Gbit satellite in my refurbished trailer, perched on the edge of a cliff.

HEADLINE: That Mirage in Foreign Harbors

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of CBS MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN the domestic stock market falls, investors may consider themselves protected if they hold a generous helping of foreign stocks in their portfolios. After all, generations of financial planners have advised their clients to diversify in order to reduce risk. What could provide broader diversification than a sampling of stocks from around the world?
 Evidence is growing, however, that adding foreign stocks to a domestic stock portfolio does little to reduce the chance of losses. In fact, a big dollop of foreign stocks can make a bad situation worse. 
 That was certainly the case recently. From the stock market's high point this year on March 5, for example, to its low on May 17, the average domestic stock lost almost 7 percent, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 index. Over the same period, foreign stocks lost almost 10 percent, according to the MSCI EAFE index. On average, internationally diversified stock investors would have fared better by investing in domestic stocks alone. 
 To be sure, foreign stocks have not always performed this poorly against a declining domestic market. And even when they have, American investors have not always suffered: if the dollar's value falls on the currency markets, for example, a stock's loss in its home currency may still translate into a gain in dollar terms. 
 Nevertheless, more often than not, foreign stock markets do not provide much, if any, buffer for the domestic market. That is because the relationship between the two categories of stocks is not constant throughout the market cycle. More precisely, academic studies have found that the performance of foreign stocks and domestic stocks tends to be more highly correlated -- more closely linked -- when domestic stocks are declining than when they are rising. 
 This dual relationship has several unfortunate consequences. It means that foreign stocks provide relatively little risk reduction to a portfolio when it needs it the most: when most of the holdings are declining. It also means that international diversification provides the bulk of its risk reduction when domestic stocks are rising, when investors don't really need it.
 The uneven correlation also reduces the long-term returns of internationally diversified portfolios, according to Domingo Castelo Joaquin, a finance professor at Illinois State University. Professor Joaquin, co-author of one of the first studies that documented the phenomenon, says that when American stocks are rising, globally diversified portfolios, on average, tend to make significantly less money than purely American stock portfolios. Yet he found that the uneven correlation tends to cause the average diversified portfolio to lose only slightly less than an entirely American stock portfolio when the domestic stock market is falling.
 Professor Joaquin concludes that if stock investors want to significantly reduce their vulnerability to a decline in the domestic stock market, they will need to shift some of their holdings away from stocks entirely, into assets like bonds, commodities or even cash. These kinds of investments usually don't move in lock step with the American stock market, whether it's going up or down. But, as he reminds us, reducing risk this way also carries a price, because these assets typically produce lower long-term returns than stocks. By diversifying this way, a portfolio's performance is likely to be steadier, but less impressive.
 Some advisers have tried to avoid this problem by taking a different approach to diversification: holding stocks in a very broad range of industries and sectors within the domestic market, some of which, presumably, would remain buoyant while the rest of the market declined. But new research closes this escape route, as well, according to Kirt C. Butler, a finance professor at Michigan State University who is the author of a college textbook on international investing. 
 Professor Butler says diversification by industry and sector suffers from the same quirk as international diversification. While industries and sectors tend to have relatively little correlation with one another when the domestic stock market is rising, they become more highly correlated when the market is falling.
 ''When it rains, it pours,'' Professor Butler said. In short, he said, the factors that cause domestic stocks to decline are likely to be felt not only in foreign stock markets, but throughout all sectors and industries of the American economy as well. While there are exceptions, there is generally no reliable place within world equity markets to hide during a storm.
 This does not necessarily mean that you should avoid international stocks. But you should not buy them to reduce your stock portfolio's risk.

HEADLINE: Sudan Leader Orders Disarming of Militias

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan, June 19 

 BODY:
President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir of Sudan on Saturday ordered ''complete mobilization'' to disarm all illegal armed groups, including the Arab militiamen who have been harassing African villagers in Darfur, in the west.
 The order was made a day after the United States threatened to impose sanctions on Sudan to intensify pressure to help ease a crisis for civilians in Darfur that the United Nations says is the worst in the world. 
 The president said government agencies should mobilize ''to control and pursue all outlaw groups, including rebels and Janjaweed,'' and ''disarm the outlaws and present them to justice and prevent any groups from crossing into neighboring Chad.'' The Janjaweed is the local name for the Arab militias whom the Darfur rebels blame for much of the conflict in the region. The rebels say the government has backed the Janjaweed, but the government has denied that.
 Mustafa Osman Ismail, the foreign minister of Sudan, told reporters that the decision meant the government would deploy additional police officers and troops to maintain order in Darfur. Asked how the decree squared with the cease-fire between the government and the rebels, he said the truce required the rebels to maintain current positions.
 ''Any group out of the demarcated territories , it is the responsibility of the government to deal with them,'' he said. International organizations have criticized the Sudanese government for not controlling the militias, who have driven hundreds of thousands of Africans into camps for the displaced or into exile in Chad.

HEADLINE: A Transition Under Fire in Iraq

 BODY:
One Bush administration forecast about Iraq is clearly coming true. As the days count down to next week's transfer of limited powers to an interim Iraqi government, things are getting worse. Attacks against Iraqis working with the American occupation authorities seem increasingly frequent and audacious. Last Thursday, Iraq's deadliest car bombing in months killed at least 35 people waiting to sign up for the new national army and injured more than 100 others. 
 Without a turnaround in the security situation, significant progress toward a self-governing, let alone democratic, Iraq is unlikely. So far, neither increasing American troop levels nor crash efforts to recruit and train reliable Iraqi security forces have helped. Improving the Iraqi military and police forces is critical, but increasingly problematic now that recruitment offices have become a prime target for attack.
 Control over Iraq's small and wobbly national army is one of the few scraps of real power Washington has agreed to hand over to the interim government, and last week Iraq's newly named interior minister floated the idea of declaring martial law. Given the state of the Iraqi forces, the gesture was both politically jarring and militarily futile.
 The ceremonial passage of power on June 30 is unlikely to usher in any immediate improvement in the security situation. With millions of Iraqis resentful of American occupation and attendant horrors like Abu Ghraib, residential neighborhoods terrorized by kidnappers and other criminals, another stifling summer under way without adequate electric power and economic revival a distant dream, it takes only a few thousand armed insurgents to generate an atmosphere of random carnage and rampant anarchy.
 With this in mind, the Pentagon now plans to keep 138,000 troops in Iraq indefinitely, almost 25,000 more than it was projecting a few months ago. Even more may be needed, although the idea of a larger and more visible American military presence will not be popular with Iraqis. According to a recent poll commissioned by the occupation authorities, increasing numbers of Iraqis would like to see American troops go home. 
 The road that got us to this point will be fully examined during the American election cycle. But there is no way to avoid the current reality. Iraqis are being protected -- to the degree they are protected at all -- by American troops they do not want and Iraqi soldiers who have shown a disturbing tendency to melt away in battle. Building a reliable Iraqi military and police will take time, and will depend on how well the country's interim leaders can establish their own authority and win the trust of a highly skeptical Iraqi population.

HEADLINE: Shades of Silicon Alley: The Day Traders Rise Again

BYLINE: By ERIKA KINETZ

 BODY:
EIGHT rows of men sit facing north, shunning the morning sun in favor of watching the pulsing computer monitors lined up, three to a man, in front of them. Occasionally, the hush is broken by the thump of a fist and a muttered profanity. 
 These men are not video game fanatics. They are day traders, at work one recent morning at the Fifth Avenue office of the Schonfeld Group. 
 Day traders, that species of investor who tries to profit from short-term movements in stock prices over a few days, hours or even minutes, were a fixture in the city in the late 90's. But when the market tanked, their dreams of riding the soaring Nasdaq to a life of affluence -- preferably on their own private island in the Caribbean -- vanished. Chastened, they went back to their jobs as construction workers, teachers, pharmacists and mail carriers.
 Now they have returned. Although the number of day traders is nowhere near what it was at the height of the dot-com bubble, defectors have gradually started to return, thanks to the relative strength of the market over the last 18 months. This is especially true in New York, where the beating of Wall Street's heart may be louder than anywhere else in the country and where day traders, now strewn across the globe, first captured the popular imagination in the mid-90's. 
 With the renewed interest comes the individual spirit of these ''active'' traders, a term many of them prefer so as to distance themselves from the excesses of the 90's. 
 ''What is risk in life?'' asked Gene Bonnano, who worked for I.B.M. for 22 years before becoming a full-time trader three years ago. ''Working for Enron and having your pension taken away? Working for a big corporation like I did and not being able to spend time with your family?'' 
 A growing number of people seem to be thinking the same way. In February, about 5,100 people attended the International Traders Expo, a show catering to active traders at the Marriott Marquis in Midtown, up from fewer than 3,900 last year. 
 Trading is up at many local brokerages, too. Track Data, a brokerage based in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, that is geared to high-volume traders, reported a 15 percent jump in trading by individuals so far this year. And Schonfeld's 500 individual traders are buying and selling 35 million shares a day, up from 20 million this time last year.
 Critics say such trading is basically gambling; on its Web site, the Securities and Exchange Commission warns investors, ''Day trading is extremely risky and can result in substantial financial losses in a very short period of time.''
 Parts of the industry have been rife with abuses, and some have been the targets of legal actions by the government. But, in addition to offering the independence that day traders typically desire, advocates say day trading is safer than long-term investing and is an easy field to enter. All someone really needs to start is a chunk of cash, time and a willingness to learn. 
 Today's day traders tend to be a little older and a lot wiser than those of the late 90's. Cary Gruber, an apple-cheeked man with perfect white teeth, has been trading his own account full time at Schonfeld since 1998, when he quit his job as a broker. Mr. Gruber, like other survivors of the dot-com years, has become more methodical, arming himself with innumerable charts and filters, a daily game plan and a lot of discipline. Unlike his wife, he has no aspirations to work on Wall Street. ''It's not that glamorous over there,'' he said. ''I control my destiny. I love that.''
 Peter Kaplan, who makes his living both by trading and by teaching traders, works from his home, a spacious, newly renovated apartment near Gramercy Park. A sandy-haired 36-year-old with a goatee, Mr. Kaplan listens to electronic trance music while he works. ''It keeps me jacked up and focused,'' he said from his perch in front of three flat-panel monitors plastered with financial data.
 His profession is very different from the one he intended to pursue. After graduating from Skidmore College in 1990 with a degree in English, Mr. Kaplan spent five years working on a novel. The book was never published, but he managed to make a tidy living from his stock-trading hobby. His father, who works for Bear Stearns, was proud -- sort of. ''He wanted to see me put on a suit and tie and go get a job,'' Mr. Kaplan said.
 IN 2000, he decided to get some education to help him beat the brewing bear market. After taking an intensive weekend course, he sat his wife down and told her: ''Honey, we're going to be millionaires! Pull out a map and pick out an island!''
 That didn't happen. In fact, with $400 to $500 a day in trading fees, he started losing substantial money. It took him more than two years to unlearn his fast and furious trading habits and to develop his own philosophy. These days, he works more slowly and steadily, and is obsessed with charts. 
 One of his students, Stan Raj, divides his time between the buildings he manages in Staten Island and his home trading office there, where he is equipped with four monitors and a cable modem. ''I'd much rather trade than anything else,'' he said. ''There's freedom involved. You can do it from anywhere in the world. All you need is a computer. No boss. No employees.'' 
 Still, making it as a day trader is tough. The show at the Marriott Marquis closed with a live trading duel, conducted with fanfare under four large chandeliers. Two men, both in gray, both balding, sat before laptops. Behind them, on two large screens, sell orders ticked by in red and buy orders in blue. There was no sweat, no blood, no tears -- just a steady stream of numbers.
 During the duel, those present discussed practical issues surrounding the profession. ''How much money should you make your first year?'' asked Scott Kohl, who is the head trader at Alaron Trading Corporation and who provided steady narration during the electronic duel. His answer: ''Have enough left over so you can start your second year.''

HEADLINE: Torch Illuminates a Risky Business

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
THE Olympic torch wended its way through New York yesterday, carrying the glow of human glory.
 Having been chosen for its grand role in staging the ancient Olympics, Greece prepares for its next encounter with history when the Summer Games open in Athens on Aug. 13.
 But the torchbearers around the five boroughs might also have been ancient Greek warriors, bearing a warning to all cities that would even think of staging future Games: ''The budget overruns are coming! The budget overruns are coming!''
 The latest estimate is that the cost of building for the coming Summer Games in Athens may exceed the government's original $5.5 billion estimate by about $1.7 billion. 
 This projected deficit may very well make New Yorkers wonder if a couple of weeks of fun and games are worth the hidden or unanticipated costs. The city is one of five finalists to be host of the 2012 Games, to be chosen in July 2005.
 ''We don't do it for 17 days; we do it for years to come,'' said Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the president of the Athens organizing committee, adding that her committee's budget is balanced. 
 Mrs. A., as she is often called, was in town for the torch procession, which in a gracious gesture has touched corners of the earth, like Africa and South America, that may never be able to afford the Games. 
 She spoke idealistically of watching icons like Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Pele of Brazil take part in the Olympic pageantry. 
 ''We forget what divides us,'' she said. ''Athens will be good for the athletes. We will show what we can give back and hope that things can be better.''
 This is serious business to Greeks, who live with their heritage every day. One Greek friend said carrying the torch in his homeland was the proudest moment of his life, so far. 
 The mental worry beads worked. The Calatrava roof -- the soaring symbol, for better or worse, of these Games -- is in place over the main stadium. Pierre Kosmidis, a media official with the organizing committee, recalls the moment the roof finally began to inch its way into place a few weeks ago: ''I felt my knees shake.'' Then Italian workmen started to sing, and produced a bottle of red wine and paper cups, and they all toasted the Calatrava roof. 
 The Greeks believe they are ready to throw a good party. The country, I am here to tell you, is a delightful place for a vacation, under normal circumstances. The Games will undoubtedly look great on NBC. And we won't even get into security issues.
 Realists that they are, however, the Greeks also know that the lasting stigma of the Games could turn out to be one missed bus by one cranky American sportswriter, too many logistical snafus at events, piles of construction rubble, hotel and travel complications, a general unfinished feeling, all arising from the three lost years from 1997 to 2000, before Mrs. A. was invited to take over the Olympic responsibility.
 At least the pressure is off Athens to gain the title of ''best games ever,'' which Juan Antonio Samaranch used to bestow at every closing ceremony.
 In Atlanta in 1996, when Samaranch said the Games were merely ''exceptional,'' the impact was like a stinging slap in the face in a tony restaurant.
 During a recent interview, Dr. Jacques Rogge, who succeeded Samaranch as president of the International Olympic Committee, said that he would not be calling the Athens Games the best ever, which annoyed Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, and hastened Rogge to explain:
 ''My predecessor, who I respect very much, used to say each time 'the best Games ever,' '' Rogge said on June 12. ''I thought that in my humble opinion you cannot compare Games that are held at a different time, in different continents, in different countries, which have their own cultural, political and economic systems.''
 Rogge called the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, the first under his regime, ''superb Games.'' On June 12 he said he would not be calling future Games ''the best ever,'' saying, ''It's a general policy that I have taken.''
 Still not amused, Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said Thursday, ''The Games will be judged by thousands of people at the Games.'' She added, ''They will also be judged by people sitting on their sofas in Moscow, Bali, New York.''
 Angelopoulos-Daskalaki speaks glowingly of the Greek legacy of the Games but sounds less upbeat about the economic viability of smaller countries being Olympic hosts.
 ''Baron de Coubertin said the Games had to go around the world,'' she said, referring to the French patron of the modern Games. ''Does the I.O.C. have a strategy? This is not just a sporting event. The I.O.C. asks a city to change its face.''
 In theory, the I.O.C. favors using existing facilities, but in reality the Games demand gigantic new projects. 
 ''And once the Games are over, once the real price of the budget is known,'' Rogge said, ''then our Greek friends will have to look at it and see, with the success of the Games, how it's a great legacy that will be given to Greece.'' 
 Citizens of New York might very well applaud the Olympic torch passing through their town. But it is the citizens of Greece who are bearing the expensive burden of their glorious heritage.

HEADLINE: A Lofty Resume, But Firmly Rooted

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG. 
E-mail: wested@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE 

 BODY:
NOT many students receive invitations to take qualifying exams for the United States Physics Team, an elite group of 24 young scientists chosen from 207 top scorers. 
 And not many who make the final cut pass up that prestigious opportunity.
 For Matthew Fasman, 18, who graduates from New Rochelle High School as salutatorian of a 585-member class, the honor couldn't compete with commitments he had made to the high school band and his track team.
 ''I have an obligation to my team, and I had my last high school concert,'' said Mr. Fasman, who declined a berth on the physics team. ''I wanted to do those more.'' 
 That decision, said those who know Mr. Fasman, goes some way toward explaining why he is one of the more unusual people to emerge from Westchester's class of 2004.
 The county is hardly lacking in bright, successful students who are headed for the Ivy League and other elite universities. But some of them have unabashedly sought tutors to improve scholastic performance and selected their extracurricular and volunteer activities with an eye to how those pastimes would look on a college application. Mr. Fasman stands out because his achievements haven't been buffed or bought. 
 ''Matthew is probably the most extraordinary kid I've ever had the privilege of counseling,'' said Mike Tedesco, a guidance counselor at New Rochelle High. ''He's an extraordinary human being. He's intellectually gifted, but he doesn't flaunt it. There's a genuine sense of humility and decency. He's remained a kid -- someone who acts his age.''
 Mr. Fasman's accomplishments are indeed impressive. He is a National Merit Scholar finalist; a National Advanced Placement scholar, with perfect fives on nine exams, all taken before his senior year; a Byrd scholar; an Intel semifinalist for his work in computer science (which he conducted with a Princeton professor); a winner of one of 1,308 national scholarships financed by Best Buy Children's Foundation; and one of 12 finalists in the Wendy's High School Heisman Award program for students talented in athletics and academics. He is also one of 141 finalists, selected from a field of 2,700, in the 2004 Presidential Scholars Program.
 He has attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts; volunteers with the New Rochelle Youth Court; heads the swim and track teams (he clocked the fastest relay time in 20 years); played water polo for the Empire State Team; and heads the youth group at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in New Rochelle. Oh, and last summer, he spent a few weeks as a Habitat for Humanity volunteer in Yonkers.
 ''I don't like being bored,'' Mr. Fasman said.
 Small chance of that, when he is also a member of the high school's ''Academic'' team (the high school equivalent of College Bowl) and model United Nations, as well as vice president of the National Honor Society. 
 He is the older of two brothers who grew up in New Rochelle; his father is a dentist and his mother an actuary. He works as a lifeguard at Rye American Yacht Club and volunteers as a homework tutor in his church's after-school program.
 Not quite everything comes easily to him, however. Trumpet has been a challenge, even though he has remained with the band throughout high school.
 ''He's practiced really hard,'' Robert Freeberg, director of bands for New Rochelle High, said in a telephone interview. ''From Day 1, Matt knew band was not going to be about him as the star. The mathematical part of music he understood; the physical part he had to work at.'' 
 Similarly, Mr. Fasman said one reason for his heavy involvement in sports was that, as a fourth grader, he had been frustrated by the difficulties he experienced in a triathlon.
 ''I had asthma,'' he said. ''I joined the Iona swim team.''
 He is headed to Harvard in September (he also got into M.I.T., Yale, Princeton, Emory, Duke and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). He expects to study physics, math, economics and French, and would ultimately like to pursue an academic career.
 ''I'm thinking of being a college professor in physics or math,'' he said. ''I have trouble working for money.''

HEADLINE: A Westchester Opinion Page

 BODY:
The page you are reading now is a corrective, a fresh start, a new answer to an old riddle: how the editorial section of The Times can think globally and locally at the same time.
 Until now, our editorials and op-ed articles have been like a camera with four main focal settings: World, Nation, Washington and New York. Subjects in the awkward middle distance -- call it Region -- pop into the frame sometimes, but not with the frequency or fine detail that the closest, most engaged viewers (you, in other words) might hope for. 
 The Times will always speak with one editorial voice, but as of today, we're expanding the opportunities for conversation, with new Sunday opinion pages in our regional sections for Westchester, Long Island and the city. Opinion pages for Connecticut and New Jersey are our next project.
 We've been wanting to do this for a long time. It only makes sense: There are 9.7 million people in the New York suburbs. If this region were a state, it would rank ninth in population, just behind Michigan. That means roughly one suburbanite for every person in Istanbul, which would also be quite a dance party, if we could ever pull it off. 
 To begin the discussion, let's share some bedrock assumptions. Here are a few things we believe:
 That the New York City suburbs are not enclaves of complacent wealth to be mined every time the state needs more money. But given New York's wide distribution of income and social ills, the region will inevitably have to keep paying most of the bill for state services, with disproportional benefits going upstate, to failing small cities and rural areas. Because the suburbs are Albany's biggest benefactors, they have a particular stake in seeing that the place runs more efficiently than it does now.
 That affordable housing is one of the region's great conundrums and most urgent problems, requiring bold if not radical new solutions.
 That this does not lessen the importance of other issues: the environment, transportation, schools, energy, health care, the exodus of the young and the problems of the old and poor.
 That deer are wonderful, but not so wonderful that none should ever be shot.
 That people who must travel great distances to work by train, bus or boat are ennobled by their suffering and deserve to ride with dignity.
 That the Hudson River and Long Island Sound, too, have suffered enough, and that in conflicts involving development, industry or motorized recreation we will often be a voice for voiceless shad, striped bass and horseshoe crabs.
 Expect more such assertions in coming weeks. Letters and op-ed submissions are invited -- see the note below if you're ready to send one. 
 Now that we're all here, let's start talking.

HEADLINE: Iraq Is a Hub for Terrorism, However You Define It

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
A SUPERPOWER invaded an impoverished Islamic nation. Guerrillas responded with AK-47's and rocket-propelled grenades. A generation of warriors was born, eager to wage jihad.
 That was Afghanistan in the 1980's. It became a breeding ground for terrorists -- most infamously Osama bin Laden -- who exported their deadly skills throughout the world. In Iraq, some of the same conditions that nurtured terrorism in the mountains of Afghanistan have emerged in the power vacuum created by the American occupation, Iraqis and terrorism experts say. 
 ''Unfortunately Iraq has become a cause celebre for radical jihadists the way that Afghanistan did a decade and a half ago,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism analyst at the RAND Corporation. ''You've got a lot of the same conditions that allowed Afghanistan to become a hub for terrorists.''
 Those include porous borders, swaths of lawless land and regions of the country harboring well-armed groups that are neither part of the government nor under its control, Mr. Hoffman said.
 He defined terrorists in terms of tactics -- using suicide car bombs rather than conventional weapons, for example. Since the civil war in Lebanon, the line between terrorism and insurgency has blurred, he said, with Iraq being a perfect example.
 There has been an average of one car bomb a day this month. More than 100 civilians have been killed. 
 Assassinations of Iraqi government officials and sabotage of crucial sites like oil pipelines are on the rise. American and Iraqi forces seem unable to prevent the carnage, fueling hatred of the occupation among the population.
 Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a spokesman for the occupation forces, said that reconstruction work like opening health clinics and renovating schools had brightened the lives of Iraqis. But ''are we satisfied with the level of instability in this country right now?'' he said. ''Absolutely not.''
 Under Saddam Hussein, Iraq was subjected to a reign of terror, but terrorism did not exist here in the manner it does now. 
 An independent commission in Washington investigating the attacks of Sept. 11 reported last week that there was no evidence of a working relationship between Mr. Hussein and Al Qaeda, as the Bush administration had said in pressing its case for war.
 The failure now to control borders has allowed foreign fighters to enter Iraq. Unguarded overland crossings exist between Iraq and its neighbors Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia, each of which has its share of radical Islamic groups. 
 Falah al-Naqib, the new Iraqi interior minister, said the suicide car bombs were a sign that foreign fighters had infiltrated Iraq, and that ''some parties and countries want to demolish this country.'' He said Iraqis do not use such tactics. And he added that he ''won't hesitate'' to declare martial law if more deadly bombings take place.
 Ahmed Hashim, a professor at the United States Naval War College who studies the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, also attributed much of the violence to the porous borders and the fact that the American presence has become a magnet for jihadists.
 ''I think terrorism has come to Iraq as a result of the war,'' he said. ''The country has unpatrolled and open borders, so all kinds of extremists who want to fight America have an excellent playing field to do so now.''
 A senior American military official wrote in an e-mail message that the fighters enter through old smuggling routes that follow tribal connections. These are like the routes used by mujahedeen to enter Afghanistan.
 ''The U.S. military continues to see small numbers of foreign fighters coming through the porous borders of Syria and Saudi Arabia,'' the official wrote. ''Financial support continues to come from Saudi Arabia through various financiers to terrorist networks and through Syria via couriers.''
 Inside Iraq, these forces find fertile ground. By deciding that Baath Party members could not participate in the rebuilding of Iraq, the Americans essentially dismantled much of the state without installing a suitable replacement. L. Paul Bremer III, the top civilian administrator here, disbanded the Iraqi Army, leaving behind a pool of disgruntled men trained in killing. 
 The new American-trained Iraqi security forces can often be ineffective, as demonstrated by the mass defections during the uprising in April. Just last Monday, Baghdad policemen stood by as Iraqis danced atop the charred vehicles of a convoy carrying foreign contractors that had been hit by a suicide car bomb.
 Nadhim A. al-Jassour, a professor of international relations at the University of Baghdad, said that the American evisceration of the Iraqi state had taught Iraqis to disrespect the government, perpetuating the lawlessness.
 ''If you beat a father in front of his children, do you think the children will respect the father?'' Professor Jassour said. ''That's an insult. At the same time, you ask the father to carry out duties in his house.''
 The Sunni-dominated city of Falluja, 35 miles west of Baghdad, has become a safe haven for terrorists and insurgents. In late April, marines turned over control of the city to a militia composed partly of guerrillas. Since then, Falluja has become a mini-Islamist state, with all manner of anti-American fighters roaming the town.
 While Iraq is not run by warlords, as Afghanistan has been, armed groups exist that do not answer to the government. 
 One of the largest is the Mahdi Army, led by Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who rallied a revolt against the occupation in April. Though Mr. Sadr called last week for his fighters to leave the holy cities of Najaf and Kufa, he did not commit to disbanding the militia.
 A recent poll ordered by the Coalition Provisional Authority showed that a majority of Iraqis look up to Mr. Sadr. Last Sunday, he said through a spokesman that he wanted to start a political party.
 As the United States occupation approaches its official end on June 30, many Iraqis say that the future will be defined by the legacy the Americans are leaving the interim government -- the birth of terrorist and insurgent groups and the struggle to control them.

HEADLINE: In Buenos Aires, Late Nights and (Very) Low Prices

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE

 BODY:
''IN Buenos Aires these days, everyone is having problems sleeping,'' said my Argentine friend Cesar as we strolled down a street in Palermo Viejo, the neighborhood of shops, bars and restaurants known locally as the SoHo of Buenos Aires. It was around 3:30 a.m. on a weekend, cool enough for a leather jacket, but the sidewalks were alive with people still reluctant to call it a night, looking for another bar, another sidewalk cafe, in which to linger.
 I live in New York, where I'm usually in bed by 11. At 11 you'll be lucky to get a reservation in a Buenos Aires restaurant. I didn't expect that I would adapt to the city's famously late hours when I first arrived there for a stay of about a week in April. Soon, however, I found myself enthusiastically ordering grilled lomo (tenderloin) and morcilla (blood sausage) at midnight -- certainly not conducive to a good night's rest.
 But that's not the kind of insomnia Cesar was talking about. I'd asked him how things were going since the Argentine currency crash of March 2002, when the peso was devalued by the government and lost about two-thirds of its value almost overnight. Cesar shrugged, in that Buenos Aires way, a shrug that said: Not good. And hadn't I noticed all the ads on the Buenos Aires subway for melatonin and sleeping pills? 
 Most people are still struggling, he said. Life is not what it was: Argentines have seen their purchasing power drop drastically. Still, on a Friday night on the town, you wouldn't guess it. At around 8:30 in the evening, along the brightly lighted Avenida Corrientes (Buenos Aires's Broadway), the pretheater crowds buzz with anticipation, thronging the entrances to opulent old Art Deco theaters like the Teatro Opera. Buenos Aires's theater row vies with Madrid's to present the top musicians, actors, dancers and orchestras in the Latin world; many come here just for the theater. (Cesar and I went to see the Argentine dancer Maximiliano Guerra, a muscular and handsome international ballet star, perform an extraordinary program of ballet, tango and rock 'n' roll composed by the Argentine rock icon Charly Garcia.)
 After the ballet, it was off to the Club del Vino, a chic cabaret theater and wine bar, where the audience -- another packed house -- quickly succumbed to a comedy troupe's affectionate parody of a Latin lounge-lizard act. The laughter and fine wine flowed, and by the end of the show the audience was on its feet dancing giddily to ''La Bamba.''
 Maybe the residents of Buenos Aires, the portenos, were tossing and turning, but they also seemed determined to keep their spirits up, and enjoy their fabulous city.
 The flip side of Argentina's economic pain is that the United States dollar goes a long way. Just about everything in Argentina -- from hotel rooms to fine restaurants to local transportation -- costs about two-thirds less than it would in the United States. The five-star luxury hotel is $100 to $175, the two- or three-star hotel $25; the best seat at the show on Avenida Corrientes is $20, the bottle of exquisite Argentine wine $6.50. (And, for those who want to be more than tourists in Buenos Aires, a modest pied-a-terre in a gorgeous classic 19th-century building sells for around $30,000.)
 The inequality of this pricked at my conscience, but tourist dollars, I knew, would help the local economy. ''Turismo Es Trabajo'' (''Tourism Means Jobs'') is the slogan on a public-service ad repeated over and over on Argentine TV. The people I met were unfailingly friendly and helpful to a stranger in town. For instance, a cabdriver parked by my hotel and walked me inside to the desk to make sure I'd be O.K. Crime is reportedly on the rise, but I exercised caution and felt more at ease than I have in some other Latin American cities. And although I saw plenty of broken sidewalks and streetlights, reminiscent of New York during its 1970's fiscal crisis, I also saw encouraging signs of the city's revival, especially in the area of Palermo Viejo, where I began my stay.
 Palermo Viejo is probably the best known of the new hip enclaves in Buenos Aires. Once a suburb of downtown (it is about 10 minutes by cab and 20 minutes by subway from the Obelisco, the tall Egyptian-style needle that marks the city's center), its rows of two- and three-story early 20th-century houses, many with rococo facades, languished in the 80's. Now they are being renovated, one by one, by young entrepreneurs. Boutiques that sell handmade shoes, designer home accessories or one-of-a-kind evening dresses elbow for space beside new restaurants, clubs and bars. The neighborhood boundaries have expanded -- there is now a Palermo SoHo and a Palermo Hollywood, a district of thriving film and television production companies.
 Checking the Internet to find a place to stay in the district, which doesn't have any sizable hotels, I found Che Lulu Guest House, in a narrow cobblestoned lane near the edge of the SoHo side of Palermo that has recently been renovated by a collective of artists as a B&B. Welcomed into the spacious common living room by a stylish young innkeeper and the throb of ambient music, I settled into my little room upstairs. It didn't have a bathroom (I shared one on the hall with another room). And with a renovation going on next door it was a bit noisy during the day, but it was sunny and pleasant. At breakfast, included in the $25-a-night price, I drank coffee and ate sugary-sweet Argentine croissants, medialunas, while sharing stories with tourists from England and Germany. 
 Although Palermo Viejo is in the midst of a transformation, it is still a working-class neighborhood, where fruit markets, schools and social clubs provide a solid contrast to the trendiness. So it's a terrific place to stroll. At the edge of Palermo Hollywood is a superb covered flea market (Mercado de las Pulgas) filled with the forgotten treasures of Argentine middle- and upper-class households -- row upon row of Italianate dining sets, tables piled with antique silver and, in one stall, a ceiling hung with Venetian glass chandeliers (I bought one, for $60). 
 Lunch in this neighborhood is an incredible value. At cool, minimalist Central, after my flea market run, I settled back into a seat on a white couch, and enjoyed a glass of sauvignon blanc with delicious ravioli in a mushroom sauce, organic salad and dessert for about $10. Lunch at Ristorante O was even better. There, each course was a well-thought-out combination of fresh local ingredients and European cooking techniques -- especially the risotto, delicately prepared but rich with the musky flavor of local mushrooms. I asked to see the chef so I could compliment him and discovered he was American, and had started his career at Charlie Trotter's. Oh, and lunch, with appetizer, main course, dessert, wine and coffee, also came to $10.
 Despite its pleasures, Palermo Viejo is a bit out of the way, and I wanted to spend some time downtown, so after two nights I moved to a hotel I had stayed in on a previous trip, the Broadway All Suites on the Avenida Corrientes. My room there was large, with a kitchenette and sitting room, and the location was convenient, but I was getting used to the Argentine way of looking at prices, and $65 (plus tax) began to feel like too much money. Cesar told me about a new hotel downtown, the Ibis, which was offering a deal for $25. I was a little dubious, since I'd checked out some hotels of this French budget chain in Europe and wasn't impressed. But my friend was right -- it was great, and brand new, with an enthusiastic staff. I booked a small, quiet room with a big bed covered with a turquoise bedspread and Ikea-style furniture. For another $2, I had breakfast in the lobby cafeteria, alongside lots of Brazilians.
 I had hit many of the key sights in Buenos Aires on an earlier trip, but some drew me back for a second round, like the moody Recoleta Cemetery, filled with gargantuan granite and marble monuments topped with cherubim and seraphim. I also returned to the Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires, or Malba, which opened in 2001, a world-class museum of Latin American painting and sculpture; its exhibitions of works by Diego Rivera and painters like Roberto Matta and Wilfredo Lam as well as a host of modern Uruguayans and Argentines, are on rotation. The Plaza Dorrego street fair, on Sundays in San Telmo, is a tourist parade, but still irresistible. How can you not love spending an afternoon meandering along cobblestoned streets, listening to jazz bands and watching septuagenarians in Borsalino hats dance the tango?
 ABOUT the tango. It is, of course, a symbol of Buenos Aires, probably the city's best-known export, and often invoked as a metaphor for the culture. There are dozens of clubs offering tango shows, places where you can watch or participate, afternoon, evening and night, in milongas, or tango dances. (My favorite is upstairs at the historic Confiteria Ideal, in the magnificent ballroom of mirrors and columns used as a location in Sally Potter's film ''The Tango Lesson.'') There is even a 24-hour cable channel, ''Solo Tango.'' I don't know how to tango, but on my first visit to Buenos Aires, I had thrown myself into the scene, spending hours watching dancers swirl and swoop, fending off passes (''I am the tango teacher give me a little kiss'') from tango Lotharios.
 This time, though, I wasn't in a tango mood. For it seemed to me the real action in Buenos Aires now wasn't the stagey, mannered passion of the tango floor but rather the everyday struggle to keep going through difficult times. So I skipped dancing, and instead I walked the leafy streets so reminiscent of Madrid or Paris, where the building facades were studded with placards that said ''Se Vende,'' For Sale. I stopped in bookstores -- Buenos Aires has an abundance of them, and they stay open late. In one, I found myself standing for an hour, conversing with the owner about politics, economics, Che Guevara and the movies. As citizens of two complex big cities that have experienced ups and downs, we soon found common ground.
 ''I love New York,'' the bookseller said as I departed. ''Say hello to Woody Allen for me.''
 I promised I would. Then I headed off to meet a friend, to share steaks, wine, conversation and another Buenos Aires sleepless night.

The bottom line
 I spent about $64.87 a day on food, lodging, activities and local transportation during eight days and nights, at 2.85 Argentine pesos to $1.

Getting There
 Using the United Airlines Web site (www.ual.com), I found a discounted round trip ticket from New York to Buenos Aires with a connection in Dulles International Airport near Washington for $572.50, with tax.

Hotels
 Che Lulu Guest House, Emilio Zola 5185, (54-11) 4772 0289, www.luluguesthouse.com, was a good bohemian base from which to explore the up-and-coming neighborhood of Palermo Viejo. My room with double bed didn't have a bath (a shared shower and toilet was next door) but was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was served at a long table in the dining room (croissants, coffee, juice, cereal). One night, with 21 percent tax and breakfast, was $25.
 Rooms at the recently opened Hotel Ibis, part of the French Accor chain, Hipolito Yrigoyen 1592, (54-11) 5300 5555, www.ibishotel.com, are small but intelligently designed, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The Ibis, downtown on the leafy Plaza Congreso, is a terrific deal at $25 a night. The price includes tax but not breakfast ($2).
 The Broadway All Suites, well situated in the theater district, Avenida Corrientes 1173, (54-11) 4378 9300, www.broadway-suites.com.ar, has more space (each of the modern-style beige-on-white rooms has a sitting room and kitchenette), and more style, at a higher price: $73 a night, with tax and buffet breakfast. 

Restaurants
 At Ristorante O, Thames 1626, (54-11) 4833 6991, the set lunches are an astonishing value at around $4 for three courses; dinner, with wine, is around $25 for one. 
 At La Vineria, Salta 490, (54-11) 4381 2920, in Montserrat, between San Telmo and Congreso, a typical neighborhood grill, or parrilla, a dinner of grilled lomo (tenderloin) and mejillones (sweetbreads) plus a bottle of malbec was $12 a person.
 At Chiquilin, Sarmiento 1599, (54-11) 4373 5163, in the downtown theater district off Corrientes, a well-known establishment that used to be the haunt of famous tango singers and composers, lunch for two, with a bottle of wine, was about $15. 
 Central, Costa Rica 5644, (54-11) 4776 7374, is another excellent place for a bargain set lunch; a three- course meal of mesclun salad, fresh pasta and dessert at this sleek, modern restaurant (at night it turns into a hip cocktail lounge) is $5.

Activities
 The Club del Vino in Palermo Viejo, Cabrera 4737, (54-11) 4833 0048, is a wine bar and performance space with jazz to tango revues to cabaret. Admission varies (the show I attended was $5.25); the schedule can be found in the ''Espectaculos'' sections of the daily Buenos Aires papers, La Nacion (www.lanacion.com.ar) and Clarin (www.clarin.com), which provide an excellent rundown of the theater and music scene.
 The Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires, Avenida Figueroa Alcorta 3415, (54-11) 4808 6500, www.malba.org.ar, is open from noon to 8 p.m. daily (9 p.m. Wednesday, when it is free); closed Tuesdays. Admission is about $1.75. 
 At Confiteria Ideal, Suipacha 384, a large, somewhat faded old Buenos Aires cafe, there are daily tango lessons and dances; the schedule is posted on a large sign just inside the cafe. DAISANN McLANE

 CORRECTION:
A listing of restaurants and lodgings with the Frugal Traveler column on June 20, about Buenos Aires, misstated the Spanish word for sweetbreads. It is ''mollejas'' (''mejillones'' means shrimp). 
A listing of restaurants and lodgings with the Frugal Traveler column on June 20, about Buenos Aires, misstated the Spanish word for sweetbreads. And a correction in this space on June 27 gave an incorrect translation for the word that had been used erroneously. Sweetbreads are mollejas. Mejillones, the word that appeared mistakenly, means mussels, not shrimp.

HEADLINE: A City Editorial Page

 BODY:
The New York Times will always be a New York City paper. But over the last decade, we've steadily gained circulation outside the metropolitan area and struggled to produce a paper for people in California and Florida and Maine while maintaining our local identity. 
The editorial board members and Op-Ed editors have never lost their passion for city issues, but we did yearn for more space in which to tackle them. As of today, we're going to be able to expand the opportunities for conversation, with new Sunday opinion pages in the City weekly section. The Long Island and Westchester weeklies will be getting new pages as well, with Connecticut and New Jersey to come later.
 Our editorial voice will, of course, remain the same in the new location. We remain generally optimistic about the plans for redeveloping Lower Manhattan, one step away from despair over the political culture in Albany. We still support school financing reform, the city's system of campaign finance, merit selection of judges and the leash laws for dogs in the park. We have nagged and cheered the city through financial crises, crime waves and terrorist attacks and we know how stupendously strong, resilient and worth protecting it is. We look forward to nagging and cheering it through the future, and we're pleased to have this additional space in which to do it.
 Letters and Op-Ed submissions from city people about city issues are invited, and there is a list of addresses on this page if you are ready to send one. Now that we're all here, let's start talking.

 The article by Mark Costello (''Throwing Away the Key'') and the questions for Sherron Watkins made me angry. 
 Yes, harsh sentences for corporate criminals will make me happy. The idea that jail terms for the Fastows will be staggered so their children can be properly cared for is appalling. Corporate offenders have done tremendous damage in California and elsewhere around the nation. Thousands of children are not receiving proper educations or medical care, and community services are being drastically cut because our states must dig out of a financial crisis growing out of corporate America's greed and disrespect for others. Yes, they should do some serious time.

HEADLINE: HOUSING PRICES UP

BYLINE: By Robert Strauss

 BODY:
Increases in housing prices slowed in New Jersey in the first quarter of 2004, but the general trend is still upward. According federal figures, prices of single-family homes in New Jersey rose on average only 0.63 percent in the first quarter. That slightly lagged the national rate of 0.96 percent for the quarter ending March 31. But it still put the annual rate of increase in the state at 10.93 percent, versus a national average of 7.71 percent. New Jersey was eighth among the states in housing-price increases.

WHY WE DO IT
Rethinking Sex and the Selfish Gene.
By Niles Eldredge.
269 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95.
 BIRDS do it. Sullen teenagers sneak around to do it. Even biologists think about doing it, though it puzzles them. The problem is that sex has its costs. If women reproduced by giving birth asexually, like aphids, to exact genetic duplicates, any beneficial mutations occurring in the mother would pass to all of her offspring. But in sexual reproduction, since newborns share but half the mother's genes, only half of her children would probably reap the genetic advantage. Sex seems a bad idea, evolutionarily speaking. It's a puzzle, then, why our ancestors -- those one-celled creatures thriving in ancient seas -- ever bothered to try it. 
 In ''Why We Do It,'' the eminent paleontologist Niles Eldredge, of the American Museum of Natural History, takes up the problem. His goal in this accessible book, however, is not so much to solve the puzzle as to discover the purpose of life, which for him is not sex. He takes his stand against scientists who adhere to the theory of the selfish gene and, more generally, the doctrines of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. They (prominently, Richard Dawkins and E. O. Wilson) maintain that most of life's activities are ultimately aimed at procuring a sex partner for the propagation of one's genes.
 Like Darwin, with whom he declares his allegiance, Eldredge pursues a quasi-teleological investigation of the main objective of life. In ''The Origin of Species,'' Darwin proposed that the struggle for existence, which involved much suffering and death, yielded the most exalted object we were capable of conceiving -- namely, ''the production of the higher animals.'' Eldredge, though, regards the purpose of life to be neither the generation of the higher animals nor the spread of one's genes; rather, it's economics. This may sound like an echo from the halls of the University of Chicago -- and Eldredge does slide in that direction. But he initially suggests a more comprehensive meaning for economics.
 He defines economics as energy transfer and flow throughout an ecological system. On African savannas elephants consume huge quantities of grasses, absorbing the energy to carry on their physiological processes, including the production of large piles of dung, which dung beetles reprocess into soil nutrients, which feed plants on which elephants graze. All organisms live in intersecting ecological systems through which energy flows and is transformed. Eldredge glides from this abstract notion to a somewhat more concrete meaning of economics when he declares that in Darwin's conception, the struggle for existence indicated the effort to secure energy resources -- food -- not the attempt to produce offspring. (Contemporary evolutionists frequently recruit Darwin to their side and, often as not, bend him into unlikely positions.) Eldredge does allow that with most animals, the effort to get food ultimately serves the aim of reproduction; but with human beings, he contends, sex has been shorn of its baby-making function. 
 He describes those mundane varieties of human sexuality that have scant reproductive outcome: masturbation, homosexuality, contraceptive coitus, pornography, rape, sex slavery and theme parks of the teenage imagination. He considers these now to be the predominant modes of human sexual activity. Moreover, we have evidence that economics controls sexual reproduction, not the reverse. The rich, demographers have shown, are different from the rest of us: they generally have fewer offspring. Such examples demonstrate, Eldredge believes, that our getting and spending lay waste to the sociobiological assumption that all human activities have the ultimate evolutionary goal of spreading successful genes to the next generation. For him sex is merely a fraction of the currency flow consolidating a community. 
 If sex no longer has the primary purpose of spreading successful genes and thus furthering evolution of the species, what is it good for? Eldredge says the real reason for sex is its function in producing stable species that are more resistant to extinction than colonies of simple, asexual organisms. His logic, never explicitly stated, seems to be that when the superficial procreative function of sex is conceptually demoted, the real significance of sex will be revealed. He sees bonobo chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, as illustrating its stabilizing and unifying power. Their rampant sexual gymnastics, with both the same and different sexes, and with astounding frequency, do seem to effect social bonding throughout a local community. Yet comparable behavior in human communities, as many utopian experiments testify, would quite likely have the opposite result: disintegration.
 Also, Eldredge offers no evidence that sexual species are more resistant to extinction than bacteria -- after all, blue-green algae have been around since the beginning. Even if sexual behavior has become partly decoupled from its procreative function -- though only in human societies -- this development alone hardly supplies a reason to believe it has deeper, species-unifying features. 
 THE hidden lever by which Eldredge attempts to lift his argument to plausibility is the highly controverted notion of species selection, which is natural selection applied at the species level. For this argument to work, a species must itself have the character of an individual, as opposed to that of a mere collection of individuals. And the trait selected -- sexuality -- would have to benefit that individual (in this case a species) in competition with other individual species lacking the trait. But do sexual species compete with bacteria for resources or to produce more daughter species? Only the speculative imagination might hazard an answer to this question, and Eldredge doesn't even try. And while the frenzied flow of energy coursing through New York clubs might suggest otherwise, neither our species nor any other sexual species seems to possess the structure of a coherently unified individual, so that selection could act upon it. A more vigorous and explicit metaphysics would be needed to make the idea of species as unit of selection spring to life. 
 Contemporary science has cast aside many veils from the sexual dance, but a few yet remain to sustain the mystery.

BUTCHER, CHARLES

 BODY:
 BUTCHER -- Charles. Busi nessman and philanthropist known for his generosity and passion for knowledge and justice, died at his home on June 12, 2004 after a long illness. At the time of his death, he lived in Boulder, CO, and maintained a family home in Maine. Charles Butcher was born in 1916 in Cambridge, MA, and attended Harvard University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical Economics. He was a conscientious objector during World War II and, as a consequence, received what he called his ''postgraduate education'' in federal prison and work camps. He continued to live his values for the rest of his life. In 1951, after several years in the printing business, Charles Butcher joined the Butcher Company, a familyowned floor care products company in Massachusetts. He became CEO shortly thereafter. Over the next five decades, he developed the Butcher Company from a small regional firm into a large, successful, socially responsible company with international reach, 100 times its original size. A pioneer in thinking about socially responsible business practices, he was invited to lecture at business schools and consult with business leaders. When he sold the Butcher Company, then headquartered in Marlborough, MA, to Johnson Wax Professional in 2000, Charles Butcher and his wife, distributed $18 million of the sale proceeds to the company's 325 employees. He published a book, How to Succeed in Business by Giving Away Millions. A lifelong fascination with science led Charles Butcher, in 1965, to found the Lazy Eight, a network of scientists interested in cross - disciplinary ap proaches to technical problem-solving, education and issues of poverty. 
In 1973 he began working with Dr. Larry Gold in the lab of the Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology Department of the University of Colorado. In 1986, he was chairman of the board of Clonetics, a biotech start-up that gained international recognition for its genetic research; in 1991 he joined the board of NeXagen, a biomedical company. With Dr. Gold, he designed the Discovery Exchange to promote cooperation between academic scientists and business. In addition to his direction of the Butcher Company, his work with high-tech and biotech startups, and his own scientific research, Charles Butcher spent decades as an active and creative philanthropist. He dedicated his giving to encouraging and promoting civil liberties, -big-picturescientific thinking and creative cross-disciplinary research. In 2002, in recognition of his longstanding, continuous support for civil liberties and his leadership as a board member, the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado presented Charles Butcher its 50th Anniversary Champion of Liberty Award. Charles Butcher, with his wife, in 2002, contributed $1.1 million to the University of Colorado to fund the launch of the Colorado Initiative in Molecular Biotechnology, which is using a multidisciplinary approach to unlock genomics secrets to improve the quality of life and health for all people. An energetic entrepreneur, a master sailor, and a generous friend and mentor, Charles Butcher was the father of eight children. His wife, the former Jane Weinberg, is a founder of the Women of the West Museum, the Co-Chair of the University of Colorado Conference on World Affairs and Co-Chair of Mother Jones magazine. Charles Butcher is survived by his wife, Jane, his children Catherine Butcher and husband Ben Pfohl, Susan Butcher and husband David Monson, Kimiko Butcher and husband Neil Grundy, Benjamin Butcher, Claudine Butcher and husband Michael Hannigan, Gina Lasky and husband David Lasky, and Andrew Butcher and grandchildren Ethan Pfohl, Naomi Pfohl, Tekla Monson, Chisana Monson, Charles Grundy and Rachel Grundy. His son, Charles Evan Butcher, predeceased him. Donations in memory of Charles Butcher may be sent to the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, 400 Corona Street, Denver, CO 80218; the Colorado Initiative in Molecular Biotechnology, C/O the CU Foundation, 4740 Walnut Street, Boulder, CO 80306; Hospice Care of Boulder and Broomfield Counties, 2594 Trailridge Drive E., Ste A, Lafayette, CO 80026; or Hemlock Foundation, PO Box 101801, Denver, CO 80246. A private memorial service was held in Boulder June 19.

HEADLINE: Would More Drilling in America Make a Difference?

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE

 BODY:
WHENEVER gasoline prices rise high enough in the United States, pressure builds to reduce the country's dependence on imported oil.
 The administration says that the way to achieve this is by allowing drilling on off-limits lands. Last month, President Bush, speaking of Republican legislation to open more federal lands to oil drilling, said, ''These measures have been repeatedly blocked by members of the Senate -- and American consumers are paying the price.''
 Most environmentalists say that opening more land won't work, and that the environmental destruction would be too great. 
 Industry analysts take a third view, arguing that lifting drilling prohibitions on federal lands might help, but not right away and ultimately not very much. Their reasoning is simple. The United States sits atop just 3 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, but burns one quarter of global production. Sixty percent of what it uses daily is imported. 
 The countries of the Persian Gulf, on the other hand, have nearly two-thirds of the proven reserves. 
 Given these facts, and absent a major conservation campaign or a breakthrough in alternative fuels, the country can't sharply reduce its oil dependence. 
 ''If you opened everything up, we would have a hump for awhile in domestic production and then decline pretty quickly, because American oil companies are focused on the quickest possible extraction of oil,'' said Jamal Qureshi, oil markets analyst with PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. ''It's an important increase but it delays the inevitable.''
 The government regularly auctions leases to companies to develop oil and gas on federal lands. Large swaths are off limits, though: the waters off much of the East and West coasts, including California; most of eastern Gulf of Mexico near Florida, and large tracts in the Rocky Mountains and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
 Because many of these areas have largely been spared exploratory drilling, it is hard to know exactly how much oil and gas they hold. The Minerals Management Service, which oversees offshore properties, estimated in 2000 that ''the mean undiscovered technically recoverable'' oil reserves in the Atlantic were about 2.4 billion barrels and 10.71 billion barrels in the Pacific. The Bureau of Land Management said that in five major oil and gas basins in the Rockies, about 15 percent of oil resources, or about 596 million barrels, were off limits. 
 But Robert W. Esser, director of global oil and gas resources at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, whose clients include major oil companies, says his firm's research shows these fields mostly contain natural gas. And if the prohibited areas were developed, Mr. Esser said, gas would not flow until after 2010. 
 ''We'd like to say, 'We can do this if we have a shortage and we can do that,''' Mr. Esser said. ''But it has to be understood that the response will take a long time.'' 
 Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, said that developing new areas would help reduce American oil dependence, slightly -- and perhaps lower prices. He pointed out that in 1995, Congress passed a measure opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, which President Bill Clinton vetoed. Mr. Goldstein said that had the bill become law, the refuge might be producing 800,000 barrels a day now. 
 That would deflate some of the ''risk premium'' that has buoyed oil prices, Mr. Goldstein said. That premium arises from the fear among oil traders that rising global demand has stretched oil production too thin. 
 Environmentalists argue, however, that oil from the refuge would barely affect the nation's dependence on Middle Eastern oil, while the process of extracting it would destroy an irreplaceable wilderness. 
 If another several hundred thousand barrels of oil were in the market now, Mr. Goldstein said, traders would see a bigger cushion against possible disruptions -- like sabotage against pipelines in Iraq. 
 Yet even if President Clinton had signed the bill, lawsuits by local native groups and environmentalists might have forestalled development, cautioned Shirley Neff, a former economist with the Senate Energy Committee -- then Democratic controlled. In fact, some major oil companies have said that the Refuge holds little appeal because of possible litigation. 
 Finally, Ms. Neff said, government data suggests that oil companies have developed only 22 percent of the federal leases they hold. So just because an area is open to drilling doesn't mean it will be developed.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, It's Hip To Conserve Energy

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
GAS prices finally headed down last week, and may have peaked for the year, the Energy Department reported. This is good news for drivers and businesses. But the pattern over the last 30 years suggests that this is bad news for anyone who believes that Americans, the world's biggest oil consumers, can ever curb their energy consumption.
 For all the scolding about America's energy gluttony, and for all the warnings about foreign entanglements linked to oil addiction, price seems to be the only factor that moves people to change habits. 
 Consider the Toyota Prius, whose gas-electric hybrid engine gets upward of 60 miles a gallon. Only after gas prices rose to 21-year highs earlier this year did its sales surge, up 100 percent this year over last. 
 The Prius is hip, for the moment. But, then, so was the Ford Escort and even the lowly Yugo, a pair of gas-efficient cars that had their brief shots at fame when the Persian Gulf tumult more than two decades ago drove up prices. 
 In the long term, the record shows that Americans will not give up their big cars. And polls show that a majority of Americans say they will use less energy only if it is easy to do so. That is, we will use less energy only if there is a nearly painless way to do it.
 Even if Americans could curb demand, there are plenty of people who think energy efficiency by itself will not curb the need for huge new production. The Bush administration says that even with conservation, a new power plant will have to be built every week to meet an estimated 29 percent rise in demand by 2020.
 But critics of the administration argue that conservation should be given a chance, either with carrots or sticks. And an emerging school of thought sees technology, coupled with price incentives, as a way for energy conservation to break the old mold of ever-increasing demand. 
 ''Fortunately for us, technology can solve a lot of these problems,'' said Kateri Callahan, director of the Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit group of government and industry officials. 
 The conservation side points to the example of the 1987 law signed by President Ronald Reagan forcing manufacturers to make energy-efficient appliances. 
 As a result, household energy use has fallen because of power-efficient appliances and technology-smart homes prodded along by tight new building codes. The average refrigerator uses a third less power than it did 15 years ago. 
 The fact that most air conditioners, refrigerators, ovens and water heaters do the same job with less power is one big reason why per capita energy use has remained about the same over the last 20 years, according to the Energy Department, while overall use has risen with a swelling population and less-gas-efficient vehicles. 
 ''Americans will always follow the money,'' said Susan Kennedy, a California public utilities commissioner who helped fashion a conservation program that has made her state the nation's most energy-efficient. ''Incentives have to be there.''
 Today, owners of hybrids receive a federal tax break, a $1,500 deduction this year. And hybrids are popular in Virginia partly because they are allowed in the car-pool lane even if the driver is alone in the vehicle. 
 But hybrid sales are still a fraction of all car sales, and Americans still use 10 times more gasoline per capita than the world average, according to the World Resources Institute. Even in wide-open Australia, people use 45 percent less gas than Americans. 
 Conservation groups want the government to do more. Current federal requirements have broad loopholes for trucks and S.U.V.'s, and for cars that burn a small percentage of ethanol, even if they run on gasoline all the time. 
 The big automakers have fought higher fuel-economy standards. They argue that consumers don't want to drive lighter, smaller cars, and that any new standards would slow a powerful sector of the economy. 
 Rising gas prices are supposed to help curb energy consumption. As soon as gas reaches something like $3 a gallon in the United States, hybrids will move beyond the asterisk phase, people in the car industry say. 
 Even at $2.50 a gallon, gas is cheap by historical standards. Paul Taylor, the chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association, said a 50-cent-a-gallon increase is still only a $300-a-year hit on the average driver -- not enough to prompt a divorce from the gas guzzler. 
 William C. Ford Jr., the president of Ford, has said that higher gas taxes are needed to change consumer choices substantially. But few politicians want to lead the way. Senator John Kerry is paying the price for even considering higher gas taxes years ago; a Bush campaign ad lashed him for what it called this ''wacky idea.''
 Americans have cut energy use during times of crisis. After the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, petroleum consumption in the United States dropped substantially. And in the summer of 2001, Californians, facing months of blackouts, slashed their energy demand. They were rewarded: by reducing the use of power by 20 percent, consumers could get a 20 percent break on their utility bills. 
 Since then, even with the incentive no longer in place and a fast-growing population, California has significantly modified the way it uses power, cutting consumption by 10 percent or more over the last three years.
 ''We may be the most energy-efficient place in the world now,'' Ms. Kennedy said. ''The key was getting people to make permanent changes. Instead of just turning off the lights, we needed them to change the kind of light bulb they used.''
 But if history is a guide, that won't last long. After the energy crises ebbed in the 70's, consumption gradually rose and took off in the 90's. 
 In his new book, ''The End of Oil,'' Paul Roberts says conservation in the 1970's and 80's, by driving down energy prices, had the unintended effect of taking away incentives to use less.
 ''Paradoxically, conservation's great success was also its downfall,'' Mr. Roberts wrote. ''As oil prices fell to $10 a barrel, few Western consumers saw any reason to continue conserving.''
 Maybe being hip will help the cause of conservation, which has had an image problem ever since Jimmy Carter put on a sweater and urged people to turn down the heat. 
 The Republican Party's rising star, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, is urging drivers and home owners to use less energy, in ways big and small. He has tied energy conservation to body-building, with a program called ''Flex Your Power at the Pump,'' and wants to see hydrogen stations at regular intervals along California's freeways.
 Of course, Mr. Schwarzenegger still owns three Hummers, which average about 12 miles to the gallon. But he has put one of them in storage and is converting another to hydrogen fuel cell power.
 Still, it's hard to imagine him driving a Prius.

HEADLINE: Democrats Say Stronghold, G.O.P. Says Swing State

BYLINE: By David Kocieniewski. 
David Kocieniewski is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
AS the battle for the White House has raged across the country this spring, New Jersey has been relegated to the unfortunate role of automated teller machine: a place candidates visit when they need money.
 The state's June primary date came three months after Senator John Kerry had locked up the Democratic nomination, and President Bush faced no Republican opposition. So, it wasn't until Mr. Kerry addressed the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Atlantic City last week that the public jousting for New Jersey's 15 electoral votes began in earnest. 
 Sounding a traditional Democratic appeal, Mr. Kerry blasted Mr. Bush's economic policies, saying that they slighted the middle class. The Bush campaign responded with a page from Ronald Reagan's playbook by branding Mr. Kerry as an apostle of pessimism whose only hope is to convince voters that the economic recovery is a mirage.
 Behind all the charges and countercharges, spin and counterspin, Republicans also raised the tantalizing possibility that New Jersey, which most analysts consider a dependably Democratic stronghold, might be one of the swing states that will remain at the center of the political battle until Election Day.
 Although Democrats have won every statewide race since Christie Whitman's re-election in 1997 and now control the governor's office and the Legislature, a handful of recent polls have given Republicans hope. In early May, the Star-Ledger Eagleton-Rutgers poll found Mr. Kerry with a surprisingly slim lead of 6 percentage points over Mr. Bush; and late last month, a Quinnipiac University poll found that the gap had narrowed to just 3 percentage points.
 Republican leaders said those polls, which were taken even as the president was being pounded by bad news from Iraq and the torture scandal at the Abu Ghraib prison, were evidence that Mr. Bush's message had connected in New Jersey. 
 Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., the state Republican chairman, said that in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Bush's assertive leadership in the war against terror had created a strong bond with New Jersey residents. 
 Ed Gillespie, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said that the state's economic resurgence in the last several months, which produced 9,100 jobs in April alone, was a result of Mr. Bush's tax cuts and that voters were giving him credit for the improvements.
 ''There will be a lot of Democrats for Bush in New Jersey,'' said Mr. Gillespie, a native of Browns Mills.
 Speaking after Mr. Kerry's speech, Mr. Gillespie predictably sidestepped a question about how much money he intended to devote to the state, saying that he didn't want to divulge tactical information. But he pointed out that many homes in south and central New Jersey will already be inundated with Mr. Bush's ads because they receive Philadelphia television stations, where Republicans have been has been advertising furiously to sway voters in the unquestionably pivotal state of Pennsylvania.
 Despite that bit of saber-rattling, there are plenty of signs that Republicans' threats to seriously contest New Jersey are nothing more than a strategic head fake; both sides are trying to the dictate the electoral playing field and snooker their opponents into squandering precious resources. The Kerry campaign has been making noise about pouring money into Colorado, which is reliably Republican, a move about as likely as Ralph Nader tapping Donald Rumsfeld as his running mate.
 To truly succeed in New Jersey, Mr. Bush would have to defy a quarter-century trend toward the Democrats. Ruy Teixeira, co-author of ''The Emerging Democratic Majority,'' said New Jersey was a prime example of three demographic shifts that favor Democrats: an increasing population of immigrants and minorities, a growing class of professionals, and a concentration of jobs in research and information technology.
 ''All of those groups have been becoming reliably Democratic, and in New Jersey they have replaced the manufacturing workers who at one point were Reagan Democrats,'' said Mr. Teixeira.
 Even the handful of Republicans who have won statewide races since 1980 have been far more moderate than Mr. Bush on issues like the environment, abortion and gay rights.
 With the exception of Ronald Reagan's victories in 1980 and 1984, both of which came in landslides, the Republicans who have triumphed in New Jersey have been from the moderate wing of the party -- George H.W. Bush in 1988, Mrs. Whitman in 1993 and 1997, and former Gov. Thomas H. Kean in 1981 and 1985.
 But the most ominous sign for Mr. Bush are the rumblings from some of the same people who last month provided his campaign a glimmer of hope: pollsters.
 The Quinnipiac poll that showed the presidential contenders in a statistical dead heat also found that many voters said they did not have enough information to form an opinion of Mr. Kerry, according to Clay F. Richards, the poll director. Since then, his message has begun to penetrate, Mr. Richards said, and subsequent polling has found New Jersey voters more familiar with -- and favorable toward -- Mr. Kerry.
 ''In the world of polling, a month can make results ancient history,'' he said. ''And we're already seeing a very recognizable shift.''
 There are still plenty more polls before Election Day. But barring a seismic realignment, it is likely that New Jersey will retain its title as the A.T.M. state, where the campaign trail runs through an endless series of banquet halls and fund raisers.

HEADLINE: What the Bush Administration Said

 BODY:
Critics of the Bush administration argue that it falsely created a link between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 attacks to help justify the war. Last week, the administration countered that it had never made such an assertion -- only that there were ties, however murky, between Iraq and Al Qaeda. A survey of past public comments seems to bear that out -- although whether there was a deliberate campaign to create guilt by association is difficult to say.

CONDOLEEZZA RICE

''Now the Al Qaeda is an organization that's quite dispersed and --and quite widespread in its effects, but it clearly has had links to the Iraqis, not to mention Iraqi links to all kinds of other terrorists. And what we do not want is the day when Saddam Hussein decides that he's had enough of dealing with sanctions and it's time to end it on his terms, by transferring one of these weapons, just a little vial of something, to a terrorist.''

Interview on ''Face the Nation,'' Mar. 9, 2003

Q: Do you believe, because this is continually a subject of debate, that there was a link between al Qaeda and the regime of Saddam Hussein before the war?

MS. RICE: Absolutely. And Zarqawi made the coming back to his old stomping ground. But we know that there was training of Al Qaeda in chemical and perhaps biological warfare. We know that the Zarqawi network was out of there, this poisons network that was trying to spread poisons throughout --

Q: You're talking about the Ansar al-Islam base in northern --

MS. RICE: Yes. And there was Ansar al-Islam, which appears also to try to be operating in Iraq. So yes, the Al Qaeda link was there. And maybe they're trying to reestablish it.''

Interview on ''Fox News'' Sunday, Sept. 7, 2003

''Saddam Hussein --no one has said that there is evidence that Saddam Hussein directed or controlled 9/11, but let's be very clear, he had ties to Al Qaeda.''

Interview on ''Meet the Press,'' Sept. 28, 2003

DONALD H. RUMSFELD

''There is no question but that there have been interactions between the Iraqi government, Iraqi officials and Al Qaeda operatives. They have occurred over a span of some 8 or 10 years to our knowledge. There are currently Al Qaeda in Iraq.''

Interview with Infinity CBS Radio, Nov. 14, 2002

''The regime plays host to terrorists, including Al Qaeda, as the president indicated.''

Defense Department briefing, Jan. 29, 2003

Q: Mr. Secretary, today in a broadcast interview Saddam Hussein said, ''There is only one truth, Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction whatsoever.'' And he went on to say, ''I would like to tell you directly we have no relationship with Al Qaeda.''

MR. RUMSFELD: And Abraham Lincoln was short.

Defense Department Briefing, Feb. 4, 2003

''We said from the outset that there are several terrorist networks that have global reach and that there were several countries that were harboring terrorists that have global reach. We weren't going into Iraq when we were hit on September 11. And the question is: Well, what do you do about that? If you know there are terrorists and you know there's terrorist states --Iraq's been a terrorist state for decades --and you know there are countries harboring terrorists, we believe, correctly, I think, that the only way to deal with it is --you can't just hunker down and hope they won't hit you again. You simply have to take the battle to them.''

Interview on ''Meet the Press,'' Nov. 2, 2003

COLIN L. POWELL

Q: You referred in your speech to the links between Al Qaeda and Iraq. Now, even some of our secret service chiefs say publicly there is no evidence of that.

MR. POWELL: We do have evidence of it. We are not suggesting that there is a 9/11 link, but we are suggesting --we do have evidence --of connections over the years between Iraq and Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations.''

Interview with European editors, Jan 26, 2003

''The more we wait, the more chance there is for this dictator with clear ties to terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda, to pass a weapon, share a technology or use these weapons again.''

Remarks at the World Economic Forum, Jan. 26, 2003

''We do have information that suggests that there have been links over the years, and continue to be links, between the Iraqi government and Al Qaeda. And the more we look at this the more we are able to look back in time and connect things with people who have come into our custody and other information has become available to us. It's clear that there is a link.''

Interview with ITN Television of Britain, Jan. 29, 2003

''But what I want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between Iraq and the Al Qaeda terrorist network, a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder.''

Remarks made before the United Nations Security Council, Feb. 5, 2003

DICK CHENEY

QUESTION REGARDING 9/11: Do we have any evidence linking Saddam Hussein or Iraqis to this operation?

MR. CHENEY: No.

Interview on ''Meet the Press,'' Sept. 16, 2001

MR. CHENEY: I want to separate out 9/11 from the other relationships between Iraq and the Al Qaeda organization. But there is a pattern of relationships going back many years.''

Q: But no direct link?

MR. CHENEY: I can't --I'll leave it right where it's at. I've tried to be cautious and restrained in my comments.''

Interview on ''Meet the Press,'' Sept. 8, 2002

''[Saddam's] regime has had high-level contacts with Al Qaeda going back a decade.''

Remarks at the Air National Guard Senior Leadership Conference, Dec. 2, 2002

''If we're successful in Iraq we will have struck a major blow right at the heart of the base, if you will, the geographic base of the terrorists who have had us under assault now for many years, but most especially on 9/11.''

Interview on ''Meet the Press,'' Sept. 14, 2003

''On the 9/11 question, we've never had confirmation one way or another. We did have reporting that was public, that came out shortly after the 9/11 attack, provided by the Czech government. We've never been able to collect any more information on that.''

Interview with The Rocky Mountain News, Jan. 9, 2004

''I continue to believe, I think there's overwhelming evidence that there was a connection between Al Qaeda and the Iraqi government.''

National Public Radio interview, Jan. 22, 2004

''We know that Iraq and Al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some Al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq.''

Remarks on Iraq made in Cincinnati, Oct. 7, 2002

''[Saddam Hussein] is a threat because he is dealing with Al Qaeda.''

Washington press conference, Nov. 7, 2002

HEADLINE: A Fight Against Fear As Well as Inflation

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
BACK in 1979, when he was battling the scourge of double-digit inflation, Paul A. Volcker often remarked that part of his job was psychological.
 ''Inflation feeds in part on itself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and productive economy must be to break the grip of inflationary expectations,'' said Mr. Volcker, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987. He ultimately did slay the dragon, but only after administering some of the harshest economic medicine -- interest rates as high as 18 percent -- that Americans have ever seen. 
 Now, as the central bank gears up to raise interest rates from their lowest levels in decades, the Federal Reserve is again wrestling with inflation expectations. 
 Alan Greenspan, who was confirmed by the Senate last week for a fifth term as Fed chairman, has gone out of his way to project a dual message.
 On the one hand, Mr. Greenspan and other top officials continue to say that inflationary pressures are ''not likely to be a serious concern.'' But they have also gone out of their way to caution that they may be wrong. And if they are, they have promised, the Fed will relinquish its plan to raise rates at a ''measured'' pace and move more aggressively to cool down the economy.
 So which is it? Is the central bank still confident that inflation poses no threat? Or is it acknowledging that there may be a problem after all?
 Part of the answer has to do with an important distinction between inflation in its own right and inflation expectations. 
 Assuming that Mr. Greenspan and other senior officials believe what they say, the Fed still seems to view recent jumps in the prices of gasoline, food and clothing as transitory jolts, rather than part of a longer-term trend. They contend that labor costs, which account for about two-thirds of production costs, are still rising slowly because the number of unemployed workers remains fairly high. And even if the recent surge in new jobs leads to higher wages, which is likely, Fed officials contend that companies can absorb those costs because their profit margins have been unusually high.
 But many bond investors are less sanguine. Though it is an imperfect measure of inflation expectations, the premium that investors have been willing to pay for 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, has been hovering at about 2.5 percentage points over other Treasury securities. Many analysts predict that inflation will reach 3 percent over the next year. 
 Consumers, rattled by higher prices for gasoline, food and clothing, have also ratcheted up their expectations. The University of Michigan's survey of consumer confidence in April showed that respondents expect prices to rise 3 percent over the next year. Last year, they expected prices to rise only 2.3 percent.
 Fed officials are acutely aware that inflation expectations can themselves contribute to inflation. If people expect car prices to rise sharply over the next year, they will be more inclined to buy earlier, in order to get a cheaper car. But the rush to buy can itself push up prices, which, in turn, feeds inflation anxieties.
 ''A rise in inflation expectations tends to become self-fulfilling as people seek to protect themselves in the process of setting wages and prices,'' said Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor, in a speech two weeks ago. 
 Consumers have been exposed to a series of price shocks. Gasoline prices, though they have softened in recent days, have soared for much of this year. Clothing prices have climbed and discounting has diminished sharply in many parts of the country. Health care insurance premiums are climbing at double-digit rates, and college tuition costs are rising rapidly.
 Andrew Tilton, an economist at Goldman Sachs, noted that perceptions of inflation could be distorted by the mix of prices that are rising or falling at any particular time. Prices for used cars have fallen sharply since 2001. But because most people buy cars only once every few years, they may notice that decline much less than the rising price for the gasoline they buy every few days. 
 Mr. Tilton, picking apart the Consumer Price Index for May, found that prices for frequent purchases like food and clothing climbed at a torrid annual pace of 11.3 percent in May. By contrast, the overall index climbed at a somewhat slower annual rate of 8 percent and the core measure, excluding energy and food, climbed only 2.5 percent.
 Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor and now a senior adviser to Schwab Soundview Capital Markets, said that while the Fed had little direct influence over consumer expectations, it was trying to persuade financial markets that long-term interest rates did not have to rise sharply.
 ''What's at issue here is whether or not the Fed is right,'' Mr. Gramley said. ''One can make a plausible case that inflationary pressures are not a concern, but it's awfully hard to make a compelling case.''
 ULTIMATELY, the Fed's loudest signal is interest rates. Adjusted for inflation, the ''real'' federal funds rate on overnight loans of bank reserves has been below zero for much of the past year. In the context of historical norms, that is the equivalent of begging consumers to borrow money and bid up prices.
 For months now, Mr. Greenspan has been slowly changing that tune. But Fed officials are keenly aware that inflation expectations depend heavily on confidence in the Fed as a guardian of price stability. And if that confidence is to remain strong, they may be forced to move at more than a ''measured pace.''

HEADLINE: The Re-Baathification of Falluja

BYLINE: By Jeffrey Gettleman. 
Jeffrey Gettleman is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
It was payday for the Falluja Brigade, a dusty, flat, 100-degree day in late May, and hundreds of the brigade's soldiers were gathering at the city's railway station on the north end of town. A month before, during the siege of Falluja by 4,500 United States marines, this same railway station was attacked by American helicopters after insurgents inside the station fired rocket-propelled grenades at Marine snipers nearby. But now things were very different. On May 1, as Falluja and the world braced for an all-out assault by the marines, the siege was suddenly called off. The marines announced they were pulling out and ceding control of the city to a new, all-Iraqi force. The man who engineered the deal was Muhammad Latif, a 66-year-old former Iraqi Army colonel from Baghdad. Latif promised the Americans that he could pacify Falluja with a corps of laid-off soldiers from Saddam Hussein's army. Some would be former members of the Republican Guard, the elite force responsible for the regime's darkest hours, and some would be drawn from the insurgents the Americans had been fighting -- a very different situation indeed. 
 Now the 2,600 members of the Falluja Brigade were packed into the railway station to collect their monthly salaries. Three Iraqi officers with big, Saddam-style mustaches and constellations of stars on their shoulders sat along one side of a table in a stuffy little office in the back of the station, counting out stacks of cash: $150 for sergeants, $250 for majors, $300 for colonels; all in crisp U.S. bills, all provided by the U.S. government. The line of soldiers waiting for their pay snaked out the door, through the railway station and into the heat. Many were dressed in faded combat fatigues with a jaunty eagle insignia on their shoulders, signifying high rank in Hussein's army; some had red triangles just below their shoulders, the mark of the Republican Guard. In just a few weeks, Falluja had gone from de-Baathification to re-Baathification. The problem, it seemed, had become the solution.
 Latif trotted up the steps of the railway station wearing a gray polyester suit. Unlike his men, he never wears a uniform. He had an assistant with him, also dressed in civilian clothes. Neither man was armed.
 ''General,'' said one soldier standing by the door, using the Arabic word, liwa. He cut a quick salute. 
 ''How's your health, general?'' asked another as Latif stepped inside. (Latif later confided: ''They always say 'general.' But I'm not a general. Colonel, maybe, but not a general.'')
 Latif strode past the soldiers pressed against the walls. There was barely room to pass. ''General, general, general, general,'' they said, a one-word echo chamber as he advanced down the musky hallway. When he walked into the pay room, which used to be the conductor's office, the men with the big mustaches barely looked up. Latif didn't say a word to them. They, in turn, said nothing back -- not ''sir,'' not ''general.''
 Two U.S. Marine officers were standing in the pay room, off to the side. They were advisers, here to report back to Lt. Gen. James T. Conway, the top Marine general in Iraq, on the progress of the Falluja Brigade. One carried an assault rifle, the other wore a pistol in a holster and both were dressed in full battle gear. Across the room, the Iraqi soldiers approached the table one by one, leaned over to sign a form, took their money and signed again. Both marines looked impressed by the drill.
 ''Man, these guys are organized,'' said Lt. Col. Scott Hartsell. ''They have a disbursement officer; they have a payroll; they have proper records.'' He smiled. ''Hell, they were a professional army after all.''
 The Marine officers motioned to Latif, and the three men stepped aside for a private chat. My interpreter, Khalid, and I found ourselves suddenly alone. The officers behind the table noticed me and glared in my direction. Khalid started to get a little twitchy. ''It's like a joint chiefs meeting of the Republican Guard,'' he whispered to me. ''These guys are bad guys. They hate Americans. Let's get out of here.''
 It seemed like a good time to ask Latif if we could see more of the brigade's operation. He agreed, and he led us out of the train station and back to his white truck, which was parked next to a Falluja Brigade checkpoint -- if you could call it that. Three soldiers lounged under a tree with their new Bulgarian-made Kalashnikovs, chewing kebabs wrapped in grease-soaked bread and lazily watching traffic go by.
 Falluja, a city of 300,000, sits on a desert shelf alongside the Euphrates River, 35 miles west of Baghdad. It is laid out in a grid: thousands of flat-roofed homes, one after another, all built from the same crumbly, monochromatic brick, the color of the earth and the dust and the sky here when it's windy. The Iraqis call Falluja the City of Mosques, and from a distance all you can see are dozens of minarets poking the sky like tiny needles. It is a traditional place, where many restaurants have their own prayer rooms or mini-mosques tucked away in the back. Some women here wear deep blue traditional tribal tattoos on their faces. The city has no nightclubs, no bars, no movie theaters. During the reign of Saddam Hussein, Falluja was home to many high-ranking army and Republican Guard officers. But it was always a difficult place to rule, even for Hussein, a volatile mix of rival sheiks and imams and military men, controlled by half a dozen powerful families, including the Zoba, the Halabsa, the Jumaila, the Muhammada, the Albu Esa and the Albu Hatim.
 The Americans have had an even harder time taming the city. Falluja lies at the heart of the so-called Sunni Triangle, where opposition to the occupation has been the fiercest. During the U.S.-led invasion last year, Falluja put up virtually no resistance. But on April 28, 2003, a demonstration to mark Hussein's birthday turned unruly, and U.S. soldiers opened fire, killing 15 people. The city was soon a hotbed of rebellion, with frequent mortar, car-bomb and rocket-propelled-grenade attacks on American convoys and American helicopters -- and many U.S. casualties. When soldiers rolled through town and tossed candy out the windows of their Humvees, the children of Falluja threw it back. They said it was poison.
 For the first 11 months of the occupation, it was the U.S. Army that had authority over Falluja, but after a number of deadly incidents, the Army adopted a they-don't-like-us-we-don't-like-them approach and pulled back to their big, walled base four miles beyond the city limits. From there, troops staged the occasional raid for weapons caches and high-ranking Baathists, but for almost a year American forces mostly stayed out of the city. Then on March 24, the Marines took over control of the region from the Army and pledged a new era of cooperation with the people of Falluja. They had big ideas: living in town, running joint patrols with Iraqi soldiers and the police, doling out millions of dollars in reconstruction contracts to a grateful city. ''Our plan,'' said Maj. T.V. Johnson, a Marine spokesman, ''was to knock on doors, not knock down doors.'' 
 But that never happened. On March 31, four American contractors from Blackwater USA, a North Carolina security company, were ambushed and killed as their convoy drove through Falluja, and a mob dragged their bodies through the streets and hanged some of them from a bridge over the Euphrates. The new era was over before it began. On April 5, two battalions of marines stormed the city looking for the men responsible for the contractors' deaths. Hundreds of insurgents from across Iraq, both Sunni and Shiite, streamed into Falluja to fight the Americans, sneaking into the city by field paths, on donkey carts and in boats rowed along the Euphrates. Falluja was quickly shaping up into the biggest battle of the war -- the insurgents' ''Super Bowl,'' as Johnson put it.
 But now the Americans are gone, and the city is quiet -- maybe not peaceful, but quiet. Stores are open, and restaurants are full. Latif's Falluja Brigade, along with the police and civil defense corps, is providing at least a veneer of order and control, but it is hard to know how far the authority of the brigade goes. Masked insurgents still operate openly in parts of the city, even enforcing their own harsh brand of Islamic law. The brigade itself has been attacked by insurgents, and Latif is essentially a commuter general, spending his days driving up and down the desolate stretch between Falluja and Baghdad, making phone calls, holding meetings, searching for more officers, more uniforms and more guns and planning for the eventual integration of his men into the new national army -- although no one knows exactly when that will be or what it might look like in a tinderbox like Falluja.
 how did muhammad latif wind up responsible for a situation that the most powerful military on the planet couldn't resolve? On April 20, Latif told me, he was working in his garden in the Adamiya neighborhood of Baghdad, tending to his young banana tree. That afternoon, Donald Rumsfeld came on TV, and from the garden Latif could hear him talking about Falluja. Latif went inside to watch. There was a shaky cease-fire in Falluja at the time, and the Marines were trying to negotiate a truce with the mayor and some tribal sheiks, but the talks were breaking down. ''The difficulty with these discussions,'' Rumsfeld said, ''is that the people who are causing the trouble aren't part of the discussion.''
 Latif was worried. He sensed that Falluja was going to get hit very hard. We were talking -- he and I and an interpreter -- in his living room in early June, and in between puffs on a cigarette and sips of Diet Pepsi, he explained what he had been thinking as he watched Rumsfeld. ''It would be worse than anything we had seen,'' he said. ''I knew how the Americans were looking at it militarily. They had run out of options.''
 Latif is a spry man with a tan, lined face and the kind of richly sloped nose Leonardo loved to paint. He was once one of the most promising Iraqi officers of his generation, winning a coveted spot studying abroad at a war college in England. He knew something about counterinsurgency too. Latif distinguished himself as a young special-forces officer in the 1960's in Kurdistan, leading hit-and-run attacks against Iranian guerrillas along the border. 
 After Hussein took power in July 1979, Latif fell out of favor. The two men, both rising stars on the Baghdad political scene, had met before Hussein's ascension, and they had argued many times, Latif told me, over torture, over the Shiite-Sunni divide, over how best to fight the communists. Two weeks after Hussein became president, Latif was arrested and jailed as part of a group of 30 officers and civilians accused of trying to plot a coup. Hussein's henchmen snapped both of his arms while he was in prison; he will let you feel the calcified bumps where the bones tried to grow straight again. When he was released in 1986, Latif weighed 100 pounds. His wife opened the door, he said, and she didn't recognize him. Even after his release, Latif was watched constantly by government minders. He was put at a desk in the Ministry of Industry, spent a few years doing nothing, and then in 1991 he retired early, took his $30-a-month government pension and went home and tended his trees. The government left him alone after that, he said.
 At the beginning of this war, when all the looting broke out, Latif guarded an orphanage in his neighborhood with a stick, but mostly, he said, ''I was just an old man sitting around at home.'' Latif insisted that until the Falluja siege, he was content reading history books and passing his days in his garden. He has many fruit trees -- mango, orange and apple -- and he took us out to the garden to show us his favorite, the banana tree. ''It should be bearing fruit soon,'' he said. ''Little ones, little Iraqi bananas.''
Around the time Latif was watching Rumsfeld on TV, I was crawling along a rooftop on the north side of Falluja. Dead bodies lay in the streets. Wobbly-legged dogs pulled at them. I saw one corpse sprawled on its back, a beard of flies crawling over its face. I was embedded with a Marine company that had taken over a string of homes overlooking a soccer field. The field marked where the occupation ended and the resistance began. Masked insurgents were hammering Marine positions. Marines were hammering back. At the crack of gunfire, both sides dropped behind dusty brick walls, clicked off their safeties and unloaded whatever they had at one another: machine guns, mortars, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades.
 Urban warfare is intimate, intense and notoriously bloody, and the battle of Falluja quickly turned into a humanitarian disaster. By April 15, according to Falluja officials, 831 civilians had been killed and 1,600 wounded. Schools were blown apart. Mosque minarets lay cracked in the streets. Most residents had no water, no light, no medicine, no flour. People were so scared to leave their homes that they buried their fallen sons in their gardens. And the Arab media, the only journalists who could operate safely in town without being embedded -- or kidnapped -- were broadcasting every bombed-out mosque, every shellshocked family. Because of them, Falluja was turning into a rallying cry for the entire Arab world -- another Palestine.
 Most people in Falluja weren't interested in becoming martyrs, though, and the city's leaders made various attempts to seek peace. But it was almost impossible for them to get out of the city to hold negotiations because of all the snipers, checkpoints and crossfire. Qasim Muhammad Abdul Satar sits on Falluja's Shura Council, a body of town elders. One night in mid-April, he told me, he and three other men slipped out of their homes and down to the banks of the Euphrates. They climbed into a rowboat and rowed across the river to rendezvous with a car on the other side that took them to Amman, Jordan, about an eight-hour drive. There, they met some people at the United Nations office and asked for help. But the talks went nowhere.
 At the same time, intermediaries from the Iraqi Governing Council, the now-dissolved body that served as an advisory board to the American administration, were shuttling between Marine generals and Fallujan sheiks. The Marines said they would pull out if the attacks stopped. The sheiks said the attacks would stop if the Marines pulled out. That was the logic the two sides were locked into. The sheiks also promised to collect heavy weapons from the insurgents and turn them over to the Americans. Instead, they collected scrap -- rusty mortar tubes and busted-up rocket launchers and World War I-era rifles. Rumsfeld was right: the sheiks the Marines were negotiating with didn't hold much sway. 
 This was the problem Latif thought he could solve. His first step was contacting Muhammad al-Shehwani, an old friend from his days in the Iraqi special forces, who had recently been appointed director of Iraq's new spy agency. Shehwani, who is close to the Americans, arranged for Latif to meet the Marine generals.
 At the same time, Latif was making contact with the insurgents battling the Marines in Falluja. On April 24, he sent a friend -- he doesn't want to say whom -- into the city to set up a meeting. The next day, Latif was sitting on a carpet at the Al Hadra Al Muhammadia mosque, one of Falluja's biggest, surrounded by 15 sheiks and imams, many dressed in turbans, headdresses and the diaphanous dishdasha gowns of true desert people. Latif had status; he came from a prominent family of Sunni merchants. But he was an outsider, from Baghdad, and he didn't know these robed men.
 ''I told them, 'I'm a stranger, yes, but I didn't come to mediate,''' Latif told me. '''I came to help. I am one of you. And if the negotiations fail, I will stay in Falluja and die with you.''' The men listened. ''I will guard your women and children,'' Latif told them. 
 The men were divided. They wanted peace, but they were also ready to fight. ''Our morale was high,'' said Satar, the Falluja elder, who was at the meeting. ''And why wouldn't it be? We were a small city, standing up to the Americans.''
 Latif leveled with them. ''It's up to you,'' he said. ''You have the choice. You can lead your people to their rifles. Or you can put them on the path to civilization.''
 On the American side, Col. John Toolan, a Brooklyn native with a wide, proud face, was in charge of leading the Marine invasion, which seemed imminent. But even as he was studying the maps, he was hoping to find a way out. ''We started thinking, What was the end result of seizing the city and destroying it and taking all that collateral damage?'' Toolan said. ''Will you have reduced the resistance or the level of frustration?''
 Col. Larry Brown, operations officer for the Marine forces in Iraq, told me that at that point the decision was out of the Marines' hands; it was being made at the highest levels of American government. That last weekend in April, President Bush was meeting with advisers at Camp David, trying to figure out what to do. Falluja had become perhaps the biggest and most anxious question of the war. ''We were just waiting,'' Brown said. But he knew waiting had a price: the two-week cease-fire had given the insurgents time to rearm, resupply and dig in. ''We figured they had fallback positions, fallback routes, covered ambushes,'' Brown said. ''We could still take that city in five days. But it wouldn't be pretty.''
 On April 26, by Latif's count (he's not exactly sure of the date), he drove up to the Marine base in a white Toyota pickup. With him were three men in old Iraqi Army uniforms. The elders of Falluja had sent the top officers in town with Latif to meet with the Americans. The leader was Maj. Gen. Jasim Muhammad Saleh, a well-fed infantry commander from Falluja with a decidedly Saddam-era look. As Latif recalled it, he and Saleh sat down across the table from the top Marine general, James Conway, and presented him with a tough choice: occupation or peace. The Marines, Latif said, couldn't have both. On top of that, Latif and the Fallujan officials proposed building a security force of ex-officers and ex-soldiers from Falluja, the exact same ''former regime elements'' the Marines suspected were involved in the resistance. It was a hard proposal for the Marines to swallow; to them, it sounded like: Here's the plan. We're going to give guns to your enemies and let them patrol the streets. O.K. with you?
 The Marines knew they hadn't accomplished their objective: finding the gunmen who killed the contractors. What's more, never before during the Iraq war had American forces agreed to abandon an entire city, and this particular city had become a symbol of both American and Iraqi resolve. But the Marines, unable to find another way out, agreed to Latif's deal, and suddenly the siege -- and the planned attack -- was off. ''If Latif hadn't showed up,'' Brown said, ''chances of engaging the city were better than not.''
 When the Marines held a news conference on May 1 to announce the formation of the new Falluja Brigade, though, Latif was nowhere to be seen. ''I didn't want to be on TV,'' Latif later explained. ''So I pushed Saleh in front.'' 
 Saleh remembered things a little differently. ''Nobody pushed me out front,'' he said recently. ''My rank pushed me there.'' In any case, for a few days Saleh was the public face of the Falluja Brigade. Saleh pumped hands with the Americans. Saleh listened thoughtfully to reporters' questions. Saleh had his face broadcast around the world. The Marines liked the idea of Saleh as leader of the new brigade; he had what they called ''street cred.'' He was from Falluja and well connected to the sheiks and imams. He was big and imposing, and he was a bona fide general.
 But while Saleh was being cheered in the streets of Falluja like a conquering war hero, someone in Baghdad started spreading the word that he had served in the Republican Guard. The rumor traveled fast and wide, infuriating Kurd and Shiite leaders who bristled at the thought that a Sunni general connected to persecution and human rights abuses would now be rewarded with a top job by the Americans. Saleh insisted he had never been in the guard, and so did the Marines. (''We checked that guy out,'' Brown told me. ''He wasn't in the Republican Guard.'') But the situation was getting messy, and Pentagon spokesmen in Washington began saying that Saleh wasn't really the commander of the Falluja Brigade. 
 The next thing Saleh knew, he heard on his TV that Latif, an outsider in a place where local ties deeply mattered, was in charge. ''Nobody even told me,'' said Saleh, who now favors traditional Arab dress and spends his time at home studying the Koran. The Marines pushed Saleh aside, and some officers admitted it was a stumble. Still, they said, Latif was the natural leader, ''the statesman,'' as Brown put it. Conway said in a news conference that Latif was ''very well thought of, very well respected by the Iraqi general officers, you can just see the body language between them'' -- although it was a bit of a mystery why that would be true of a man who never reached the top ranks of the military and who had spent the past decade tending to his fruit trees. When Latif asked Saleh to be his assistant, Saleh refused. ''I have more rank than he does,'' Saleh said.
 Even under Latif, the Falluja Brigade has its detractors. Some marines are bothered by the presence of former insurgents. But officers like Brown say that isn't so important. ''You've got to be realistic,'' Brown said. ''Most of these guys were fence-sitters who got swept up in the resistance.'' Brown pointed out that in Falluja there is 60 percent unemployment among military-age men. ''At the beginning of the war, we asked these guys to lay down their arms and not fight us,'' he said. ''They did. Then we fired them. You've got to take that into account.''
 Some say the deal sends the wrong message. Anthony Zinni, the retired Marine general in charge of U.S. forces in the Middle East in the late 1990's, said in a recent speech that threatening a major attack and then suddenly pulling out, as the Marines did in Falluja, imperils American credibility. ''One thing you learn in this business is, Don't say it unless you're going to do it,'' Zinni said. ''In this part of the world, strength matters. And if you say you are going to go in and wipe them out, you better do it.''
There is a battle going on for Falluja's soul right now, and it is not clear who is winning. As the United States prepares to transfer sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government on June 30, officially ending the occupation, Falluja is still a shaky place. In the second week of June, a Falluja Brigade camp was shelled by insurgents, and 12 members of the brigade were wounded. It was the first time any of Latif's men had been attacked.
 The brigade's essential responsibility is to stop the violence against the Americans and set the conditions for the Marines' eventual return so they can deliver on their reconstruction promises. Yet it seems very unlikely that Americans will be fixing pipes or passing out lollipops in downtown Falluja any time soon. A few weeks ago, masked insurgents, apparently religious Sunnis, paraded four men through town who had been caught selling beer and whiskey along the banks of the Euphrates. The men were shirtless, and their backs were bleeding. They had been savagely whipped for selling alcohol, which is legal in Iraq. There have also been reports of masked men running checkpoints in the city and enforcing a strict Islamic code in which dominoes, videos and Western-style haircuts are banned.
 Mahmood Othman, a Kurdish politician who sat on the governing council, called Falluja ''another Taliban'' and complained that the deal the Marines made set a bad example. ''This could be a model for the rest of Iraq,'' Othman said. ''Whenever you want your own rule, you fight the Americans, and they'll back off.'' Othman pointed to Karbala and Najaf, two Shiite holy cities where Americans are contemplating granting some form of local control to the very militiamen they were just fighting. ''See,'' he said. ''More Fallujas.'' 
 Latif concedes that he does not have total control of the city. ''My force is still young,'' he said. ''We are just starting.'' Nevertheless, he said that he may not stick around much longer. ''I'm here as a bridge,'' he said. ''Soon the brigade won't need me.'' Latif said that the officers beneath him are good, though he admitted that he does not have much of a relationship with them. ''I don't know many of these men,'' he said. Latif advised me not to linger in town. Several foreign journalists have been kidnapped and attacked there in recent weeks, and Latif said that even he couldn't guarantee my safety. (As a result, some of the interviews for this story were conducted by my interpreters, Fooad al Sheikhly and Khalid W. Hassan.)
 Reconstruction is happening in Falluja, but quietly. With the help of Iraqi professionals, the Marines have been contracting projects out of a small building on Falluja's outskirts. So far, they have spent more than $2 million on wheelbarrows, mosque restoration, home improvements, water treatment and road repairs, creating, they say, 3,500 jobs. But the Marines cannot oversee the projects they are paying for; instead, they send in the money and hope it is going to the right people. ''It frustrates me I can't go into that city,'' Toolan said. ''But Latif is adamant we stay out.'' 
 Toolan mentioned Karma, a village five miles up the road that is essentially a Falluja suburb. ''Karma is what we wanted to do in Falluja,'' Toolan said. Just a few weeks ago, Karma was a serious insurgent hangout. Today, it is totally different. The masked men are gone, thanks to a Marine offensive that wiped out an estimated 100 insurgents. Marines are now living in the police station with Iraqi soldiers. It is not complete harmony, but it is not total dysfunction, either. They eat, sleep and patrol together. Sometimes, after dinner, the marines and Iraqis wrestle. Both sides say it helps blow off steam.
 The Marines say Latif has held up his end of the bargain, at least on some things. Mortar attacks have stopped. So have the ambushes on American convoys near town. But few heavy weapons have been handed over, and neither have the suspects in the contractors' killing. A senior American official in Iraq said in mid-June that Falluja remains one of the top concerns of the occupation authority as it prepares to hand over power. ''Everybody agrees that the Falluja Brigade helped us avert a crisis,'' the official said. ''But is the situation sustainable?''
 An American military commander responded to that concern by saying that nobody should be complaining about Latif. He was the best option they had, the commander said, short of invading the city and putting a marine on every street corner. 
 Latif stopped the killing in Falluja. That seems to be his biggest achievement. And now the Americans are beginning to realize that law and order may have to wait for another day. ''The jury is still out on Falluja,'' Brown said. When I asked him if Falluja was a model, a cautionary tale, an uncertain compromise or a disaster, Brown thought for a second. Then he answered. ''All of the above.''

HEADLINE: The Slump Has Ended, But Not The Gloom

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
AFTER enduring three years of a deteriorating job market and one economic false start after another, Americans finally have reason to think that the long slump of the early 21st century has ended. Employers are hiring again. The stock market has risen more than 40 percent since early last year. 
 And how have the American people celebrated? By becoming a lot grumpier about the economy. 
 Since January, more than a million jobs have been added to the payrolls, yet the percentage of people who say the economy is in good shape has dropped, polls say. Fewer people now than at the start of the year are willing to say it is improving. George W. Bush's marks for economic stewardship have reached the lowest level of his presidency, according to recent Gallup and CBS News surveys. 
 It may sound discordant, but the early days of the new boom really do feel worse for many families than the recession of 2001 or its long aftermath did. The layoffs of the past three years totaled in the millions, but they touched only a small segment of the population. The stagnant wages that have followed job losses, the recent spike in gasoline and other consumer prices and the slow climb of interest rates, by contrast, reach into the pocketbooks of every household. Americans notice when milk reaches $4.43. 
 The gap between economic indicators and public mood has left strategists for both Mr. Bush's campaign and that of Senator John Kerry swearing that the economy will benefit their man in November. On Monday, Mr. Kerry began what aides described as two weeks of focus on the economy by saying that people who work hard should be able to pay their bills. Mr. Bush countered that he is an optimist and chided those who ''can't see the sunshine.''
 Republicans argue that the nation's angst is merely an echo of the downturn and that it will soon fall silent. ''The economy has really turned,'' said Senator Jim Talent, Republican of Missouri, a swing state. ''It just takes awhile longer for that to filter through to folks.''
 If this does end up being the high point for pessimism, Mr. Bush will stand for re-election while Americans are feeling pretty good about the economy. Even with gloom rising, consumer confidence is at roughly the level as it was during the summers before Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon won second terms, according to University of Michigan monthly surveys. It is significantly higher than it was in the run-up to losses by Jimmy Carter and Mr. Bush's father.
 But unlike recent presidents who won twice, Mr. Bush has presided over a significant slide in confidence, from record highs in 2000. The recent burst of worry has given Democrats new reason to think he is vulnerable on more than Iraq. Swing voters are even more concerned than the rest of the population, according to the Gallup Poll. Only 16 percent of independents described the economy as excellent or good, compared with more than 30 percent of people who say they usually vote for one party of the other.
 ''It's neither the best of times nor the worst of times,'' said Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll. ''It's neither as dire as Kerry would say it is or as good as Bush would say it is.''
 In Missouri, a gallon of regular gasoline cost an average of about $1.75 last week, having fallen in recent weeks but still almost 50 cents higher than it was in December, according to GasBuddy.com. In Florida, Maine and New Mexico, three other swing states, a gallon costs about $1.90. The prices of milk and beef have surged, because of a shortage of cows. Consumers also see the increases in eggs, ice cream, butter and mayonnaise. 
 A poll released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center found that Americans were following news about high gas prices more closely than news about either Ronald Reagan's death or the conflict in Iraq. 
 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week that inflation was unlikely to be ''a serious concern'' in coming months. Much of the recent inflation increase has stemmed from unusual events rather than economic demand strong enough to cause prices to keep accelerating, Fed officials say. 
 The Fed seems poised to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate by a quarter point when it meets on June 30 and to continue increasing rates for the rest of the year. Mortgage rates and other long-term rates have already risen.
 Still, inflation has made life a little uncomfortable for many households. The weekly pay of the median full-time worker is rising at roughly the rate of inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Two years ago, when job losses were soaring but the aftereffects of the late 90's boom remained stronger, weekly pay was rising at an annual rate of about 2 percent after being adjusted for inflation. 
 ''There are good indicators now,'' said Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat. ''But people aren't feeling them. The growth is misleading. We're creating the wrong kind of jobs.''
 The idea that the recent recovery in hiring has occurred largely in low-wage jobs has become a central part of the Kerry message, setting off a series of warring press releases, each with its own dizzying set of statistics. The question has no definitive answer, because the Labor Department data shows only which industries are adding jobs, not what kind of jobs. 
 But the Kerry campaign's line does seem to hew more closely to the actual trend, and that suggests it could find more sympathetic ears among voters. The typical private-sector job created since December has been an industry job that pays an hourly wage of about $14.25, according to government numbers. Across the private sector, the average wage exceeds $15.
 If the healthy job gains of the last few months continue, though, paychecks are almost certain to improve as well. Republicans are betting that they will and that Mr. Greenspan is correct about inflation remaining tame. 
 Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio, a Republican, said the biggest source of anxiety is the rapid pace of economic change, which has left many people wondering whether their jobs will be lost to a machine or another country.
 ''People feel an uneasiness because of the global economy we're living in,'' added Gov. John E. Baldacci of Maine, a Democrat. ''That, more than anything else, clouds the recovery.'' As he spoke by telephone, he was traveling between two events -- both celebrating Maine companies that were expanding their work forces.

HEADLINE: Democrats Work Together to Build an Anti-Bush Platform

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., June 19 

 BODY:
More than two dozen witnesses, from former cabinet secretaries to unemployed textile workers, spent hours on Friday attacking President Bush's domestic policies and no time squabbling among themselves in the last of three public hearings to help the Democratic Party write its 2004 national platform.
 There were no flare-ups, rude banners or angry disagreements. Not even a whisper of discontent. It was a far cry from the days when Democrats regularly savaged one another over issues like the Vietnam War, civil rights and abortion. 
 ''That's due to such an overwhelming flood of feeling in the party at the moment that we've got to trim our differences and do whatever is necessary to beat Bush,'' said Don Fowler, a South Carolina lawyer and former national Democratic Party chairman who was among those listening in the audience. ''It's not as much fun this way, but I've never seen the party so united.''
 The polite and sparsely attended event -- the audience never exceeded two dozen -- took place here in the gymnasium at the Indian School, established in 1890 to educate the children of American Indians.
 The Democratic Platform Drafting Committee had already met in May in Portland, Ore., to hear testimony about domestic security, then on June 5 in Baton Rouge, La., to focus on foreign policy and national security. 
 A June 11 hearing in Ohio, was canceled after the death of former President Ronald Reagan, forcing the committee to schedule a day and a half of testimony in Santa Fe to cover the remaining domestic issues.
 On July 9, the group will present its proposed draft to the 186 members of the Democratic Platform Committee, who will in turn approve the document that will be presented to delegates to the party's national convention in Boston in late July.
 In reality, party platforms carry no authority beyond providing a kind of snapshot of the leadership's thinking and a distillation of its assessment of the public's mood.
 William Perry, a defense secretary in the Clinton administration and a member of the drafting committee, said the process offered at least one concrete benefit. ''It gives people who want to have a voice a chance to have a voice,'' Mr. Perry said. ''It invests them in the process.''
 For eight hours on Friday, and then four more on Saturday morning, speaker after speaker belittled recent signs of job growth and economic recovery as far too modest, and derided the president's stewardship of the environment and civil liberties. They painted a bleak picture of working-class and middle-class life under the Bush administration.
 On Friday, two women who lost their jobs asked for help keeping jobs from going overseas. American Indian leaders objected to program cuts. Educators called for more money and attention. And small-business owners asked for help with rising health insurance costs.
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico asked the committee to include a substantial section on education. Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas did the same for health care. And Gov. James E. Doyle of Wisconsin pressed the case for stem-cell research. 
 Then on Saturday, committee members heard testimony about energy (''Deregulation wasn't just a bust, it was theft,'' said Jim Dushaw of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers), the environment (Democrats must save America from ''a wholesale abandonment of environmental standards in order to appease the president's campaign contributors,'' said Leon G. Billings, a former Maryland state legislator) and civil liberties (''We're not asking for wholesale repeal of the Patriot Act,'' said Laura Murphy, director of the Washington, D.C., office of the American Civil Liberties Union. ''We're saying fix it''). 
 Comments from Robert B. Reich, former labor secretary in the Clinton administration, came in written form because a late plane caused him to miss the event. But Mr. Reich offered an impassioned attack on the president's economic agenda.
 ''In a time of terrorism, war and continued economic hardship for many households, these policies are shameful,'' he said. ''Republicans preach we're-all-in-this-together patriotism but practice what is, in fact, scathing divisiveness. The cruel irony of our time is that they're getting away with this by diverting the nation's attention to external threats.''

HEADLINE: The Capitalist in the Cage

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
''They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom to justify.'' 
 -- Dostoevsky, ''Crime and Punishment''
 SINCE his incarceration eight months ago, Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, has made only fleeting public appearances -- behind bars on a prison video screen, hustled from police vans amid a phalanx of security guards, or, as his trial began on Wednesday in a Moscow courtroom, seated inside a cage.
 In these glimpses, Mr. Khodorkovsky looks pale, resolute and unemotional, much as he did in the years before the state police arrested him at gunpoint aboard his private jet in October, charging him with looting public assets and evading hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.
 Until shortly after his arrest, Mr. Khodorkovsky, 40, was the chief executive of Yukos Oil, which he had transformed into one of Russia's biggest and most shrewdly operated companies. He had amassed a personal fortune of at least $15 billion. Along the way, he jousted politically with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin; deftly courted American financiers, legislators and opinion makers; showered money on public relations firms; and played the role of freshly minted capitalist with singular aplomb. 
 And until his arrest, Mr. Khodorkovsky's past as one of Russia's wiliest and most hard-nosed tycoons seemed a rapidly fading memory. He began his career as a banker who built his fortune on a series of highly criticized privatizations of state-owned companies, like Yukos. Russia's former president, Boris N. Yeltsin, and a senior deputy, Anatoly B. Chubais, spearheaded the privatizations during the 1990's. The deals were plagued by inside maneuvering and fire-sale prices, giving rise to a group of powerful businessmen, including Mr. Khodorkovsky, who became known as oligarchs.
 Perhaps inevitably, given the arc of his career, Mr. Khodorkovsky's showcase trial -- freighted with the possibility of a lengthy prison term and a Yukos bankruptcy -- promises to offer one of the first public referendums on the state of Russia's riches. Its outcome could help shape for years the nature of the country's experiments in capitalism. 
 ''This should be Russia's O.J. trial and should be the most public and most important bit of jurisprudence in modern Russian history,'' said Bernard Sucher, a Moscow investment banker, referring to the attention on the trial of O.J. Simpson in the United States. ''Most people want to look deeply at what happened here in the 1990's, and this is a chance to come to terms with how the country ended up the way it did at the end of the Yeltsin years.''
 Mr. Khodorkovsky and his lawyers have disputed the charges against him, saying they are an attempt to neutralize him as a political reformer. They argue that a main fraud charge was already settled last year and that the shifting ground rules that defined the privatization rush in the 1990's contained few clear-cut guidelines for any businessman to follow. Even so, in an effort to accommodate a prosecution widely regarded as orchestrated by the Kremlin, Mr. Khodorkovsky at one point offered a rare mea culpa for some of his business practices.
 ''WE have made many stupid mistakes, because of our ambitions and because we failed to understand what is going on in the country and the entire complexity of its social and regional peculiarities,'' Mr. Khodorkovsky wrote in a letter published by Russia's Interfax news service in April. ''These are our mistakes and not an inevitable result of liberal democratic reforms. Forgive us if you can. Let us make up for it; we know how to do this.''
 By the time his trial started on Wednesday, however, Mr. Khodorkovsky's stance had hardened. Speaking on his own behalf from inside the defendant's cage, he reverted to the dispassionate and steely certitude that had guided his ascent through the ranks of Russia's scrappy business world.
 ''I am not a naive person,'' he told three judges and a single state prosecutor in a cramped courtroom. ''As for the accusations made against me, I can say that there are no real grounds for them. The charges represent the opinion of the general prosecutor's office and contain no facts.''
 The charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos, like everything else in the trial, are of Brobdingnagian proportions. They fill 227 volumes, and Mr. Khodorkovsky, who has been denied bail, was given about three months to read them. Among their other charges, the Russian authorities accuse him and another Yukos executive, Platon Lebedev, of defrauding the government of $1 billion. After crawling along uneventfully for nine hours on Wednesday, legal proceedings were postponed for a week to allow one of Mr. Khodorkovsky's lawyers to seek medical treatment.
 Mr. Khodorkovsky's presence dominates the proceedings, but Mr. Putin casts a very long shadow. In a separate court case, the Russian authorities contended that Yukos owed $3.4 billion in back taxes. For months, the company said it lacked the money to make the payment, setting the stage for a bankruptcy filing and focusing attention on Mr. Putin's designs for one of the crown jewels of Russia's booming oil industry. 
 ''The government will do its utmost not to ruin Yukos,'' Mr. Putin told journalists in Uzbekistan on Thursday, according to Itar-Tass, Russia's state news agency. The next day, however, a Moscow court ordered the company to make the tax payment. 
 Yukos shares still soared on Thursday and Friday, suggesting that investors believe some sort of deal will be struck, possibly one in which the Russian government receives a stake in the company in exchange for settling the tax case. 
 Many of the early privatizations in the 1990's involved banks ostensibly lending money to industrial companies in exchange for controlling stakes, a widely derided program known as loans for shares. If the Russian government continues to assert itself with Yukos, then loans for shares may morph into shares for taxes, giving the Russian government a new foothold in the economy.
 MR. PUTIN dominates Russia's political sphere in the same way that Mr. Khodorkovsky once dominated its business realm. In many ways, the two are mirror images of each other. They are highly educated, extremely disciplined students of power who quietly keep their own counsel. Both expertly navigated around Russia's bureaucracies and then outflanked opponents by patiently thinking several moves ahead of everyone else.
 But they differ in one crucial aspect: though fairly close in age, they are from very distinct generations. Mr. Putin, 51, is a former K.G.B. agent, a child of the last vestiges of the old Soviet system. He has an ingrained respect for the role of the state. Mr. Khodorkovsky, 11 years younger than Mr. Putin, is a child of the economic restructuring known as perestroika who took full and ruthless advantage of the outsized financial opportunities presented during the Yeltsin era. Mr. Khodorkovsky also came of age during years in which the strong-arm police tactics of the Soviet years began to abate, adding, perhaps, to a risky self-assuredness when his confrontation with Mr. Putin came to a head late last year.
 Although the standoff between the men has been widely characterized as political, economic factors also forced Mr. Putin's hand. Last year, Mr. Khodorkovsky tried to sell a large stake in Yukos to an American company, Exxon Mobil, without consulting the Kremlin -- at a time when oil was becoming a pivotal geopolitical and economic resource prized by Mr. Putin. Mr. Khodorkovsky had also tried to shop an oil pipeline deal with China, a move at odds with Kremlin policy. A senior Yukos official conceded in an interview in Moscow late last year that the confrontation between the two potentates was grounded in sharply differing visions of how to steer Russia's economic might.
 For now, Mr. Putin's vision is winning out. He has made an example of Mr. Khodorkovsky, cracking down on him with all the remorseless determination of an old Soviet hand and winning the support of average Russians dismayed by the country's inequities.
 And the models that Mr. Putin appears to favor are the managed economies of countries like Chile, China and Singapore, which blend market forces with a strong state role. Those economies were spared the free-market fluctuations that ravaged some developing nations beginning in the late 1990's -- like Russia and Argentina, which were privatized hastily, before viable regulatory and legal structures were put in place as checks on hit-and-run profiteers.
 ''Khodorkovsky's personal fate in this is not the big picture,'' said Stephen M. Kotkin, director of the Russian studies program at Princeton. ''The big picture is Russia's oil and gas holdings.''
 ''Putin has bought into the notion that Russian power will derive from higher G.D.P., and that's totally new for that part of the world,'' Mr. Kotkin added. ''He's given a wide berth to both the economic planners and the market reformers. He's also given a wide berth to the state security apparatus.''
 Government intelligence and security forces are so free to operate in Mr. Putin's Russia that the country's courts, some political analysts say, act as instruments of Kremlin policy rather than as counterbalances to state power.
 ''Some people try to make Khodorkovsky the next Andrei Sakharov and he's not the next Andrei Sakharov -- he did sinister things,'' said Michael McFaul, an associate professor of political science at Stanford University. ''But you don't need to make him the next Sakharov to argue that there is a problem when the state self-selects whom to prosecute.''
 Mr. Kotkin likens current Kremlin politics to a rugby scrum, with market reformers, hard-line security advisers and members of Mr. Putin's inner circle all wrestling for the upper hand in policy making. Mr. Kotkin suggests that if market reforms gain greater traction in Russia, then the rule of law, over time, will supersede the security apparatus -- though he cautions that this is unlikely ''in Putin's lifetime.''
 Dire predictions about financial fallout from Mr. Khodorkovsky's imprisonment last fall have not proved true so far. Foreign investors have not fled Russia in droves, as Mr. Khodorkovsky's Western advocates initially envisaged, and the country's economy is robust and thriving. The government is running a budget surplus, runaway inflation has been tamed, and the gross domestic product has risen at a brisk pace. From 1998, when the economy unraveled amid a financial collapse, to the end of 2003, Russian G.D.P. rose 38 percent, according to the World Bank -- a stellar performance by any standard.
 A recent J.P. Morgan Chase research report praised Mr. Putin's oil policies as ''well conceived,'' saying that the industry will be taxed ''more in line with international norms'' while still receiving government support for expansion projects. The report notes that the Kremlin plans to use added tax revenue from the oil industry to lower other business taxes and to finance health, education and welfare programs in Russia, where one in five people are mired in poverty.
 Russia's stock market has been flagging of late amid fears of rising interest rates in the United States. And Russia's banking system remains dangerously weak and racked by corruption. But financial analysts say that neither problem seems to presage broader upheavals in the economy.
 Nor have Russia's oligarchs disappeared, despite a belief among some political and financial analysts that Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest foreshadowed a widespread purge of the country's industrial titans. A World Bank report published in April said that 23 Russian industrial concerns -- all of them controlled by oligarchs -- still accounted for about 36 percent of the country's privately generated revenue and 38 percent of total private employment. The roster includes Oleg V. Deripaska, an aluminum magnate, and Viktor Vekselberg, an oil and metals tycoon.
 True, some oligarchs have taken to the road. Roman A. Abramovich, who controls the oil giant Sibneft and once pursued a merger with Yukos, has been busy spreading his $12.5 billion fortune around Western Europe. He has relocated to Britain, bought one of England's premier soccer teams, scooped up a Swiss castle and two yachts worth more than $115 million each, and has given every appearance of wanting to convert a big chunk of his cash into hard assets before the Kremlin lays its hands on it.
 Like specters from the privatization follies and machinations of yore, other Russian businessmen have rushed into the gap created when Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested. 
 In May, Boris A. Berezovsky, once the dean of the oligarchs but now in self-imposed exile in London, slapped ''Free Khodorkovsky'' placards atop a fleet of Mercedes-Benz limousines that snaked like a rich man's conga line through the streets of the British capital. 
 And Boris Jordan, an American-born financier who created some of the earliest and most widely disputed Russian privatization plans, this month offered his own solution to Yukos's woes: he would secure a seat on the company's board and lead negotiations with the government. Mr. Jordan's maneuver was pooh-poohed by analysts who observed that a Kremlin insider, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, had the Yukos board firmly in rein as its new chairman.
 ''It's not viable and Gerashchenko would never let that happen,'' said Padma Desai, an economics professor at the Harriman Institute at Columbia University, who met recently with Russian government officials and businessmen in Moscow. ''I think about 25 percent of the company may go into government ownership and the government clearly doesn't want to destroy Yukos.''
 YUKOS officials say the company's financial performance, buoyed by skyrocketing oil prices, has not waned since Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested. Last month, Yukos reported that its oil output rose 9.3 percent in the first quarter, compared with the corresponding period of 2003.
 ''I don't think there has been any material impact on the bottom line,'' Bruce Misamore, Yukos's chief financial officer, said of Mr. Khodorkovsky's absence. He added that Mr. Khodorkovsky's managerial talents were missed, but that Yukos had a ''very strong remaining management team.''
 In January, Yukos reported net income of about $3.5 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2003, an increase of 71 percent from the period a year earlier. Since January, Yukos has not publicly posted earnings that conform with American accounting standards, prompting analysts in Moscow to question exactly how the company is deploying its ample resources -- especially in light of its contention that its inability to make the $3.4 billion tax payment will force it into bankruptcy.
 Yukos made dividend payments of about $2 billion to its investors last year, cash that went to major shareholders like Mr. Khodorkovsky. Yukos also recently paid a bank consortium an undisclosed portion of a $2.6 billion loan, about $1.6 billion of which was guaranteed by Group Menatep, an investment vehicle controlled by Mr. Khodorkovsky and other financiers. 
 Group Menatep owns about 44 percent of Yukos's shares, and the loan repayment, which tapped into cash that otherwise might have gone toward the disputed tax payments, benefited Mr. Khodorkovsky and other Yukos insiders. 
 ''In the event that cash flows could not be properly accounted for, questions could arise as to whether or not Menatep was seeking to strip as much cash as possible from Yukos, an asset which it justifiably believes itself to be in immediate danger of losing,'' Eric Kraus, a financial analyst at Sovlink Securities, said in a June research report. ''If so, the complex web of trading companies which still reportedly handles Yukos's oil sales would provide an ideal vehicle for diversion of cash flows.''
 MR. MISAMORE disputed that any cash was being drained from Yukos, describing it as ''absolutely false'' speculation. Although he declined to provide details of the loan repayments to Group Menatep, he said Yukos had about $1 billion in cash reserves. He said Yukos could meet the tax payment if the government allowed it to sell some assets. But if Mr. Putin stays true to his word that he does not wish to see Yukos bankrupt, then the Russian government may wind up with a large stake in Yukos. 
 James Fenkner, research director at Troika Dialog, a brokerage firm in Moscow, said that the Russian government controls only about 5 percent of the country's oil concerns. By comparison, he said, oil assets in OPEC countries are completely state-owned, as are oil interests in Mexico.
 Such a small government presence in the oil industry makes Russia the exception among emerging-market economies, he said.
 ''This all goes back to Anatoly Chubais and the need to privatize everything immediately,'' Mr. Fenkner said. ''There was an incredible concentration of wealth in a very short period of time in a society that regards itself as egalitarian. The quick-and-dirty method of privatization has had its negative ramifications.'' 
 For Mr. Khodorkovsky, who raked in riches faster than anyone else, that has meant trading his executive suite for a cage in court.

HEADLINE: Renovation Project Takes New Prep School to the Bank

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The domestication of the financial district is taking another step forward -- a child-size step -- with the recycling of an old bank at 41 Broad Street into a private school, on a block that first welcomed young students in the mid-18th century.
 The Claremont Preparatory School will occupy the former home of Lee, Higginson & Company, a long-vanished investment bank. Built just ahead of the 1929 stock market crash, the walls of the main hall were joyfully ornamented with three dozen ships in ''A Pageantry of the History of Commerce by Sea''; this space will be the auditorium. 
 Quite imposingly, the bank adorned one of its partners' offices with carved oak from Sherwood Forest. ''This is going to be a conference room, to scare parents,'' said Michael C. Koffler, chief executive of MetSchools and executive director of Claremont Preparatory. The bank also installed 29-inch-thick doors on its downstairs vault. This will not be used as a detention room, Mr. Koffler promised. 
 ''When we're done, it should look brand new and gorgeous,'' he said. ''Brand new -- 75 years old.'' The school, running from kindergarten to the eighth grade, will open in September 2005, ready to receive 300 students. Its enrollment will grow to 700 the next year, reaching 1,000 in 2007.
 MetSchool's seven other institutions include the Claremont Children's School, in the landmark former East River Savings Bank at Amsterdam Avenue and 96th Street.
 Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan, said of Mr. Koffler: ''He's got a good program. He's got a good track record. I love the building. I eyed the building for a public school, but he got there first.''
 Only a block from the New York Stock Exchange, Claremont Preparatory will sit in a high-security zone, where roadblocks and heavily armed police officers are commonplace. But Ms. Wils expects strong demand.
 ''Absolutely, there's going to be a big audience down here,'' she said. ''As more families move back to Lower Manhattan or stay here, schools are the No. 1 issue.''
 Around the corner from 41 Broad Street, on what is now Exchange Place but was then Garden Street, the Reformed Dutch Church opened a free school in 1749.
 Claremont will not be free. The annual tuition will be about $25,000, Mr. Koffler said, though scholarships will be offered. He expects to draw students from the immediate neighborhood, Battery Park City and TriBeCa. He also expects to appeal to parents who work in the financial district and would bring their children downtown.
 OCV Architects of Manhattan are designing the renovation. Mr. Koffler estimated the cost at $25 million, which MetSchools will share with the owners, Walwilhal Associates, an affiliate of Garden Commercial Properties. MetSchools will occupy the entire 12-story structure on a 20-year lease, paying $2.5 million in rent for the first year.
 The school will receive a $500,000 grant from the state Empire State Development Corporation and the city Economic Development Corporation on the condition that it will create 221 jobs by 2007. Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the state corporation, said the conversion would not deprive Wall Street of office space since 41 Broad Street ''is not a building that would be suitable for normal commercial use.''
 Mr. Gargano will join other officials today for a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the school to mark the start of construction.
 A gymnasium will be built on the ninth floor and a lap pool in the basement. Classrooms will occupy the third through eighth floors. Offices, conference rooms and a library will be on the second floor, some in partners' quarters that still have fireplaces and elaborate woodwork. In the subbasement, a cafeteria will surround the old vault, which will serve as a kitchen.
 The particular glory of the building, designed by Cross & Cross, is the 29-foot-high main banking hall, with mosaic-encrusted, bronze-capped columns and a 225-foot-long seafaring mural by Griffith Baily Coale, who was a Navy combat artist in World War II and lived in a whaling captain's home in Stonington, Conn., until his death in 1950.
 Beginning with ancient galleys, the mural runs through caravels and clippers to the latest (as of 1929) ocean liners, ending with the skyline of Lower Manhattan, above which float even more modern means of transportation: a biplane and two dirigibles.
 Lee, Higginson were bankers for Ivar Kreuger, the Swedish match king, whose effort to corner the world match market ended in his suicide in 1932 and the bankruptcy of many of his companies. The bank came under fire for marketing shares in International Match ''without conclusive proof of assets,'' The New York Times reported in 1932.
 A year later, 41 Broad Street was bought by the stock exchange. It sold the property in 1941 to the Public National Bank, which merged in 1955 with Bankers Trust. Lee, Higginson operated until 1966, when it was acquired by Hayden, Stone.
 In recent years, the banking hall housed a Conway clothing store. ''This room is going to be like an art museum,'' Mr. Koffler said. For now, it is in a state of decrepitude and upheaval. But as a worker's lamp illuminates the darkened volume, there is a glimpse of something prescient in the mural, foretelling the building's fate.
 To the left of the skyline can be seen two historic ships. One is Henry Hudson's Half Moon. The other is Robert Fulton's steamboat, The Clermont.

HEADLINE: A New Upstate Theater With a Five-and-Dime Soul

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: GLENS FALLS, N.Y., June 19 

 BODY:
When Elaine Stritch found herself performing at an old five-and-dime here this weekend, by no means was she cheapening her career.
 She was helping her friends in the Adirondack Theater Festival, who were celebrating not only their 10th season but also their first year in a permanent home: an old Woolworth's converted into a theater in the heart of this small city some 200 miles north of Manhattan.
 People came out by the hundreds to see Ms. Stritch, and after the show they mingled with friends on the sidewalk or lingered in restaurants. 
 City officials found that even better than the performance. While much of upstate New York is burdened with a poor economy, Glens Falls is on the upswing, and its theater is getting some of the credit.
 ''A community needs a heart and a soul, and the arts provide that,'' Mayor Robert A. Regan said. ''We could be enormously successful in other things, and if we did not have this, something would be missing.''
 While he realizes that now, it was happenstance that brought the arts to Glens Falls, not any focused desire by the city.
 Martha Banta, 38, lived her teenage years in a nearby town, Queensbury, when her father moved the family there after he was lured by a job in a manufacturing company, now defunct. After Ms. Banta graduated from college and spent several years working in New York City, primarily for the New York Theater Workshop, she and her eventual husband, David Turner, decided to start a summer theater company and take it upstate. ''It would be a little vacation,'' she said, ''keep us out of hot New York during the summer.''
 Mr. Turner, who was working as a company manager for ''Show Boat,'' mentioned it to Ms. Stritch, one of its stars. She had fond memories of summer theater and, he said, volunteered, '' 'Oh, I'll come up and do ''Love Letters'' for you, and I'll bring Jason.' ''
 Mr. Turner recalled, ''It took me five minutes to realize she meant Jason Robards.'' 
 This was going to be easy, the couple concluded. That first year they found an empty theater in a friend's R.V. park in Lake George. It was an upscale park, made for families with luxury campers who intended to stay a week or two, not for good. Still, they decided not to overexplain to Ms. Stritch. ''To this day, she does not know she was in an R.V. park,'' Mr. Turner said. ''We brought her in at night.''
 The next year, Ms. Banta shopped for additional locations and found herself peering inside the vacant Woolworth's building in the old paper-mill city of Glens Falls, a short drive from her mother's home. It had ugly vinyl floor tiles and a drop ceiling, but the rest was open, and the building was in a small downtown. ''I said to Dave, 'Get me that building,' '' she said.
 The city business group that owned the property, Partners for Progress, longed for a mini-mall, not a theater. But since the Adirondack Theater Festival would need it only for early summer until it would return to the R.V. theater -- which was air-conditioned -- the business group agreed. A stage crew hung black curtains, built a wood platform for a stage, removed the drop ceiling and brought in folding chairs. A group of New York City actors put on ''Heartbeats,'' ''101 Humiliating Stories'' and other plays. A theater was born -- at least until the crew restored the dusty drop ceiling and departed.
 The next year, the old Woolworth's, still being marketed as a mini-mall, was still available. The theater came back to put on ''Three Tall Women,'' among other productions, again removing and replacing the drop ceiling. ''We felt we had to,'' Mr. Turner said. ''It was like a house that people were trying to sell.''
 By the fourth year, the business group agreed to turn on the Woolworth building's air-conditioning so the theater group could stay all summer. By the sixth year, the owners were giving up on their mini-mall, and the Adirondack Theater Festival was delighting in its work on an old-fashioned main street. ''In New York, it's harder to make a connection with the audience,'' said Ms. Banta, the artistic director.
 In the meantime, Mayor Regan started a series of Rudolph W. Giuliani-like policies, working for small changes like fresh paving and landscaping that would improve the city's overall atmosphere. More shops moved into the vacant storefronts around the theater; a Thai restaurant opened across the street.
 Then Partners for Progress decided to create a permanent summer home for the Adirondack Theater Festival and use the space as a community theater and for traveling shows during the rest of the year.
 A local theme-park owner, Charles R. Wood, donated $750,000 toward the $3.3 million capital campaign to renovate the building. The theater is now named for him.
 The state threw in more than $1 million, and Gov. George E. Pataki began citing surrounding Warren County in his speeches about economic breakthroughs. 
 ''How often does the governor show up at a groundbreaking at an old Woolworth's?'' asked Thomas L. Hoy, head of the nonprofit group that owns the theater.
 Renovation of the 30,000-square-foot building was finished earlier this year. Ms. Stritch returned -- in the daylight -- to perform the Tony Award-winning ''Elaine Stritch at Liberty'' to a sold-out audience of 300. The Thai restaurant had a 30-minute wait on Friday night, reported the theater's executive director and sole employee, Andrea Lyons. 
 ''That many people downtown, patronizing our local businesses, is a big deal for us,'' she said.
 Other scheduled productions include David Mamet's ''Boston Marriage'' and a world premiere musical, ''Mimi Le Duck.''
 ''The Woolworth's was a focal point for why people came to downtown,'' Ms. Banta said. ''It was a place to meet people and see people.'' As theatergoers waved to one another before Friday's performance, it seemed it still was.

HEADLINE: Broadcast Indecency To Get Higher Fines

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission said last Friday that it would raise the maximum fine for indecent material on broadcast television and radio 18 percent to $32,500 an incident, to adjust for inflation.
 Fines for indecency have been criticized as inadequate because many broadcasters take in large profits, and Congress is trying to increase the penalties. 
 Previously, fines for violations of federal decency standards were $27,500 an incident. Federal law calls for F.C.C. fines to be increased to account for inflation every four years.
 Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, is expected today to try to amend a bill moving through the Senate to raise fines for indecency to as much as $275,000 an incident and up to a maximum of $3 million a day. The House has already passed a measure to raise fines to as much as $500,000 an incident.
 Indecency on the airwaves has attracted worldwide attention since pop singer Janet Jackson's breast was exposed this year during the National Football League's Super Bowl championship game on Viacom Inc.'s CBS broadcast network.
 The new fines would go into effect a month after the information is published in The Federal Register, which will probably occur in the next few days.

HEADLINE: Old Search Engine, the Library, Tries to Fit Into a Google World

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 20 

 BODY:
Katarina Maxianova, who received her bachelor's degree in comparative literature from Columbia University in May, took a seminar last year in which the professor assigned two articles from New Left Review magazine. She found one immediately through Google; for the other, she had to trek to the library stacks.
 ''Everyone in class tried to get those articles online,'' she said, ''and some people didn't even bother to go to the stacks when they couldn't Google them.''
 For the last few years, librarians have increasingly seen people use online search sites not to supplement research libraries but to replace them. Yet only recently have librarians stopped lamenting the trend and started working to close the gap between traditional scholarly research and the incomplete, often random results of a Google search. 
 ''We can't pretend people will go back to walking into a library and talking to a reference librarian,'' said Kate Wittenberg, director of the Electronic Publishing Initiative at Columbia University. 
 Ms. Wittenberg's group recently finished a three-year study of research habits, including surveys of 1,233 students across the country, that concluded that electronic resources have become the main tool for information gathering, particularly among undergraduates.
 ''We have to respond to these new ways,'' Ms. Wittenberg said, and come up with a way to make better research material available online.
 That means working with commercial search engines like Google and Yahoo to make ever more digital-research materials searchable. 
 Undergraduates like Ms. Maxianova and her classmates are not the only ones conducting research from their computers. Faculty members also do it.
 ''One of the rarest things to find is a member of the faculty in the library stacks,'' said Paul Duguid, an information researcher who will teach a class this fall at the University of California, Berkeley on judging the authenticity of information found on the Web. 
 In the Columbia survey, 90 percent of the faculty members who responded said they used electronic resources in their research several times a week or more. 
 While the accuracy of online information is notoriously uneven, the ubiquity of the Web means that a trip to the stacks is no longer the way most academic research begins. 
 ''The nature of discovery is changing,'' said Joseph Janes, associate professor and chairman of library and information science at the University of Washington. ''I think the digital revolution and the use of digital resources in general is really the beginning of a change in the way humanity thinks and presents itself.''
 A few research librarians say Google could eventually take on more of the role of a universal library.
 ''If you could use Google to just look across digital libraries, into any digital library collection, now that would be cool,'' said Daniel Greenstein, university librarian of the California Digital Library, the digital branch of the University of California library system.
 The biggest problem is that search engines like Google skim only the thinnest layers of information that has been digitized. Most have no access to the so-called deep Web, where information is contained in isolated databases like online library catalogs. 
 Search engines seek so-called static Web pages, which generally do not have search functions of their own. Information on the deep Web, on the other hand, comes to the surface only as the result of a database query from within a particular site. 
 Use Google, for instance, to research Upton Sinclair's 1934 campaign for governor of California, and you will miss an entire collection of pamphlets accessible only from the University of California at Los Angeles's archive of campaign literature. 
 ''Google searches an index at the first layers of any Web site it goes to, and as you delve beneath the surface, it starts to miss stuff,'' said Mr. Duguid, co-author of ''The Social Life of Information.'' ''When you go deeper, the number of pages just becomes absolutely mind-boggling.'' 
 Reference librarians are trying to bring material from the deep Web to the surface. In recent months, dozens of research libraries began working with Google and other search engines to help put their collections within reach of a broader public.
 Carnegie-Mellon University, for instance, has digitally scanned 1.6 million pages of archival material from the papers of Carnegie-Mellon scientists like Herbert Simon, a winner of the Nobel in economic science. Now, a Google search for ''Herbert Simon and Carnegie Mellon'' turns up his papers. 
 Google has also indexed two million book titles through the Online Computer Library Center, which manages a database of catalogs from 12,000 libraries. 
 Other search sites are striking similar deals. Yahoo recently signed an agreement with the online library center to index its catalogs, and four months ago, it started carrying out a plan to make more of the deep Web reachable through Yahoo. 
 Yahoo has also signed other agreements, including one with the University of Michigan to make searchable the university's compendium of academic collections from more than 250 institutions. 
 Yet for every archive that is digitized, scores are not. ''There's lots of great stuff that isn't available digitally and likely never will be,'' Dr. Janes said.
 ''We have to figure out how to adapt to a world where people will prefer digital stuff,'' Dr. Janes said, ''yet not forgo the investment in print and analog collections and the work involved in mapping and maintaining those collections.'' 
 Research institutions are investing heavily in combining the new with the old. At Columbia's Butler Library, the stacks are not only alive and well, Ms. Wittenberg said, but have been modernized to allow for better physical access to the seven million volumes in the collection.
 During the renovation, work areas with network connections were placed throughout the library.
 ''A student or faculty member could work for a whole day in what looks and feels like a very traditional library,'' Ms. Wittenberg said, ''while accessing either the print collection or the large and rapidly growing collection of electronic resources.''
 Many experts, even those who specialize in digital material, say that losing the tactile experience of books and relying too heavily on electronic resources is certain to exact a price. 
 ''How do you know it's the appropriate universe from which to draw your research materials?'' Dr. Greenstein said. ''It has huge ramifications for the nature of instruction and scholarship.''
 At the same time, many research librarians say that the new reliance on electronic resources is making their role as guides to undiscovered material more important than ever.
 Thomas Mann, a reference librarian in the main reading room of the Library of Congress, was reminded of this recently while helping a visitor who was researching a 1942 famine in Greece. A Google search had yielded little useful information.
 ''While he was looking at newspaper articles from the 1940's that we have digitized,'' Dr. Mann said, ''I set up a search on the terminal next to him in another database of historical abstracts and history journals.'' 
 In less than a minute, he pulled up citations for five scholarly articles about the famine and helped the visitor put in requests for the paper copies. ''We can show people things they don't ask for,'' Dr. Mann said. 
 Some library experts welcome the change with few reservations. 
 ''Although it seems like an apocalyptic change now, over time we'll see that young people will grow up using many ways of finding information,'' said Abby Smith, director of programs at the Council on Library and Information Resources, a nonprofit group in Washington. 
 ''We'll see the current generation we accuse of doing research in their pajamas develop highly sophisticated searching strategies to find high quality information on the Web,'' Dr. Smith said.
 Dr. Janes said that, like many others, he occasionally pined for the days spent in musty library stacks, where one could chance upon scholarly gems by browsing the shelves. 
 ''You can think of electronic research as a more impoverished experience,'' Dr. Janes said. ''But in some ways it's a richer one, because you have so much more access to so much more information. The potential is there for this to be a real bonus to humanity, because we can see more and read more and do more with it. But it is going to be very different in lots of ways.''

HEADLINE: Ruling Party's Slick Campaign in Mongolia Has Rough Edges

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia 

 BODY:
On the road from the airport, the face of a ruling party candidate smiles in a hypnotic series of signs fastened to every light pole. In town, drivers caught in traffic jams contemplate billboards that show the prime minister grinning with Mongolia's Olympic wrestlers, and of Mongolian rappers endorsing the ruling former Communists as the ''hip-hop party.''
 The center-left government seems to be pushing hard for victory in national elections on Sunday, even though the economy has been growing by 5 percent a year, international tourism has increased 15 percent, and the public approval rating has been hovering around 60 percent in recent polls. As part of its campaign, the government is blanketing the populated pockets of this Alaska-size nation with billboards, television ads, and concerts by the nation's top singers, many with exclusive contracts until Election Day. 
 ''It's like a well-oiled car,'' Oyun Sanjaarsuren, the most popular opposition candidate, said in a recent interview in her office in a downtown district where progovernment billboards seemed to outnumber opposition billboards by 10 to 1.
 Two blocks away, Otgonbayar Yondon, secretary to the governing party, brushed aside such complaints, saying: ''We are simply better organized and better planned. Our campaign ads have appeared according to plan.''
 But the government may have misread Mongolia, a rare island of feisty multiparty politics in Central Asia. A nomadic lifestyle combined with near universal literacy has forged a people with strong streaks of individualism and political contrariness.
 The slick and omnipresent advertising campaign is leaving the governing Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party feeling dangerously overexposed.
 ''Mongolians feel sorry for the underdog,'' L. Tungalag, the party's international relations director, said in an interview. She charged that the opposition Motherland Democratic Coalition ''decided to stop all propaganda and advertisements, so only M.P.R.P. is doing advertising. They are saying, 'We are poor people and can't afford to do anything.'''
 Under the governing party's tactics, campaign workers strong-armed business owners, forcing them to cover up their business advertisements with ruling party propaganda for the 39 days of the parliamentary campaign. Now, sensing a backlash, it is debating whether or not to scale back the advertising.
 This effort to read public opinion is rare in a region that is dominated by the family autarchies of Central Asia and the one-party politics of China.
 ''I would not consider Mongolia part of the 'stan' countries,'' John H. Poepsel, an American political adviser, said here, referring to the Islamic countries to the West. ''Politically, socially, economically, Mongolia is much closer to'' South Korea, Mr. Poepsel said.
 On the economic front, Mongolia's ruling party has moved in 15 years from Communist orthodoxy to membership in the center-left Socialist International movement. Welcoming foreign investment, Prime Minister Nambaryn Enkhbayar recently traveled 50 miles north of here to inaugurate a $75 million Canadian-owned gold mine, the first of hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign mining investment expected in the coming years.
 In this booming capital sprawling along a valley in the steppes, construction cranes pierce a gray haze raised by an urban fleet of private vehicles that expanded by 19 percent in the last year alone.
 On paper, Mr. Enkhbayar, a British-trained linguist, appears invincible. His party controls 72 of the 76 seats in Parliament. In April, he ranked as Mongolia's most admired politician, with a 59 percent approval rating in a national poll commissioned by Mr. Poepsel's International Republican Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit group that promotes democracy. But in the 2000 elections, the opposition won 46 percent of the popular vote, losing many districts in tight races. The April public opinion poll indicated that the opposition ranks were swollen with voters who were unemployed or self-employed, and who worried about housing, jobs and corruption.
 While the capital's new squatter suburbs are expected to vote for the opposition, dissenting voices can be heard in unexpected places. One hundred miles east of Ulan Bator, Ulzii Ganbaatar, a 29-year-old herder, predicted setbacks for the official party, saying, ''I am sure that this year Democrats will win more seats than at the last election.''

HEADLINE: TV's Loneliest Night of the Week Is Starting to Look Very Familiar

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Network programmers think they may finally have found a way to hold onto more viewers. Give them more of the same. Literally. 
 This fall, for the first time, three of the big networks and one of the lesser broadcast networks will offer viewers regularly scheduled repeats as part of their fall prime-time lineups. 
 NBC will turn over its 8 p.m. Saturday time slot to a repeat of the episode of ''The Apprentice'' that appeared two days earlier. CBS is dubbing its 9 p.m. Saturday hour this fall ''Crime Time Saturday,'' during which it will run a repeat of one of the six CBS crime dramas scheduled elsewhere in its prime-time lineup -- ''C.S.I,'' ''C.S.I. Miami,'' ''C.S.I. New York,'' ''Without a Trace,'' ''Cold Case'' and ''Navy NCIS.'' 
 Fox Network, the first network to run regularly scheduled, prime-time repeats by showing ''Cops,'' its video verite crime series, at 8:30 Saturday nights right after each new episode of ''Cops,'' is planning to do the same this year.
 And the UPN network will show a rerun of its breakout hit, ''America's Next Top Model,'' on Friday nights, two nights after it shows the original.
 Network executives make no apologies for the repeats, a tactic that most cable networks, including HBO, USA, FX, MTV and others, have used for years. ''This is inevitable,'' said Preston Beckman, the executive vice president of Fox Entertainment. ''No network can program 22 hours any more, or in our case 15 hours.'' 
 Although the broadcast networks have made much of their recent strategy of adding more original episodes of programs in June, July and August, displacing many of the repeats that used to run there, the reason for the regular-season repeatathon is simple, said Jeff Zucker, the president of the NBC Universal Television group. ''It makes economic sense, and it makes ratings sense,'' he said.
 Not surprisingly, the most popular place for these regular repeats is Saturday night, the night with by far the lowest television viewing.
 Rather than fight the steady erosion of viewers on Saturdays by coming up with something that might induce more viewers to stick around, the networks essentially have decided to offer warmed-over servings. 
 NBC, even before it helped make Saturday the official repeat night this fall, had flooded Saturdays with repeats for every ratings sweep month, turning the night into a ''Law and Order'' film festival.
 The influx of reality programs has added to the trend. Some industry executives have said that reality programs have a downside in that they cannot be rerun, leaving no second chances to amortize their costs, but in truth, more and more reality series are being repeated -- within the same week of their first broadcast.
 NBC used a repeat of ''The Apprentice'' last season as a regular entry on Wednesday at 8 p.m. Fox has frequently used its more successful reality programs, like ''Joe Millionaire'' and ''My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance,'' twice in the same week.
 ''Now, with reality shows costing more, I think networks have to find a way to repeat them,'' said Kelly Kahl, the executive vice president for program planning at CBS. 
 ABC still relies mainly on movies from its Disney production company to fill Saturday night. Network executives said they still needed a place for the long-running ''Wonderful World of Disney'' franchise of family-oriented movies and specials.
 For years CBS tried to stand out on Saturdays by sticking with scripted dramas, fare that might have run on any other night, like ''The District'' and ''Hack.''
 Now CBS has shifted to a less expensive reality series, ''Amazing Race,'' and a newsmagazine, ''48 Hours'' to go with its crime series repeats. 
 ''CBS tried the original series strategy for five years,'' Mr. Zucker said, ''Tell me, did it work?'' He predicted that by relying more on repeats, CBS would turn a money-losing night into a money-maker.
 Mr. Kahl of CBS said the network would be able to deliver a more attractive audience to advertisers next fall, ''and for one-tenth the cost.''
 The economics of repeats are certainly attractive. For a single license fee, networks acquire the right to use each episode at least twice, and increasingly three times. For programs that typically produce 22 original episodes a year, that could mean enough reruns to fill the program's regular time period 52 weeks a year, with 14 left over for use on other nights.
 The only extra costs a network incurs are whatever residual fees it might be required to pay writers, directors or actors -- perhaps $100,000 for each repeat. CBS paid about $2 million an episode last year for the drama ''The District'' alone. For Saturday night this season it will pay about $1 million an episode for ''Amazing Race,'' and $900,000 or so for ''48 Hours.'' 
 With whatever residual fees it has to pay for its crime series repeats, the network's total costs for three hours on Saturday will be about what it paid for just one hour last year.
 ''You have the costs of the repeats plugged into to your original fee,'' Mr. Beckman said. ''The repeat of a successful show generally does better than if we had a original show in there, and you get to expose the successful show to more people. It's win-win-win.''
 The only potential risk, several executives said, is overdoing it. ''You could eventually begin to dilute the original,'' Mr. Beckman said. ''I think you saw some of that with 'Law and Order' this year.''
 The NBC crime series, which has repeats turning up not just on NBC but on two cable networks as well, did have a slight drop in ratings for its original episodes this past season.
 Running regular repeats in places where original programs could go also means fewer times at bat for networks desperate for hits. 
 But the networks seem to be conceding they are mostly swinging and missing anyway, so why not squeeze a few extra dollars out of the programs people do want to watch?
 Meanwhile, several network programmers said that viewing levels on Friday evening are plummeting, putting it in danger of becoming the next Saturday. That may mean another repeat refuge is in the making.
 Repeats are now so customary on the schedule that some thought has been given to ways to jazz them up. For a time, Fox considered a pop-up version of ''Joe Millionaire'' when it ran repeats of that series, modeled after the pop-up videos on VH-1. NBC was pondering adding extra scenes and features to its Saturday night repeats of ''The Apprentice,'' making it into a sort of director's cut. 
 The hope was to catch the fancy of the audience attracted to television and movie DVD's for the extras offered.
 Neither idea went anywhere, mainly because the networks decided that spending extra money on repeats defeated the point of using them to amortize costs. But one executive at a television production studio said the idea made little sense anyway. The executive noted that the studio's research indicated that almost everyone who purchased a DVD of a television program paid no attention to the additional material and cared only about the program itself.
 They may have even watched it on Saturday night.

HEADLINE: European Labels Hope Piracy Succumbs to Digital Services

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
After several rocky years for the European music business, some of the biggest labels are hoping that the new digital music services can help stem the tide. 
 Apple Computer Inc. started its iTunes service in Britain, France and Germany last week, about a month after Roxio Inc.'s Napster opened in Britain. Sony's Connect service is preparing to join them in Britain, France and Germany by next week Wednesday. 
 The services are entering a market that has been damaged more by file-sharing than even the United States. In Germany, a country where illegal song-swapping and pirate CD's have reached epidemic proportions, sales in 2003 fell to $2 billion, a 20 percent decline from the previous year. Music sales in France fell 14 percent last year, and Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland all registered drops in double-digit percentages as well. 
 Increasingly music industry executives are pinning their hopes for a recovery on digital distribution technology. 
 ''There are definitely a lot of exciting opportunities for the industry online,'' said Helen Smith, deputy secretary general of Impala, a group based in Brussels that represents more than 1,800 independent record labels in Europe. 
 ''It is a shame that the major record labels were so slow to come around to realizing it,'' Ms. Smith said. ''In a way, that's one reason why they are in the trouble they're in.'' 
 About $17 million in songs were downloaded last year in Europe where the bulk of legal download Web sites are operated in partnership with On Demand Distribution, a pan-European online music store of which the musician Peter Gabriel is one of the founders. 
 All five of the world's biggest record companies -- Universal Music, the EMI Group, Sony Music, Warner Music and BMG -- and hundreds of independent labels have signed online music distribution deals with online retailers within the last six months, including iTunes, Napster and On Demand Distribution, which is known as OD2. These same companies are expected to sign deals with Sony's Connect service. 
 ''There is a light at the end of the tunnel,'' said Hartmut Spiesecke, a spokesman for the industry group Bundesverband der Phonographischen Wirtschaft, which is based in Berlin. ''The online market is very fast growing and the market for mobile music will be very interesting.'' 
 Still, many music labels have already been forced to stanch the bleeding in their European operations, cutting expenditures on music marketing and winnowing their repertoires of poorly selling artists. Back-office employees are being let go by the hundreds, while several smaller independents have been forced into bankruptcy proceedings.
 Sony Music and BMG, the music division of the German media group Bertelsmann, are hoping that their proposed merger can produce as much as $400 million in costs cuts to help them ride out what they see as a long-term changes in the industry. BMG has nonetheless warned of cuts in its work force in Germany of as much as 20 percent and said last week that it would not renew recording contracts for up to 60 percent of its German artists because their CD's had failed to sell more than 25,000 copies. 
 BMG's British rival, EMI Group, said in April that it would cull about 20 percent of its underperforming artists and lay off 1,500 employees worldwide. Warner Music, which this year was sold by Time Warner to a consortium of investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Thomas H. Lee Partners, began layoffs of about a quarter of its French employees just this month.
 ''This is not something that we can recover from very quickly,'' Mr. Spiesecke said. ''It will take years.'' 
 In France, the Culture Ministry has been enlisted to lobby the European Commission to classify music as a ''cultural good'' that should be exempt from value-added taxes, which average about 20 percent in most of Western Europe but can be as high as 70 percent in countries like Estonia. Other national governments, notably Britain and Spain, have also pushed for reductions in taxes on music. 
 Meanwhile, the music industry is suing scores of illegal music file-sharers in Europe for copyright infringement. In some instances, governments are pursuing individual and professional music pirates in criminal court. All of the efforts, analysts said, are likely to help slow the sales declines. 
 In North America, where Apple's iTunes service has been live for more than a year, there is some evidence to support optimism in the industry. In the six months ended Sept. 30, 2003, total sales of CD's and digital music in the United States and Canada fell 7 percent from a year earlier, but from October 2003 to March 31, 2004, sales rose 4 percent year-on-year, according to estimates by EMI, the world's second-largest music label. 
 For now, online sales of CD's through vendors like Amazon.com continue to represent the bulk of Internet music sales, although the pace of growth is slowing. In 2003, global hard-format music sales stood at about $1.2 billion, about 92 percent of overall online music sales, according to the market researcher Informa Media. 
 With global production of digital music players expected to jump to 42 million by 2008 from 14 million units in 2003, downloads will soon be the norm. In fact, an estimated $90 million worth of music was sold worldwide through legitimate music download sites last year, Informa Media says. That figure is expected to more than double to $187 million this year and to reach $1.83 billion by 2008. 
 In Europe, OD2 claims 830,000 registered users and says an average of 500,000 songs are purchased on its sites each month, for a total of around 5 million downloads since it went live in 2002. By comparison, Apple, whose chief executive is Steven P. Jobs, says iTunes users in the United States have bought more than 85 million tracks since the service began in April 2003 -- an average of more than 6.5 million songs a month. 
 Daren Siddall, a media analyst at Gartner G2 in London, said that with the rise in broadband Internet access and more sophisticated cellphone services, a growing share of consumers have access to the basic infrastructure for downloading and playing music. 
 ''We know there is a huge demand out there,'' Mr. Siddall said. ''Interest levels are very high -- around 60 percent to 70 percent -- and there is a clear willingness to pay'' for the services, he said. 
 Osman Eralp, an economist at Spectrum Ventures, a consulting firm in London, said, ''If the industry doesn't adapt, clearly they will continue to lose market share'' to other electronic forms of entertainment like DVD's and games.

HEADLINE: The Best of Times, and the Worst, for Two Tourist Towns

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
With a name like that, one would think this town would have no trouble attracting tourists. 
 After all, Victoria Falls, the town, is cheek-by-jowl with Victoria Falls, the waterfall -- a jaw-dropping, heart-stopping torrent one mile wide and 300 feet high, its constant roar audible for a mile or more, its towering cloud of spray visible from the farthest horizon. Mere words do not do justice to Victoria Falls. One must see it to appreciate it. 
 Where better to start to see the waterfall than Victoria Falls, the town? 
 Until lately, the answer was ''nowhere.'' In the contest for falls-hungry tourists, Victoria Falls towered over its only rival, Livingstone, just across the broad Zambezi River in Zambia. Lively Vic Falls embraced everyone from backpackers to jet-setters; bungee-jumpers to golfers. Livingstone, disheveled and sedentary, had some historic cachet: it is named after the explorer David Livingstone, the first European to see the falls. But for tourists, it was an afterthought. 
 Then Zimbabwe imploded. And the tables turned. 
 Suddenly, prosaic Livingstone is hot, jamming visitors into new four-star hotels and river's-edge lodges, bursting with upscale craft and souvenir shops, clubs and casinos.
 Victoria Falls is not. ''There's just no one coming here,'' a disconsolate businessman said, a conclusion borne out by even a brief stroll in the deserted shopping district. 
 Since early 2000, when squatters began occupying that nation's white-owned farms in what would become a wholesale seizure of commercial farmland, tourism in Zimbabwe has hit the skids. Things grew worse in 2002, after President Robert G. Mugabe was re-elected in balloting marred by widespread violence. It deepened further last year, as inflation roared past 600 percent and fuel shortages became pervasive. 
 In truth, Zimbabwe's violence and repression have largely passed by Victoria Falls. The region is so solidly in the camp of Mr. Mugabe's political opponents -- and such an important source of scarce hard currency -- that the government has avoided measures seen in other opposition centers, like the invasions of pro-government youth militia, which might scare tourists away. 
 But Zimbabwe's reputation has grown increasingly ugly, especially among tourists from members of the Commonwealth nations, mostly former British possessions. Mr. Mugabe quit the Commonwealth in December after it refused to lift its suspension of Zimbabwe in protest of the nation's human rights policies. 
 One hotelier in Victoria Falls, who refused to be identified for fear of retaliation, said tourist traffic from Europe and the United States has been little affected by Zimbabwe's turmoil, but that visits from commonwealth nations have all but dried up. Some tour agencies in some Commonwealth nations have removed Zimbabwe from their lists, one South African agent said, and replaced it with package trips to Zambia. 
 During a recent visit to the Zambian side of Victoria Falls, Mike Carter, a New Zealand appraiser on vacation with his family, emerged raincoat-clad from the falls' drenching mist and said, ''We never considered coming to Victoria Falls,'' the town. ''We wouldn't bother going 'til they sort things out.'' 
 Zimbabwe's loss has been Zambia's gain. Livingstone's hotel occupancy has jumped since 2000, to 50 percent from an average of 36 percent, despite a brace of new hotels. 
 The contrast with Victoria Falls could hardly be more stark. Zimbabwe businessmen say average hotel occupancy runs between 20 and 30 percent, and some of the bigger four-and five-star resorts have severely pared their staff to keep from closing. The world-famous grand dame of local hostelries, the Victoria Falls Hotel, marked its centennial in June with hallways of empty rooms despite an effort to lure celebrants with a 100th-birthday package. 
 The plight of merchants is, if anything, bleaker. Souvenir shops on the main street to Victoria Falls sometimes pass the entire day without ringing up a single sale, one vendor said. Some wholesalers and street vendors have given up and moved their operations to Zambia, prompting a government minister to denounce them as unpatriotic in a recent meeting with the town's beleaguered businessmen. 
 Things could change, of course: longtime residents remember that Vic Falls prospered most in the 1970's, when Zambia's economic policies drove that nation and its Livingstone tourism business close to ruin.
 In the meantime, merchants and hotel operators might take a tip from a Zimbabwe tourism Web site, www.go2africa.com/zimbabwe, and try to turn their bitter plight into tourism lemonade. 
 Zimbabwe's national parks ''are completely safe to visit, as they are far from the cities where the instability exists,'' the site says. ''Game lodges are desperate for occupants, so prices are extremely competitive. 
 ''And low lodge occupancy means you'll have thousands of hectares of pristine game country virtually all to yourself.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Quietly Spending $2.5 Billion From Iraqi Oil Revenue to Pay for Iraqi Projects

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20 

 BODY:
Struggling with bureaucratic problems in spending the money appropriated by Congress to rebuild Iraq, American authorities are moving quietly and quickly to spend $2.5 billion from a different source, Iraqi oil revenue, for projects employing tens of thousands of Iraqis, especially in the country's hot spots, Bush administration officials say.
 The spending program, which was started unannounced, has been undertaken in consultation with Iraqi ministers, despite misgivings that the oil revenue belonged to Iraq and that it should be set aside for use when Iraq's sovereignty is restored, scheduled for June 30.
 Because of deteriorating security and complex delays in contracts that have slowed the spending of the $18 billion in Congressionally appropriated money, occupation authorities say they decided recently that they had to spend the Iraqi money to build schools, factories and oil fields, and to turn Iraqis away from violence.
 ''The security needs were just overwhelming,'' said an occupation official. ''Would we rather have been able to save the money and have a nice kitty? Sure. There's always a tension between putting money to work right away and having it available for a tough year next year. This is the way we resolved it.'' 
 Bush administration officials say they believe that the spending program has helped stabilize Iraq, although most note that negotiated arrangements allowing insurgent groups to operate peacefully in Falluja, Karbala, Najaf and other troubled areas also have aided in reaching that goal.
 Iraq's overall domestic budget of roughly $20 billion for 2004, financed mostly by oil revenue, was approved last year by the Program Review Board, a unit of the Coalition Provisional Authority -- the American-led occupation authority in Iraq.
 But this spring, Bush administration officials said, it became clear that rising global oil prices were presenting Iraq with a windfall, and a decision had to be made about whether to save that extra money or disburse it in a one-time expenditure that might not be available in the 2005 budget. 
 American occupation officials said the $2.5 billion had helped pay for security needs like police cars and uniforms, as well as repairs of schools, power grids, oil fields, state-owned factories and other sources of employment. Additional funds have been used for vocational training for young Iraqis ''to get some of these kids off the streets, doing something productive for the future,'' an occupation official said.
 Some of the money has gone to American military teams operating since the beginning of the occupation 14 months ago. The teams have become famous in Iraq for the way they have spread across the country, commissioning repairs and paying for them from satchels bulging with $100 bills shipped by plane from a Federal Reserve vault in East Rutherford, N.J. Much of that money came from Iraqi assets frozen in the United States during the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
 At least $1 billion has been distributed in this fashion -- by some estimates more than $2 billion.
 ''The military commanders love that program, because it buys them friends,'' said an administration official, referring to the cash distribution. ''You want to hire everybody on the street, put money in their pockets and make them like you. We have always spent Iraqi money on that.''
 The $2.5 billion to be spent from Iraqi oil funds has several components, the biggest of which is $1 billion to be spent on 15 to 21 military or security projects around the country. The rest of the money is to be used for vocational training, infrastructure repair, principally in the oil and electricity sectors, and increased supplies of food. A small amount has been set aside for future compensation of victims of Saddam Hussein's government and displacement since the occupation began.
 A principal goal is to employ Iraqis and compensate for the shortfall in financing that was supposed to have come from American sources.
 One reason for distributing cash for quick gains, some administration officials say, is that controls on the $18 billion appropriated by Congress last fall to rebuild Iraq may make it harder to operate in that fashion, so policy makers have decided to use what they have before the formal end of the occupation, now scheduled for June 30.
 Early last fall, L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Baghdad, said he hoped that most of the $18 billion would be spent by the time sovereignty was transferred.
 In November, however, the transfer of sovereignty was accelerated. Meanwhile, what was intended as a spending program to showcase the benefits of the American occupation has been slow in functioning because of security problems and cumbersome contracting regulations.
 Of the $18 billion appropriated by Congress, the American occupation has made spending ''commitments'' of $7.7 billion, with the hope of reaching $10 billion by the time Iraq officially regains self-rule on June 30. But these figures simply represent money that is reserved or to be reserved for certain purposes. Only $3.2 billion in contracts for actual construction projects have been awarded, although the number could rise before June 30.
 A senior administration official said that, contrary to early hopes, it would probably take five years to use up the $18 billion.
 ''The expectations for spending were unrealistic,'' said the official said. ''You can't just pull 2,300 projects off the shelf and build them without vetting. It takes time to figure out if you're going to build a power plant, where it should be and who should build it.''
 Another problem has been a lag in donor countries coming forward with the money they had pledged last September at a donors' conference in Madrid. Of $13 billion pledged then, less than $2 billion has been received.
 ''Donor countries can see that the money that is already there is not being spent, because they can't spend it,'' said a development official involved in that fund-raising effort. ''That removes the pressure on the donors to come through with the money they pledged.''
 More than a year ago, after the fall of Mr. Hussein, some conservatives in the Bush administration envisioned Iraq as a model for free enterprise, replacing the big money-losing state-owned industries in everything from petrochemicals to pharmaceuticals.
 Instead, the accelerated government-driven employment and construction projects are cementing Iraq's reliance on the state as its central economic engine, just as it had been under Mr. Hussein.
 ''Lots of people wanted to change this, and change that, and transform the economy of Iraq,'' said an administration official. ''But then we quickly realized that we had to put Humpty Dumpty back together first, and then give it over to the Iraqis and let them figure out the best way to change their country.''
 Accordingly, when sovereignty is transferred next week, Iraq will be what this official called ''a centralized socialist state'' on which virtually all citizens are dependent for basic needs, putting a particular burden on the fragile interim government selected less than three weeks ago.
 Of Iraq's eight million employed workers, for example, an estimated 700,000 work for the government directly, 400,000 work for state-owned enterprises, many of them operating in the red, and 200,000 work for various armed forces or security branches, a number expected to grow.
 But those numbers measure the equivalent of full-time employees, and some administration officials say that a more realistic number is two million Iraqis, one out of every four with a job, who are dependent on the state for employment.
 In addition to the tens of thousands of jobs to be created by the new oil-financed program, American officials say 1.5 million jobs will be generated by the Congressionally appropriated funds that are only now starting to be spent.
 Beyond these state programs, most Iraqis are given free or partially subsidized food, costing $4 billion this year. Electricity supplied at subsidized rates costs $1.7 billion, and the cost of distributing low-cost kerosene and other fuel to Iraqis is estimated at $3 billion to $5 billion.
 But occupation officials say the spending of money now to generate employment will revive state industries, so that in the future they can be privatized and serve as the country's economic base.
 ''All the programs we have started have the full support of the Iraqi ministries of planning and finance,'' said an occupation official. 
 ''There are two ways of looking at this,'' the official said. ''First is the absolute need to find jobs for millions of young people who need training. But second is to increase the capacity of companies and of the oil infrastructure to become healthy and employ more Iraqis in the future.''

HEADLINE: Malpractice Myths

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The power brokers obsessed with tort reform really have the jargon down. They travel the country with overheated stories about runaway juries and jackpot justice. The way they tell it, sinister lawyers and opportunistic plaintiffs are on the hunt, preying on virtuous corporations, hospitals and doctors in search of that big payout from the lawsuit lottery.
 President Bush has been complaining about ''junk and frivolous'' lawsuits for years. So it's interesting to hear the following from the Center for Justice and Democracy, a consumer advocacy group: 
 ''It may be hard to understand why 'tort reform' is even on the national agenda at a time when insurance industry profits are booming, tort filings are declining, only 2 percent of injured people sue for compensation, punitive damages are rarely awarded, liability insurance costs for businesses are minuscule, medical malpractice insurance and claims are both less than 1 percent of all health care costs in America, and premium-gouging underwriting practices of the insurance industry have been widely exposed.''
 In looking at medical malpractice cases, I've been amazed by the cold-blooded attitude so many people have taken toward patients who have been seriously, and sometimes grotesquely, harmed. Referring to a Wisconsin woman who had both of her breasts removed after a laboratory mix-up mistakenly indicated she had cancer, a doctor from South Carolina told a Congressional subcommittee:
 ''She did not lose her life, and with the plastic surgery she'll have breast reconstruction better than she had before.''
 Last week I interviewed a woman in Minerva, Ohio, whose abdominal aorta was somehow ruptured while a doctor was performing a tubal ligation. In a discussion of her malpractice suit, the woman, Deborah Rayburn, said the foul-up was not immediately detected. When it became clear that she was in serious trouble, another doctor was called in. ''He ended up cutting me open,'' she said, ''and he clamped the aorta.''
 Ms. Rayburn, who has two children, was unable to work for 18 months. The surgery left her with a scar from chest to groin, and she said she still experiences frequent abdominal pain.
 When Ms. Rayburn filed suit, she said, she was made to feel as though she had done something wrong, as if seeking compensation was in some sense an affront to the system.
 As a trial date approached, she said, she felt pressured by all the parties involved to agree to a settlement, which she did. She would have preferred to go to trial, she said, not because she was looking for a big payday, but because all the details of her case would then have come out publicly.
 And that is one of the essential points that is overlooked by the tort reform zealots: the problem when it comes to malpractice is not the amount of money the insurance companies are making (they're doing fine) or the rates the doctors have to pay, but rather the terrible physical and emotional damage that is done to so many unsuspecting patients who fall into the hands of careless or incompetent medical personnel.
 What is needed is a nationwide crackdown on malpractice, not a campaign to roll back the rights of patients who are injured. This is another utterly typical example of the Bush administration going to bat for those who are economically and politically powerful against those who are economically and politically weak.
 Despite claims by the insurance industry, there is no evidence that soaring malpractice premiums are the result of sharp increases in the amounts of money paid out for malpractice claims. And, tellingly, industry executives are generally careful not to say that the tort reforms sought by the Bush administration will result in premium reductions.
 This is all about greed. What tort reform will lead to, not surprisingly, is an unwarranted burst of additional profits for the insurance industry, which is why the industry is sinking so much money into its unrelenting campaign for ''reform.''
 It would be helpful if the nation's many good doctors would blow the whistle on the insurance industry and its exploitive practices, and on the members of their own august profession who violate that essential maxim, ''First, do no harm.''

HEADLINE: IRAQ GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS USING EMERGENCY RULE

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS and SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 20 

 BODY:
Faced with violent resistance even before it has assumed power, Iraq's newly appointed government is considering imposing a state of emergency that could involve curfews and a ban on public demonstrations, Iraqi officials said Sunday.
 In his first news briefing here, Prime Minister Iyad Allawi offered no details of what emergency rule might include, only that a committee of cabinet members had been appointed to consider the issue.
 Dr. Allawi, who worked closely with the Central Intelligence Agency in opposing Saddam Hussein's government in the 1990's, said he would consider ''human rights principles and international law,'' but made clear that he intended to act quickly and forcefully against the insurgency, using extraordinary methods if necessary.
 ''We will do all we can to strike against enemy forces aiming at harming our country, and we will not stand by with our hands tied,'' Dr. Allawi said. ''The Iraqi people are determined to establish a democratic government that provides freedom and equal rights for all its citizens. We are prepared to fight and, if necessary, die for the cause.'' 
 Among the places where such measures could be applied include the city of Falluja, where United States forces have been battling guerrilla fighters for several weeks, and Sadr City, the restive eastern slum in Baghdad, where three Iraqis were killed Sunday in confrontations with the First Infantry Division.
 Among the emergency rule provisions being considered are a curfew, a ban on public demonstrations, checkpoints to control public movement and changes to search and seizure laws, two cabinet members said in separate interviews on Sunday evening.
 It remains unclear whether such measures would bring significant changes in the lives of ordinary Iraqis. Under the United States-led occupation, occupation and Iraqi soldiers and security forces have been allowed to conduct raids without warrants, make arrests without charges, and hold suspects in detention indefinitely.
 If some sort of emergency rule is imposed, it is possible that this situation could persist. Iraq's new leaders have yet to work out the exact nature of their cooperation with the American military in the coming months, particularly on such issues as offensive operations and house-to-house searches.
 However, Iraqi officials have often criticized American forces for the way they have conducted themselves here over the past 15 months. A frequent complaint of Iraqi leaders is that the Americans often alienate ordinary Iraqis by searching the wrong homes and detaining the wrong people.
 The Iraqi leaders have said they know far better who the insurgents are. The restoration of sovereignty here on June 30 may give those leaders an opportunity to take the counterinsurgency in another direction.
 Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, said the potential measures were prompted by a tide of attacks by ''global terrorists'' as well as Hussein loyalists who, as he put it, ''will not let the country go through the transitional process towards democracy peacefully.''
 ''They will try to derail the political process,'' Mr. Rubaie said. ''It is our responsibility to protect our people from these terrorists. If you bear all this in mind, then some sort of exceptional rules, if you like, need to be adopted to deal with the exceptional circumstances.''
 Interior Minister Falah al-Naqib said he hoped that if emergency rule were imposed, it would happen only in particularly fractious areas and for no more than two to three weeks at a time. He also hinted at the delicate political balance that the interim government must strike, between winning the confidence of ordinary Iraqis and crushing what has already proven to be a powerful armed resistance.
 ''We have disturbances in the whole country, but many areas could be controlled very easily, and others will be a little more difficult,'' Mr. Naqib said. ''But also we have to work politically with many groups. We don't want to use force very much. If we have to use it with certain terrorists like Al Qaeda or anyone else, then we will not hesitate to use it.''
 Neither he nor other officials would say when a decision would be made about emergency rule.
 The head of the Iraqi bar association, Kamal Hamdoon Mulla Allaw, said he hoped that such measures would be imposed only for a short period. Hamza al-Kafi, of the Iraqi Human Rights Society, said he too hoped that any such measures would be limited in scope and time and that they would not be used for political advantage.
 As the transfer of sovereignty approaches, insurgents have stepped up attacks on interim government officials and security forces.
 On Sunday morning, the interior minister's house in Samarra was attacked and four bodyguards were killed. Last Thursday, a car bomb ripped through an army recruitment center in Baghdad, killing at least 41 people. Dozens of local officials and many senior members of the government in Baghdad have been assassinated.
 Prime Minister Allawi also announced a significant expansion of the Iraqi Army and its rededication toward internal threats. The army, which currently has about 3,000 soldiers, would take control of more than 37,500 troops who make up the existing Iraqi Civil Defense Corps as part of a new National Guard.
 Together with the new Iraqi antiterrorism force now being trained here, the armed forces available to combat insurgents could total more than 60,000 soldiers.
 The decision to use the army against the insurgency represents a change to American policy, which had intended the force to be directed against foreign threats and, most important, to be small. American policy makers had wanted to ensure that the Iraqi Army, which has played a significant role in shaping the country's political history, could be kept out of domestic politics.
 Dr. Allawi acknowledged that concern but said the extraordinary circumstances presented by the insurgency demanded a special response. He said that for the ''foreseeable future,'' the army would be fighting insurgents, rather than guarding borders.
 ''Our army's priority will continue to be national defense,'' he said. ''However, in these difficult times, substantial elements of the army will have to assist in the struggle against internal threats against national security.''
 The reconstitution of the army amounts to another step away from the American decision of spring 2003 to dissolve the Iraqi Army. That decision has been roundly criticized, by Dr. Allawi and others, as having contributed to the insurgency by pushing thousands of young men with military training into unemployment.
 In response to that criticism, American officials announced last month that they would begin rehiring higher-level army officers who had earlier been banned from serving in the armed forces.
 ''Disbanding the Iraqi Army was a big mistake,'' Dr. Allawi said. ''We are fixing the mistakes of the Americans, aren't we?''
 Together, redirecting the army toward internal threats and possibly imposing emergency rule illustrated the grim choices Dr. Allawi and his cabinet feel they have to make in their early days in office.
 Dr. Allawi said the United States had agreed ''in principle'' to transfer custody of Iraqis suspected of involvement in the insurgency and for criminal acts to the Iraqi government after June 30.
 He offered a vigorous vision of combating the guerrilla insurgency, which he said was ''systematically destroying the country.''
 ''The enemy we are fighting is truly evil,'' he said. ''They have nothing to offer the Iraqi people except death and destruction.''
 He appealed to foreign countries to help protect the United Nations staff members who would be working in the country to prepare for elections later this year or early next.
 Meanwhile, Moktada al-Sadr, the young Shiite cleric who led an uprising against the American occupation, has been invited to attend a national conference that will select a quasi-legislature to advise the interim government, Agence France-Press reported Sunday.
 The invitation appears to be part of a broader effort to bring Mr. Sadr into the political mainstream. His insurgent force, the Mahdi Army, took heavy losses from American forces over the past three months, but Mr. Sadr soared in popularity, according to recent opinion polls. 
 The council that will be selected during the national conference will have a wide array of powers, including authority to approve the national budget and to question ministers.

Although former President Ronald Reagan died over a weekend, many Americans apparently waited until they got back to work to follow the news online.
 Nielsen/NetRatings found that Mr. 
Reagan's funeral was a substantial factor in driving 54 percent of American office workers to news and current affairs Web sites last week. Traffic to the New York Post's Web site rose by 123 percent, with Mr. Reagan's funeral being the top story for 58 percent of its visitors. Additionally, the White House Web site also saw a substantial boost in traffic.
 But as news events go, Greg Bloom, a senior analyst at Nielsen/NetRatings, said the former president's death had relatively little impact on Web traffic.
 ''This wasn't an earth shattering, Web-centric event,'' Mr. Bloom said.
 But Mr. Bloom said that the numbers reflect a tendency among Web users to visit news and current affairs sites when they are on the job. By contrast, one of the sites that saw the biggest gains last week in visits from home Internet users was NASA's. Its 43 percent increase was apparently prompted by the transit of Venus. IAN AUSTEN

 I am not aware of any good evidence supporting Juan Williams's wish that what he calls enthusiasm among African-American churches ''about the president's faith-based initiative'' is translatable into Republican votes.
 After all, the federal resources available through the faith-based initiative are minuscule relative to the broad-based social needs of working-class and middle-class African-Americans.
 Mr. Williams appears unaware of the devastating effect on African-Americans of the loss of millions of jobs on President Bush's watch.
 Today, double-digit unemployment for African-Americans is back with a vengeance, hitting African-Americans in the 18-to-30 age bracket especially hard, the bracket in which Mr. Williams believes that President Bush can fish for votes with confidence.
 While a serious bipartisan growth among African-American voters will materialize one day, African-Americans are more politically savvy about when to make such a move than Juan Williams's curious belief that President Bush's re-election bid is the time to do so.

HEADLINE: Wachovia Moves to Buy Big Lender In Alabama

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
The Wachovia Corporation is close to a deal to acquire the SouthTrust Corporation for at least $11.5 billion, according to people involved in the transaction.
 The deal, which would continue a longstanding consolidation trend in banking, is expected to be announced as early as today, though people close to the negotiation cautioned that the talks could still fall apart. The purchase would expand Wachovia's already substantial footprint in the South, which is home to one of the nation's fastest-growing regional economies.
 Wachovia, with assets of $411 billion, has been an aggressive acquirer in recent years and ranks as the country's fourth-largest bank by asset size. SouthTrust, with about $53 billion in assets, is based in Birmingham, Ala., but has a large franchise in Florida. 
 Wachovia, based in Charlotte, N.C., has a total stock market valuation of about $62 billion, while SouthTrust is worth about $11.5 billion. Bank acquisitions typically carry a 20 percent to 30 percent premium over the market value of the acquired entity -- meaning that SouthTrust may be sold for more than $14 billion. The exact value of the transaction could not be determined yesterday.
 Wachovia and SouthTrust representatives were unavailable for comment yesterday. G. Kennedy Thompson, Wachovia's 53-year-old chief executive, is a highly regarded banker known for his patience and financial discipline. 
 At the First Union Corporation, a Wachovia predecessor, he orchestrated the purchase of Wachovia three years ago and has ample experience in an area that is still new and somewhat mysterious to many regional retail bankers: capital markets. Mr. Thompson oversaw First Union's investment banking franchise before becoming the bank's chief executive, and he recently led Wachovia's acquisition of Prudential Financial's brokerage operation.
 But retail banking, in which Wachovia excels, remains the soul of Wachovia's franchise and the SouthTrust purchase is clearly geared toward expanding an already robust retail business. If the acquisition does not lead to a drag on Wachovia's earnings, it will enhance Wachovia's presence in several important retail markets, particularly Florida. 
 Florida, which has an ever-growing population of retirees with disposable income and is one of the country's most important state economies, is an attractive market for any bank. 
 A combination of Wachovia and SouthTrust would be almost even with the Bank of America Corporation in Florida in terms of deposits under management. Bank of America manages more than $50 billion in deposits in Florida, making it the biggest operator there.
 While cultural issues like executive control and layoffs are thorny matters in mergers, management battles are unlikely in this transaction. Wallace D. Malone Jr., SouthTrust's chief executive, 67, is not likely to present a succession threat to Mr. Thompson. 
 Wachovia, which contended with unpleasant issues when it acquired the CoreStates Financial Corporation several years ago, including flagging employee morale and a rapid loss of customers disgruntled about poor service, has become much more sensitive about such matters. It could not be determined yesterday if the merger would involve sizable layoffs. Wachovia has more than 85,000 employees, while SouthTrust has more than 12,000.
 SouthTrust just completed its own acquisition of FloridaFirst Bancorp Inc. in May and its shares rose 4 percent last Wednesday amid speculation that it might be a takeover target. The stock settled down by the end of the week, closing up just 9 cents, to $34.80 in trading Friday on the Nasdaq stock market. That was just shy of its 52-week high of $35.22.
 Other Southern banks were also at the center of takeover speculation last week, including Compass Bancshares Inc., which is also based in Birmingham. Its shares closed down slightly on Friday to $41.81.
 Wachovia's shares closed up 8 cents, to $47 in trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Preserving Today's Voices for Tomorrow's Fans

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH Major League Baseball abandoned Fay Vincent, the former commissioner, he has not abandoned baseball. He has quietly undertaken a project to record the oral histories of former players and other significant figures within the sport for the Hall of Fame.
 In what had to be a fascinating conversation, Vincent last month interviewed Marvin Miller, the former chief of the players union, whom most other management people avoid. ''He's 87,'' Vincent said. ''I wanted to preserve his version of the start of the union, the Flood case and the Messersmith arbitration. His stories about those are critical. He talked about the 1981 strike at great length.'' 
 The Curt Flood case, which went to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Andy Messersmith-Dave McNally arbitration, which created free agency, were the major milestones on the path to freedom of movement for players and the unparalleled escalation of their salaries. Aside from perhaps Branch Rickey, who brought Jackie Robinson to previously all-white baseball, Miller had a greater impact on the game than anyone. Unlike Hall of Fame voters last year, Vincent recognized his importance. 
 In the interview, Vincent said Miller also talked about growing up in New York, working for the war-production board during World War II and as an economist for the steelworkers, before moving to baseball in 1966. 
 ''He was very interesting,'' Vincent said. ''We could've gone on another couple of hours. I think we were both aware it was unusual for us to be doing this.''
 But they found at least one view in common, Vincent said. ''Looking at the 30 years of labor history,'' Vincent said he told Miller, ''one of the things we can agree with was the quality of legal work done for the union was far superior to the quality of legal work done for the owners.'' 
 Vincent said part of Miller's success lay in his strategy of taking an economic fight and making it a moral issue. ''He made the players the good guys and the owners the bad guys,'' the former commissioner said.
 In the interview, Vincent said, Miller talked about the 1976 negotiations that followed the Messersmith decision and produced the free-agency system.
 ''Miller was petrified at Charlie Finley's idea of making everyone a free agent every year,'' Vincent said. ''He stayed awake nights. He said: 'How could we have argued with total freedom? It would've been like putting blacks back into slavery.'''
 Vincent, who resigned under pressure in 1992 when the owners were gearing up for a labor fight with the players, began his project about five years ago, funded by the investment banker Herbert Allen. 
 ''I heard tapes of the Larry Ritter interviews with players who played at the turn of the century,'' Vincent said in reference to Ritter, who turned those interviews into the acclaimed 1966 book, ''The Glory of Their Times.'' ''What he did was spectacular,'' Vincent said of Ritter, who traveled 75,000 miles in a five-year period to get his interviews on reel-to-reel tape recorders. ''I wondered if anyone was doing anything with more recent players.''
 Vincent said he has interviewed about 35 players and executives, using videotape. Larry Doby, the first black player in the American League, was Vincent's first interview; his most recent was Don Baylor, the Mets' new hitting coach, whom he interviewed yesterday. 
 In between, the roster has included Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Tommy Henrich, Ralph Kiner, Tom Seaver, Eldon Auker, Johnny Pesky, Robin Roberts, Ralph Branca, Bob Feller, Duke Snider, Buck O'Neil, Connie Johnson, Slick Surratt, Warren Spahn, Bill Rigney and Joe Black, ''who was great on racism in baseball when he started.''
 ''I have Doby talking about his first day in the majors,'' Vincent said. ''I have Whitey talking about the Copacabana, Yogi about D-Day and what it was like off Omaha beach, Warren Spahn talking about some wonderful times with Ted Williams. Of all the ones we did, Spahn might have been the most remarkable because he was so thoughtful.''
 His interview with Berra did not elicit any Yogiisms, but Vincent said he heard one first-hand in another setting. They were at Doby's funeral last June, and Vincent was sitting between Berra and Ralph Branca.
 ''It's nice of you to come, Yogi,'' Branca said to Berra.
 Berra replied: ''You know why I go to funerals? If I don't go to yours, you won't go to mine.''
 ''He said it,'' Vincent said. ''I heard it.''
 Next on his interview list, Vincent hopes, are Stan Musial and Phil Rizzuto.
 ''We never got Williams,'' Vincent added. ''DiMaggio turned me down. I regret not getting them. Mays turned me down because he sold video rights to his life story. DiMaggio said his lawyer told him not to.''
 Vincent said he envisioned people 50 years from now going to the Hall of Fame and watching the tapes. ''Push a button,'' he said, ''and see Marvin Miller talking for three or four hours. That's precious stuff.''
 Vincent taped several former Negro League players, including Double Duty Radcliffe, a catcher, who played in the 1930's and '40's
 ''He talks about playing against Ty Cobb, who was one of the worst racists of all time,'' Vincent related. ''Cobb is batting and says 'You'll never throw me out.' He gets on first, tries to steal second and Radcliffe throws him out.'' 
 The next time Cobb came to bat, Vincent said, he told Radcliffe that he was a good catcher, but that he was still black. 
 ''Double Duty didn't care for Cobb,'' Vincent added.

HEADLINE: California Thieves Prey On Farms' Diesel Fuel

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif., June 18 

 BODY:
Country living for the Nilmeier family has gotten a lot less charming these days. 
 ''Now I can get a clear shot from my bedroom window at whoever is ripping me off,'' said Keith Nilmeier, pointing to a 450-watt industrial light mounted atop a wooden pole near his barn. And ''I don't come to the door at night without a .357 Magnum in hand.''
 Mr. Nilmeier has yet to fire a shot since putting up his new night light, but thieves be warned: this fourth-generation farmer has had enough. In the last year or two, a pair of big rigs, three pickups and an assortment of tools have been stolen from him. And most recently, in the crime du jour of rural California, hundreds of gallons of diesel fuel have been siphoned from a storage tank in his peach orchard. 
 While drivers in Los Angeles and San Francisco bemoan some of the highest gasoline prices in the country, farmers like Mr. Nilmeier, in the big agricultural expanse in between, are striving to keep their tractors and harvesters running at all.
 ''Right now diesel is my highest cost aside from labor,'' Mr. Nilmeier said. ''It is even higher than insurance.'' 
 Diesel fuel stealing has quadrupled in the last several months here in Fresno County and in some other parts of the Central Valley, the nation's richest farming region and a land of plenty for thieves cashing in on spiraling prices. The price of diesel in California has risen 25 percent in the last year, according to the Department of Energy, turning it into the hottest black-market agricultural commodity around. Diesel here is now consistently over $2 a gallon, most recently 34 cents above the national average.
 ''The theft is really market driven and price driven,'' said William E. Yoshimoto, a supervising lawyer in the district attorney's office in Tulare County, southeast of here, who oversees a valleywide program to fight agricultural crime. ''You hope it is not someone stockpiling diesel fuel to make a bomb.''
 While there have been big diesel thefts in other states -- five people were arrested in April in Palm Beach County, Fla., for selling stolen farm diesel to truckers -- agricultural and law enforcement officials say California is in a category by itself. Diesel prices here are the highest; farmland extends across thousands of square miles, making it difficult to patrol; and there are untold buyers on the lookout for cheap fuel. 
 ''It seems things start on the West Coast, so unfortunately we're the trendsetter,'' said Debbie Jacobsen, a grape farmer who is president of the farm bureau in Fresno County, where agriculture is a $4-billion-a-year business. 
 In the first five and a half months of this year, the authorities estimate, thieves in the eight counties that make up the Central Valley have stolen 46,000 gallons of diesel fuel, 30 percent more than in all of last year. The amount stolen is small when measured against total diesel consumption in the valley; Mr. Nilmeier, whose family farms about 500 acres and also runs a small trucking company, stores 50,000 gallons on his property alone.
 But the loss of diesel is only the start of it. ''The cost to farmers is exponential beyond the cost of the fuel,'' said Sheriff's Lt. Jeffrey L. Johnson, commander of the Fresno County Agricultural Task Force. ''When a farmer has to shut down operations for 6 or 8 or 10 hours waiting for a shipment of fuel, he is losing money, slowing the harvest and delaying filling contracts.''
 The authorities say small-time criminals with nothing more than a pickup truck and a 55-gallon drum are draining farm equipment with garden hoses by the light of the moon, while big-time operators are hauling off 5,000 gallons at a time -- sometimes with a tank and trailer in tow. One farmer in San Joaquin County got so fed up with the thievery that he filled a fuel tank with water. It was stolen, too.
 In February, the police in Tulare County arrested a man in Porterville who has been charged with driving a stolen flatbed truck loaded with plastic drums of diesel fuel, about 950 gallons in all. The man, Jesus Sanchez, was apparently so unconcerned about being caught that the drums were not even covered.
 ''He was driving down the road sloshing diesel everywhere,'' said Sgt. Mike Renteria of the Tulare County Sheriff's Department.
 Pat V. Ricchiuti, a peach and almond farmer in Clovis, lost 800 gallons, a tank and a trailer to thieves last month. Perplexed as to how to avoid a repeat, Mr. Ricchiuti has resorted to removing the wheels and tires from his remaining trailers.
 ''The sheriffs tell me they found the same identical tire tracks of my stolen trailer at some of these other locations where fuel is being taken,'' he said. ''They're using my trailer to steal other fuel.''
 The diesel fuel situation has become so serious that at the Tulare County district attorney's office, Mr. Yoshimoto's group, the Agricultural Crime Technology Information and Operations Network, or Action, has made it a focus of dealings with the region's rural law enforcement agencies. The network, which is federally financed, has also placed surveillance equipment like motion sensors and cameras in remote areas considered particularly vulnerable.
 There have been a handful of arrests, but what frustrates many farmers is that so few thieves are being caught and that in all likelihood, the stealing is being tacitly encouraged by the fact that some farmers seem willing to buy the stolen fuel. A local state legislator has proposed stiffening the penalties for people convicted of stealing diesel, but Mr. Ricchiuti, the Clovis farmer, said that misses the point.
 ''It is kind of like prostitution, where you target the people who are the users and you then eliminate the supply,'' he said. ''We have to go after the people who are buying the stuff.''
 But the authorities acknowledge that as little as they know about the thieves, they know even less about the buyers. Much of the stolen fuel is so-called red diesel, meaning it has been dyed to indicate it is for agricultural purposes and is therefore taxed less than diesel for transport. Because of the stiff penalties truckers face if caught with it, law enforcement officials speculate that most of the stolen red diesel is probably going to other farms.
 Many farmers, however, also use clear diesel. The fuel stolen from both Mr. Nilmeier and Mr. Ricchiuti was clear, and so it had a far larger number of potential buyers.
 Ian Marty, a rural-crimes prosecutor in Tulare County, said some gas stations dispensed stolen diesel out the back door and truckers alerted one another to its availability though a special code on their CB radios. Thieves also frequent the back parking lots at truck stops, striking deals with drivers.
 Mr. Nilmeier, who has a hand in farming and trucking alike, does not doubt that there are customers in both industries. ''Economics,'' he said. ''It's tempting.''
 Though diesel prices have dipped somewhat in recent weeks, Mr. Nilmeier is not counting on the market's drying up any time soon. And even if it does, he says, the criminals will come looking for something else. He has embarked on an ambitious security offensive, which in addition to the 450-watt light includes new fencing and electric gates at his home and that of his elderly parents, a mile or so away.
 One morning this week his father, Glenn, showed up at the irrigation pump in the peach orchard where thieves had cut through a lock and drained about 500 gallons of diesel fuel. Leaning out the window of his pickup, the elder Mr. Nilmeier, stern-faced and blunt-spoken, said it was hard not to take the theft personally.
 ''When I got married 55 years ago, we were so broke we borrowed $250 to get married,'' he said. ''We made it. We made it honestly.''

HEADLINE: Brazil's Spreading Exports Worry Minnesota Farmers

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS 

 BODY:
When Cargill Inc. disclosed a plan in May to import Brazilian ethanol by way of Central America to avoid paying tariffs, Ron Obermoller, the president of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association, described it as an example of how ''some interests are helping Brazil pull ahead of us in our own game.''
 Much in the way that people in other areas in the United States are worried about the migration of technology jobs to India or manufacturing jobs to China, farmers in Minnesota are growing concerned that Brazil's power in global agricultural markets may be eclipsing that of the United States, threatening their livelihood. 
 The fact that it was Cargill, Minnesota's biggest company and the largest privately owned corporation in the United States, that had orchestrated the plan did little to soothe the nerves of Mr. Obermoller and other farmers in the state. Instead, they see Cargill, with $60 billion in annual revenue, as aggressively developing its activities in Brazil at their expense. 
 To be sure, concern over the growth of Brazil's farming industries is not limited to Minnesota, the seventh-largest exporter among the states of farm products, which ranks behind states like Iowa and Illinois in corn and soybean production.
 And it is not limited to corn and soybean farmers. Orange growers in Florida have suggested using spy satellites to track orange production in Brazil. Sugar producers in Louisiana and Florida vehemently oppose trade agreements that would open United States markets to Brazilian sugar. 
 Still, worries over Brazil have crystallized most strongly in Minnesota, partly because of the state's long tradition of actively following -- and sometimes leading -- trends in international agriculture.
 Farming newsletters regularly carry articles about Brazilian agriculture, deploring the smuggling of genetically modified soybeans in Brazil while farmers in the United States pay royalties for such seeds, and noting that a small number of farmers from Minnesota and other states have bet on Brazil by emigrating there to plant soybeans.
 ''It makes me sick to witness what Cargill has done,'' said Sever Peterson, a farmer who cultivates soybeans and corn outside Minneapolis. ''I have nothing against my counterparts in Brazil, but the way Cargill has done this is underhanded and, yes, very deceptive, even if it is legally O.K.'' 
 A spokesman for Cargill, Bill Brady, said that the company was aware of the criticism it had received over the ethanol project but that this had not deterred it from seriously considering the plan. ''The ethanol initiative is still in the discussion stages,'' he said.
 A recent surge in Brazil's output of agricultural products has advanced the issue of competition with Brazilian farmers to the forefront of public debate here in Minnesota and in other farming states. Last year, Brazil for the first time surpassed the United States as the world's largest exporter of soybeans, after already growing into the biggest exporter of sugar, coffee and orange juice and the nation with the largest commercial cattle herd. 
 Concerns over Brazil's influence in global markets have been gathering for some time. And Cargill's push into Brazil has come under criticism before -- for instance, in the late 1990's, when it imported soybeans from there into the United States. 
 But the company's latest ethanol project has brought new scrutiny to its normally circumspect operations and to Brazil's agricultural competitiveness in general. Ethanol, which can be made from most organic matter that ferments, is produced from corn in the United States and sugar in Brazil.
 Farmers and state officials in Minnesota have organized several trips to Brazil this year to assess the competition, something other American farmers had done before but generally without the involvement of state agricultural officials.
 ''Some of us are absolutely paranoid that Brazil will put us out of business,'' said Gene Hugoson, Minnesota's agriculture commissioner and the owner of a 650-acre soybean farm. ''Others choose to ignore it.
 ''My function is to get opinion somewhere in the middle,'' said Mr. Hugoson, who joined more than 20 officials on a tour of soybean-growing areas in Brazil in January. 
 Their worries have been sharpened by dispatches from Brazil that have appeared in local papers. A series in March in The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, the state's largest newspaper, said that Minnesota and other areas in the Midwest were on the cusp of losing their status as the world's breadbasket to frontier regions of western Brazil. A series later in The Chicago Tribune carried headlines that included ''Brazil Threatens U.S. Soybean Dominance; Midwest Farmers Scramble to Adjust.''
 Cargill, which has its headquarters in a 63-room replica of a French chateau outside Minneapolis, has steadily expanded its operations in Brazil, a country it entered nearly four decades ago and is now one of its largest sources of revenue outside the United States. Cargill accounts for about a quarter of sugar exports from Brazil, and has become a leader there in soybean crushing, orange juice and cocoa production, as well as the trading of commodity contracts in Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center.
 But it is Cargill's foray into ethanol exports that has really touched a nerve in Minnesota. Though Brazil is the world's largest ethanol producer, its exports to the United States have been restricted by a 54-cent-a-gallon tariff intended to shield domestic corn growers from relatively cheap imports. Yet with regulations for cleaner-burning gasoline taking effect this year in some states, the demand for ethanol -- which is considered less polluting than other fuel additives -- is soaring. 
 Ethanol production in the United States is expected to reach a record five billion gallons next year, up from about three billion this year, according to some estimates. Seeking to meet the demand, Cargill devised a plan, which is still under consideration, to build a dehydration factory in El Salvador that would convert Brazilian ethanol for use in American automobiles. 
 The attraction of El Salvador is its inclusion in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a program dating from the 1980's, that allows 7 percent of the ethanol used in the United States each year to be exempt from import duties if delivered from certain Central American or Caribbean countries. If Cargill goes ahead with the project, it could import as much as 230 million gallons of Brazilian ethanol, filling the entire 7 percent allowance.
 ''We're a significant investor in U.S. corn production, but we also recognize what is happening in Brazil,'' said Dan Dye, president of Cargill AgHorizons, a unit that advises farmers, including those producing corn for ethanol in the United States, on how to market their crops. ''Brazil has abundant resources and a lot of open land. Those are the economic realities.'' 
 Some Minnesota farmers regard such statements from the state's most powerful company and the expansion of Brazil's agricultural frontier as a very bad omen.
 Brazil is said to be clearing an area equivalent to the state of Maryland for new farms each year, and its trade diplomats have successfully pressed a series of complaints against American and European farm protection policies at the World Trade Organization. [In the latest case, the W.T.O. ruled on Friday that United States cotton subsidies violated international trade rules.] 
 ''Brazil is an enormous long-term concern,'' said Seth Naeve, a soybean agronomist at the University of Minnesota Extension Service. ''Eventually, they could evolve into an OPEC-like power with the ability to determine soybean prices around the world.'' 
 Brazilian farm leaders do not seem surprised, or concerned, by alarmist sentiments in Minnesota.
 ''Some of them don't even know yet if Brazil is to the north or south of Guatemala,'' Luiz Marcos Suplicy Hafers, a former president of the Brazilian Rural Society who met with a group of visiting officials from Minnesota early in 2004 in Brazil, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. ''They have good reason to worry.'' 
 In keeping with Minnesota's progressive traditions, efforts have also been made to engage the left-leaning administration of Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Seeking to hear about Brazil's programs to alleviate hunger, the University of Minnesota invited Mr. da Silva to inaugurate a series of lectures in honor of Orville L. Freeman, the Minnesotan who served as secretary of agriculture under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. But the invitation, which was extended to coincide with Mr. da Silva's trip to the United States to address the United Nations, was declined.
 ''If the thrust of global agriculture is shifting to Brazil we'd like to understand why, and having Lula here to explain his nation's ambitions would have been valuable,'' said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute, a nonprofit organization involved in inviting the Brazilian president to Minnesota. ''Unfortunately, we'll have to wait for another occasion.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. to Order That Funds Have Outsiders As Chairmen

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21 

 BODY:
Overcoming strong opposition from the mutual fund industry, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday will approve a regulation forcing most of the nation's fund companies to replace their board chairmen with outsiders who are independent, commission officials said Monday.
 The new regulation, which is expected to take effect in 18 months, will apply not just to fund companies that have figured in recent investigations, but giant firms that have not been named, including Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price Associates. 
 Industry analysts estimate that 80 percent of the nation's fund companies now have chairmen who are also senior executives and who will have to be replaced under the new rule.
 The new set of laws will also require that 75 percent of the directors be independent, up from 50 percent. The outside directors will have to hold quarterly meetings without fund executives, and each board will have to justify the fund managers it retains. 
 The changes in fund governance are a significant and controversial part of an overhaul of rules by the commission in recent months in response to the industry's problems. 
 The agency has already revised significant disclosure rules and forced the funds to adopt new ethics codes and to appoint compliance officers. Officials said the agency was planning to complete rules later this year limiting after-hours trading, requiring greater disclosure of some fees and regulating more closely the payments and other compensation from funds to brokerage firms that execute their trades.
 The agency has moved ahead of Congress, where a similar measure has sailed through the House of Representatives and other bills on the subject have been introduced in the Senate.
 In a speech on Sunday at Stanford Law School, William H. Donaldson, chairman of the commission, said the proposal ''solidifies the role of the fund board as the primary advocate for fund shareholders.''
 He said the new requirement for an independent board leader was needed to eliminate ''the inherent conflict of interest'' when a mutual fund chairman is also a senior manager. That person, he said, must serve as steward for both the fund's investors and for the shareholders of the fund's investment adviser.
 ''It is easy to see that these two duties are often in conflict,'' Mr. Donaldson said. ''For example, consider the conflict that necessarily arises when it comes to setting the level of fees the fund will pay the adviser.''
 Last week, seven former Republican and Democratic chairmen of the agency wrote a letter to the commission urging the adoption of the rule. But the provision has sharply divided the commission, with Mr. Donaldson, a Republican, siding with the two Democratic commissioners who have supported the rule. 
 The agency's two Republican commissioners, Cynthia A. Glassman and Paul S. Atkins, have not said how they will vote. But in both public and private settings, they have expressed strong reservations about the plan.
 Ms. Glassman, an economist, has said she has found little empirical data that supports the changes or that shows that the costs of the measure would outweigh its benefits. 
 Mr. Atkins has said that the funds could reduce conflicts by giving a greater role to lead outside directors. 
 Mr. Donaldson, and his two Democratic allies -- Harvey J. Goldschmid and Roel C. Campos -- say the changes in governance combined with other moves will go a long way toward restoring investor confidence in the industry.
 ''This is the pivotal proposal to make the board effective, and with the other things we've done, should provide for more protection for investors,'' Mr. Goldschmid said. ''Over all, this package will make a large difference.''
 The industry's trade association, the Investment Company Institute, has raised objections to the plan, and industry executives have noted that some of the abuses have occurred at fund companies, like Putnam Investments and Bank of America, whose boards were led by independent chairmen.
 Paul S. Stevens, the new president of the institute, said Monday that the industry had not opposed independent chairmen, but had sought to give each fund company the discretion to pick inside or outside candidates.
 ''We prefer the issue be left to the directors,'' he said. 
 Mr. Stevens said it was ''not apparent'' to him why publicly traded companies would have the flexibility of having a chairman from the senior ranks of management, while a mutual fund company would not. 
 He added that a change by the commission in the rules ''is not insignificant, but it is not a cataclysm that funds cannot make work.''
 Two other major proposals that are headed for final votes in the coming weeks have deeply divided the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency has set plans to vote in mid-July on a requirement that hedge funds file registration statements with the agency. That proposal has been questioned by Ms. Glassman and Mr. Atkins, but has had the support of Mr. Donaldson and the two Democratic commissioners.
 Less clear is how the commission will complete its work on a proposal to open proxy contests to candidates proposed by large shareholders as alternatives to the board's nominees. Earlier versions of the proposal have been sharply criticized by the Business Roundtable, an organization of chief executives from the nation's most prominent corporations, as well as the United States Chamber of Commerce. 
 Ms. Glassman and Mr. Atkins have questioned the proposal, while Mr. Goldschmid and Mr. Campos have endorsed it, officials said. Mr. Donaldson, who appeared to support the original proposal, has told officials at the commission that he would favor a compromise, but its contours remain unclear. 
 In his speech on Sunday, he complained that ''the escalating, shrill and fearful rhetoric on all sides of this issue has drowned out thoughtful discourse and comment.'' 
 He did not offer his solution to the agency's deadlock but suggested that the agency's deliberations were becoming complicated by the political season.
 ''That this is an election year doesn't help,'' he said. ''Politics must not be allowed to drive the public debate or the commission's deliberations on this matter or any other.''

HEADLINE: Charitable Giving Holds Steady, Report Finds

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Charitable giving was steady last year, as the stock market regained ground, the economy stabilized and employment prospects brightened.
 Americans gave an estimated $240.72 billion in 2003, a slight increase from the previous year, according to Giving U.S.A., an annual survey of charitable contributions published by the A.A.F.R.C. Trust for Philanthropy, a unit of the American Association of Fundraising Counsel, and compiled by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University.
 Estimated giving in 2003 equaled roughly 2.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, the fifth year since 1971 that charitable contributions exceeded 2 percent of the total output of goods and services.
 The increase was roughly equal to that from 2001 to 2002. Charitable giving hit $234.09 billion in 2002, a $6.83 billion downward revision from the trust's initial estimate, which had pegged giving at $240.92 billion. 
 ''This occurs despite rather unsettling times,'' said Henry Goldstein, chairman of the Giving U.S.A. Foundation, which released the survey. ''The economy is in what I would call partial recovery; there's a war, there's a threat of violence, there's a political campaign that is nasty, and yet philanthropy is really quite robust.''
 The data comes out on the eve of a major Congressional hearing on issues confronting the nonprofit sector, which may lead to changes in regulation. Charities have come under intense scrutiny by the news media and the public over the last two years, and some nonprofit leaders suspect that has discouraged giving.
 ''That we're in a holding pattern is frankly miraculous,'' said Robert L.E. Egger, founder of the D.C. Central Kitchen and author of the book ''Begging for Change.'' ''The institutional flaws in our system are coming to a head.''
 Mr. Egger said support for the kitchen had been stable while demand for its services had grown, not only from clients but also from other nonprofit groups seeking to replicate its programs. ''That also costs money, but people giving to us don't necessarily understand that,'' he said.
 The sector continues to struggle in part because the number of charities continues to rise at a faster pace than charitable giving. The Internal Revenue Service grants tax exemption to an average of 83 nonprofit groups a day.
 ''The competition is so fierce you have to get better at fund-raising or you'll get eaten alive by the local garden club,'' said Kurt Schermann, chief marketing and development officer for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the umbrella organization for 3,400 clubs nationwide.
 Contributions to the clubs totaled $1.1 billion in 2003, Mr. Schermann said, up from roughly $1 billion the previous year. He said giving from traditional sources like corporations, foundations and governments was largely flat, while giving from individuals propelled the increase.
 Last year, the organization tested a program to cultivate individual donors, called One Campaign, in 19 clubs. The program attracted 3,700 new donors, and the Boys and Girls Clubs plan to expand it this year and have it in place in all clubs by 2006.
 Mr. Schermann expects giving to remain stable or increase this year. Two recent dinners held to benefit the organization in New York and Dallas brought in $1.3 million and $1.7 million in profits, respectively. ''That's a pretty good sign that people are still giving,'' he said.
 Like the Boys and Girls Clubs, many nonprofits have tried to develop new ways to tap potential donors. The Ella Sharp Museum in Jackson, Mich., for instance, mounted its first major exhibition in 2003, Linda McCartney's ''Portraits of an Era.'' The exhibition drove changes in the museum's fund-raising efforts, attracting new members in late 2002 and providing valuable lessons in reaching out to national corporations for support, said Jeanne Donado, vice president for administration.
 ''We wanted to increase our visibility regionally and see if we could use an event to raise revenues,'' Ms. Donado said. ''It was successful, even though our timing was bad.''
 In late 2002, when the museum, which has a budget of roughly $1 million, began soliciting contributions from corporations, the economy had not yet picked up, and it did not meet its goals. It did, however, attract more sponsorship money than it ever had before, $40,000. ''People in New York will probably laugh at that, but our previous high was $10,000,'' Ms. Donado said.
 The museum, a historical site that features art exhibitions, also has raised almost $3 million of the $5 million it hopes to raise as part of a capital improvement campaign. 
 The United Way of America, the umbrella organization for 1,300 local United Ways, expects fund-raising through traditional workplace giving campaigns to decline by roughly 1.5 percent this year.
 But total cash giving to United Way organizations should rise by at least 1 percent, said Brian A. Gallagher, president and chief executive of the United Way of America. ''A lot more of the local organizations are engaging in housing and educational initiatives and offering them as separate giving options,'' Mr. Gallagher said. ''That's helping to offset declines in workplace giving, and it's the direction we want to go in.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about charitable contributions in 2003 misstated the surname of the chief marketing and development officer for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, who said competition for donations was fierce. He is Kurt Aschermann, not Schermann.

HEADLINE: Al Lapin Jr., a Founder of the IHOP Chain, Is Dead at 76

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Al Lapin Jr., who started the International House of Pancakes chain by opening a family-operated restaurant with his brother, Jerry, in 1958, died last Wednesday at the U.S.C./Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles.
 The cause was cancer, said a son, Randy. Mr. Lapin, 76, lived in the Century City section of Los Angeles. 
 The chain's first location, featuring extra-sweet recipes for waffles and pancakes tested in the kitchen of his mother, Viola, was in Toluca Lake in Los Angeles County. It was chosen in hopes of catching the overflow from a popular Bob's Big Boy restaurant nearby. 
 ''My mother Marilyn was the cashier and I was 4 months old, under the register in a bassinet,'' Randy Lapin said.
 IHOP, as the chain came to be known, grew with hundreds of franchised units, the sale of stock to the public and an assortment of food-related and other businesses. The pancake houses became known for their blue roofs and a policy of leaving a pot of coffee on the table. 
 Mr. Lapin also bought businesses, including the Orange Julius chain, Michael's Artist & Engineering Supplies, motels and business colleges.
 A New York native, Mr. Lapin studied filmmaking at the University of Southern California after Army service. He worked in television and produced films for a civil defense agency on surviving atomic attacks.
 His first food enterprise was Coffee Time, which supplied urns of hot coffee to offices. 
 Mr. Lapin was a stickler for attractive presentation, both personally and in food, his son recalled. ''He used to say, 'You have to look like a dollar to borrow a dime' and 'People eat with their eyes before they eat with their hands.''' 
 Julia Stewart, chief executive of the current IHOP company, a franchise chain with 55,000 employees and $1.7 billion in sales last year, said in a newsletter that Mr. Lapin ''took a seemingly simple idea'' and created a business much appreciated by people in 48 states and Canada. 
 But he lost control of his company in 1973. Earnings fell in an economic slowdown and credit dried up for franchise chains generally. Franchise holders argued in a lawsuit that they had been overcharged for supplies and equipment. The company changed some practices and earnings again declined.
 ''After eight years of impressive growth and earnings, we were clobbered by the recession of 1970 and 1971 and some of our own errors,'' Mr. Lapin said at the annual meeting in 1973.
 He tried some other businesses and eventually declared bankruptcy in 1989. 
 ''He rode the wave and experienced the crash,'' Randy Lapin said.
 Survivors include his wife, Yona, of Century City; his sons Randy, of Simi Valley, and Jeffrey, of the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles; a brother, Jerry, of Boulder, Colo. and three grandchildren. Marilyn Lapin, his first wife, lives in the Marina del Rey area of Los Angeles.

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:

AIR FARES DOWN -- After climbing slightly but steadily all year, average domestic fares at eight major United States airlines dropped 1.8 percent in May, according to the Air Transport Association. With overall domestic capacity expected to be up more than 10 percent this summer over last summer and low-cost carriers continuing to challenge bigger rivals for market share on competing routes, the sagging fares in May suggest that downward pressure could continue on summer domestic fares, industry analysts said. International fares, where there is no competition from low-cost carriers, have risen steadily all year, the trade group said.

FUEL PUMP BLUES -- Some airlines have been wailing that the surging cost of fuel has thwarted a return to profitability. But a new Unisys R2A Scorecard report questions their reasoning. ''Current fuel prices, in nominal dollars, are near but still below their all-time high'' just before the first Persian Gulf war in 1990, the report stated. When adjusted for inflation, current fuel prices are about half of what they were in 1981. ''For all carriers, because of their increasing fuel efficiency, fuel prices are steadily declining in relative importance'' compared with other operating costs, according to the report, which adds: ''Fuel price levels are not the cause of the current disastrous financial results posted by the large carriers. It follows, then, that lower fuel prices would not save the carriers.''

HIGHER HOTEL TABS -- Average room rates in domestic hotels will rise by 3 percent this year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. A big reason, it said, is a higher-than-anticipated proportion of business travelers to leisure travelers, who are more likely to be bargain hunters.

WORLD'S LONGEST FLIGHT -- Singapore Airlines will break its own record for the world's longest nonstop commercial flight when it begins service between Singapore and Newark next Monday. The 18-hour flight, which crosses the North Pole, will cover 10,357 miles. That is nearly 1,200 miles more than the existing record, the nonstop route between Singapore and Los Angeles that the airline began flying in February. To entice business travelers on those routes, Singapore configured new, ultra-long-range Airbus A340-500 aircraft with two cabin classes: executive economy, which has 117 seats with 37 inches of legroom, and its Raffles business class, with 64 seats that can fold down flat for conversion into 78-inch-long beds.

MORE AIRPORT ADS? -- Airport advertising, which includes everything from signs and billboards to corporate messages woven into departure lounge rugs, is a ''highly effective medium for reaching upscale Americans,'' according to a survey released yesterday by Arbitron Inc. Of the 92 million Americans who boarded airplanes in the last 12 months, 17 million are considered frequent fliers who tend to be ''affluent, well-educated and sophisticated consumers,'' Arbitron said. Diane Williams, an Arbitron research analyst, said that airport advertising provided an especially good opportunity for selling luxury goods and entertainment because it reaches ''upscale targets in a captive environment.''

FOREIGN VISITORS SURGE -- About 3.4 million foreign visitors traveled to the United States in April, representing a 28 percent increase over April 2003, the Commerce Department said yesterday. During the first four months of this year, 11.4 million foreign visitors arrived, an increase of 16 percent from the same period last year. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: City Unveils Gigantic Plan To Transform Far West Side

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration's plan to redevelop the far West Side of Manhattan would transform a neighborhood of brick warehouses, tenements and parking lots into a vibrant district of skyscrapers, 12,600 new apartments and 20 acres of parkland, according to a 6,000-page environmental impact study released by the city yesterday.
 The proposal, known as the Hudson Yards plan, would rezone a 40-block area west of Seventh Avenue between 30th and 42nd Streets and include a one-mile extension of the No. 7 subway line, an expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and a 75,000-seat football stadium over the adjacent railyards.
 Although the study acknowledged that traffic congestion would increase at more than 30 intersections in the district, it indicated that most problems could be mitigated. The city also rejected 18 alternative plans, including some proposed by community groups, saying they were impractical or generated fewer jobs and revenues for the city. 
 The benefits of creating a new district and allowing the city to grow outweigh any potential problems, the report concludes. It was prepared by the city's Department of City Planning and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 ''Hudson Yards is the single biggest investment we can make in our city's future, besides the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan,'' said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. ''It provides room in Midtown for the largest and most productive business district in the nation to grow, while creating the conditions for significant residential development.''
 The release of the environmental study triggers the beginning of a seven-month public review of what promises to be one of the most contested rezonings in city history. Despite the opposition of neighborhood groups and the local community board, the city government hopes to win formal approval in January.
 Most West Side groups were still wading through the dense report yesterday and not yet ready to comment.
 The $1.4 billion expansion of the convention center has fairly broad support from Community Board 4 and the hotel and tourism industry, unlike the plan for the football stadium, which would serve as home for the New York Jets.
 There was an effort in the State Legislature yesterday afternoon to hammer together a revised bill that would allow the center to add 340,000 square feet of exhibit space. Gov. George E. Pataki's original proposal sparked widespread criticism from supporters and critics alike, in part because some of the language appeared to allow for the financing of the stadium.
 ''We'll try to find a way to pass a Javits bill,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, ''but not if they keep trying to jam the stadium into it. We can fix the other problems.''
 The governor issued a revised proposal on Friday, which removed some of the most disputed elements of the bill. But it came in for criticism yesterday during an Assembly hearing in Manhattan. Assemblyman Brodsky asked city and state officials if they would accept language stating that the bill would in no way authorize the financing, construction or management of the stadium.
 Mr. Doctoroff said the bill was solely concerned with the expansion of the Javits, but he favored some kind of joint operating agreement, because the stadium would double as an exhibit hall. He said that he would oppose efforts to prohibit construction of the stadium, which he views as a critical component of the West Side redevelopment plan.
 ''They should do what's necessary to get the Javits expansion moving forward,'' said Louis J. Coletti of the Building Trades Employers Council, a construction company group. ''I think it's time to move this project forward.''
 The $1.4 billion stadium, which requires a $600 million public investment, is the single most contentious item in the city's plans for the West Side. Those plans also include the creation of a tree-lined boulevard between 10th and 11th Avenues, stretching from 42nd Street to a newly created public square next to the stadium at 34th Street. There would also be a connection to the High Line, a former elevated railroad line that would be turned into a linear park.
 The rezoning would provide developers and corporations with sites for new skyscrapers and apartment houses and allow for the construction of 28 million square feet of office space, hotels, stores and thousands of apartments over the next 40 years.
 The impact study examined 18 alternatives, including moving the stadium to Willets Point, Queens, next to Shea Stadium, a proposal supported by some groups in Queens and Manhattan. The study said it would cost as much as the Manhattan project, but would not attract any convention business.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley (Version 2.0) Has Hopes Rising for Economic Rebound

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., June 21 

 BODY:
''Silicon Valley is back'' is on the lips of eager entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, who are rejoicing over the success of Google and pointing to the modest comeback in computer sales. The three-year-long depression, they say, is over. 
 But other signs tell a different story. The famed traffic jams of Silicon Valley's boom times are still uncommon. A last-minute reservation at some of the area's hot restaurants, like Tamarine or Spago Palo Alto, can still be had. And a suite in a gleaming office park that would have cost nearly $10 a square foot in monthly rent in 1999 can now be had for less than $3.
 Big portions of sprawling projects built on optimism in the mid-1990's, like the Midpoint Technology Park in Redwood City, sit dark and unoccupied. On Mission College Boulevard in Santa Clara, 750,000 square feet of office space is still available in an archipelago of office parks built during the boom. 
 The optimists tend to compare today's prospects with that of the mid-1990's, when Netscape Communications' initial public offering in August 1995 touched off the greatest boom the area has ever witnessed. They believe that a new era, which some are calling Web 2.0, is here. 
 ''It feels like we're 12 months, 18 months away from the equivalent of the Netscape I.P.O.,'' said Andrew Anker, a former venture capitalist who this month became executive vice president at Six Apart, a start-up based in Silicon Valley that aims to help businesses publish Web logs, or blogs. 
 Still, in more sober moments, even the optimists admit that this period is something quite different from the boom of the late 1990's.
 ''I think people have been waiting so long for anything positive that a little bit of green looks to them like a lush forest,'' said Konstantin Guericke, the co-founder of LinkedIn, a business networking company and one of Silicon Valley's higher profile start-ups.
 Indeed, conditions do look relatively good because things have been so bleak for so long. The area lost nearly a fifth of its jobs after the end of the bubble in 2000, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at the consulting firm Economy.com.
 Looking strictly at job losses, he said, the San Jose metropolitan area, which includes much of Silicon Valley, suffered the worst collapse of any metropolitan area in the United States since the Great Depression, surpassing Detroit, which lost 13 percent of its jobs in the early 1980's. 
 ''You're starting to hear about profits at some companies, double-digit jumps in chip sales, and about increases on the executive compensation side of things,'' said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. ''But I think you can say Silicon Valley is on an upswing only if you don't care about the 200,000 jobs that disappeared when the bubble burst.''
 Since 2000, the region has added one new job for every 15 jobs lost, according to data provided by Mr. Levy, and added roughly 13,000 jobs over the last four months. 
 ''At that rate a jobs recovery is going to take a long, long time,'' he said, maybe through the end of the decade. Silicon Valley's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent does not sound extremely high, but as Mr. Levy points out, tens of thousands of workers left the area after the collapse. 
 Office vacancy rates in the region were below 4 percent during the boom, but reached 18 percent in the second half of 2003, according to BT Commercial Real Estate/NAI.
 That figure now stands at 17.6 percent, even though office rental rates are at their lowest level in more than seven years, according to that firm's Silicon Valley Office Report. (Home prices in the area, however, are at record highs, according to DataQuick Information Systems, a real estate data firm based in San Diego.)
 ''Silicon Valley is no longer at death's door,'' said Mike Moeller, director of corporate communications at Hewlett-Packard. ''People are no longer in shock. But is Silicon Valley back? That's like saying a patient who was in diabetic coma for several years is healthy again because he can lift his head and open his eyes.''
 The optimists, though, cite the visitor parking spots at Cisco Systems, the network equipment maker.
 For the first time in years they are filled with representatives from start-ups hoping to cut a deal with the company. The busy lunch corridors, whether Castro Street in Mountain View or University Avenue in Palo Alto, are once again filled with junior moguls in the making wearing khakis and blue oxford shirts, the standard Silicon Valley uniform. 
 ''The bleeding has stopped,'' said Alex Resnik, a part-owner of Spago Palo Alto. No longer do ''three youngsters in their late 20's spend $3,000 on dinner,'' he said with a frown, but the restaurant is starting to do a brisk business again in wines that sell for $60 a bottle. 
 The economic rebound and a modest rise in technology spending by corporate America have been good for companies that specialize in critical software areas like security. But companies selling less than crucial products have not experienced big improvements. 
 ''I think this is going to be an environment that treats some people very well, and some people very poorly,'' said Roger McNamee, a longtime technology investor based in Silicon Valley. ''You're going to find companies that are doing spectacularly well sharing parking lots with companies that are on the verge of shutting down.'' 
 Those with a more tempered opinion say Silicon Valley is in the midst of a recovery that is as modest as it is delicate. 
 ''I think the operative word is fragile,'' said Paul Saffo, a research fellow at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. Mr. Saffo, who has lived and worked in Silicon Valley since the early 1980's, noted that the region ''has always been dependent on events and trends happening far from the Valley, but that's now more true than ever.''
 For 20 years, Mr. Saffo said, people have been predicting the area's demise, citing factors like its horrendous traffic and surging home prices, and for 20 years he has chuckled over their doomsday pronouncements. But the lack of traffic causes him to worry. 
 ''You have mixed feelings on those days you sail up and down the Valley,'' Mr. Saffo said. ''You're glad to get around, but on the other hand, you worry, 'Is it over?''' 
 In 2000, according to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, 55 percent of the region's major freeway miles were snarled in traffic during commuting hours, compared with less than 40 percent in 2002, the latest year with data available.
 The traffic was far worse for those commuting to and from the area, whether over bridges or via a route like State Highway 17, which runs southwest from Los Gatos, Calif., through the Santa Cruz Mountains.
 Traffic on more than 8 in 10 miles on that highway slowed to a crawl at rush hour in 2000, compared with 3 in 10 miles in 2002. 
 ''We're seeing a slight increase in traffic in the past few months but nothing like it was three years ago,'' a spokeswoman for the transportation authority said. 
 Google, of course, offers good news for those who believe that the region is about to see a full-bore revival, but even the most exuberant optimists admit that Silicon Valley needs more than a single spectacular stock offering. 
 ''I think people who are expecting a phoenix to rise out of the ashes are going to be disappointed,'' said Joseph Ansanelli, a 15-year Silicon Valley veteran and entrepreneur who helped found his latest company, a data security firm called Vontu, at the end of 2001. ''We're looking at a slow and steady return,'' he said. 
 That view is shared by William T. Coleman III, the co-founder of BEA Systems, one of the more successful start-ups created in the 1990's, who predicts that the region will not see any kind of full-bore recovery until ''later in the decade.'' 
 ''Silicon Valley grows in great spurts, and it grows connected to big themes,'' said Mr. Coleman, now the chief executive of Cassatt, a business software start-up. He said that, for now, ''no big themes'' had yet emerged to drive the next wave of growth. 
 The region has suffered other downturns, of course, including a steep decline in the mid-1980's after the excitement over the advent of the personal computer. ''But that recovery was much quicker than it will be this time,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Previously, the job levels had always bounced back really strongly in two or three years. This time it's going to take much longer.''
 The revival of the venture capital investment provides perhaps the most encouraging sign. By all accounts, venture firms are once again investing in promising but risky technology start-ups. They are competing over the hottest deals, slapping down term sheets and offering a few million in cash in exchange for a chunk of the business. 
 ''There was a long stretch there where the environment was so negative that people felt that no matter what they did, they couldn't be successful,'' said Jonathan Feiber, a partner at Mohr, Davidow Ventures. ''I don't know where we are in the cycle, but I know we're well past that point.''
 Yet even on this front, the excitement should be muted. For one thing, there are so many tens of billions in the hands of venture capitalists that renewed investment may simply indicate their impatience. 
 For another, the numbers are not all positive. Venture firms, according to Thomson Venture Economics, invested $1.8 billion in Silicon Valley start-ups in the last quarter of 2003. That is far more money than they had invested in any three-month period during the previous 18 months. But that figure fell to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2004, a number in line with tougher times in late 2002 and the first three quarters of 2003. 
 Josh Becker, a top executive at Agile Software, a company that sells software packages to large corporations, offers another test for Silicon Valley's prospects. ''When you see people starting to leave companies like eBay to start their own companies, despite leaving considerable money on the table in unvested options,'' he said, ''then you know Silicon Valley is back.'' 
 For now, Mr. Becker added, ''that isn't happening.''

HEADLINE: Using Your Miles? Often, It's Now Double or Nothing

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT. 
Readers are invited to send stories about business travel experiences to businesstravel@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
When Timothy Placek tried to cash in his miles to fly his daughter from St. Louis to Houston last year, Continental Airlines told him no seats were available.
 Disappointed, Mr. Placek, who is a Silver Elite member of Continental's frequent-flier program, asked whether he could use his points to travel to Omaha, to visit his parents in January, four months later. No award seats were available on any of those flights, either.
 Well, then, how about applying the miles to a family vacation he was planning to the Philippines, an increasingly frustrated Mr. Placek asked. Unfortunately, the airline replied, that would not be possible; all standard mileage-award seats on those flights were also taken. 
 As his annoyance increased, a phone representative told him all was not lost. He could use his miles for any of those excursions if he were willing to spend twice as many as the standard 25,000 miles for a round trip within the United States, or 50,000 miles for overseas destinations. Continental's EasyPass program, she said, would make it possible.
 ''I was disappointed,'' said Mr. Placek, a vice president for MicroMed Technologies, Inc., a manufacturer of medical devices in Houston. ''I felt as if they were trying to steal my miles.'' He reluctantly booked the flight for his daughter, but not for the other two trips that he had wanted.
 His distress is shared by many business travelers. A survey by e-Rewards Inc., a consulting firm in Dallas that specializes in loyalty programs, suggests that many airlines are quietly cutting the number of seats available at the 25,000-mile redemption level while promoting their costlier premium-redemption plans.
 In the poll of loyalty-program members, 26 percent described their recent experiences in booking award travel as ''much more difficult'' or ''virtually impossible,'' an increase of five percentage points from an identical survey last year. About two out of every five travelers reported that they had made premium redemptions in the last 12 months, and half of those who did said they had felt they had no other choice.
 Continental says it has not reduced the number of conventional award seats available to its frequent fliers. Julie King, an airline spokeswoman, says redemption rates are up 15 percent this year, with standard rewards accounting for 75 percent of the total. Ms. King said the higher redemption levels were meant to ''give our customers more flexibility when seats are in high demand.''
 But the double-or-nothing proposition has left many frequent travelers -- and some loyalty program experts -- with a different impression.
 ''This amounts to a covert increase in award levels,'' said Tim Winship, who publishes FrequentFlier.com, a Web site. 
 Mr. Winship said the changes made sense from the airlines' point of view. After all, most major carriers are losing money and have a reservoir of unredeemed miles that some industry analysts say could top 10 trillion this year. But, he said, they ought to be forthright about what they are doing.
 ''There's no disclosure about what's going on behind the scenes, no transparency to the system,'' he said. ''Consumers don't know what their odds are of getting an award seat. It's an outrage.'' Even when travelers try to work within the system, they are often foiled.
 ''I have had nearly zero luck in getting the award travel I wanted at the lower mileage amount,'' said Dana Baldwin, a management consultant in Ada, Mich. ''I've tried making reservations more than nine months in advance, tried flexible dates, different airports, leaving from different cities and arriving at different destinations, all with little luck.''
 Mr. Baldwin believes that airline-capacity controls are limiting the number of 25,000-mile awards on every flight to a few seats. That way, he speculates, airlines can say they have them available.
 That is not so, according to at least one airline. ''Customers on frequent-flier award tickets are occupying more seats now than they were five years ago,'' said Mary Stanik, a spokeswoman for Northwest Airlines. Indeed, the portion of the carrier's revenue passenger miles -- an industry term for the total number of miles flown by paying passengers -- on award tickets rose to 7.5 percent last year from 6.1 percent in 1999.
 Maybe both are right. Bruce Mainzer, a former director for the yield-management department at United Airlines -- the office in charge of matching prices with demand -- says basic economics are at work. It is not that carriers are somehow trying to cheat frequent fliers out of the miles they have earned, he says, it is just that they quite naturally choose to give priority to paying customers.
 ''Award seats are made available after all the other revenue-producing demand is met -- in other words, only excess capacity is allocated to award travel demand,'' Mr. Mainzer said. ''But now there's less capacity, because airlines are more closely matching seat demand to capacity.''
 Competition from low-cost carriers is driving the trend, he says. These upstarts mostly serve popular tourist destinations like Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., and to stay in the game, the big airlines have to squeeze as many pennies as they possibly can from each seat. 
 ''They've pulled back even more seat capacity in the markets where award travel demand is the strongest,'' Mr. Mainzer said, ''which is why travelers often find that an award seat is completely unavailable.''
 If that is the case, then why would seats always seem to be available for people willing to spend double the miles on them? For the simple reason that airlines classify them as revenue producing and thus allocate more of them per flight than they do ordinary award seats, which they consider freebies.
 They also assume that any premium tickets they allot for high-demand routes will be snapped up, Mr. Mainzer says. But he wonders if they are forgetting about the deep-rooted human dread of being fleeced.
 ''I think a majority of travelers think to themselves, 'I'm a loser if I have to redeem that many miles for a ticket,''' he said.
 At the very least, they are irritated by the prospect of shelling out more points. Richard Puk, the president of Intelligraphics Inc., a computer-graphics consulting firm in Carlsbad, Calif., did not have that many miles. Last month, he says, he tried unsuccessfully to redeem his Delta award miles for two tickets from San Diego to Rapid City, S.D. ''I started trying to book the trip in March,'' Mr. Puk said, ''and was never able to find any available award seats.''
 Delta told him he could have the tickets if he anted up 80,000 miles, but he had accumulated only 50,000, he says. Instead, he purchased the tickets for $300 apiece.
 He is still angry. ''I was very frustrated,'' he said. ''In the past, I've never had any trouble getting a seat for my miles. It's almost as if Delta had restricted the number of award seats to the point where no one could get any.''
 The e-Rewards study found that Mr. Puk is in good company. Almost 44 percent of frequent travelers reported difficulty in booking an award seat more than once last year. It also concluded that some business travelers are skeptical about the future of loyalty programs (see chart). But the biggest surprise to Bill Russo, the executive vice president at e-Rewards, was that business travelers remained fiercely loyal to their programs despite their misgivings. ''People are saying it's virtually impossible to book seats,'' Mr. Russo said. ''People are afraid their programs won't have any value. Yet more than half of the respondents told us they're satisfied enough with their primary program that they would recommend it.''
 What is going on? ''These are businesspeople, and they understand the business reasons behind what the airlines are doing,'' Mr. Russo said. ''Of course, when times get better, it's reasonable to think that they'd expect the airlines to make reward redemption easier than it is now.''

HEADLINE: Beating Kerry to Punch, Nader Picks a No. 2

BYLINE: By MARK GLASSMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21 

 BODY:
Ralph Nader, who twice ran for president on the Green Party ticket, chose as his running mate on Monday a member of that party. The selection rekindled his association with the Greens and raised the outside possibility that they might endorse him and thereby put him on the ballot in 22 states and here in Washington.
 Mr. Nader's choice, Peter Miguel Camejo, 64, was a candidate for governor of California in 2003 and the second-most-popular presidential candidate in the Green Party primaries this year. 
 But no sooner had Mr. Nader announced Mr. Camejo's selection in Washington than he upstaged it by saying that he would accept the party's endorsement if offered. 
 He said he would continue to run as an independent but welcomed support from alternative parties because his campaign, he said, aimed to be ''an ecumenical gathering of third parties.''
 The Green Party endorsed Mr. Nader in 1996 and 2000, and many members have indicated that they are ready to do so again at the 2004 Presidential Nominating Convention in Milwaukee, which begins on Wednesday. Mr. Camejo will attend and speak on Mr. Nader's behalf.
 But the party remains divided this year over how to deal with Mr. Nader, who won 3 percent of the presidential popular vote in 2000 as its nominee. Some members say that Mr. Nader is the candidate closest to their environmentalist ideology. Others say that his candidacy could again polarize voters, as it did in the 2000 election, and lead to the re-election of a candidate that neither side wants.
 John Rensenbrink, a founder of the Green Party and a political adviser to Mr. Nader in 2000, said he would not endorse Mr. Nader this year. ''I decided that this was a different situation,'' Mr. Rensenbrink said. ''We learned something, and I think he's making a mistake.''
 Mr. Rensenbrink said he would support David Cobb, who helped found the Green Party of Texas. Mr. Cobb has led the voting in the Green primaries.
 Mr. Camejo is chairman of the board of Progressive Asset Management of California, a social and environmentalist investment firm he founded in 1987. Mr. Nader, in introducing him to reporters at the National Press Club, said that he was a champion of civil rights, noting that he had marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Alabama. 
 Mr. Nader also pointed out that, like him, Mr. Camejo strongly opposes the war in Iraq, and that he was suspended from college while protesting the Vietnam War. And, he noted, Mr. Camejo just might be an asset in difficult economic times.
 ''He was admitted to M.I.T. after receiving a perfect score on his math S.A.T. test,'' Mr. Nader joked. ''A fact that is relevant to the economic and fiscal crises of our times.''
 Mr. Nader said he chose Mr. Camejo because he is ''a man who has put his principles in practice.''
 In 1976, Mr. Camejo ran for president as a socialist. In October, he joined 134 others in the race for governor of California.

HEADLINE: A Deal for New Yorkers

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
In doling out a something-for-everyone budget, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, will undoubtedly score political points with virtually every imaginable constituency -- the working poor, homeowners, older New Yorkers, those who love libraries.
 But, like the mayors and Council speakers before them, they also appear to have thrown in the towel on the idea of providing structural balance to the city's budget, which each year creaks under growing state and federal mandates, rising pension costs and increased spending for various services. 
 While Mayor Bloomberg came into office insisting that he would balance the city's budget with his businessman's head, he has done so in large part with a venture capitalist's mindset, insisting that he hears the Cassandra-like calls of fiscal watchdogs but doing little to heed their warnings. 
 Last year, rather than make the tough cuts that he swore would be needed to balance the budget, he instead opted to raise taxes, notably property tax levies, which increased 18. 5 percent, with the blessing of Mr. Miller. He also increased the city's borrowing while making far more modest trims in spending than he had once said were necessary. 
 His failure to address the city's longer-term fiscal problems has drawn the scorn of fiscal watchdogs. In a recent report, the New York State Financial Control Board cited a ''deterioration in the city's fiscal condition that was temporarily masked'' by a growing surplus in this year's budget. The board, which can take control of the city's finances if the city ends the fiscal year with a deficit, said the city has been relying too heavily on temporary tax increases to keep its budget in balance, a notion echoed by other budget experts. The mayor himself acknowledged last night, ''The economy is doing somewhat better, but we are hardly out of the woods.'' In fact, with last year's fiscal crisis behind him and faced with the opportunity to pay down debt or put money aside for the next budget crisis, Mr. Bloomberg, with the Council's assistance, decided to put the money back in New Yorkers' pockets, further erasing the line that divides him from all the politicians he has proclaimed to be different on the fiscal front. 
 Mr. Miller said last night: ''Budgets are the process of compromise. We laid out at the very beginning what our priorities were, and leadership is about making sure that you address those priorities as best we can. The mayor was very clear about what his priorities were, and we tried to address those so we could come to an agreement that reflected both of our concerns.''
 Mr. Miller and Mr. Bloomberg, inching toward an election year, do not appear to be spooked by the dire warnings of longer-term budget gaps. But New York City will have to spend hundreds of millions more than originally anticipated on employee salaries, bus subsidies and other programs in the next fiscal year, as well as ballooning pension and health care costs, expenses the city has little control over. Instead, each wants to prove to New Yorkers that they have their pain in mind.
 In January, Mr. Bloomberg said he wanted to give New York homeowners a $400 rebate, roughly equaling the 18.5 percent increase the average homeowner faced last year. Mr. Miller countered with a plan that would roll back the entire property tax rate by two percentage points, but he included large landlords and businesses in the relief package. Thus ensued perhaps the oddest class war to play out in city government in years, with the Republican billionaire mayor accusing the majority Democratic Council of putting the needs of businesses before long-suffering middle-class home owners. 
 Mr. Miller's failure to sway Mr. Bloomberg and others toward his tax plan was an embarrassment for the speaker, who has spent the last few months deriding Mr. Bloomberg's tax rebate as a ''gimmick.'' He further hurt himself by letting criticism of his tax plan as a giveaway to big business dominate instead of beating the drum about his earned income tax credit proposal, which would put money in many people's checkbooks. 
 But it was the haggling over extra money for city services -- libraries, cultural groups, economic development studies, services for the elderly and the like -- that sent this budget down to the wire, nearly missing today's crucial deadline to have the budget done before the state legislature ends its session so that it could bless the tax plan. Indeed, City Hall yesterday was filled with the cicada-like chirps of those seeking money chatting it up with those in the position to dole it out.
 Throughout the day, the mayor's aides insisted that no deal was in the offing, while Council members assured lobbyists, reporters, union officials and anyone else who cares about these matters that the two sides were close. An aide to Mr. Miller was spotted cursing into her cellphone about an aide to the mayor. People went to dinner. They came back. It was that sort of negotiation. But the deal was sealed in time for the 11 p.m. news programs, before an adjourning Albany Legislature, and before a packed schedule for both men today as they prepared to sell the package to the city.

HEADLINE: Budget Deal Gives City Homeowners Tax Rebate

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg reached an agreement with the City Council last night on a roughly $47 billion budget deal that offers $400 property tax rebates to homeowners for each of the next three years, $50 million in tax breaks for the working poor and $215 million in additional spending on health, social service and cultural programs.
 The agreement represented a victory for Mr. Bloomberg's plan to give homeowners tax relief just a year after he pushed through an 18.5 percent increase in property taxes, angering many homeowners at the time. The property tax rebate, which is expected to cost the city $250 million each year, comes as budget watchdogs have warned about large deficits beginning in the 2006 fiscal year, which begins next summer. 
 The mayor's office and the Council worked feverishly last night, and at times with a great deal of hostility and uncertainty, to adopt a budget before the planned adjournment today of the State Legislature, whose blessing is needed for the tax breaks. The city is obligated to adopt a new budget by July 1.
 ''Tomorrow the City Council will pass a home rule message asking the State Legislature to adjust the taxes,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a hurriedly called news conference in the City Hall rotunda at 10:30 p.m. ''We're optimistic that Albany will go along with what the city wants.''
 It was unclear whether Albany would grant approval to the tax changes being sought by the city. There has been some grumbling about recent court decisions ordering the state to sharply increase its financing for New York City schools and allowing the state to take over some of the city's debt. 
 Those developments have left some lawmakers wondering aloud why the city is proposing to cut taxes while still seeking so much state aid.
 The mayor said the overall budget agreement ''was good and balanced and responsible,'' and ''shows the priorities of all New Yorkers -- we're trying to protect the young and protect the old.''
 Movement on a budget agreement bogged down in recent weeks, as council members debated among themselves over hundreds of millions of dollars they wanted to add to the mayor's proposed budget, which would have cut $220 million from current spending levels. Lobbyists and special interest groups loitered outside City Hall for weeks, and continued to line the steps late last night, buttonholing council members on behalf of their favored spending increases.
 In the end, the mayor agreed to restore much of what his budget plan had cut, and he also agreed to add money for a few other initiatives, including $10 million for job training for the long-term unemployed and $10 million for the teacher's choice program, which reimburses teachers for classroom expenses they incur. The budget also provides more money for libraries and for child day care and legal aid for the poor.
 Since the mayor announced the rebate proposal in January, it has rapidly gained political traction among members of the Council. 
 By embracing the rebate, the Council abandoned an alternative plan offered by the speaker, Gifford Miller, who proposed to roll back last year's increase permanently by 2 percentage points and provide tax breaks for elderly homeowners on fixed incomes and working New Yorkers who earn roughly $17,000 a year or less.
 As part of last night's deal, the mayor agreed to Mr. Miller's earned income tax credit for the poor. The elderly homeowners who were the focus in the speaker's plan would instead be covered by the $400 rebate.
 Mr. Miller, who joined Mr. Bloomberg in making last night's announcement, singled out the tax credit for the poor as ''one of the accomplishments that we will all be most proud of.'' 
 ''This is a budget that does represent a 'good news budget' for all New Yorkers,'' Mr. Miller said, borrowing a phrase that Mr. Bloomberg used to describe his original budget plan, which was unveiled in January. The final agreement, he said, represents ''the interests of all our constituents.''
 The tax break, which would have been unthinkable less than a year ago, became possible because the city's fiscal situation has improved markedly, with tax revenues pouring in from a reinvigorated Wall Street, surging real estate sales and mortgage refinancings. 
 After two consecutive years of multibillion-dollar budget deficits, the Bloomberg administration predicts a surplus of roughly $1.9 billion.
 The extra income allowed the mayor and the Council to replace their traditional squabbles over what to cut with a debate over how to spend the surplus. 
 The mayor emphasized returning money to taxpayers in the form of a rebate, while the Council's focus quickly became how much money to add for libraries, smaller classes and job training for the long-term unemployed.
 The last-minute deal was driven not by a fiscal crisis, which overshadowed the last two budget negotiations, but rather the political will of both Mr. Bloomberg, who will seek re-election next year, and Mr. Miller, who will likely seek to challenge him next year. 
 Since taking office in 2002, Mr. Bloomberg has reduced the municipal work force by 18,000 employees, cut $3 billion from agencies and increased property taxes, on top of increases to personal income and sales taxes on the city and state level.
 He had resisted agreeing to pay raises for unionized employees unless they could be paid for with corresponding productivity gains, but partially abandoned that position this year and signed a contract that gives modest increases to the largest municipal union, District Council 37, mostly without productivity enhancements. 
 He included $652 million in next year's budget for pay increases for all city unions, at the D.C. 37 contract level, although agreements with those other unions have yet to be worked out.

HEADLINE: Justices Limit Ability to Sue Health Plans

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court on Monday unanimously rejected efforts by states to give patients in managed care a right that Congress has so far declined to provide: the ability to sue managed-care companies for damages for refusing to cover treatment that a doctor has deemed medically necessary.
 The court ruled, in an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, that the laws of Texas and nine other states are pre-empted by the federal law known as Erisa, which applies to the employment-based health care plans that cover some 140 million people. 
 The law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, allows patients to sue for reimbursement of denied benefits, but not for damages stemming from the denial. A conventional medical malpractice suit, consequently, is not permitted against a typical health maintenance organization or managed- care company under the federal law. 
 The question for the Supreme Court was whether that prohibition left any maneuvering room for the states, and the court's answer was no. Any state law that ''duplicates, supplements or supplants'' the remedy available under the federal law ''conflicts with the clear Congressional intent to make the Erisa remedy exclusive,'' Justice Thomas said.
 As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg indicated in a concurring opinion, the result returns the issue to Congress. ''A regulatory vacuum exists,'' Justice Ginsburg said in an opinion that was also signed by Justice Stephen G. Breyer.
 For years, Congress has wrestled with but failed to pass a national ''patients' bill of rights.'' 
 The decision came in a pair of closely watched cases from Texas, where a strong patients' rights bill became law in 1997 without the signature of George W. Bush, who was then governor. During his campaign for the presidency four years ago, Governor Bush embraced the state law, citing it as a product of his nonpartisan leadership and as a potential model for the country. Arizona, California, Georgia, Maine, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Washington and West Virginia have adopted similar laws.
 Before the Supreme Court, the Bush administration opposed the Texas law, instead joining two managed-care companies, Aetna Health Inc. and Cigna HealthCare of Texas Inc. in their appeal of a federal appeals court's ruling that the Texas Health Care Liability Act and the federal law could coexist.
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, held in 2002 that the damage suits brought by two managed-care patients were not the type of lawsuit that Congress had intended to pre-empt. While Erisa would bar a breach of contract suit for a denial of benefits, the appeals court said, Congress had not intended to pre-empt a damage suit based on a ''duty of ordinary care'' as defined in state law.
 One of the plaintiffs, Ruby Calad, had a hysterectomy and other abdominal surgery under her husband's health care plan provided by his employer. The plan, managed by Cigna, provided for a one-day hospital stay for a hysterectomy. Ms. Calad's surgeon recommended a longer stay, but the Cigna discharge nurse refused to authorize it. Ms. Calad developed complications at home and had to return to the emergency room several days later.
 The other plaintiff, Juan Davila, was prescribed Vioxx, an expensive anti-inflammatory medication, for arthritis and other problems. But his health care plan, managed by Aetna, authorized Vioxx only for patients who had first tried and failed to benefit from two less expensive drugs. One of those drugs, Naprosyn, causes a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, a complication that brought Mr. Davila within hours of dying. He needed seven units of blood and was in critical care for five days.
 In his majority opinion, Justice Thomas offered a spare one-paragraph description of the facts of the two cases, Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, No. 02-1845, and Cigna HealthCare of Texas Inc. v. Calad, No. 03-83. He said that in any event the plaintiffs' injuries could not fairly be attributed to their managed-care companies if those companies ''correctly concluded that, under the terms of the relevant plan, a particular treatment was not covered.''
 The cause of the injuries was ''the failure of the plan itself to cover the requested treatment,'' Justice Thomas said, reflecting the managed-care industry's argument that it should not be blamed when an employer has, for economic reasons, declined to buy a certain level of coverage.
 The court's unanimity was not reflected in responses to the decision. The American Medical Association, whose members often find themselves in conflict with managed-care companies, said that it was ''extremely disappointed'' by the decision. ''Managed-care plans can now practice medicine without a license, and without the same accountability that physicians face every day,'' the association's statement said.
 But a trade organization for managed-care companies, America's Health Insurance Plans, called the decision ''a victory for consumers and employers'' that ''puts the brakes on efforts by trial lawyers to turn every question about the scope of an individual's coverage into a costly lawsuit.'' The American Benefits Council, representing employers, likewise said the decision would preserve cost-effective health coverage.
 Democratic members of Congress were quick to react and to criticize the Bush administration. Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he would reintroduce the ''patients' bill of rights'' measure that was passed by the Senate in 2001. The House version had more limits on patients' lawsuits, among other differences with the Senate version, and the two were never reconciled.
 Miguel A. Estrada, a lawyer for Aetna and Cigna, said in an interview that patients like Ms. Calad and Mr. Davila could try a range of remedies under federal regulations that require a prompt response if the physician complains about the denial of necessary treatment.

HEADLINE: More Slot Machines for Tribes; $1 Billion for California

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, June 21 

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger struck a bargain on Monday with five California Indian tribes that will provide the state with a quick cash infusion of $1 billion while permitting a sizable expansion of tribal gambling operations in the state.
 The deal is a sharp reversal for the governor, who in his campaign last fall demonized the tribes as a ''special interest'' that did not pay a fair share of its billions of dollars in gambling revenue to the state. 
 The five tribes that signed new compacts with the state own something less than 20 percent of the slot machines now in operation at 50 Indian casinos around California. Mr. Schwarzenegger said he hoped the dozens of other casino-operating tribes would reach similar agreements with the state.
 Under the new agreements, the tribes will be able to operate as many slot machines as the market will bear, although they will have to pay a fee for each new machine. The tribes are currently limited to 2,000 slot machines each and make no payments to the state's general fund.
 ''This is a fair deal for the tribes and for the state,'' the governor said at an elaborately staged signing ceremony at Memorial Auditorium, a few blocks from the Capitol. ''I'm hopeful more tribes will join us.''
 In addition to forging an alliance with the Indian tribes he once reviled, Mr. Schwarzenegger also won the support of a major union, the Building and Construction Trades Council of California, whose president, Bob Balgenorth, stood on the stage with the governor during the ceremony. The union, which customarily supports Democratic candidates and causes, donated tens of thousands of dollars last fall to defeating the recall initiative that swept Mr. Schwarzenegger into office. It is likely to gain jobs from highway projects that will be financed by the new casino revenue.
 The five tribes involved in the deals agreed to finance a bond that will pay the state $1 billion to help plug an estimated $14 billion hole in the budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. After the bond is paid off, the tribes will pay 10 percent of the net from their slot machines. They will also pay a fee beginning at $12,000 a year for any new slot machines above the current limit of 2,000. Those fees could bring the state as much as $150 million a year in additional revenue, aides to the governor said. The new compacts will run for 25 years and replace agreements signed with Gov. Gray Davis in 1999.
 Anthony R. Pico, chairman of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians, which operates a large casino near San Diego, said the agreements would provide his tribe with an opportunity to expand its gambling business and provide new jobs to its members. He said the deal also preserved the tribe's historic right to self-government.
 ''The courts have long held that Indians have the right under the Constitution to govern ourselves,'' he said. ''But having that right without adequate economic resources is a hollow dream.''
 Mr. Pico presented Mr. Schwarzenegger with a colorful Indian blanket, which the governor wrapped around his shoulders and wore as he walked off the stage.
 The other tribes that signed compacts on Monday are the Pala Band of Mission Indians, the Pauma Band of Mission Indians, the United Auburn Indian Community and the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians. 
 The agreements are subject to ratification by the California Legislature and by the voting members of the five tribes.

HEADLINE: Kerry Vows to Lift Bush Limits on Stem-Cell Research

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: DENVER, June 21 

 BODY:
Backed by the unusual endorsement of 48 Nobel laureates, Senator John Kerry on Monday accused the Bush administration of letting ideology trump science, and promised to lift the limits on federal financing of stem-cell research and to build an economy ''based on innovation, ingenuity and imagination.''
 Mr. Kerry and his scientific supporters echoed a 38-page report issued in February by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which accused the administration of ''manipulation, suppression and misrepresentation of science'' on issues like biotechnology, global warming and nuclear power. 
 Mr. Kerry vowed to ''listen to the advice of scientists'' and make their advisory reports open to the public. The group of scientists had complained that the White House heavily edited a report by the Environmental Protection Agency to remove almost any finding pointing to a human link to global warming. 
 Mr. Kerry also invoked the recent death of President Ronald Reagan from Alzheimer's disease and echoed Nancy Reagan's call for stem-cell research ''to tear down every wall today that keeps us from finding the cures of tomorrow.''
 ''We need a president who will again embrace the tradition of looking toward the future and new discoveries with hope based on scientific facts, not fear,'' Mr. Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, told thousands of people here at Civic Center Park, many of whom waited for hours on a rainy 50-degree day to see him.
 ''Presidents are supposed to think big and dream big and help our nation to do so,'' he said, citing Franklin D. Roosevelt's creation of the national laboratories, John F. Kennedy's commitment to put a man on the moon, and Bill Clinton's support for mapping the human genome. ''When America sees a problem or a possibility of greatness, it is in our collective character to set our sights on the horizon and not stop working until we get there,'' Mr. Kerry said. 
 On Monday night, Mr. Kerry decided to upend his schedule, canceling a fund-raiser and speech on Tuesday in New Mexico to allow him to fly back to Washington overnight for a possible vote on an amendment to make health care financing for veterans mandatory. Mr. Kerry has rarely interrupted his campaign activities for Senate business, but veterans' health care is a signature issue in his campaign. 
 Burton Richter, who received the Nobel in physics in 1976 for discovering a subatomic particle and who helped Mr. Kerry's campaign collect his colleagues' support over the last 10 days, told reporters that ''Nobel laureates tend not to use their names for anything outside of science,'' adding, ''I hope you take that as a sign of how seriously all of us think the errors of our present course are.''
 Mr. Kerry's speech, beginning a week focused on science and technology, was his first public appearance in Colorado, a Republican-leaning state that the Democrats hope to win. He noted, as he has in television advertisements, that he was born at an Army hospital nearby. It also reflected his increasing attention to stem-cell research, an issue for which Democrats believe they have public support.
 Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for Mr. Bush's re-election campaign, did not respond to the criticism of the president's policy prohibiting research on stem cells harvested since his order in 2001. The issue has split his party, with many Republicans signing on to legislation to lift the limits, particularly since Mr. Reagan's death. Mr. Schmidt answered the attack by pointing out that 22 of the 48 Nobelists who signed the pro-Kerry statement also signed a statement in January 2003 opposing war in Iraq, and 16 had given money to Democratic candidates. 
 In addition, 13 of the 48 were part of the group that released the February report criticizing the administration's approach to science.
 ''Only John Kerry would declare the country to be in scientific decline on a day when the country's first privately funded space trip is successfully completed,'' Mr. Schmidt said in a statement, referring to the rocket plane SpaceShipOne's journey 62 miles from earth and back. 
 Mr. Schmidt said the administration had increased the budget for research and development 44 percent since 2001, to $132 billion next year, and pointed to the president's plans to develop hydrogen fuel cells, promote clean coal technologies and modernize the electricity grid. 
 The Union of Concerned Scientists charged that the administration had often dismissed experts or selected others for scientific advisory panels based on their views on contentious subjects. The Bush administration has called most of the accusations made in the organization's report inaccurate and has said that the E.P.A. draft on global warming was dropped because more voluminous reports on climate change were in the works. 
 But in a conference call, three of the scientists supporting Mr. Kerry said that Mr. Bush had let America lag behind Europe and Asia in terms of patents, advanced degrees and publications in scientific journals.
 ''Where are the new things of tomorrow going to come from?'' Dr. Richter asked. ''This isn't about what's going to happen next week, it's what's going to happen next decade.''
 Harold Varmus, who won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1989 for his discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes and headed the National Institutes of Health under President Clinton, accused the Bush administration of taking a ''cavalier attitude in the way it receives advice from the scientific community.'' Mario J. Molina, a 1995 Nobel laureate for his work in atmospheric chemistry, said he was concerned that Mr. Bush ''overplays politics to scientific information.''

HEADLINE: A New Leader Carrying Hope -- M. Jodi Rell

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 21 

 BODY:
M. Jodi Rell likes to tell the story about the first time she ran as John G. Rowland's running mate, in 1994. Dressed in a suit and high heels, she came home from the campaign trail one night and saw that her family had neglected to take out the trash. She dragged the trash outside, her indignation rising. ''I'm running for lieutenant governor,'' she said she told family members upon returning. ''The least you could have done is taken out the trash.''
 To which her son, Michael, said, ''So, does that make you someone important?'' 
 It remains to be seen whether her family will cut her any slack now that she will be ascending to the top job in Connecticut on July 1. She will be the ninth female governor serving in the nation. 
 Through the months of investigation and weeks of impeachment hearings that prompted Governor Rowland to resign, Ms. Rell has been walking a fine line between showing support for a Republican power broker who helped her career and keeping a distance from his legal and ethical problems.
 That she will begin her term as the state's 87th governor -- only the second time a Connecticut woman has taken that oath -- with much of the state rooting for her success is as much a result of the fatigue that permeates this scandal-scarred state as it is testimony to her popularity. 
 People from both major parties interviewed on Monday expressed optimism that she had the political savvy and personal good will to break the gridlock that has gripped the Capitol since Mr. Rowland's problems burst into view. They also said she could restore confidence in state government, notwithstanding some minor blemishes of her own during her 20 years in public service.
 ''There's a tremendous amount of good will that will accompany her,'' said James C. Smith, the chairman of Webster Bank in Waterbury. Though a registered Democrat, he describes himself as an ''avid supporter'' of the economic policies advanced by Governor Rowland and said he thinks Ms. Rell, also a Republican, can be counted on to support those policies as well. 
 In an hourlong interview in her office earlier this year, Ms. Rell made clear that she had not let the events of the last few months sour her optimism or belief in the power of government to accomplish great things. 
 She said she was confident that her administration's efforts to revive big cities would continue to draw people to downtown Hartford. And she remained optimistic that trust in government would soon be restored. 
 Ms. Rell starts each morning at 5:30 with a two-mile walk, which also gives her time to listen to her favorite biographies on tape. Her older sister, Carol Bahringer, describes her as a ''steel magnolia.'' 
 Born Mary Carolyn Reavis 58 years ago, she grew up in Norfolk, Va., near the naval base where her father, Benjamin, worked. Though she rarely discusses it, Ms. Rell lost her mother, Foy, at the age of 7. Her father remarried, to Dorothy Peach Glisson, a divorced mother of three, and the two families moved in together. 
 Ms. Rell became the youngest of five, not that it stopped her from telling the others how to behave, Ms. Bahringer said.
 ''All of us learned to get along because we lived in such a small house as teenagers,'' Ms. Bahringer said. 
 Ms. Rell sometimes stayed with relatives in North Carolina in the summer, where she picked tobacco and learned how to drive a truck, her sister said. 
 In her teens, an old boyfriend gave her the nickname Jodi because she reminded him of the actress Joey Heatherton, whose name he garbled. 
 Hoping to become a teacher, she attended Old Dominion University but dropped out to marry Louis R. Rell, a Navy pilot, in 1967. They moved to Parsippany, N.J., when he began flying for Trans World Airlines, and then in 1969 to Brookfield, Conn., where they raised two children, Meredith and Michael. 
 For a time, Ms. Rell was content being a homemaker, a member of the local parent-teacher organization who delivered meals on wheels to housebound neighbors and volunteered with the Brookfield Republican Women's Club. 
 But in 1984, she discovered she was game for more when friends suggested she run for state representative. 
 Despite her inexperience, she won the race and was re-elected four times. She was a deputy minority leader in the House when Mr. Rowland invited her to join his ticket in 1994. 
 As lieutenant governor, Ms. Rell has crisscrossed the state meeting the elected leaders of all of Connecticut's 169 towns and cities. She has also served at the governor's request on panels that made recommendations about prison overcrowding and the redevelopment of downtown Hartford.
 Asked in the interview what she thought taxpayers most wanted their elected officials to tackle, Ms. Rell paused before ticking off job creation, holding the line on government spending, medical malpractice premiums and traffic, in that order. 
 While eradicating political corruption is not at the top of Ms. Rell's priorities, she has already informed her staff that they can no longer exchange holiday or birthday gifts and to ''just say no'' when others offer gifts. 
 She has, however, stirred up a few ethical debates of her own. The most vexing concerned her son, who was found in 1995 to be in possession of a stolen Jet Ski on Candlewood Lake in Connecticut. He was never arrested, and both he and his mother said he had no idea the watercraft was stolen. 
 That has led to persistent allegations of a bungled investigation and possible cover-up. 
 In 1997, Ms. Rell's husband had to apologize along with Mr. Rowland for accepting free surplus military equipment that had been given to the state for law enforcement purposes.
 The lieutenant governor also came in for criticism when she went ahead with two $250-a-plate fund-raisers on the day after Sept. 11.
 Her staff has said that the events' planners could not reach everyone on their lists to cancel. 
 Ms. Rell's political instincts were on better display in January, at a $2,000-a-plate fund-raiser that President Bush had in Greenwich. 
 With the governor concluding it was best to stay home, given the unflattering publicity trailing him, Ms. Rell was there, aglow in a sparkling blue dress, representing the administration.

HEADLINE: Wachovia Hopes SouthTrust Deal Repeats Success of 2001 Merger

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
G. Kennedy Thompson says he can do it again.
 Mr. Thompson, the chief executive of the Wachovia Corporation, has been a darling of bank stock investors since he successfully pulled off the $13 billion merger of Wachovia and First Union, which was announced more than three years ago. Now, Mr. Thompson is back with another deal, the $14.3 billion purchase of the SouthTrust Corporation, which was announced yesterday. 
 Mr. Thompson is arguing that investors should have faith that this deal will be as successful as the last one.
 ''We are well positioned to deliver the same smooth merger integration that has become a hallmark of our company,'' Mr. Thompson said in a conference call with analysts yesterday.
 The purchase of SouthTrust, based in Birmingham, Ala., will solidify Wachovia's already leading presence in the Southeast. The combined bank will have a presence in 15 states and Washington. The purchase will also give Wachovia, based in Charlotte, N.C., a foothold in the fast-growing Texas market.
 But there are some important differences between this deal and Mr. Thompson's last purchase. The price Wachovia is paying for SouthTrust looks expensive, both compared with some recent deals and compared with the merger of First Union and Wachovia in 2001. And this acquisition is being done at a time when growth in consumer bank deposits may have peaked and interest rates are rising.
 ''It is not cheap,'' said Mr. Thompson of the SouthTrust acquisition. ''But this is an incredibly attractive franchise.''
 Wachovia is the latest in a wave of big banks to announce mergers in recent months, beginning with Bank of America's acquisition of FleetBoston last October. Many of these deals have been predicated on the continued profitability of consumer banking.
 Wachovia, which is offering 0.89 share for each share of SouthTrust stock, is paying 17.6 times the next 12 months' earnings. That is slightly more than the 16.9 that Bank of America paid for FleetBoston, a deal that analysts also considered expensive.
 ''Why doesn't anyone in this industry ever know when the cycle is over?'' said Richard Bove, an analyst at Hoefer & Arnett, who is critical of Wachovia's latest deal. 
 Banks like SouthTrust might be willing to sell now because they are anticipating that the banking environment could get tougher, said Nancy Bush, an independent analyst in Annandale, N.J.
 ''Why not get out while the prices paid are still hefty, and before any cracks have become visible in the facade of the industry?'' she said in a report to clients yesterday. ''Could it be that a revenue wall is in sight -- for SouthTrust and for others?''
 Analysts worry that banks like Wachovia are returning to the old patterns of the late 1990's, when they went on a buying spree just before the economy slumped. It took several quarters for the earnings of these banks to recover. 
 ''Whenever the brass ring comes up at Wachovia they take it away from you,'' Mr. Bove said. ''Whenever they are starting to show the benefits of the last deal, they go off and do another one.'' Yesterday, he reduced his rating on the stock to neutral from strong buy and in a report urged investors to ''stay away.''
 When Mr. Thompson took over as chief executive of First Union in March 2000, the bank was reeling from acquisitions by his predecessor, Edward E. Crutchfield Jr. One of the banks, CoreStates Financial, was bought in 1997 for $17.1 billion, or six times book value. The same year, the bank paid $2 billion for the Money Store, a lender to consumers considered high credit risks. Mr. Thompson ended up writing off that deal for $3.8 billion, then one of the most expensive write-offs by an American company. 
 In contrast, the merger between Wachovia and First Union has been a huge success, in part, analysts have said, because the banks allowed two years for the integration to be completed. Wachovia's stock price is up nearly 29 percent since that deal was completed in September 2001.
 In the latest deal, Mr. Thompson is allowing 15 months to combine Wachovia and SouthTrust, in part because the overlap between the two banks is relatively modest. Mr. Thompson also argues that the merger will accelerate its planned expansion into Texas. Wachovia was planning on opening 250 branches in Texas over the next five years. Now, with SouthTrust already a presence in the state, it will need to open only 100 branches to meet its goals. 
 Mr. Thompson said he was not worried that rising rates will hurt the earnings potential of the combined bank, noting that rising rates signal a better economy. That will bolster the prospects for commercial lending, a strength of SouthTrust.
 Wachovia also anticipates that it will have $1.7 billion in excess capital available after the merger to buy back stock. 
 Wachovia's shares fell $1.98 yesterday, or 4 percent, to $45.02 on the announcement of the SouthTrust purchase.
 But Wachovia stockholders can find some consolation in the revival of Bank of America's stock price since its merger was announced. The shares, which fell more than 10 percent after reports of the FleetBoston purchase, have rebounded and closed at $84.94 yesterday, compared with $81.86 before the deal was disclosed.
 Mr. Bove also takes some small comfort from the fact that most of the major United States banks have announced big purchases, which at least means that they will be too preoccupied to do any other deals in the near term. 
 ''We're getting to the end of it,'' he said of the recent big bank merger wave.

HEADLINE: Oracle Weighed Bids for Others in Software Before Aiming at PeopleSoft

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 21 

 BODY:
The Oracle Corporation considered buying Lawson Software Inc. and J.D. Edwards about two months before its $7.7 billion bid to acquire PeopleSoft, according to court testimony on Monday. The federal government is seeking to block Oracle's takeover on grounds that it would crimp competition and drive up software prices for major businesses and government agencies.
 Videotaped testimony yesterday from Jeffrey O. Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer, came at the start of the third week of the trial in federal court in San Francisco. 
 Mr. Henley said that in April 2003, Oracle's board considered buying J.D. Edwards and Lawson Software to establish a ''better presence'' in the so-called midmarket software segment serving medium-size companies. PeopleSoft later bought J.D. Edwards.
 The government's lead lawyer, Claude Scott, suggested that Oracle, in considering whether to buy J.D. Edwards and Lawson, was distinguishing between software producers that cater to small- and medium-size companies and those that cater to larger ones. 
 That could blunt Oracle's argument that companies like Lawson already operate in the high-function ''upmarket'' software arena and would provide competition for a merged company. The Justice Department has argued that there is a distinction between the markets and that removing either PeopleSoft or Oracle from one would lead to higher software prices.
 Also on Monday, Oracle's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, said in videotaped testimony in federal court that the software vendors Siebel Systems and BEA Systems Inc. were potential acquisitions for Oracle. Mr. Ellison said such companies could have helped Oracle achieve the type of scale it needed to compete with rivals like Microsoft and I.B.M. 
 In addition, an antitrust expert testified that his analysis showed a merger would cause high-function software prices to rise 5 percent to 30 percent. Preston McAfee, an economics professor at the California Institute of Technology, said the increases would occur because the two companies, in direct competition with each other, often offered discounts.
 The merger ''will increase license and maintenance prices for high-function human resources maintenance and financial management systems software,'' said Mr. McAfee, a government witness.
 The government also raised the issue of whether Oracle would continue to provide service to clients using PeopleSoft products after a potential merger.
 Mr. Henley said Oracle would make ''minor enhancements'' and fix PeopleSoft software bugs but would not make major architectural improvements or invest time in building a new PeopleSoft product.
 Mr. Henley said Oracle would honor all existing PeopleSoft contracts that require PeopleSoft to build new ''functionality'' into software it has already sold.
 ''We'll support PeopleSoft's products for 10 years or longer,'' Mr. Henley said. ''We'd make enhancements.''

HEADLINE: Saying 'economic expectations are much brighter,' a longtime forecaster raises his spending estimates.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
A LEADING forecaster of advertising spending raised his estimates for 2004 yesterday, citing the improving economy, and offered an optimistic outlook in his first assessment of 2005.
 But the forecaster, Robert J. Coen, reduced his prediction for ad spending growth in local media across the country, citing softness in categories like retail and classifieds.
 In his annual midyear presentation, Mr. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, lifted his estimate for the growth of combined national and local ad spending in the United States to 7.3 percent this year compared with 2003. In December, he had forecast a gain of 6.9 percent in 2004. 
 ''The economic expectations are much brighter,'' Mr. Coen said. ''We are more confident a sustained economic expansion is in place'' -- unless of course, he added later, there is ''a disaster somewhere, which can blow everything out of the water.''
 An 7.3 percent increase would be the largest since 2000, when American ad spending rose 11.3 percent from 1999. (Spending fell 6.5 percent in 2001, the first decline since 1991 and the largest since 1938; it rebounded 2.4 percent in 2002 and 3.6 percent last year.)
 Next year, ad spending in the United States should grow an additional 6.5 percent over 2004, Mr. Coen said. Universal McCann is part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 Ad spending is closely watched as an economic barometer, not only because of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year but also because the spending can offer a glimpse into the mind-sets of marketers. For instance, a company that plans to significantly increase ad spending may also be planning to significantly expand its work force, equipment purchases or plant construction.
 Mr. Coen, who has been tracking ad-spending since the Truman administration, has joined a lengthening list of forecasters and analysts who recently raised their estimates for how quickly ad spending will grow in the United States this year.
 Lauren Rich Fine, the advertising analyst for Merrill Lynch, increased her forecast this week to a gain of 6.6 percent from an earlier forecasted increase of 6 percent. And last week, TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres, increased its prediction for ad spending in major American media to a gain of 9.3 percent, compared with an earlier estimate of 7.8 percent.
 ''There are lurching improvements in U.S. ad-spend growth'' at different rates across the different media, said Leland Westerfield, a managing director at the Harris Nesbitt Corporation in New York who follows media and entertainment stocks. He attended Mr. Coen's presentation at the Midtown office of the McCann Worldgroup.
 While the growth in radio ad revenue has been disappointing, Mr. Westerfield said, ''newer forms of media like local cable and the Internet are having strong growth.''
 Although local cable ad revenue may be growing, sluggishness in spending in other local media led Mr. Coen to reduce his overall estimate for local ad spending in 2004. Rather than growing at what he called a respectable clip of 6 percent, which he had forecast in December, he said he now expected a gain of 5.5 percent.
 Classified ads in local newspapers, though lagging, may ''get quite a bit stronger as the year unfolds,'' if economic recovery continues, he said.
 The growth that Mr. Coen predicts for this year comes from his increase in the estimate he made for ad spending in national media to 8.3 percent, from an estimate of 7.4 percent in December. He listed among the more robust potential performers the Internet, up 20 percent; cable TV, up 14 percent; and syndicated TV, up 13 percent. Magazines, sluggish for a year, trail other national consumer media with a projected gain of 5 percent, behind rivals like newspapers, up 6.5 percent, and radio, up 7 percent.
 Among the national ad categories expected to stand out, Mr. Coen listed drugs and remedies; toiletries and cosmetics; automobiles; dot-com brands advertising off-line in media like TV and print; beverages and snacks; and liquor. He also said he expected comebacks in several categories that were ''down so low'' last year, among them airlines; banks; brokers and mutual funds; insurance; and resorts.
 Mr. Coen typically makes two forecasts a year, revising his estimates as data is updated. The forecast for 2004 is somewhat better than in December, he said, because a recovery in advertising ''is beginning to catch on.''
 For one thing, he added, there is more confidence that the economy is expanding, which encourages advertisers to spend more. For another, the national elections and the Summer Olympics will stimulate ad sales. While advertising typically grows every four years when the presidential election and the Summer Games coincide -- a phenomenon known on Madison Avenue as the quadrennial effect -- the spending for both will be strong in 2004, Mr. Coen said.
 If the effect can be likened to a hypodermic needle, Mr. Coen said, there will be ''a little more juicy needle this year.'' Election spending, to promote candidates for the presidential, congressional and other races, may reach as much as $1.5 billion, he added, and marketers spending to promote Olympic sponsorships and campaigns may add another $500 million to the total.
 For 2004, Mr. Coen predicts ad spending in this country will total $263.3 billion, which would surpass the earlier record for American ad spending of $247.5 billion, set in 2000. By comparison, ad spending in the United States last year totaled $245.5 billion, he said, revising downward the forecast he made in December that 2003 would end at $249.2 billion. He reduced the total because, he said, ''we thought the fourth quarter would have a nice surge in ad spending'' that did not materialize.
 ''It's in place now,'' he added, resulting in his increasing the growth rate for 2004. (Because Mr. Coen lowered his total for 2003, the percentage increase for 2004 is higher than it was in his December forecast even though his total for 2004 is less than the $266.4 billion he predicted then.) 
 Mr. Coen also raised his estimate for ad spending growth overseas. In December, he had forecast a gain of 4.5 percent from 2003, but he has raised it to a gain of 4.8 percent. The change resulted from forecasts for growth in the economies of almost all major ad markets abroad, Mr. Coen said, including those in Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan and Mexico as well as gains in countries like China, Indonesia and Russia.
 The overseas total for 2004 is $256.1 billion, compared with $244.4 billion for 2003; the figure for last year was increased from a December estimate of $221.9 billion because of exchange rates that saw many overseas currencies appreciate considerably.
 Combining Mr. Coen's forecasts for ad spending domestically and internationally, the total would make 2004 the first year in which ad spending would, as he put it, pass the half-trillion mark. The forecast of $519.4 billion would be up 6 percent from his final total of $489.9 billion for 2003.
 The first forecast for overseas spending Mr. Coen made for 2005 calls for a total of $270 billion, up 5.5 percent from his expected 2004 total of $256.1 billion. Combining that with his initial American estimate for next year of $280 billion would bring the 2005 total to $555 billion, up 5.9 percent from his 2004 total.

PERSON: Bernard S. Baker

HEADLINE: Bernard S. Baker, 67, a Pioneer In the Development of Fuel Cells

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Bernard S. Baker, a chemical engineer whose research and entrepreneurial instincts spurred the development of large stationary fuel cells for industry, died on Monday at the Bethel Health Care Center in Bethel, Conn. He was 67.
 The cause was a series of strokes resulting from cancer, his son William V. Baker said. 
 Dr. Baker was the leading champion of efforts to develop a high-temperature fuel cell to be used as a reliable, economical power source for buildings and the electrical grid. He was the chairman and chief executive of FuelCell Energy of Danbury, Conn., a company he founded in 1970 with other researchers. Today, the company is the major vendor of such fuel cells.
 Fuel cells create electrical current with almost no air pollution through chemical reactions that combine hydrogen with air. The first such cell was invented in 1839. But the technology had come to be seen as a scientific oddity with scant practical potential when Dr. Baker was exposed to it in 1959 as a Fulbright fellow working under G.H.J. Broers, a Dutch scientist, at the Laboratory for Electrochemistry at the University of Amsterdam.
 Most fuel cells get their hydrogen from an external device called a reformer that extracts the hydrogen from natural gas or some other hydrocarbon fuel. Dr. Broers had pioneered a high-temperature design built around molten salts that could extract hydrogen from fuel within the cell, skipping the reformer step.
 In its early years, Dr. Baker's company, then called the Energy Research Corporation, survived largely on federal research contracts and worked on advanced battery technologies as well as fuel cells. 
 Dr. Baker turned over management of the company to Jerry D. Leitman in 1997. Since then, the molten carbonate design has gained acceptance as a reliable power source, although it cannot yet compete with traditional electrical power without government subsidy. In addition to the molten carbonate cells, the company is working on other fuel cell designs as it searches for a strategy to become profitable.
 Dr. Baker was born in Philadelphia on June 26, 1936, the son of William V. Baker, a chemicals salesman, and Bessie Weinstein Baker. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. After his studies in Amsterdam, he worked on fuel cells and related energy chemistry as a senior scientist in the missile and space division of Lockheed Aircraft and at the Institute of Gas Technology in Chicago. He received his Ph.D. from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1969.
 Dr. Baker's survivors include his wife of 45 years, Cornelia Markey Baker of Bethel; four children -- William of New Milford, Conn.; Stephen Baker of Peru, N.Y.; Jennifer Baker of Monkton, Vt.; and Suzanne Lamerand of Collegeville, Pa., as well as three grandchildren.

PERSON: Leonel Brizola

HEADLINE: Leonel Brizola, 82, Dies; Opposed Military Rule in Brazil

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, June 22 

 BODY:
Leonel Brizola, the former governor of Rio de Janeiro state and a veteran leftist whose role in trying to head off a military coup in the early 1960's made him a towering figure in Brazilian politics, died Monday night at a hospital near his home in the Copacabana district in Rio de Janeiro. He was 82.
 The cause was a heart attack, officials of Sao Lucas Hospital announced. He had checked in earlier in the day with a serious cold and a lung infection, they said. 
 A fiery populist whose political career spanned almost 60 years, Mr. Brizola became a national figure in the 1960's, when Brazilian politics were increasingly polarized between a left that sympathized with communism and a conservative establishment backed by the armed forces. Some observers have even speculated that Mr. Brizola, a rising star at the time, was the real target of the 1964 military coup that toppled President Joao Goulart.
 Leonel de Moura Brizola (pronounced bree-ZO-la) was born on Jan. 22, 1922, in the rural town of Cruzinha, in Brazil's southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul. The youngest son of subsistence farmers, Mr. Brizola learned to read and write at home from his mother. At 14, he moved to Porto Alegre, the state capital, where he worked as a shoeshine boy and elevator operator before studying engineering at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.
 His political career began at the age of 25 in 1947, when he won a seat in the state legislature for the Brazilian Labor Party, which he had joined two years earlier. In 1954, Mr. Brizola was elected to Congress as a federal deputy.
 But his stay in Rio, which was still the country's capital at that time, was short-lived. In 1955 Mr. Brizola was elected mayor of Porto Alegre, and three years later, he won the gubernatorial race in Rio Grande do Sul. At 36, he became the youngest state governor in Brazilian history.
 As governor, Mr. Brizola became known as a radical leftist and an economic nationalist, expropriating two American-owned utility companies without providing compensation. But he also used his influence to cement his reputation as a staunch defender of democracy.
 When President Janio Quadros resigned after less than a year on the job in August 1961, the military sought to block his vice president, the left-leaning Mr. Goulart, from taking office. That prompted Mr. Brizola, who had married Mr. Goulart's sister 11 years earlier, to start a nationwide campaign in favor of the constitution that eventually allowed Mr. Goulart to become president.
 By 1964, Mr. Brizola was widely viewed as a possible successor to Mr. Goulart, whose term was set to end in 1965. But before elections could take place, the armed forces overthrew Mr. Goulart's government, fearing he intended to install a Cuban-style Communist regime in Brazil. Twenty-one years of military dictatorship ensued.
 Both Mr. Goulart and Mr. Brizola were forced into exile in Uruguay. Mr. Brizola also lived in the United States and Portugal before returning to Brazil in 1979, when an amnesty law was passed that set the stage for the return to democracy in 1985.
 Back in Brazil, he quickly returned to politics, founding the Democratic Labor Party, and was elected governor of Rio de Janeiro state in 1982 and 1990. He ran for president and lost in 1989 and 1994, and in 1998 he was Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's running mate in a race won by Fernando Henrique Cardoso. In 2000 Mr. Brizola ran for mayor of Rio de Janeiro but got just 9 percent of the vote, and in 2002 he failed to win a Senate seat.
 Though many Brazilians saw him as an aging strongman of a bygone era, Mr. Brizola commanded a strong emotional following on the left, especially in Rio. His political views remained almost unchanged since the 1960's. Until his death, he advocated a militant form of economic nationalism, liberal benefits for government employees and a generous education policy.
 Mr. Brizola's radical politics eventually put him at odds with Mr. da Silva, the former union leader who was elected president in October 2002 in his fourth bid for the presidency. Mr. Brizola backed Mr. da Silva in his first year in office, but broke with the government in December, alleging that the president had abandoned his leftist roots.
 Mr. Brizola is survived by three sons. His wife, Neuza, died in 1993.

HEADLINE: ELECTRONIC CARDS REPLACE COUPONS FOR FOOD STAMPS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Mary Spicuzza contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22 

 BODY:
The Bush administration announced Tuesday that it had completed one of the biggest changes in the history of the food stamp program, replacing paper coupons with electronic benefits and debit cards.
 At the same time, the administration said it wanted to rename the program because the term ''food stamps'' had become an anachronism. It is inviting the public to suggest how to update the name of a program that became a permanent part of the government, and the nation's vocabulary, during Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society era. 
 Electronic benefits have replaced food stamp coupons in all states, and more than half the states now issue electronic benefits in place of welfare checks as well. In addition, some states are using debit cards for Medicaid and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. 
 Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman declared an end to the ''paper era'' of the food stamp program on Tuesday at a conference of state officials here.
 ''This month the food stamp program arrived in the 21st century,'' Ms. Veneman said. ''States are destroying the paper coupons, and we don't anticipate that we'll ever have to print them again.''
 Food stamp recipients generally like debit cards because they avoid the stigma that can be associated with the use of paper coupons. Grocers like the new technology because they are paid faster, often within 48 hours; cashiers do not have to handle vouchers; and there are no coupons to sort, count and bundle. 
 State officials said they preferred the electronic system because it was simpler to administer and helped reduce fraud and abuse by eliminating the paper coupons that can be lost, sold or stolen. Over the years, food stamps have been sold on the black market and used as a form of currency to buy narcotics and other contraband. 
 More than 23 million people receive food stamp benefits each month, but nationwide only three of five eligible people are participating. Unlike most other assistance programs, food stamps are available to most low-income households with few assets regardless of age, disability or family structure.
 States experienced a number of problems when they began testing electronic benefit technology in a few counties 20 years ago. But most of those problems have been worked out, officials said. 
 California was the last state to complete the shift. Christine Dunham of the state's Health and Human Services Agency said that Los Angeles County, with 40 percent of the state's food stamp recipients, made the change to electronic benefits in March, and six other counties switched over this month. 
 Under the new system, each recipient has an account in which benefits are electronically deposited each month. A food stamp recipient can draw on the account in the checkout line of a grocery store, by sliding a plastic card through the same device used by other customers paying with commercial debit or credit cards. The food stamp recipient needs to punch in a four-digit personal identification number. The account is debited for the precise amount of the transaction, and food stamp recipients do not get cash back in change. 
 Connie B. Reinhardt, the electronic benefits director at the Florida Department of Children and Families, said the new technology had produced an increase in the use of food stamp benefits there because recipients no longer had to go to a state office once a month to pick up coupons. In the past, she said, about 15 percent of the people enrolled in the Florida program failed to pick up the vouchers to which they were entitled.
 The number of people in the national food stamp program has shot up by 6.5 million, or 38 percent, in the last three years and by 2.8 million, or 13 percent, just in the last year, to 23.8 million in March 2004.
 The soft economy is one reason for the increase. Another factor is that the government has been encouraging eligible people to participate, emphasizing that the program is not welfare but nutrition assistance.
 Frederick Henry, 35, of West Palm Beach, Fla., said the electronic benefit system ''gives you a lot more privacy in purchasing merchandise.'' By contrast, he said, ''it was sometimes embarrassing'' to use paper coupons. ''It would lower your self-esteem. People would hiss at you and look at you funny because you were holding up the line.''
 As a teenager, Mr. Henry said, he saw ''addicts who would trade food stamps for drugs even though they had sick children starving.'' Now, he said, ''you have no choice but to purchase food.''
 Another food stamp recipient, Jessette Santiago of New York City, said the electronic benefits helped her manage spending on groceries. ''The more money you have in your hand,'' she said, ''the more you spend. But with electronic benefit transfer, I budget myself for the month. I have three kids and I get $364 a month, so I spend about $100 a week.''
 Outside the Community Kitchen of West Harlem, which serves 800 dinners a day to low-income people in New York, opinion was divided. 
 Robbin Smoke, 44, said she would prefer to have the paper coupons. ''The cards don't always work,'' she said. ''It's a pain. You can't get cash back now.''
 She and several other food stamp recipients said they found it somewhat easier to keep track of their unused benefits when they had a booklet of paper coupons. 
 Phillip Harrison, 67, of Manhattan, said he would take either form of assistance, ''as long as I have something to eat.''
 The food stamp program has its roots in the Depression era. It operated as a temporary measure from 1939 to 1943. After 18 years of studies and legislative debate, it was restarted as a pilot program in 1961 and made permanent three years later as part of President Johnson's Great Society.
 In signing the law on Aug. 31, 1964, Johnson said the program, ''one of our most valuable weapons for the war on poverty,'' combines humanitarian instincts with the best of the free-enterprise system, improving the diets of low-income people ''while strengthening markets for the farmer and immeasurably improving the volume of retail food sales.''
 As part of the 2002 farm bill, Congress revised the food stamp program to encourage participation by more of the working poor. A major goal was to ''make work pay,'' said Robert Greenstein, a former head of the Food and Nutrition Service who is now executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

HEADLINE: France Steps Up Its Investments in Iran

BYLINE: By BORZOU DARAGAHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran 

 BODY:
Undeterred by Iran's pariah status in the United States and by the shortcomings of the country's commercial climate, French companies have been increasing their presence in the country in the last few years. 
 New Peugeots and Citrons flood crowded highways and streets. French business people dine in the capital's restaurants and work on Persian Gulf oil platforms. Air France resumed flights to Tehran this month after a seven-year hiatus. And the carmaker Renault is about to make the first large-scale, long-term direct investment in the country by a French company since the 1979 revolution that toppled the pro-American Shah Reza Pahlavi. 
 ''The French are eager to come to Iran,'' said Bernard Hourcade, a Paris-based Iran scholar who acts as a consultant to French companies considering doing business here. ''It is the only major place in the Middle East to invest because the other countries are more or less in a revolutionary or prerevolutionary situation.'' 
 Though companies from Germany and the United Arab Emirates have a bigger presence in Iran, France is catching up. 
 French exports to Iran have nearly doubled in five years, totaling 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in 2003, according to the economic mission of the French embassy in Tehran. And the number of French-connected companies registered with the embassy -- some of which are joint ventures and some representative offices -- has risen from a handful several years ago to more than 40.
 Among the French exports are luxury goods, for Iran's increasingly affluent middle class. If even a fraction of Iran's 68 million people are ''rather prosperous,'' one Western diplomat said, that could exceed the total population of all the smaller, wealthier gulf kingdoms combined. 
 The Iranian business of Socit Gnrale, one of a handful of French banks with small offices in Tehran, has grown roughly 20 percent a year in the last five years, according to Jean-Michel Meunier, the bank's Tehran chief.
 Alcatel, the French telecommunications giant, recently signed multimillion-dollar contracts to provide high-speed Internet service in Iran as well as communications for offshore oil and gas platforms. 
 PSA Peugeot Citron, under a licensing agreement, sells kits for several models, including the Peugeot 206, a sports car that has become a status symbol in Tehran's chic sections. 
 The Total Group, one of the world's largest energy concerns, has long been involved in Iran, a country with 9 percent of the world's oil reserves and as much as 18 percent of its natural gas reserves. This year, it formed a $2 billion venture with the government-owned National Iranian Oil Corporation and Petronas of Malaysia called Pars LNG, which aims to produce eight million metric tons of liquefied natural gas a year, equal to about 15 percent of current world output.
 Total executives in Paris would not comment on Middle East operations. A spokeswoman said the company employed 242 people on its Iran projects.
 But Total's buyback agreements with Iran, under which it builds plants and then is paid back and sent on its way as its operations produce energy, means it never owns anything long term in Iran. Peugeot employs only 15 people to oversee the assembly of its cars by local employees of the government-owned factories. Alcatel sells and installs equipment. Socit Gnrale's business here is also limited, consisting mostly of setting up transfers and repatriating funds.
 Far more ambitious is Renault's plan to begin making its low-budget Logan series cars here in 2006, eventually bringing hundreds of Western experts to Iran. Renault says it will initially spend 300 million euros ($363 million), and some people close to the deal say the company could lay out $700 million over the next several years. The initial outlay alone nearly equals the total foreign investment in Iran by French companies in 2002, the last year for which statistics were available from the French economics mission, up from zero in 1994.
 Under the agreement, Renault owns 51 percent of the joint venture, Renault Pars, with the Automotive Industry Development Company, a concern owned by the country's two main, government-controlled carmakers, the Saipa Group and the Iran Khodro Industrial Group.
 The car is coming on line just as the Iranians begin halting production of the clunky, fuel-guzzling Paykan, a knockoff of the 1960's British Hillman Hunter that dominates the domestic market.
 ''The Renault investment will encourage other companies to come,'' the Western diplomat said, adding that the company would bring along many subcontractors.
 Executives for Renault, which is 15 percent owned by the French government, were not made available for comment.
 Iran is among several developing countries, including Romania, where Renault is bolstering its presence.
 ''Four-fifths of the world's population don't yet have access to a car: these markets therefore have the highest potential for growth,'' Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chief executive, says on the company's Web site. According to Peugeot, Iran has 1 car for every 21 inhabitants, compared with 1 for every 12 in neighboring Turkey, another developing Muslim country.
 The country produced 600,000 new cars in the fiscal year that ended March 20, up from 430,000 in the previous year. This year, the country is slated to produce nearly 900,000 cars. 
 Despite such potential, many Western companies doing business in Iran do so clandestinely, worried they will cross the United States, which has imposed strict sanctions on Iran since 1996. At least one major French company in Iran with significant United States operations has not registered with the French embassy. The front door to its office in Iran says simply, ''French company.''
 While American officials have not said anything publicly about Renault, they did complain about Total's recent deal and said they would look at possible actions under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. 
 ''We do not encourage investment in Iran's petroleum sector,'' said Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman, according to an Associated Press report in February. ''We have laws that affect our attitudes toward these investments. And we will have to look at those laws appropriately.''
 State Department officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But trade experts said they did not think the act, which allows for the imposition of penalties on foreign companies for certain large investments in Iran, had ever been invoked. 
 ''As to whether the U.S. has actually sanctioned any firms for prohibited investments in Iran, there is not much of a track record,'' said Donald A. Weadon Jr., a Washington lawyer specializing in foreign trade sanctions. ''But companies are investigated, and pressure is brought to deter investment.''
 And, he said, other sanctions and embargos are being imposed.
 According to Mr. Hourcade, the consultant, the companies are mostly worried that they will have trouble running their businesses without access to products -- like software or spare parts -- made by American companies, which are barred from doing business with Iran.
 An executive of a multinational with a big United States business said his company decided to open an office here in part to keep an eye on its competitors and not be totally clueless about Iran should Washington lift sanctions. 
 ''So many companies are here, but they're keeping a very low profile and you can't figure out what they're doing here,'' he said, asking his name and his company's not be used.
 Iran's business climate also poses formidable challenges, including a byzantine regulatory system and unorthodox accounting practices that sometimes have left companies wondering whether they will be able to repatriate any profits.
 The country has worked hard to draw foreign investment, with officials vowing to remove red tape and saying that foreign investors now can establish a company in Iran and own 100 percent of it.
 Still, one person involved in the Renault Pars deal said that problems had already begun. Though the company is nominally French-controlled, he said, the Iranian manufacturers can override Renault's decisions.
 Western business leaders here also complain of a lack of demographic and marketing data. Half of the country's cars, for example, are registered in Tehran. But Peugeot -- whose business in Iran is its third largest non-European operation, behind China and Brazil -- found that many of those living along the cool, rainy Caspian coastline register their cars in the relatively warm, dry capital, to increase resale values. 
 And though the Peugeot 206 is selling, said Jacques Manlay, the Tehran representative for Peugeot, no one is sure why and to whom. ''All I know,'' he said, ''is that it's a car for the young lady in the north of Tehran.''

HEADLINE: South Korean Is Killed in Iraq By His Captors

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and JAMES GLANZ; Edward Wong reported from Baghdad for this article, and James Glanz from Basra.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 22 

 BODY:
A South Korean interpreter who dreamed of becoming a Christian missionary in the Arab world was beheaded Tuesday by the insurgents who held him captive after his abduction five days ago near Falluja. 
 The execution was carried out after the South Korean government rejected the captors' demand that it halt the scheduled deployment of an additional 3,000 troops to Iraq in August. A videotape broadcast on Al Jazeera television showed the victim, Kim Sun Il, sitting or kneeling quietly in an orange jumpsuit and blindfolded with an orange cloth. Five masked men, three cradling guns and one with a sheathed knife, stand behind him. 
 ''Your army has not come here for the sake of Iraqis but for cursed America,'' one of the men says. 
 Al Jazeera, which did not show the killing, reported that the men then beheaded Mr. Kim. The killers were believed to be members of a group called Jamaat al-Tawhid and Jihad, which is linked to the Jordanian terrorist, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The Central Intelligence Agency has said Mr. Zarqawi was the man seen beheading Nicholas Berg, an American who had been kidnapped, on a tape circulated on the Internet. 
 Hours later, the United States military carried out an airstrike in Falluja on what a general called a ''known Zarqawi network'' safe house, The Associated Press reported. Four people were killed and six wounded, according to witnesses and a hospital official. 
 President Bush said Mr. Kim's beheading was another futile effort to drive the United States and its allies out of the country. ''They want us to cower in the face of their brutal killings,'' he said, ''and the United States will not be intimidated by these people.'' 
 This was the third beheading in the Middle East in the last several weeks. Last Friday, Saudi members of a cell suspected of being linked to Al Qaeda decapitated Paul M. Johnson Jr., an abducted American engineer. Mr. Berg was killed last month. 
 American soldiers found the body of Mr. Kim, 33, between Baghdad and Falluja, the volatile Sunni city 35 miles west of the capital. ''It appears that the body had been thrown from a vehicle,'' Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a spokesman for the occupation forces, said Tuesday in a statement to The Associated Press. ''The man had been beheaded, and the head was recovered with the body.'' 
 In southern Iraq, one of two great pipelines began flowing with oil again after a pair of explosions shut down oil exports last week. Investigators were focusing on current and former employees of the state-owned South Oil Company who may have given inside information to the saboteurs, government officials and engineers at the company said Tuesday. 
 But as oil began flowing in the south, a huge new explosion ripped through a pipeline running from Bayji to a key refinery in Baghdad. Plumes of dark smoke rose above the blast, 20 miles north of Baghdad. 
 The devastating effect of the two southern explosions, which were placed with surgical precision amid the welter of buried gas, water, oil and petrochemical pipelines crisscrossing the open desert, immediately raised suspicions that someone inside the company was involved. 
 ''That's very likely and very possible,'' said Walid Khadduri, an Iraqi who is the editor of the Middle Eastern Economic Survey and an authority on Iraq's oil industry. 
 Although earlier pipeline attacks have also suggested that the attackers had inside help, ''they have never accused anyone publicly,'' Mr. Khadduri said of Iraqi officials. 
 Elsewhere, two American soldiers were killed by enemy fire in Balad, north of Baghdad. The dean of the law school at Mosul University and her husband were shot and killed, and two Iraqis died in a car bombing in Baghdad. 
 [A roadside bomb exploded near Kindi Hospital in Baghdad on Wednesday, killing at least two civilians, one of them a child, Reuters reported, quoting police sources. American military had no immediate information about the explosion.] 
 In all the recent beheadings, the victims were wearing orange shirts similar to prison jumpsuits. Some analysts have speculated that the jumpsuits are meant to evoke the humiliations of Muslim men at the Abu Ghraib prison and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
 Mr. Kim was kidnapped Thursday as he was returning to Baghdad in a civilian convoy that had left an American military base 120 miles west of the capital. 
 He had been working for a South Korean company that supplied goods to the American military, and held degrees in Arabic, English and theology. He was working in Iraq to earn enough money to carry on his studies, his sister said. 
 Militants released a videotape on Sunday in which they demanded that the South Korean government abandon its deployment plans within 24 hours or receive the head of Mr. Kim. 
 Hundreds of South Koreans held candlelight vigils and joined prayer groups on Monday to ask for Mr. Kim's release and to beseech their government to negotiate with the captors. Officials rejected the insurgents' demand, and the Monday night deadline came and went with no news of Mr. Kim's fate. 
 But the worst fears of Mr. Kim's family and friends were realized on Tuesday night, when Al Jazeera showed part of the videotape of his death. 
 The video showed a large black banner with a yellow circle hanging on a wall behind the men. Words at the bottom revealed the name of the group, Jamaat al-Tawhid and Jihad, which means Monotheism and Holy Struggle. A standard Islamic saying runs across the top of the banner: ''There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.'' 
 A similar banner was left behind by insurgents who staged a brazen daylight assault in February on the main police station in Falluja. That city remains the single most problematic place for the occupation forces in Iraq. In early May, marines withdrew from the city and turned it over to a 2,000-strong militia composed partly of insurgents, and Falluja now remains firmly in the hands of hard-line Sunni clerics and guerrilla fighters. 
 Last Saturday, an American jet fired missiles at what General Kimmitt said was another suspected Zarqawi safe house in Falluja. At least 26 people were killed. 
 It was unclear whether Mr. Kim was killed by the same people who had kidnapped him. Insurgents have announced rewards for the abduction of foreigners from countries that have sent soldiers to Iraq. 
 Scores of foreigners have been kidnapped since the bloody uprising in April, and many are still being held. 
 Kim Chun Ho, the head of the Gana Trading Company, which employed Mr. Kim, has told the Yonhap news agency that several other foreign contractors were traveling in the same convoy with Mr. Kim and were also kidnapped. 
 He said those contractors were working for Kellogg, Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton and the largest private supplier to the American forces. The company said Tuesday that it could not confirm the kidnappings. 
 South Korea has 660 noncombat troops in Iraq. The addition of the 3,000 in August would make the country's deployment here the third largest, behind the United States and Britain. 
 Polls in South Korea show that a majority of people there oppose their government's participation in the war. The government released a statement on Tuesday emphasizing that the troop deployment is ''for reconstruction and humanitarian aid support.'' 
 Insurgents have pursued a strategy of punishing countries that join in the occupation. In April, fighters killed one of four Italian hostages but released the others. A Japanese photographer and two nonprofit workers were kidnapped in April and eventually released. In both cases, the countries refused to negotiate with the captors. 
 Many of the hostages who have been released have won their freedom through the mediation of Sunni clerics. Earlier on Tuesday, wire services reported that an Iraqi mediator said he had seen Mr. Kim alive and that the captors had agreed to extend talks.

HEADLINE: National Labor Group Takes Over L.I. Union

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In what it called a rare step, the national office of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. took over a Long Island unit yesterday and appointed a regional director as trustee after an audit showed financial irregularities. 
 The unit, the Long Island Federation of Labor in Farmingdale, is an umbrella organization for more than 300,000 union members and is Long Island's largest union group.
 In a statement, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. cited an independent auditor's preliminary report that showed ''a disturbing pattern of financial improprieties and financial mismanagement of funds'' for the Long Island Federation Workforce Development Center, a federation project. 
 The immediate consequence of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s action is the suspension of Jack Caffey, the longtime president of the federation, and his replacement with Jose Alvarez, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. regional director. There was no response last night to messages left at Mr. Caffey's home in West Babylon, in Suffolk County.
 The federation, a group that covers occupations like sailors, hospital workers and truck drivers, has a total annual budget of about $250,000, Mr. Alvarez said.
 Mr. Alvarez said he would expand the investigation to the Long Island federation. The preliminary audit, by the firm of Buchbinder Tunick & Company of Manhattan, focused only on the development center.
 In an interview yesterday, Mr. Alvarez declined to comment on an article in Newsday in April that made reference to embezzlement and that said the investigation focused on one employee and $150,000 in financial irregularities.
 ''That there are improprieties and mismanagement there is no doubt,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''That is why we have acted.''
 He said he did not know how long the takeover would last. ''We won't be able to finish in a month,'' he said. ''But we hope to finish as quickly as possible. To a certain extent, I'm walking into the night here and still evaluating where we are.''
 The training center offers instruction in English as a second language, computer training and other classes intended to help laid-off workers, especially those hurt by the post-Sept. 11, 2001, economy.
 The federation, which began an inquiry in March, has already forwarded information about the inquiry to the Suffolk County district attorney, Thomas J. Spota, as well as to the office of the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. 
 Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer, would say only that the matter was under review. Mr. Spota's office did not return a call.

HEADLINE: Amid an Apartment Glut, Building Prices Move Up

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Like many cities, Dallas has suffered from a glut of apartments in recent years as low interest rates have turned many renters into home buyers and a weak job market has forced young tenants to double up or live with their parents. With vacancy rates in Dallas at 10 percent or so, rents have continued to drop and landlords have been forced to offer inducements like a month or more of free rent or department store gift certificates to attract tenants.
 Yet prices paid by buyers of apartment buildings have continued to rise. In June 2002, Summit Properties, a publicly traded company based in Charlotte, N.C., paid $17.7 million to buy the San Raphael, a luxury complex near the Galleria mall in Dallas, where the apartments have bay windows, balconies with French doors and wood-burning fireplaces.
 One year later, the company put the 222-unit complex on the market and received nearly two dozen offers. Summit sold the San Raphael to the Hayman Company, a private investor in Troy, Mich., for about $19.1 million. While only an 8 percent increase in price, on a leveraged basis this would result in a return on investment of 15 percent or more, a real estate specialist said. 
 In the Seattle area, where the vacancy rate is about 8 percent, a private investment company, the Prometheus Real Estate Group of Redwood City, Calif., paid $19.1 million in February for the 260-unit Mission Ridge apartment complex in suburban Renton. The seller, Waterton Associates, a Chicago investment company that forms joint ventures with pension funds, bought the property in October 2002, for $15.6 million.
 Across the country, trading in apartment properties is continuing at a feverish pace, despite a national vacancy rate that stood at 7.1 percent in the first quarter, the highest level since 1987 and four percentage points higher than it was at the end of 2000, according to Reis Inc., a New York research firm.
 About $2.6 billion worth of significant deals were reported in the first five months of the year, nearly twice the volume during the corresponding period last year, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm that tracks transactions of more than $5 million. And buyers have been willing to accept very low rates of return on their initial investment -- now at an average of 6.5 percent, or two points less than what they were two years ago. 
 The bulk of these buyers are private investors who are able to finance as much as 95 percent of the deal. This month, the Lembi family, the owners of 110 apartment buildings in San Francisco, bought seven small buildings in Pacific Heights, Noe Valley and Haight-Ashbury for $26.3 million, borrowing 88 percent of that amount, said Walt Lembi, the managing partner. The initial rate of return is pegged at 4.75 percent, said the Lembis' broker. 
 That is much less than what a real estate investment trust or pension fund would be allowed to accept, said James DeVincenti, a senior director of the national multifamily housing group at Marcus & Millichap. But the Lembis found the deal attractive because it included 32 vacant apartments. Once these are upgraded, Mr. Lembi said, rents for a one-bedroom can be raised from about $1,100 to as much as $1,700.
 As interest rates have begun to climb, trading activity has accelerated, real estate specialists say. About $3.2 billion in properties went on sale in May, more than any other month on record, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics. ''The number of offerings has really spiked in the past 60 days,'' he said.
 The surge in offerings may reflect a concern that prices could well be at their peak because of increasing interest rates, said Will Balthrope, the senior director at Cushman & Wakefield of Texas in charge of multifamily housing.
 As interest rates rise and investors have to spend more to borrow money, prices are likely to soften because other types of investment may become more appealing, decreasing the competition, he said.
 ''Sellers are saying this may be our last chance to get a historically high price for the building in the near term,'' he said. ''We're on the cusp of turning from a seller's market to a buyer's market.''
 As the cost of capital goes up, Mr. White said, ''the first group of buyers who will disappear will be the condo converters.'' Buyers hoping to convert rental properties into condominiums accounted for 15 percent of large sales tracked by his company during the first quarter, he said, and more than a third of the deals in northern Virginia and South Florida.
 Other investors and developers, on the other hand, are counting on higher mortgage rates to induce more people to rent rather than buy. A report by M/PF Research Inc. and Torto Wheaton Research found that by the end of 2003, the cost of monthly mortgage payments was higher than the average rent. ''The gap is likely to widen further if home prices and/or mortgage rates continue to increase,'' the report said. (Some analysts warn, however, that, to become homeowners, more people may simply accept the risks of adjustable-rate mortgages.)
 Many apartment owners are also increasingly confident that the job market will continue to expand, thereby spurring young workers to set up households. Richard J. Campo, the chairman and chief executive of Camden Property Trust, a real estate investment trust that recently built $350 million worth of apartments in California, said that among people in their 20's, ''we know there is pent-up demand -- that people have roommates they don't like.''
 After trailing for several years, the stock prices of apartment REIT's have fared better than publicly traded office and industrial shares in recent months. Investors seem to feel that landlords have more flexibility to respond to improving market conditions by raising rents than do office landlords, who may be locked into their rental rates for five years or more, said Craig Leupold, an analyst with Green Street Advisers, a private research company in Newport Beach, Calif.
 Conditions in many areas do seem to be improving for the industry, at least slightly. Lloyd Lynford, the chief executive of Reis, said the average vacancy rate might be declining, reversing the trend of the last two quarters. 
 But even as more apartments are filled -- and landlords cut back on generous concessions -- many areas will continue to feel the consequences of overbuilding. The excess supply is most pronounced in metropolitan areas where there are few constraints on new construction and housing prices are still low enough to provide an alternative to renting; Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix are among the cities that are considered overbuilt.
 As for promising markets for investment, Maury Tognarelli, the president and chief executive of Heitman, a real estate investment management company that advises pension funds, singled out Southern California; the Southeast, particularly Florida; and the Northeast.
 One private investor, Brian Ward, the president and chief executive of Orion Residential, a Seattle company that focuses on older properties that can be upgraded, said he had two large apartment deals awaiting closing -- one in metropolitan Washington and the other in Houston -- with a combined value of $220 million. He said he expected to pour money into the property in Washington, where many new jobs have been added and rents have been rising, but would be more cautious in Houston. 
 ''In Houston,'' he said, ''there are no barriers to entry. There's tons of supply, and you have to be very careful about how you invest in that marketplace.''
 In Denver, the combination of vacancies and concessions means that landlords are currently taking in 30 to 35 percent less than they would if their properties were fully leased, said Jeff Hawks, a Denver-based principal of Apartment Realty Advisors, a national brokerage company. ''There's going to be a shortage of new product in Denver a couple of years out.'' But not every community has exercised that type of discipline.
 Real estate specialists say they are mystified that developers keep building when demand is low, thereby preventing the vacancy rate from decreasing even when the market begins to show signs of life. ''The level of construction is still high,'' Mr. Lynford said. ''I've never been able to make sense of it.''

HEADLINE: Sense and Nonsense: Legislature's Last Day

BYLINE: By AL BAKER and MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 22 

 BODY:
On this week's Tin-Cup Tuesday, so called because people from across the state come on that day during legislative sessions to beg lawmakers to pass their pet projects, two people dressed as grapes were seen wandering the hall of the State Capitol. They were not shilling for Fruit of the Loom underwear, but for a law that would allow New York's grocery stores to sell wine.
 Outside, Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, paraded around in the rain with a band of chanting activists. More militant than the grapes, they were quickly corralled, handcuffed and hauled off to a State Police station for processing. 
 On this, the final day of a legislative session notable for its lack of progress, bills were passed to ban hand-rolled cigarettes, to exempt taxes on coin-operated air pumps for tires, to build a new parking lot for Tonawanda, in western New York, and to prohibit the sale or bartering of wild pets. These were only a few in a host of bills that, like much else in Albany, would go nowhere.
 In some ways, the festival-like atmosphere outside the building represented a closer view of reality than what was happening inside, where the Assembly and Senate would pass legislation knowing it had no chance of becoming law. The top legislative leaders admitted as much, but said they were blameless. It was the other guy, obviously.
 Tuesday's theatrics started as the clock ran down on a legislative session notable more for what did not happen then for what did.
 In the Assembly, lawmakers debated a resolution intended to give Democrats political cover before they approved a measure proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki to stretch out state spending another six weeks. That way, core government operations could continue even without passage of a state budget.
 A Republican asked if Democrats would show up for work next week, since Democrats argued that the Governor was effectively telling lawmakers to go on vacation.
 ''Only the Shadow knows,'' said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Democrat from Manhattan, in a floor debate shortly before midnight on Monday.
 That answer could have applied to dozens of issues in the Capitol.
 So in the absence of substance, the order of the day was silliness and superfluousness.
 The arrests of Ms. Weingarten and other protesters were made as they tried to block a Capitol entrance and trap lawmakers inside. But the police were ready because on an average day the Capitol is blanketed with security guards to thwart any evildoers.
 By the time of the arrests, Mr. Pataki was safely ensconced in his second-floor office. He had spent the morning touring the Center of Excellence in Nanoelectronics in Albany. An aide said that Mr. Pataki loved that kind of stuff and that the trip would make him happy all day. Which was good, because at the State Capitol, happiness was in short supply.
 ''We look lousy,'' thundered Senator Seymour P. Lachman, a Democrat from Brooklyn.
 He was speaking on the Senate chamber floor on Monday evening, the day before the session was to end. The list of bills on the day calendar, most of which would never become law because they would not pass the Democratic-controlled Assembly, did not reflect the weightier issues facing the state. But for those completely fed up with the tax on coin-operated tire-inflation equipment, the Senate was the place to find kindred souls. They passed a bill to scrap the tax.
 Hunters, upset that they could not shoot a bear in New York with a rifle, also had reason to cheer because, in certain counties, the Senate moved to allow such hunting. They would also be able to shoot a deer.
 Sticking with the animal theme, there was a bill that ''prohibits the possession, sale, barter, transfer exchange and import of wild animals as pets.'' That one might become law. The Assembly passed an identical bill. No one from the tiger lobby was seen in the hallway.
 In the Assembly, much of the time was spent introducing special guests, like lifelong friends and local sports teams.
 Joel M. Miller, a Republican, introduced members of what he called ''The Lyme Community'': representatives of New Yorkers who suffer from Lyme disease.
 Jeffrey Klein, a Democrat, pushed through a bill to commemorate Susan B. Anthony. Apparently the coin was not enough. 
 Back outside, a group calling itself the Red Hat Society Ladies -- women over 50 who like to wear red hats -- stood on the steps. They did not want any special red-hat law; they just wanted a photo.
 The beefy men of the transit workers union, meanwhile, got lost. They were concerned about the fate of bus lines in Queens, but first they had to navigate the Harry Potter-like interior of the Capitol.
 The three leaders who control the fate of legislation -- the governor, the Assembly speaker and the Senate majority leader -- had one of their fruitless closed-door meetings. Afterward, the speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, emerged to speak to reporters, forced by design to crowd into a doorway, making questions and answers difficult. Not that it mattered much, since the answers were all the same: nothing doing.
 But advocates joined reporters and, with the possibility of a scene, Mr. Pataki took the rare step of holding a formal news conference.
 ''I thought that in the absence of any news I'd at least let you sit down,'' the governor said.

HEADLINE: Communications Equipment Makers Lead Shares Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, led by communications equipment makers, after telephone companies said that they would spend billions of dollars upgrading networks.
 ''It seems like the tech sector's playing catch-up here,'' said Pat Becker Jr., who helps manage $2.2 billion at Becker Capital Management in Portland, Ore. ''I don't think it's participated very much in the past week or so.''
 The S.&P. 500-stock index added 4.11 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,134.41. Before yesterday, an S.&P. index of technology shares had the worst performance in the last six sessions among 10 industry groups. Yesterday the technology index jumped 1.4 percent and accounted for almost two-thirds of the S.&P. 500's rise. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, which gets 40 percent of its value from computer companies, advanced 19.77 points, or 1 percent, to 1,994.15. It was the index's biggest gain in a week. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 23.60 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,395.07. 
 Almost six stocks advanced for every five that declined on the New York Stock Exchange. About 1.3 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board.
 JDS Uniphase, the largest maker of fiber optic network parts, rose 38 cents, or 12 percent, to $3.58, for the biggest rally in the S.&P. 500. JDS rose another 10 cents in after-hours trading. Lucent, the telephone equipment maker, climbed 19 cents, to $3.71.
 They gained after SBC Communications, the telephone company, said Alcatel of France would help it build a $6 billion fiber optic network that offers digital television service. JDS supplies equipment to Alcatel.
 Among other technology shares, Cisco Systems, the biggest maker of computer-networking equipment, added 35 cents, to $23.22, and added 6 cents after trading hours. Broadcom, which makes microchips for computer networks, gained $2.20, to $44.85, and added 11 cents later.
 Morgan Stanley advanced 90 cents, to $52.15. The firm said second-quarter profit more than doubled, to $1.10 a share. Analysts expected $1.06, the average of 20 estimates compiled by Thomson.
 PalmOne rallied $7.90, or 37 percent, to $29.36, but gave back 33 cents in after-hours trading. The company, which makes hand-held computers, said profit in the fiscal first quarter would be 17 cents a share, excluding some costs. On that basis, PalmOne was expected to break even, according to the average analyst estimate from Thomson. The company also said fourth-quarter profit, excluding some costs, was 32 cents a share, beating the 13-cent average estimate from a Thomson poll.
 PalmSource, whose software runs Palm hand-held computers, surged $1.74, to $17.04.
 Financial shares rose after better-than-expected earnings reports from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
 Goldman rose $1.81 to $90.60, followed by another 10 cents in after-hours trading, after saying that net income in the second quarter increased to $1.19 billion, or $2.31 a share. It was expected to earn $1.95 a share, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
 Shares of Target fell $1.27, to $45.16. The company expects sales this month to be at the low end of its forecast of a 5 percent to 7 percent increase. 
 Home Depot, the largest home improvement chain, shed 68 cents, to $35.04. The 1.9 percent decline was the steepest in the Dow average.
 Treasury prices fell for a second day in three as investors wait for next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve policy makers, who are widely expected to raise the benchmark interest rate from a four-decade low. By late in the day, the price of the 10-year note fell 8/32, to 100 8/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.72 percent, from 4.68 percent on Monday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills: 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.918
High Rate: 1.050

HEADLINE: Suing Wal-Mart but Still Hoping to Move Up

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
The way Betty Dukes tells it, it is not for lack of trying that she has failed to move up at Wal-Mart Stores. Despite repeatedly asking her managers how she could advance, she says, the jobs she wanted were filled by men time and time again. 
 After 10 years at Wal-Mart, Ms. Dukes is a store greeter. She said she would still like the chance to enter the assistant manager training program. 
 ''I'm in this for the long haul,'' she explained in a telephone interview yesterday from her lawyer's office. 
 Three years after she became the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against Wal-Mart, Ms. Dukes shows no sign of bowing. She is unshaken in her sense that she will prevail -- not just in the suit accusing Wal-Mart of widespread discrimination against women but in her quest to advance at the company. 
 Wal-Mart says it cannot comment on the specifics of the litigation but continues to review its employment practices. 
 A 54-year-old African-American woman who is an ordained Missionary Baptist minister, Ms. Dukes says she is willing to take on Wal-Mart because she believes the company must abide by the law, just as she must. ''I've never shied away from any type of challenges,'' she said. ''I have no fear in my spirit at all of Wal-Mart.''
 When Ms. Dukes first went to work for the Wal-Mart store in Pittsburg, Calif., 40 miles east of San Francisco, she said that she hoped to soon rise beyond her entry-level position as a part-time cashier making $5 an hour. A woman in her mid-40's, she had worked for other retailers and had shopped at the Wal-Mart store in her community. She needed a job, and the situation looked promising. ''I thought it would be more of a piece of cake to move forward,'' she said. 
 Within her first month, Ms. Duke says in a court filing, she approached her manager about advancing and was told to wait until she had been there for three months. He never gave her any guidance, and she became a full-time cashier within the year. 
 Over the years, she kept asking about being promoted, she said, but when jobs became available, they were frequently filled without being posted. Even when they were posted, employees often believed there was no real chance of getting them. 
 She made little progress despite asking her managers again and again. ''There was always some obstacle, some reason,'' she said. 
 As she describes it, no one ever told her what she needed to do or why she was not being considered. ''Opportunities seemed to come and go, positions were filled,'' she said, and her managers provided no feedback. ''No one would talk to you.''
 In court filings, Ms. Dukes also describes being disciplined for things that male employees were not, like returning late from breaks. Under company policy, employees are not eligible for promotion if they have received what she calls ''coachings'' for these infractions. Although she worked briefly as a customer service manager, she was demoted to cashier, the court documents say. 
 All the while, Ms. Dukes stayed at the company. ''I had a job, and I appreciated the job,'' she said yesterday. ''It was a honest job.'' 
 When she came to Wal-Mart, she was unemployed, and the job represented badly needed income. Ms. Dukes filed for personal bankruptcy in 1997, according to court documents. 
 She kept expecting that she would eventually move up. ''I am always anticipating a rise in the company,'' she said. She became a greeter after a work-related injury forced her to stop working as a cashier, she said.
 Since she filed the lawsuit, Ms. Dukes says her co-workers have given her a mixed reception. Some employees do not agree that Wal-Mart has discriminated against women, while others describe similar experiences. ''They themselves have experienced low promotions to no promotions,'' she said.
 Last year, Ms. Dukes tried again to apply for a management training program. She cannot work on Sundays because of her religious beliefs, and said that she was automatically disqualified when she filled out the application by computer. Ms. Dukes, who is unwilling to lie to get her application considered, says she has been shut out of the program.
 But she has not given up. A year ago, a new manager saw that she was still making less than $9 an hour and raised it to $12.53, finally giving her a decent salary, Ms. Dukes says. And she says she plans to work at Wal-Mart until she retires. ''At my age of 54, I have several good years,'' she said.
 Yesterday's decision by Judge Martin J. Jenkins of Federal District Court in San Francisco gives her faith, she said. While the company has said the decision has no bearing on the merits of the case, she said she believed that the judge found the accusations made by the female employees credible. ''The facts spoke for themselves,'' she said.

HEADLINE: State Senators Stall Approval Of City Rebates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
The $400 property tax rebate for homeowners that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council have agreed on hit a speed bump in Albany yesterday when the State Senate decided not to allow the city to enact the plan until the long-delayed state budget is approved. 
 With the state budget more than two and half months late, and members of the Republican-controlled State Senate heading home from Albany after ending the formal session, the Senate's decision left doubt as to whether the city would be able to send out the rebate checks in September, as city officials had hoped.
 The city needs Albany's permission to proceed with the rebate. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Lower Manhattan, said he would pass it, and Gov. George E. Pataki said he would support it. But Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, expressed reservations about it and decided to postpone it. 
 Mr. Bruno said in a statement last night that he would pass the plan, but not until the state budget is finally approved. And he said he would like any legislation about the expansion of the Javits Convention Center, which had stalled in recent days, to be part of the budget negotiations as well.
 ''The budget we adopt will address the Javits Center expansion and include the mayor's property tax rebate along with other measures that will help keep local taxes under control throughout the state, and we are committed to doing a budget that achieves those goals,'' said Mr. Bruno, whose base of support is in the suburbs and upstate.
 Privately, some Senate Republicans have complained that Mayor Bloomberg is trying to send $400 checks to homeowners at the same time he is seeking a sharp increase in state aid to the city's schools to satisfy a court order. And some said that they were unhappy that the rebate applied only to homeowners, and not businesses or large landlords.
 New details of the city budget, including the fact that some homeowners may have to pay income taxes on the $400 property tax rebate, emerged yesterday about the last-minute deal cobbled together Monday night. Depending on property owners' income tax brackets and whether they itemize deductions, the net benefit of the rebate could be substantially reduced. For instance, someone who has a 25 percent income tax rate and claims property taxes as a deduction could pay $100 in federal income taxes on the $400 rebate, city officials said. 
 The rebate, a priority for Mayor Bloomberg, was a central part of the agreement between the mayor's office and the City Council on the $47 billion budget for next year.
 Yesterday, the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, cited the taxable nature of the rebate as ''one of the things that I had raised as a concern about this proposal.''
 ''People should certainly be aware that it is taxable income,'' Mr. Miller said in response to a question from reporters. ''It's one of the reasons I haven't been a huge fan of the rebate. But the budget is a process of compromise, and obviously it was an enormous priority to the mayor.''
 The mayor, answering reporters' questions at an event on Staten Island, seemed to express irritation that the city had to go, hat in hand, seeking Albany's approval.
 ''It is just an aberration of the law that we need to go to Albany to adjust our own taxes,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. 
 In releasing details of their budget agreement, council members said the budget contained at least $76 million in additional spending beyond the $215 million figure that the mayor's staff circulated Monday evening. The numbers have political significance, since the mayor wants to be seen as holding the line on spending, and the Council wants to satisfy various interest groups lobbying for millions of dollars for various programs.
 The additional spending will go toward reducing school class sizes, reopening some libraries seven days a week, and providing legal services to the poor, job training for the long-term unemployed and day care for children. All are initiatives pushed by Mr. Miller, who took credit yesterday for securing money for them. 
 Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the mayor, denied that Mr. Bloomberg agreed to more than the $215 million. Any other added appropriations, he said, were either the mayor's own or were paid for with state or federal funds.
 Details of spending for various city agencies and programs will not be available until a final budget document is prepared for the Council to vote on, which could happen today or tomorrow, council members said.
 The property tax rebate would apply to about 625,000 owners of one-, two- and three-family homes, condominiums and co-ops. It is opposed by landlords whose rental properties would not qualify for the benefit. And owners of rental properties in one class of real estate that also includes co-ops and condominiums would have to make up the difference in tax not collected from homeowners.

HEADLINE: Kerry's Long Flight to Say 'Aye' Runs Into a Storm of G.O.P. Delays

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22 

 BODY:
How far would a presidential candidate travel in one day to not cast a vote on an issue critical to his campaign? For Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts on Tuesday, the journey was 3,910 miles.
 Mr. Kerry, the Democratic presidential contender, scrapped a speech and a fund-raiser in Albuquerque on Tuesday to fly here from Denver overnight in order to support an amendment to a military spending bill on veterans health care. But procedural delays on the Senate floor, under control of Republicans, kept him from saying ''aye'' before flying back across the country Tuesday evening to San Francisco, where he plans to speak at a labor union convention on Wednesday. 
 He did manage to fit in a short private session with Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who is believed to be one of the leading contenders for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket and who also canceled events on Tuesday in Alabama to return here for votes. 
 Mr. Edwards, one of Mr. Kerry's rivals in the Democratic primaries, confirmed that he and Mr. Kerry spent at least 20 minutes alone in the ornate president's reception room off the Senate floor. ''Kerry has made it clear he wants to keep the process confidential,'' Mr. Edwards said, ''so I'm not going to say anything about it.''
 Mr. Kerry also got to sit for the Senate class photo, receive two enthusiastic ovations from his colleagues for an upbeat campaign briefing at the Democratic caucus lunch, and make his first speech on the Senate floor in more than three months.
 ''At this time of great sacrifice, it is even more important that we show our veterans that we honor them and respect them, and we have to show them with more than words, we have to show them with our deeds,'' Senator Kerry said when he finally appeared at 5:40 p.m. after a long afternoon of fruitless negotiations among Senate leaders about the timing of the vote. ''At this time of war, our message ought to be loud and clear: When you come home, your country will take care of you, because you took care of us.''
 It was only the fourth time that Mr. Kerry, who has been slammed by Republicans both here and in his home state for ignoring his Senate job, curtailed campaign activities to cast his vote on Capitol Hill. And while he did not get to actually vote on the amendment, the surprise schedule switch did make for a striking show of support to a veterans constituency his campaign considers crucial, as a voting bloc and as a group that helps portray Mr. Kerry as a decorated Vietnam veteran.
 ''If he's going to be traveling the country talking to veterans, he needs to go back and fight for them when it matters,'' said Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Kerry's communications director, as his entourage flew to Washington, landing at 1:55 a.m. Tuesday. ''You see the vets he meets on the tarmac every time he lands, and the vets who introduce him and say the Pledge of Allegiance. They're out there fighting for him; he's going to fight for them.''
 Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for President Bush's re-election effort, pointed out that Mr. Kerry had missed five other votes on veterans issues these past two years. There was the October 2003 bill for reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, which included $1.8 billion for veterans health benefits (it passed); a November 2003 amendment that would have financed the Department of Veterans Affairs at $122.7 billion (it died); a January spending bill with $91 billion in funding for veterans and housing (adopted); and two March amendments to pump money into veterans medical programs (both rejected).
 Over all, according to Mr. Schmidt, Senator Kerry has missed 70 percent of the votes in the current Congress -- 64 percent in 2003, and 89 percent this year (not including two roll calls while he was having prostate surgery last January).
 Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader from Tennessee, dismissed Senator Kerry as someone who ''parachutes in for a day and then will be taking off once again.'' And Mitt Romney, the Republican governor of Mr. Kerry's home state, Massachusetts, who was on Capitol Hill for a hearing on a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, renewed his call for Mr. Kerry to resign the Senate seat he has held for 20 years, as Bob Dole of Kansas did when he won the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. 
 ''Had he only missed 15 or 20 percent I might have come to a different conclusion,'' Governor Romney said Tuesday, noting that Mr. Kerry skipped a recent vote on extending federal unemployment benefits -- something most Republicans on Capitol Hill opposed -- that cost Massachusetts $75 million to backfill. ''We as a state need to be represented by a United States senator, or a second United States senator.''
 Mr. Kerry previously canceled campaign events to return to Washington to vote against the $87 billion to finance the war in Iraq in October; to help Democrats try to block the Medicare prescription drug bill in November; and, in March, to support the extension of the federal assault weapons ban, the subject of his last floor speech.
 The issue on Tuesday was an amendment to the $447.2 billion defense spending bill that would require that funding for veterans' prescriptions and medical services keep pace with the growth in the veteran population. Aides to Mr. Kerry said he decided Monday night to upend his schedule after hearing the vote on the amendment would be close.
 But amid the fanfare of his arrival, the votes were delayed from Tuesday morning until Tuesday afternoon and then Tuesday evening, as Mr. Kerry canceled a $500,000 fund-raiser in Albuquerque he had hoped he could still make. 
 In an exchange on the Senate floor, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said he had been told Mr. Kerry's presence was the sole reason for the delay, adding, ''you would hope that we could keep the campaigns off the Senate floor.'' In response, Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, said, ''I have to take a different view with regard to the situation on Kerry,'' attributing the delay to procedural glitches.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Offer North Korea Incentives in Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22 

 BODY:
President Bush has authorized a team of American negotiators to offer North Korea, in talks in Beijing on Thursday, a new but highly conditional set of incentives to give up its nuclear weapons programs the way Libya did late last year, according to senior administration officials. 
 The proposal would be the first significant, detailed overture to North Korea since Mr. Bush took office three years ago. 
 Under the plan, outlined by American officials on Tuesday evening, in response to pressure from China and American allies in Asia, the aid would begin flowing immediately after a commitment by Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, to dismantle his plutonium and uranium weapons programs. In return, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea would immediately begin sending tens of thousands of tons of heavy fuel oil every month, and Washington would offer a ''provisional'' guarantee not to invade the country or seek to topple Mr. Kim's government. 
 It would also begin direct talks about lifting a broad array of American economic sanctions that have been in place against North Korea for more than half a century, and providing longer-term energy aid and retraining of nuclear scientists.
 But Mr. Kim would have only three months, what the officials call a ''preparatory period of dismantlement,'' to seal and shut the North Korean nuclear facilities, similar to what Libya committed to late last year. After that, Mr. Bush's aides say, the continuation of the oil and the talks would depend on North Korea giving international inspectors access to suspected nuclear sites, and meeting a series of deadlines for disclosing the full nature of its facilities, disabling and dismantling then, and then shipping them out of the country, as Libya did.
 ''Our allies have been telling us that they think Kim Jong Il is ready for a test of his intentions,'' one of Mr. Bush's most senior national security aides said in a interview on Tuesday night. ''So we are prepared to offer them a strategic choice.'' Another senior aide said, ''They may say no -- and in that case they will have failed the test.''
 Administration officials said they expected the North Koreans to take any offers back to Pyonyang, and that it could be weeks or longer before an answer.
 Mr. Bush has been under rising criticism -- from South Korea, China, Russia and most recently his presumptive Democratic opponent, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts -- for failing to make a serious offer to the North Koreans since coming into office. While intelligence agencies are still arguing with each other about what progress North Korea's two nuclear programs have made in the past few years, a consensus is developing that, in the past year, the country has probably fabricated enough plutonium fuel to make six or seven new nuclear weapons, and there is still unconfirmed evidence, gathered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, that the North may have shipped raw uranium to Libya for its bomb project.
 By setting a three-month grace period, Mr. Bush's aides say they are trying to correct what they view as major flaws in the 1994 nuclear freeze agreement with North Korea that President Bill Clinton signed, but which has been abandoned. Under that agreement, North Korea never had to ship its plutonium fuel out of the country, and it continued to receive fuel oil and other aid while, intelligence officials assert, it started a second, secret program to build bombs out of uranium fuel, with help from a clandestine network built by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear chief. 
 Officials from several Asian allies, who began to hear about the plan on Tuesday in Beijing, said they welcomed it -- but they questioned whether it would be enough to induce Mr. Kim to give up the one program that gives his desperate country leverage over its far more powerful neighbors. ''They probably would reject even a better offer, figuring that after the election they have a chance of dealing with someone other than George Bush,'' said one senior Asian official who has been urging the White House to make an offer to the North. ''And, of course, they can use the extra time to work on making more bomb fuel, if they haven't finished that process already.''
 Asked Tuesday night why the North Koreans should respond before they see whether Mr. Bush has been re-elected, or whether they will be dealing with a Democrat who has promised one-on-one talks, one of Mr. Bush's aides said, ''Maybe they won't.'' But if they fail to agree, he said, ''they will have to weigh the effect on the Japanese, the South Koreans, the Russians and the Chinese,'' all of whom are potential sources of energy, food and investment.
 Under the offer, those four countries -- but not the United States -- would provide the North with heavy fuel oil roughly equivalent to the 45,000 tons the United States was sending to the country under the 1994 agreement. The United States halted those shipments 18 months ago when it confronted North Korea with evidence about the uranium program. 
 Elements of the new proposal have been floated before -- including a written security guarantee -- but never with this specificity, with a timetable or promise of immediate aid. But several hawks in the administration are opposed to making what one senior State Department official called ''a much more expansive offer,'' and both American and Asian officials fear that North Korea could rejected it as insufficient.
 Several outside experts said they believed that the North Koreans now think they have the upper hand in the negotiations, partly because South Korea has agreed to direct talks on military issues and because China, which is organizing the negotiations in Beijing, has provided the North with millions of dollars in fuel and other goods to keep talking.
 ''The North Koreans don't feel under any pressure to make concessions right now because they feel the United States is not in a position to take military action, and not in a position to walk away,'' said Gary Samore, who ran the nonproliferation office of the National Security Council under Mr. Clinton and is now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ''They are in a strange position; they are being paid by the Chinese to talk.''
 In public, Mr. Bush talks about confronting North Korea with a unified view from the five nations on the other side of the table: the United States, South Korea, Russia, China and Japan. But it was not until the past few days -- with signs that the unity of that group might be cracking -- that he agreed to put what one administration official called ''meat on the bones'' of its offer. 
 South Korea, impatient with Mr. Bush, has made its own series of overtures to North Korea. Japan has agreed to compensate North Korea for releasing the children of Japanese who were kidnapped years ago. China has publicly questioned the American evidence that the North has a separate uranium program, though administration officials say that, in private, the Chinese concede they, too, believe the North is taking two paths to building bombs, and has been trying to simplify the talks to get Washington to return to a freeze of the nuclear program. 
 Mr. Bush has rejected that approach, saying a freeze would not solve the problem, his aides say. He is demanding a Libya-like dismantlement, and will be speaking in the next few days to leaders of the countries involved in the negations, one of his most senior aides said, ''to urge them to urge the North'' to take the deal. 
 Like Iraq, North Korea has been a subject of constant division and argument within the Bush administration, almost since the day the president took office. Many in the State Department urged the White House to build on talks Mr. Clinton was pursuing in 2000, including discussions of removing North Korea from the list of states that sponsor terrorism. Hawks in the administration -- from the vice president's office to the Pentagon -- opposed any talks at all, saying there was no reason to believe that the North Koreans would abide by a new agreement after violating the 1994 accord. (North Korea charged that Congress never fulfilled its commitments to provide all the oil promised under that agreement.)
 Mr. Bush, while refusing direct talks with North Korea, began six-party talks to put pressure on the North from its closest neighbors, but so far the sessions have made no concrete progress. Frustrated, the allies have for months been urging Mr. Bush to make what one Chinese diplomat called ''a serious offer, not a vague statement that if the North Koreans disarm, something good might happen.''
 Mr. Bush's aides say they are now doing that -- though Mr. Kerry argued in an interview last month that if the White House had seriously engaged with North Korea early in Mr. Bush's presidency, the North might not have converted its 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods into bomb fuel. White House officials have said that that position is naive, and that North Korea was intent on cheating on its old agreement.
 With the new offer, Mr. Bush has retreated on one major point: after insisting a year ago that the allies cut off oil to North Korea, he has now agreed to allow a resumption of oil shipments -- though not American oil -- before the country actually dismantles anything. But because the shipments would last only for three months if the North reneged on any part of its disarmament pledge, Mr. Bush's aides argue that there would be little at risk. 
 It may not get that far. The kind of disclosure Mr. Bush is pressing North Korea to make would involve an admission that the secret uranium program exists -- something the Americans say the North admitted to in October 2002, but have since denied. It would require revealing, then opening, secret nuclear sites. And it would require, in the end, trusting that the benefits would continue to flow even after all the country's nuclear materials have been shipped out of the country.

HEADLINE: Wolfowitz Testifies Pentagon Misjudged Iraqi Insurgency

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22 

 BODY:
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, a prime architect of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, said Tuesday that the Pentagon had underestimated the violent tenacity of an insurgency that formed after Baghdad fell, and he acknowledged that the United States may be forced to keep a significant number of troops in Iraq for years to come.
 But even under questioning from House Democrats, Mr. Wolfowitz never wavered from an optimistic posture as he cited ''enormous progress'' in the effort to stabilize Iraq and hand over responsibility for governing and security to the Iraqis.
 Mr. Wolfowitz, who just returned from a five-day visit to Iraq, told House Armed Services Committee members that he heard military personnel from the United States and its allies, as well as Iraqi citizens, say the world does not realize the successes achieved as Iraq moves toward sovereignty on June 30. 
 ''It's something we heard almost everywhere -- from Iraqis, from Americans, from a British general down in Basra,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. ''It doesn't mean that there aren't serious problems in Iraq; we all know about the problems. But I think that what doesn't get through in all the reporting on problems is there's also been enormous progress.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz's assessment was challenged by Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, the committee's ranking Democrat, who read aloud the administration's goals for Iraq as stated last July, and said they had still not been met.
 ''The four pillars of this plan were establishing security, restoring essential services, creating conditions for economic development, and enabling the transition to democratic governance,'' Mr. Skelton said. ''It's clear that these goals have not been achieved, at least not to the extent we had hoped, largely because we haven't established security.''
 Mr. Skelton asked Mr. Wolfowitz whether American forces might be required to remain in Iraq for ''a good number of years.''
 ''I think it's entirely possible,'' Mr. Wolfowitz replied. ''But what I think is also nearly certain is the more they step up, and they will be doing so more and more each month, the less and less we will have to do.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz said Pentagon planners had not counted on the ability of a guerrilla-style resistance to form, operate and grow after the capture of Saddam Hussein and the arrest or killing of his top advisers.
 ''If you want to say what might have been underestimated, I think there was probably too great a willingness to believe that once we got the 55 people on the blacklist, the rest of those killers would stop fighting,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said.
 During more than three hours of testimony, Mr. Wolfowitz received compliments and support from committee Republicans but dueled with Democrats over an exit strategy for American forces and the quality of intelligence supplied by Ahmad Chalabi of the Iraqi National Congress.
 When pressed to address charges that Mr. Chalabi provided false intelligence on Iraq's program for unconventional weapons, which helped form the administration's arguments for war, Mr. Wolfowitz said ''nothing in Iraq is black and white.'' 
 But he said American military commanders told him that ''some of the intelligence that his organization has provided us has saved American lives and enabled us to capture some key enemy targets.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz also defended the Bush administration's assessment that American intelligence had evidence of contacts between Al Qaeda and the Hussein government. 
 Mr. Hussein's Iraq was ''a state that had contacts of a murky but ominous sort with Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. ''The mere fact of contact is disturbing.''
 Committee members also pressed Mr. Wolfowitz about a mismatch between individual battlefield successes and a lack of political progress.
 ''I'm deeply concerned about a precipitous withdrawal of troops, for whatever reason, in the short term, if we don't achieve a political end-state that is satisfactory to the American people,'' said Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, Democrat of California.
 Mr. Wolfowitz offered reassurances, saying ''what terrifies the enemy the most is the prospect of an elected Iraqi government.'' He said the administration's plan for bringing stability to Iraq is based on passing sovereignty to an interim government by July 1; training and equipping Iraqi security forces; moving to an elected government late this year or early next year; seeking additional international forces; and forming a constitutionally elected government by the end of 2005.
 ''I would hope five years from now we see an Iraq that has more or less effectively defeated this enemy,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. ''It doesn't mean that terrorism will be gone.''

HEADLINE: When Irish Ties Are Fraying

BYLINE: By Nuala O'Faolain. 
Nuala O'Faolain, a former columnist for The Irish Times, is the author, most recently, of ''Almost There,'' a memoir.

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
The Irish hold the rotating presidency of the European Union and President Bush is scheduled to make an overnight visit to Ireland this week to take part in a two-hour summit meeting. On Friday, he'll fly into Shannon, an airport whose use by the American military during the Iraq venture has been highly controversial here. Substantial protests are planned, but the protesters will, of course, be kept far away from the president. He won't even hear their chants.
 No doubt American television will show the president and his wife surrounded by harp-playing colleens and little girls in ringlets doing stepdancing in a medieval castle -- this is an election year, after all, and there is an Irish-American electorate. But, in fact, the president and the Irish won't encounter each other at all. The loss is ours; but it is America's, too. 
 Mr. Bush is coming to a country that has been passionately pro-American since America took in our people after the Great Famine. Presidential visits have been a gift from that diaspora. John F. Kennedy came and assuaged some of the pain of all the farewells in our history. Richard Nixon came; I remember running almost three miles to the obscure graveyard in which an ancestor of his had been providentially discovered. Beside me, a couple carry a plump 3-year-old between them, hoping to show the child a president of the United States.
 We didn't make it; but we cheered when we saw the presidential helicopter take off over the bog. Ronald Reagan came and protesters against American actions in Central America landed in jail, but on the entertainment side, he was the perfect partner in genial, Oirish leprechaunery. It was also believed that he had leaned on Margaret Thatcher to bring her to negotiations with us on the future of Northern Ireland. And that's what has mattered most in modern Ireland's relationship with America. Its friendliness to us has often been the power behind our dealings with Britain. 
 The Clinton administration and both the Clintons went further; they put a lot of time and effort into installing a political structure in Northern Ireland that will work, however long it may be delayed by local malice. When Bill Clinton visited the republic the place was brought to a standstill. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. 
 If Mr. Clinton came back today, we'd find some way -- even in the post-Sept. 11 world -- to welcome him. But even in that world, is security the only consideration keeping President Bush and the Irish apart? 
 When Mikhail Gorbachev, at the height of his promise, stopped over in Shannon for just a couple of hours, there was a fiesta. His wife, Raisa, was taken to an outdoor folk museum behind what was meant to be impermeable security, but there was such a welter of children up trees, people holding out daffodils, boys balancing on walls, lambs bleating, fiddles playing, buses reversing the wrong way and general happy mayhem that security became extremely flexible. True feeling finds ways to express itself.
 How can there be so little enthusiasm for welcoming President Bush in as pro-American a country as exists on the face of the earth? Our intelligentsia is pro-American; American popular culture, far from being resisted as it is elsewhere in Europe, has been a precious modernizing influence on the grim patriarchy that dominated Ireland until recent times; our teachers and students work in the United States in the summer, our athletes train there, our doctors and scientists do postgraduate work there, we all have friends and relations there. No wonder Ireland shut down more completely than any other country in the world -- schools, pubs, business, transport, everything -- on its day of mourning for the Sept. 11 attacks.
 But nations on the periphery watch the center more keenly than the center realizes. The vacuum where our enthusiasm should be is our response to the perception -- the fear -- that this administration is indifferent to any world view but its own; that it doesn't care whether a little place like this loves it or not. 
 There is another twist: we Irish, in our quarrel with Britain, have relied on American power, and that implicates us in how that power is exercised. The images from the Abu Ghraib prison were especially shocking here. We took the British Army to the European Court of Human Rights for using techniques of interrogation in Northern Ireland much less extreme than were used in Abu Ghraib -- and, for all we know, in Guantanamo Bay, in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Iraq. The British techniques were ruled inhuman and degrading. 
 And Iraq is only the most lurid in a sequence of isolationist initiatives -- the abrupt rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, the imposition of protective tariffs, the hostility to any international court of justice, and above all, the disrespect this administration has shown to the United Nations. Not that anyone has unqualified respect for the United Nations. But small nations, in particular, have to rely on international bodies, and the United Nations for all its flaws is the international body we've got. We take it seriously and we strongly support it. Irish troops are serving with United Nations missions in places that could do with the money and attention Iraq is getting, like Liberia, Kosovo, Lebanon, Congo and the Western Sahara. 
 The hardheaded proconsuls in Washington know that we, though by no means the victims we once were -- we've a stunningly successful economy -- do not matter in terms of realpolitik. Ireland's population is a little less than that of Atlanta. But the attitudinal change I see here is part of global politics all the same. Americans who work or play outside their own country will have felt already, I'm sure, that the Bush presidency has changed how the world looks at America. For them -- for ordinary Americans -- the reception they get abroad at this time of profound difficulty should be warmer than ever.
 But for the present administration -- and a 1,000-strong entourage will be accompanying President Bush on his visit -- my welcome flag is furled. It was such fun and such an honor, the first four times a president came here. But in the bitter words of a poet: ''Never bright, confident morning again.'' 


CORRECTION-DATE: June 24, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed article yesterday about Irish attitudes toward President Bush imprecisely compared the populations of Ireland and Atlanta. The population of Ireland is smaller than that of the Atlanta metropolitan area, but not that of Atlanta proper.

HEADLINE: Wooing Black Voters: The Role of the Kerry Campaign

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Bush Shouldn't Write Off the Black Vote,'' by Juan Williams (Op-Ed, June 16):
 I dispute Mr. Williams's claim that John Kerry's presidential campaign has been ''notable for its lack'' of minority representation. 
 Along with appointing me, a black woman, to be a co-chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention Platform Committee and a co-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Senator Kerry has many minorities working in his campaign in high-profile positions, including Vernon Jordan, the lead debate negotiator; Marcus Jadotte, a deputy campaign manager; and Art Collins, a senior adviser, as well as a number of African-Americans who serve as his state directors in battleground states. 
 Senator Kerry will put policies in place that will address the issues that resonate with minorities. He has a solid plan to jump-start our economy through tax breaks to encourage businesses to keep jobs here in America, invest in our small and medium-sized businesses and work to secure universal access to college and expand job training.

HEADLINE: Lollapalooza Tour Canceled Amid Weak Concert Season

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
In a blow to the summer concert season already hurt by the loss of big tours by Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, the touring Lollapalooza festival has been canceled because of poor ticket sales, the festival organizers said yesterday.
 The tour, which was to have begun on July 14 in Auburn, Wash., and travel to 16 cities through Aug. 25, had booked Morrissey, Sonic Youth, P. J. Harvey, String Cheese Incident, Modest Mouse, the Flaming Lips and many other alternative rock groups for 31 engagements across the United States.
 Marc Geiger of the William Morris Agency in Los Angeles, who founded the tour in 1991 with the singer Perry Ferrell, said in a statement: ''I am in utter disbelief that a concert of this stature, with the most exciting lineup I've seen in years, did not galvanize ticket sales. I'm surprised that given the great bands and the reduced ticket prices that we didn't have enough sales to sustain the tour.'' 
 Representatives of the festival did not disclose sales figures for the concerts, but Mr. Geiger said that if the concerts had not been canceled, the promoters would have faced losses in the millions.
 The cancellation comes at a difficult time for the concert business. Many large tours are said to be having difficulty selling tickets, despite strong economic signals for the business earlier in the year. 
 ''We had a very strong first quarter, which allowed people to be a little overly optimistic going into the summer,'' said Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of the concert trade magazine Pollstar. ''But ticket sales dried up in mid-April, right after tax day, just as the big tours started to gear up.''
 Mr. Geiger said ticket sales had been uneven around the country, with relatively strong sales for the Aug. 16 and 17 concerts at Randalls Island in New York, where the Pixies were to make one of their only two appearances on the tour.
 But in many markets, the concerts were said to have sales not much higher than one of the headlining acts might have drawn on its own.
 ''Sometimes one plus one plus one equals one in this business,'' Mr. Bongiovanni said.
 The tour's cancellation is bad news for the bands; most were counting on the tour to support new albums. Morrissey, P. J. Harvey, Wilco and Modest Mouse all have released CD's in the last few months.
 The first Lollapalooza tour in 1991, which featured Jane's Addiction, Nine Inch Nails, Ice-T and the Rollins Band, helped define the alternative rock market that transformed the music industry in the 1990's. The tour had six summer sequels before bowing out in 1997 with Snoop Dogg, Korn and Tool. Its highest gross was the 1994 tour, when it earned more than $21 million, according to Billboard.
 The festival returned last summer with a reunited Jane's Addiction, though it was not entirely successful. Two concerts on that tour were canceled. Its gross last year was $13.7 million for 25 concerts, Billboard reported in April.
 Ms. Spears canceled her tour because of a knee injury, and Ms. Aguilera cited strained vocal cords.
 Mr. Geiger blamed the slow concert season for the festival's woes, citing poor sales for the Dead, Dave Matthews, Van Halen and Kiss. ''My question is, what is doing well?'' he said. But not all promoters agreed that the summer concert business was in a slump. 
 Seth Hurwitz, an independent promoter in Washington who booked Lollapalooza into the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Md., said that there was waning interest in aging alternative rock acts like the ones on the Lollapalooza tour. 
 ''How well is Morrissey going to do in the Midwest?'' he said. ''I wouldn't venture to guess. The problem is that there is just not a really large interest in alternative music. What was called alternative in the 90's was exploding with something new, with Pearl Jam and Nirvana. It was exciting stuff.''
 Mr. Hurwitz said many of his concerts, including those by younger acts like Evanescence and Three Doors Down, were selling well.
 ''They tried to pull together Morrissey and Sonic Youth,'' he said, on an alternative bill. ''But there are not enough people who care about it.''

HEADLINE: Brazil's Armored Cars Find a Space in Iraq

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, June 23 

 BODY:
A few years ago, the armored car business was one of Brazil's fastest-growing industries. As urban crime and kidnappings soared, armored car dealers sprouted up by the dozens, and sales jumped almost sevenfold in five years.
 But while violent crime continues to plague Brazil's biggest cities, armored car sales have been declining for two years -- partly because of a harsh economic slump and partly because most wealthy Brazilians who felt the need for bulletproof cars already own one.
 So to keep their business humming, makers of the cars are turning to the export market -- becoming the latest of many industries to look beyond Brazil's borders for growth. And perhaps no region is more attractive as a market for armored cars than the Middle East -- especially Iraq, where attacks on American troops and employees from Western companies have become common. 
 ''On a daily basis, things are getting blown up and people are getting killed in Iraq, so it's no wonder the demand for armored cars there is so big,'' said Franco Giaffone, president of Abrablin, a trade association representing more than 30 Brazilian armored car manufacturers and dealers.
 ''And because a lot of armored car companies in places like the United States are already operating near capacity, people are looking to Brazil to get what they need,'' added Mr. Giaffone, whose own company, G5 Blindagens Especiais, is in talks with several Eastern European governments to start armoring cars for their diplomatic corps in Iraq.
 After decades of focusing almost exclusively on Brazil's domestic market, all types of companies are bringing much-needed dollars into the country and driving an economic rebound by exporting everything from washing machines to commercial airplanes. In May alone, exports totaled a record $7.94 billion, helping the country post a monthly trade surplus of more than $3 billion for the first time in history.
 With one of the most skewed income gaps in the world, Brazil became a big force in the armored car business in the second half of the 1990's as the country's elite scrambled to shield themselves from surging crime. Sales soared from 388 cars a year in 1995 to 4,681 in 2001, making Brazil the world's top producer of bulletproof vehicles, ahead of other crime-ridden countries like Colombia and Mexico.
 But by 2003, sales had plunged by a third, to 3,123 cars, forcing some smaller companies out of business. The industry kicked off 2004 betting that sales would edge up 5 percent or so this year as the economy picked up, but then requests for vehicles for Iraq started trickling in. Now armoring companies expect to revise their sales forecasts upward, though they caution that it is too early to say by how much.
 ''All of sudden people are waking up to the fact that the Middle East can be a promising new market for us,'' said Eduardo Rodrigues, industrial director at Grupo Inbrafiltro, one of Brazil's biggest car-armoring companies.
 Inbrafiltro, which also makes bulletproof cockpit doors for Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, the Brazilian aircraft maker known as Embraer, is one of a few armoring companies that has received orders to ship vehicles to Iraq.
 Mr. Rodrigues said he was approached at a trade show last month in Miami by representatives from a half dozen American multinationals -- mainly big energy and construction companies that he declined to name -- all interested in buying armored vehicles to be used in Iraq. Now Inbrafiltro is closing deals on its first two orders for export to the Middle East, for a total of 60 sport utility vehicles, at a cost of about $100,000 each.
 ''We're talking about orders that can add up to millions of dollars,'' said Marcelo Carneiro, managing director of Central Brasileira de Blindados e Seguranca, a Sao Paulo armoring company that is negotiating contracts with one American and two European multinationals operating in the Middle East.
 Another company benefiting from the demand for armored vehicles in Iraq is the International Armoring Corporation do Brasil, the Brazilian subsidiary of the High Protection Company, in Atlanta. High Protection, which already armors Humvees for the United States Army at its plant in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., recently received three large orders for shipment to the Middle East -- all of which it expects to fill at its factory in Itaquaquecetuba, on the outskirts of Sao Paulo.
 The orders include 200 autos for the Saudi Arabian government, 130 for the government of Jordan and up to 50 heavily armored S.U.V.'s for the Parsons Corporation, the engineering and construction giant in Pasadena, Calif., that was awarded a $1.8 billion infrastructure contract in Iraq earlier this year.
 ''We're going to send the vehicles from here in the United States to Brazil, and then from Brazil straight to the Middle East,'' Mauricio Junot De Maria, High Protection's chief executive, said by telephone from Atlanta.
 To be sure, not all the car-armoring companies in Brazil are likely to find themselves signing million-dollar contracts to ship vehicles to Iraq any time soon. Most companies here aim at the domestic market, which means they armor cars to protect motorists from random street violence at intersections and stray bullets from handguns -- a common occurrence on the main highways leading into Rio de Janeiro, stretches of which are straddled by sprawling shantytowns controlled by heavily armed drug gangs.
 An armored car in Iraq, however, must withstand high-caliber automatic weapons like AK-47's and explosive devices. That can cost more than twice as much as a basic armoring job, and requires technology that only the biggest armoring companies here have.
 ''Here, if a car isn't armored well, you can still escape an incident, though not always,'' said Boris Kruijssen, regional director for Latin America of the Control Risks Group, a security consulting firm that is advising American companies operating in Iraq on where to go to buy armored cars in Brazil.
 ''But in Iraq, if it's not armored well, you will get killed,'' he said. ''Because of that, our clients are asking us to test cars here.''

HEADLINE: Doing Our Homework

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: DALIAN, China 

 BODY:
When I was growing up, my parents used to say to me: ''Finish your dinner -- people in China are starving.'' I, by contrast, find myself wanting to say to my daughters: ''Finish your homework -- people in China and India are starving for your job.''
 That thought struck me in a visit to Dalian, a port city in northeastern China. It is not just impressive for a Chinese city. With its wide boulevards, beautiful green spaces and nexus of universities, technical colleges and a massive software park, Dalian would stand out in Silicon Valley. 
 Dalian symbolizes how much China's most modern cities -- and there are still plenty of miserable, backward ones -- are rapidly grabbing business as knowledge centers, not just manufacturing hubs. No, Toto, they are not just making tennis shoes here. Try G.E., Microsoft, Dell, SAP, H.P., Sony and Accenture, which are setting up back-room operations here for Asian companies and software R.& D. centers.
 ''I've taken a lot of American people to Dalian, and they are amazed at how fast the China economy is growing in this high-tech area,'' said Win Liu, director of U.S./E.U. projects for DHC, one of Dalian's biggest homegrown companies, which grew from 30 to 1,200 employees in six years. ''Americans don't realize the challenge to the extent that they should. I do have confidence in the American people, though, to take the challenge.''
 Because of Japan's long colonization of this area in the first half of the 20th century, Dalian has a pool of people who know Japanese. And because of its proximity to Japan and its abundance of Internet bandwidth, and parks and golf courses that attract knowledge workers, Dalian has become the Bangalore of China -- the center for outsourcing by Japanese businesses that want to tap China's low-cost brainpower. Japanese companies can hire three Chinese software engineers for the price of one in Japan, and still have change to buy a room full of call-center operators (starting salary: $90 a month).
 Although Japan is still deeply resented for its wartime abuses in China, young Chinese have not let that stop them from working as data-entry technicians, software programmers or call-center operators for Japanese companies -- some 2,800 have set up in Dalian -- in order to get onto the first rung of the high-tech ladder.
 ''We have 22 universities and colleges with over 200,000 students in Dalian,'' the city's mayor, Xia Deren, told me. More than half graduate with engineering or science degrees, and even those who don't are directed to spend a year studying Japanese or English and computer science. 
 ''The Japanese enterprises originally started some processing industries here,'' the mayor added, ''and with this as a base, they have now moved to R.& D. and software development. . . . In the past one or two years, the software companies of the U.S. are also making some attempts to move outsourcing of software from the U.S. to our city.''
 Although some of what the mayor says gets lost in translation, he gets it -- and we should, too: ''The rule of the market economy is that if somewhere has the richest human resources and the cheapest labor, of course the enterprises and the businesses will naturally go there,'' he said.
 Just as in manufacturing, he added, ''Chinese people first were the employees and working for the big foreign manufacturers. And after several years, after we have learned all the processes and steps, we can start our own firms. Software will go down the same road. . . . First we will have our young people employed by the foreigners, and then we will start our own. It is like building a building. Today, the U.S., you are the designers, the architects, and the developing countries are the bricklayers for the buildings. But one day, I hope, we will be the architects.''
 The Chinese certainly want to believe it's inevitable that they will move from basic software outsourcing to design, but even a top Chinese science planner acknowledges that it won't be easy. Xu Kuangdi, president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said to me that for China to advance, ''we have to build more products from our own intellectual property.'' But in software, he added, that will require ''improving the innovative capability of the younger generation,'' which will require some big changes in China's rigid, rote education system. Chinese officials, he said, are thinking about such changes right now. I wouldn't bet against them.
 Have your kids finished their homework?

HEADLINE: The Ever More Graspable, And Risky, American Dream

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif. 

 BODY:
For years, Ray and Shahrazad Daneshi sought to buy a home, only to be told that they did not earn enough to qualify for a mortgage. But they recently managed to buy a small house in the shadow of Disneyland for $360,000 -- six times their annual income -- thanks to a lender who allowed them to borrow the entire value of the home, with no down payment.
 ''We will not be going to any movies or eating out at restaurants,'' said Mr. Daneshi, a self-employed wedding photographer who came here from Iran in 1988. ''But in two years, the house will be worth a lot more and we will have something to show for it.''
 The Daneshis' purchase underscores the new, ever-optimistic economics of home buying. A kaleidoscopic array of mortgages for people with little cash or overstretched budgets has enabled families of modest income to take on debt that once would have been beyond their reach. As long as new home buyers could count on rock-bottom interest rates and housing values were going nowhere but up, this seemed to be a virtuous circle. 
 But now, with the Federal Reserve expected to embark on a series of interest rate increases starting with its meeting on June 30, some experts worry that recent first-time buyers could find easy home ownership a lot harder on their wallets, possibly causing housing prices to wobble in some high-price markets.
 With the Daneshis, for example, rising interest rates on the two adjustable-rate mortgages they took out to buy their house would mean that their monthly payment of $2,500 -- already more half their monthly income -- could go up substantially in two years. Mr. Daneshi realizes that, but is unconcerned.
 ''Why worry?'' he said, adding that he believes rising home prices will help him obtain a better loan deal by then.
 With interest rates going up, that may be wishful thinking. Most analysts agree that there is no nationwide housing bubble because housing prices have climbed only slowly in the Midwest and the South, even as they have soared on the East and West Coasts. Still, if rising interest rates cause housing prices to drop, even slightly, industry officials warn that some new buyers will have no equity in their homes and could choose to walk away from their loans if they run into trouble with payments.
 ''A lot of these loans are dangerous,'' said Allen Jackson, manager of Bristol Home Loan in Bellflower, Calif., a mortgage broker who specializes in so-called subprime loans, which charge higher interest rates to people unable to qualify for traditional mortgages. ''If you have any dip in values, people can just say the heck with it because they don't have any of their own money in the house.''
 Lenders have aggressively encouraged home buyers to stretch in ways that would have been unimaginable a decade ago. In the new world of flexible mortgage lending, it is possible to buy a $600,000 house with no down payment, and to pay only interest and nothing on the principal for years.
 ''The financing has changed everything,'' said Humid Karat, a manager of Tarbell Realty's office in Anaheim. ''Ten years ago, if I offered to buy your house with a 100 percent loan, you would have called it 'creative financing' and thought I was crooked. Today, everybody wants a 100 percent loan.''
 The volume of subprime mortgages, primarily for people with poor credit ratings, has risen sharply, as indicated by securities backed by the mortgages. Such securities soared to a total of $195 billion in 2003 from $17 billion in 1995, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research firm in Bethesda, Md. Securities backed by unconventional mortgages, like no-money-down loans, climbed to nearly $80 billion from less than $1 billion.
 ''Underwriting standards have loosened to almost historic levels,'' said Bill Dallas, a pioneer in no-money-down loans and a board member of the California Mortgage Bankers Association. ''Nobody is heeding the yield signs.''
 Experts say these novel techniques have democratized the access to credit and home ownership. The overall rate of ownership climbed to nearly 69 percent in 2003 from 64 percent in 1994. Home ownership among blacks rose to 48 percent from 42.2 percent. Among Hispanics, it was up to 46.4 percent from 41.1 percent.
 But the experts worry that problems may be just over the horizon, especially in markets where housing prices have risen far faster than personal income. Here in Orange County, one of the frothiest markets of all, the median price of a single-family home is $572,000, up 28 percent in the last year alone. 
 In the New York area, the median home price -- half were less expensive, half more expensive -- rose 88 percent from 1998 to 2003, to $353,000 from $188,100; in Miami, prices jumped to $226,800 from $121,500. The median home price for the Washington area increased to $286,200 from $172,100.
 Signs that the frenzy has not yet reached a peak abound in Southern California. In Ladera Ranch, a planned community in the southern part of Orange County, more than 1,000 people are on a waiting list for the chance to buy one of 27 unbuilt three-bedroom houses at prices starting in ''the low $400,000's.'' In San Bernardino County, where some commute as long as two hours a day to jobs in Los Angeles and elsewhere, a five-bedroom tract house that sold for $378,000 a year ago is on the market again for $609,000.
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at the research firm Economy.com, estimates that about a third of the nation's housing is now overpriced and poised for at least a mild drop in values as the Fed begins to push up rates.
 And there is a risk that the situation could turn into something a lot worse. ''If there is a fissure in the economic system, it's in housing,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''This is a big, rapidly growing market that has not been tested by higher interest rates. Many people got into their houses by the skin of their teeth.''
 Southern California is at the leading edge. People with poor credit ratings or low incomes can take out subprime mortgages at high interest rates. Those with good credit but erratic earnings can get what are called no-document loans, in which they do not have to prove their incomes.
 By any measure, such innovations have vastly expanded the availability of credit over the last decade, making it possible for people previously shut out of the market to share in the dream of home ownership.
 ''Thanks to God for finding me a mortgage program that let me buy my own house,'' Mr. Daneshi said.
 He and his wife, a seamstress at Disneyland, had lived for years in a cramped apartment with their autistic son. They took out two mortgages this month, one for $280,000 at 6 percent and the second mortgage for $80,000 at 10.25 percent. Both are adjustable after two years, and the payments are virtually certain to rise, meaning that their budget will be further pinched unless their income rises, too.
 And they are hardly alone in stretching. 
 Mark Christian, 33, a controller at a stock brokerage firm, is buying a four-bedroom house for $620,000. Mr. Christian, who earns $160,000 a year, is also borrowing the entire purchase price. To keep his monthly payments down to $3,700, he is taking out an interest-only loan.
 Mr. Christian is already bracing for higher monthly payments. His mortgage will adjust to prevailing interest rates after three years, which he expects will be higher. ''I'm figuring that my income will have climbed by then as well,'' he said.
 House prices have climbed so rapidly in the last few months that banks are refusing to appraise some properties as high as their selling prices.
 Jennifer Tracy, a graphic designer, recently agreed to buy a condominium in Los Angeles for $235,000. But the same property had exchanged hands less than a year before for $114,000, and no appraiser would value it at more than $195,000. Ms. Tracy bought the condo anyway, but only after coming up with the extra cash to bridge the gap.
 The big question is whether prices will remain so high once the Fed begins raising interest rates.
 Real estate agents and many homeowners here vividly remember that Southern California housing prices soared in the 1980's and then fell in the early 90's -- the bubble ruptured by a combination of rising rates and a severe contraction in the region's aerospace and armaments industries.
 Today, interest rates are clearly heading up, but employment is climbing and economic growth appears strong. As a result, the Fed is widely expected to start raising rates at the end of this month, and some analysts worry that it may have to raise rates more sharply than originally planned to keep inflation under control.
 Mr. Zandi, of Economy.com, said that in overheated markets like Southern California, housing prices could easily drop at least 5 percent.
 Mortgage brokers who help people qualify for bigger loans, acknowledge that they are nervous. But for the moment, they are pressing ahead.
 ''What can I do?'' asked Mr. Jackson, the manager of Bristol Home Loan, the subprime loan specialist. ''My job is to help people realize the American dream.''

HEADLINE: Latin America Graft and Poverty Trying Patience With Democracy

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: ILAVE, Peru 

 BODY:
On a morning in April, people in this normally placid spot in Peru's southeastern highlands burst into a town council meeting, grabbed their mayor, dragged him through the streets and lynched him. The killers, convinced the mayor was on the take and angry that he had neglected promises to pave a highway and build a market for vendors, also badly beat four councilmen. 
 The beating death of the mayor may seem like an isolated incident in an isolated Peruvian town but it is in fact a specter haunting elected officials across Latin America. A kind of toxic impatience with the democratic process has seeped into the region's political discourse, even a thirst for mob rule that has put leaders on notice. 
 In the last few years, six elected heads of state have been ousted in the face of violent unrest, something nearly unheard of in the previous decade. A widely noted United Nations survey of 19,000 Latin Americans in 18 countries in April produced a startling result: a majority would choose a dictator over an elected leader if that provided economic benefits. 
 Analysts say that the main source of the discontent is corruption and the widespread feeling that elected governments have done little or nothing to help the 220 million people in the region who still live in poverty, about 43 percent of the population.
 ''Latin America is paying the price for centuries of inequality and injustice, and the United States really doesn't have a clue about what is happening in the region,'' said Riordan Roett, director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University. 
 ''These are very, very fragile regimes,'' he added. ''Increasingly, there's frustration and resentment. The rate of voting is going down. Blank ballots are increasing. The average Latin American would prefer a very strong government that produces a physical security and economic security, and no government has been able to do that.''
 These at-risk governments stretch thousands of miles from the Caribbean and Central America through the spine of the Andes to the continent's southern cone, and increasingly the problems associated with weak governments are spilling beyond Latin America and affecting United States interests in the region.
 ''We're confronted with large increase in illegal migration,'' Mr. Roett said, ''more drugs pouring into the American market to meet an insatiable demand, and the potential for regime failure that could spread in the region and bring serious threats to our security position in the hemisphere.'' 
 Among the weakest states is Guatemala, which struggles with paramilitary groups, youth gangs and judicial impunity and has become a crossroads for the smuggling of people and drugs to the United States. 
 Several other governments are fragile at best and susceptible to popular unrest that could further weaken and topple them. These include the interim administration of Prime Minister Gerard Latortue in Haiti, which took power after a popular revolt this year, and President Carlos Mesa in Bolivia, who took power after such a revolt last year. 
 The most unpredictable and volatile region is the Andes. 
 Venezuela remains deeply polarized, as foes of President Hugo Chavez plot to oust him while he continues with what he has called a ''peaceful revolution'' that includes a radical redistribution of the nation's oil wealth. Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia are buffeted by nearly continuous protests from indigenous groups and other once-forgotten classes that are demanding to be heard.
 Their struggles vividly demonstrate an issue that animates strife in nearly all Latin America -- the gap between the haves and have-nots of money and power that makes the region the world's most inequitable, and increasingly the most politically polarized.
 Even in Argentina, once Latin America's most developed country, President Nestor Kirchner has warned of threats against his government and his life as he struggles to root out corruption, repair democratic institutions and lift the country out of an economic implosion in 2001 that prompted the fall of four presidents in two weeks. 
 In Argentina and elsewhere, the most immediate cause for alarm is the short-lived nature of individual governments and the havoc it can create. But the larger concern is that roiling instability is eroding the foundations of democracy. 
 In this climate, even competence has become cause for concern -- the popular impulse being to find something that works and to stick with it, whether arrived at democratically or not. In Colombia, where a stable and popular government has made new strides in beating back a 40-year-old Marxist insurgency and reviving the economy, the temptation has been to extend extrajudicial authority to President Alvaro Uribe's government and even change the constitution to permit his re-election.
 But, then, the pool of competent leaders from which to chose has proved limited. Having lost faith in President Alejandro Toldeo, Peruvians, opinion polls show, look to a return of Alberto K. Fujimori, the elected authoritarian who fled after corruption charges and lives in Japan, or to Alan Garcia, another former president, who was exiled in disgrace after a tenure considered one of the most corrupt and incompetent in Peru's recent history. 
 Their fortunes are being revived with the feeling, increasingly common in Peru and elsewhere, that only a caudillo, the classic Latin strongman, can solve the longstanding problems that plague the region. 
 The United Nations report, also drawn from interviews with current and former presidents, political analysts and cultural and economic figures, showed that 56 percent of those asked said economic progress was more important than democracy. 
 ''Democracy today is broad, but it's not deep,'' said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington-based policy group. ''It's broad in that the leadership talks about it, it's a buzzword. But the danger is that the more they talk about it the more skeptical the population becomes because they see a great deal of rhetoric but the standard of living of the impoverished hasn't improved.''
 The view is common among the common man, particularly in poverty-stricken corners.
 ''I believe in an authoritarian government, if it works,'' said Daniel Vargas, 24, a university student from Ilave whose father was accused with six others of having orchestrated the lynching of the mayor, Fernando Cirilo Robles. ''They do this in other countries and it works. Look at Cuba, that works. Look at Pinochet in Chile, that worked.''
 The United Nations report noted that the promise of prosperity offered by democracy has gone unfulfilled. Economic growth per capita, it said, ''did not vary in a significant manner'' in Latin America in the last 20 years, even though analysts had predicted that growth would pick up as governments flung open the doors to free-market changes prescribed by Washington and the International Monetary Fund. That institution has instead come to be considered a bete noire in this and many other developing parts of the world.
 A slump in local economies that has lasted years has only deepened the discontent with governments already widely scorned as corrupt and overly bureaucratic. Predictions that economic growth is on the way -- economists say Latin America will record a 4 percent growth rate this year after a long slump -- have done little to quell the dissatisfaction. 
 The main reason: recent growth has not been widely shared, but concentrated in isolated pockets, usually attached to multinational investments that employ few people. 
 Peru is a good example. It has the region's most impressive economic growth, on paper, with the economy expanding about 4 percent a year since Mr. Toledo was elected in 2001. But that growth has not filtered down, and the deep disillusionment that failure has inspired is not lost on Mr. Toledo, whose approval rating is mired below 10 percent.
 ''What good is an impressive growth rate?'' he said in a speech in May. ''Wall Street applauds us, but in the streets, no. So what good is it?''
 The poverty and inequality that breed unrest are never more apparent than in this desolate region, 13,000 feet above sea level, that hugs Lake Titicaca and the Bolivian border.
 Unlike Lima, prosperous and modern, the hamlets and farms here provide a meager life. ''What we have here is a subhuman life,'' said Teofilo Challo, 27, a farmer. ''We try to make it and work from sunrise to sundown just to survive. But we win nothing. No services, no health care, nothing.''
 Like many in Latin America who feel a disconnect from their government, the people here are Aymara Indians. They form part of Latin America's forgotten classes, often indigenous or otherwise nonwhite, who increasingly promise political upheaval.
 ''The government only pays attention to those who have power,'' said Nestor Chambi, an indigenous leader and agronomist. ''Rights are not for the poor. They are for the rich, by the rich, and so the people here have gotten tired.''
 The popular discontent with a central government seen as aloof, unresponsive and subservient to powerful interests was only amplified as Ilave's political, business and church leaders raised concerns about suspected corruption and incompetence by Mayor Robles, to no effect. 
 That Mr. Robles is Aymara himself, like practically all the townspeople here, did not matter. People here and throughout the region charge that politicians are corrupted by power and a long tradition in which politics is used as a spoils system for personal enrichment.
 Elected officials do not remember their people or keep their promises, people here complained. Gregorio Ticona, the first Aymara elected to Congress, faces corruption charges. The president of the regional government, David Jimenez, was also charged in May with corruption. 
 ''Institutions have no more credibility,'' said Percy Florez, a municipal official in Ilave. 
 Mr. Robles, a university-educated social scientist who belonged to a far-left fringe party, had political adversaries who agitated for his resignation, namely the lieutenant mayor, Alberto Sandoval, who has also been charged in Mr. Robles' death.
 But the political campaigning, mounting protests and hyperbolic reports in local radio stations, which fomented the unrest, did little to attract attention outside Ilave. 
 Protests reached a fever pitch after an April 2 meeting where residents demanded to know details of the town's finances, only to be shouted down by Mr. Robles's lieutenants. 
 ''People wanted to ask where the money was, but they did not let them speak,'' said Mr. Florez. 
 The mayor tried to diffuse tensions by leaving town. But when he returned on April 26 for a town council meeting at his house a mob awaited. 
 Mr. Robles fled with four councilmen, who sought refuge in an adjacent house, but were hunted down and dragged out into the dusty street.
 ''They threw rocks at the windows and we were so afraid,'' said Arnaldo Chambilla, a councilman, from his hospital bed. ''They pulled me out, they beat me. I do not remember after that.''
 Another councilman, Edgar Lope, recalled begging his attackers.
 ''I kneeled and said, 'Please forgive me,' '' he said. ''At that point, I had given myself to the Lord.''

HEADLINE: AT&T to Halt Some Residential Marketing

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
AT&T said yesterday that it would stop marketing its phone services to residents in seven states, an action the company said was in direct response to the Bush administration's decision not to intercede in the dispute over the fees carriers like AT&T pay to the Bell phone companies for the use of their networks. 
 AT&T also scaled back its revenue and operating income forecasts for the year, citing the administration's decision and industrywide pressure to cut prices. 
 On June 9, the administration said it would not appeal a federal court ruling that overturned Federal Communications Commission regulations requiring the Bells to provide competitive access to their networks. AT&T's subsequent request to stay the lower court's decision was rejected.
 ''For consumers and the economy, the consequences could well be dire,'' James W. Cicconi, AT&T's general counsel, wrote in a letter to Michael K. Powell, chairman of the F.C.C. ''If competitors leave the residential telephone business, the result will be higher prices and fewer choices for consumers, and fewer jobs, less innovation, and reduced investment in the industry.'' 
 AT&T's announcement is the most aggressive reaction yet to the June 9 decision, and could presage similar steps by other providers that also lease lines from the Bells, according to industry analysts. AT&T's residential customers in the seven states will continue to receive phone service, but ultimately the company argues that all consumers may face higher prices and fewer choices in their phone service.
 Among the carriers, the June 9 decision may touch off another round of cost-cutting steps and, potentially, closings and mergers in the long-distance industry.
 For now, AT&T will continue to provide local and long-distance phone service to its customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Tennessee and Washington, but will not try to find new customers there. Given how often and how quickly consumers change telephone providers, AT&T's decision not to seek new customers is tantamount to leaving those markets, a company spokesman said. (The company will, however, continue to serve and compete for business customers in those states.)
 AT&T said the selection of the seven states was determined by its relative inability to generate profits there, but some analysts contend that politics played a major role. Several of the states, particularly Missouri, Ohio and Tennessee, are likely to be hotly contested in the presidential elections this November, and spokesmen for several of the Bells said AT&T's announcement was a ploy intended to pressure the Bush administration, which sided with the Bells.
 Companies like AT&T -- called competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC's) -- pay the Bells to connect their calls. As part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the fees have been capped to promote competition in the local phone market. But the Bells argue that the caps force them to connect calls at prices below their costs, and they say the ceiling on the fees is no longer relevant because the CLEC's have a significant foothold in the local phone market.
 Still, AT&T said it paid about $11 billion a year in interconnection and other fees to the Bells and other carriers, an amount equal to almost a third of its revenue. Like other long-distance carriers and consumer groups, AT&T argues that giving the Bells free rein to raise fees will drive it from many markets, reduce competition and lead to higher retail prices.
 ''We foresee a future with less choice for consumers,'' David W. Dorman, chairman and chief executive of AT&T, said in a statement. ''Competitive alternatives are simply not available today for most Americans.''
 For their part, the Bells say they will continue to face stiff competition in the local market from wireless providers, cable companies and others, and that retail prices will not necessarily rise after the caps on interconnection fees are eliminated.
 ''Consumers can rest assured that competition will continue,'' SBC Communications said in a statement. ''AT&T's departure means there's one less than a lot. It's not a seismic event.''
 Since 1999, AT&T and others have attracted more than 29.6 million customers, capturing 16.3 percent of the local phone market. AT&T alone has 4.3 million local line customers nationwide. The company would not say how many residential customers it serves in the seven states, though it appears to be leaving markets where it is has fewer clients.
 The company only started offering local line service in Louisiana, New Hampshire and Washington in the first quarter of this year. AT&T entered the local phone market in Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee in the fourth quarter of 2003. AT&T, however, has offered local phone service in Ohio since June 2002.
 According to the F.C.C., 1,544,001 customers in six of the seven states affected by AT&T's decision (Arkansas does not release relevant figures) received local phones lines from CLEC's as of Dec. 31, 2003. This amounts to 8.6 percent of all subsidized local lines.
 ''AT&T's decision to leave these seven states makes perfect sense,'' said Edward Snyder, who covers the telecommunications industry at Charter Equity Research in San Francisco. AT&T benefited greatly while connection fees were capped, he said, and now must learn to survive without them. 
 ''When you live by regulations, you die by them,'' Mr. Snyder said.
 Walter B. McCormick Jr., the president of the United States Telecom Association, an industry group for local phone companies, said AT&T chose these states on the basis of their political importance in November, not for economic reasons. 
 ''AT&T is engaged in sleight of hand,'' Mr. McCormick said. ''This appears to be a political statement directed at presidential battleground states, rather than a real business announcement.''
 AT&T said its decision to stop marketing local phone lines in some residential markets would help reduce its full-year revenue to $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion, from the $31 billion to $32 billion expected before. 
 The company also said consolidated operating income minus restructuring charges would be $1 billion to $1.4 billion, below the $1.87 billion to $2.57 billion initially forecast. AT&T will accelerate its plans to introduce new Voice-over-Internet services that do not require it to use the Bells' networks.
 The fallout from the decision to remove the caps on the interconnection fees is still unclear for both the carriers and their customers. The Bells have not immediately raised their wholesale rates, and many analysts do not expect them to do so before the elections in November. Some state utility commissions have also issued orders in an effort to block the Bells from raising rates. The F.C.C. is also crafting rules that may preserve some of the existing fee structure.
 AT&T's decision comes a day after a smaller rival, Z-Tel Communications, said it would stop marketing its local phone services in eight rural states. The company, which is based in Tampa, Fla., serves 571,000 customers. It said operating in those states would no longer be profitable, given the likelihood that the Bells would raise their fees.
 It makes ''little business sense and would be unfair to consumers for Z-Tel to continue to recruit new customers knowing that there might be price increases or service disconnection shortly after migration,'' Z-Tel's vice president, Donald Davis, wrote in a letter to regulators.


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Strategic Withdrawal''The states where AT&T said it would stop trying to sign up new residential customers for local-calling plans include six where the company had only recently begun offering the service. In none of the seven have rivals to the local Bell phone company -- including AT&T -- made much competitive headway.SHARE OF TELEPHONE LINES SERVED BY NON-BELL CARRIERS, INCLUDING AT&TARKANSAS: 11%LOUISIANA: 10%MISSOURI: 11%NEW HAMPSHIRE: 17%OHIO: 14%TENNESSEE: 11%WASHINGTON: 11%TOTAL TELEPHONE LINES (RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS)ARKANSAS: 1,359,000LOUISIANA: 2,375,000MISSOURI: 3,360,000NEW HAMPSHIRE: 829,000OHIO: 6,851,000TENNESSEE: 3,319,000WASHINGTON: 3,809,000(Source by Federal Communications Commission)

HEADLINE: Loosening up some Depression-era limits on selling stocks short.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
SHORTING the stocks of some of the largest companies in the United States is about to become easier. But shorting the stocks that some investors view as the most overvalued will become more difficult.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new rule on short selling yesterday that for the first time in decades will allow some stocks to be sold short even though the price is falling. The original rule, which let investors sell most stocks short only when share prices were rising, was adopted during the Depression at a time when short sellers were blamed by some for the 1929 crash. 
 The short selling rule was adopted unanimously at the same meeting at which the commission, as expected, voted to require that chairmen of mutual fund boards be independent directors, rather than the head of the management company, as is now often the case.
 ''The leadership of an independent chairman will be the critical pivot point for avoiding potential conflicts of interest that can in the future lead to new forms of mismanagement, noncompliance and even fraud,'' said William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the S.E.C. 
 He was joined by the two Democratic members in voting for the measure, while the two other Republicans, Cynthia Glassman and Paul Atkins, opposed it, saying there was little evidence that investors would benefit from the changes.
 Short selling is the practice of borrowing shares and then selling them. It is usually done to bet that the stock price will decline, which allows the seller to buy the shares back at a lower price and pocket the difference after returning them. But it can also be done as part of hedging strategies. 
 To many economists, short selling helps create efficient markets for stocks by allowing prices to be influenced by everyone who has an opinion on a stock, and restrictions on the practice, therefore, impede market efficiency.
 But many companies bitterly complain that traders use it to drive down prices in what are called bear raids. They are especially angry about so-called naked shorting, in which stocks are sold short even though the seller has not borrowed shares.
 The S.E.C. agreed yesterday that for a year, beginning on Jan. 3, one-third of the stocks in the Russell 3000 -- basically the 3,000 largest companies traded on American markets -- would have the basic limitation on short selling removed.
 On the New York and American Stock Exchanges, that limitation bars a short sale of any stock except at a price higher than the last different price. On the Nasdaq stock market, there is a somewhat similar rule based on the bid price of the stock.
 For the stocks chosen to be part of the trial -- every third one based on average volume -- that rule would be suspended. During the year, the S.E.C. would study the trading in those stocks to determine differences in liquidity, volatility and the speed with which the stocks adjusted to changes in fundamental conditions. Of the stocks to be in the trial, 50 percent trade on the Big Board, 48 percent on Nasdaq and the remainder on the American Stock Exchange. The names will be announced next week.
 At the end of the year, the S.E.C. will consider whether to remove the rule for all stocks.
 Naked shorting is now against the rules of all exchanges, but the rules vary. The S.E.C. decided to adopt its own rule, requiring that brokers may not execute a short sale until they have determined that shares are available to borrow.
 Selling short a stock that has not been borrowed leads to a failure to deliver the shares. With the new rule, in cases of what appear to be substantial naked shorting, it will become much harder to sell short.
 If at least 10,000 shares of a stock, amounting to at least 0.5 percent of the shares outstanding, have not been delivered for five consecutive days, then a brokerage firm that has failed to deliver any shares will not be allowed to sell further shares short without having already arranged to borrow them.
 Annette Nazareth, the S.E.C. director of market regulation, said yesterday that about 4 percent of the outstanding issues would now face the restrictions. It is likely that many, if not most, of those stocks are smaller companies, many traded on the over-the-counter bulletin board. A result would be that it would be harder to bet against some of those stocks.

HEADLINE: Land of Opportunity? For Some, It's Poland

BYLINE: By REGAN MORRIS

DATELINE: THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. 

 BODY:
Shoppers snatched up Indonesian masks, Buddha figurines and cat statues, and riffled through piles of multicolored sarongs. ExoTeak, a Southeast Asian furniture store in this suburban California town, was packed for the first time in months -- but only because it was going out of business.
 ''I should have put that sign up years ago,'' said Fernando Zucca, the store's owner, referring to the giant closing banner on the roof of his car, parked outside. Now, Mr. Zucca and his wife, Magdalena Wullert-Zucca, are abandoning the United States and focusing on a land that they consider an entrepreneurial mecca: Poland.
 While sales at their ExoTeak store here grew steadily at about 10 percent a year after it opened in 1998, the couple struggled to break even every year as they coped with high labor and rental costs, fickle customers and California's many complicated regulations. Meanwhile, their store in Ms. Wullert-Zucca's native Poland turned an instant profit when it opened in May 1999, six months after ExoTeak. 
 At that time, after more than four decades of Communist rule, Poland was coursing with free-market energy and starving for outside investment. The country was also in the early stages of negotiating membership in the European Union, which it joined last month. And the couple liked what they saw in Poland: low costs, a strong work ethic and a voracious national appetite for long-denied consumer goods. The 700-square-foot teak-furniture store that they named Imperium was an instant success in Poznan, a cosmopolitan city of 750,000, midway between Berlin and Warsaw. While sales have not soared, they have remained steady, and so has the profit, though the Zuccas declined to provide figures.
 ''It's too expensive to do business in the States,'' Ms. Wullert-Zucca said. ''To have someone working for you in the States, it's at least $10 an hour. In Poland, it's about $300 a month. And this person is happy, because people are working for $100 or $150 for a whole month.''
 The rent is cheaper, too. Ms. Wullert-Zucca's parents, who own the building where the couple have their Polish shop, take a percentage of their gross sales, which comes to a fraction of what they paid in California. And there are other savings. Furniture damaged on the way from Indonesia, for example, can be repaired cheaply in Poland but usually had to be thrown out in California. In all, the couple say, their operating costs are 25 percent lower in Poland than in the United States.
 Yet demand is so great for their products that they are able to keep prices close to what they charged in Thousand Oaks, selling an outdoor chair for $60 instead of $70, for example. (A weaker dollar and a stronger Indonesian rupiah, however, have increased the Zuccas' costs.)
 The couple's experience shows that mom-and-pop businesses, and not just big corporations, are feeling the pull of opportunity and lower costs abroad. More than 200,000 American businesses with fewer than 100 employees export goods each year, according to the Commerce Department, and that number has been surging. Many more small ventures import merchandise, contract out work abroad or otherwise tap into the global economy.
 Eastern Europe, and particularly Poland, holds allure for American businesses of all sizes, not only because it has low costs and an educated work force but also because it is a gateway to the European Union and its 430 million people. But Mr. Zucca and his wife have ridden the trend in a relatively unusual direction, forsaking an economy that was once the wonder of the world in favor of a society in the early stages of capitalist growth.
 Betty Jo Toccoli, president of the California Small Business Association, said she was not surprised by their migration. ''I hear four to five times a day about someone closing their business in California, either making the decision to move to a different state or just because of the high costs and onerous regulations,'' she said, adding that in her opinion California is one of the most difficult places in the United States to do business. ''We have high workers' comp,'' Ms. Toccoli said. ''We have high general liability, high licensing fees, high taxes. It goes right on down the line.''
 The Zuccas believe their store in Poland thrives not only because of lower costs but also because people there are hungrier for exotic products than Americans are. ''In Poland, people look for new things,'' Mr. Zucca said. ''They're anxious to find something new. It's been 15 years since communism, but there's still so much opportunity for new things.''
 Take outdoor heaters. Three years ago, Mr. Zucca knew of only one in all of Poznan. Today, they warm patrons at cafes and restaurants all over the city. ''I wish I'd brought them in,'' he said. He and his wife see untold other product gaps in Poland and have talked about providing some of the missing goods, like hot tubs.
 By contrast, Mr. Zucca says, Americans have so much choice in consumer products they have become jaded. In California especially, he says, retailers have trouble just coaxing customers from their cars. ''First of all, strip malls are an uphill battle,'' he said a few days after his shop officially closed on May 1, the same day Poland joined the European Union. ''If you're not in the line of sight, forget it. People don't really leave their cars to explore in Los Angeles.''
 It has not been all easy sailing in Poland, of course. The value-added tax on goods is 22 percent, compared with California's 7 percent sales tax. And so far, Imperium does not accept credit cards, though the owners plan to do so soon.
 Mr. Zucca, 35, and his wife, 34, could be emblems for globalization. She was born in Poland; he was born in Oakland, Calif. They met in India a decade ago when they were both traveling for pleasure and thinking of business opportunities. For the last five years, they have lived in a walk-up apartment in one of Singapore's few remaining colonial-era neighborhoods surrounded by lush, rolling hills. They chose that island nation for their home because it is so close to Bali, where they buy most of their furniture, and because it offers frequent and affordable flights to Europe and America. (When they moved, they left day-to-day management of the California store in the hands of Mr. Zucca's brother-in-law; they have put his father-in-law in charge of the Polish store when they are not in Poznan.)
 Now, they say, they are looking for other business opportunities around the globe. ''This whole Bali thing started because I started thinking like a global bargain hunter,'' Mr. Zucca said. ''After a country crashes, you purchase what they're good at. If Argentina crashes, you buy their wine.''
 He also says he is interested in getting a foothold in China's booming economy, though he and his wife have no specific plans. What about California? They would love to return, but probably will not unless the real estate bubble bursts, a natural disaster wreaks havoc or both events take place, he says.
 ''An earthquake,'' he said. ''If there's a big earthquake, I'll come in and buy real estate. I can wait until then.''

HEADLINE: Until a more thorough study is done, it is impossible to know whether private or federal airport screeners perform better.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
IN remarkably short order, the federal government hired 45,000 workers and took over passenger screening at virtually all airports in response to Sept. 11. Would the private sector do a better job? 
 This question is not just academic: on Nov. 19, the Transportation Security Administration will permit airports to apply to opt out of using federal screeners in lieu of private screeners operating under federal supervision. Initial guidelines for the application and selection process are due this week. 
 The Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which set up the system, required the new agency to select up to five airports representing different security risks to use private screeners. This pilot program, known as PP5, was intended to provide evidence on whether privately contracted screeners could achieve the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of federal screeners. 
 In truth, the private screeners are part of a hybrid system because they are overseen by federal employees and highly regulated. For example, private screeners are required to be paid at least as much as federal ones, and to undergo the same training. Still, the PP5 program is the only available evidence on how well private screeners perform compared with federal ones in the current system. 
 Results of three studies -- by the General Accounting Office, by the inspector general of the Homeland Security Department, and by BearingPoint, a consulting firm hired by the Transportation Security Administration -- comparing performance at privately and federally screened airports were announced at a Congressional hearing in April. Although the detailed results are classified, it is clear that the studies reached the same conclusion: there was no statistical evidence of different performance at federally and privately screened airports. 
 For example, in its summary report, BearingPoint describes four separate security checks, including covert tests in which inspectors tried to sneak banned items past checkpoints, and computerized Threat Image Projection tests, which superimposed images of threatening objects on X-rays of passengers' luggage. Of the five privately screened airports, only Kansas City performed better than federally screened ones in its class -- and that difference could easily have occurred by chance. 
 The cost of operating the privately screened airports was about $1.3 million less, on average, than what the cost was estimated to have been under federal screeners based on traffic flows and other factors, but this figure does not do justice to the uncertainty underlying the calculation. We can be 95 percent confident that the true difference from using private screeners falls between it being $3 million more costly to $5.6 million cheaper, a huge range.
 There is simply not enough evidence to conclude with any reasonable degree of certainty whether, as a group, private or federal screeners performed better or cost less. 
 Each study suffered from two unavoidable flaws because of the design of the Pilot Program. 
 The first flaw is what the econometrician Arthur Goldberger calls ''micronumerosity,'' meaning the sample size is very small. Five privately screened airports are not enough to yield results worth placing much confidence in. If you flip a coin five times, it will be hard, from the results, to tell whether the coin is balanced. More than five airports are required to distinguish consequential differences between federal and private screeners from random patterns in the data. 
 This problem was compounded because BearingPoint examined performance of each airport against the others in its class, but did not average the results across the five airports. Averaging would have yielded a more precise estimate of the private-public difference. 
 The second flaw is equally serious. The five privately screened airports were not selected at random. Instead, the agency used 11 criteria -- including the availability of law enforcement officials to the airport and the screening company's resources -- to choose them from among the 19 airports that applied to use private screeners. It is likely that this process yielded airports that gave the private screeners an advantage over the remaining 424 federally screened airports for reasons having nothing to do with whether the screeners were federal or private. This problem is known as selection bias, as the selection and application process stacked the comparison in a particular direction. 
 Indeed, micronumerosity is probably the only reason that selection bias did not cause the studies to find that private screeners outperformed federal ones, irrespective of the true state of affairs. 
 Random assignment of some airports to use private screeners and others to a control group with federal screeners would solve the selection problem. 
 A recent memorandum by the Office of Management and Budget explains the benefit of random assignment: it ''ensures, to a high degree of confidence, that there are no systematic differences between the groups in any characteristics (observed and unobserved) except one -- namely, the intervention,'' which in this case means the intervention to allow airports to opt out of federal screening. 
 In a noteworthy break from past practices, the budget office advised agencies in its revised Program Assessment Rating Tool, ''The most definitive data supporting a program's overall effectiveness would be from a randomized controlled trial, when appropriate and feasible.'' 
 The acting administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, David M. Stone, testified that he planned to continue evaluating the effectiveness of private and federal screeners after the opt-out program took effect. So here is a proposal. Suppose 70 airports apply to opt out of federal screening and are deemed eligible. Rather than grant all 70 authority to use private screeners at once, randomly select half of them to opt out and half to continue with federal screeners. This sample is large enough to estimate the cost difference to within $1 million or so. 
 Allowing all the applicants to opt out at once could strain the agency's capacity to supervise and monitor the program. Random assignment is not only feasible, it is the fairest way to select the eligible applicants. Airports that are not selected could be phased in later, and serve as a control group in the meantime. 
 With random assignment of enough airports, there would be no reason to suspect that differences in outcomes between federally and privately screened airports resulted from anything other than whether screening was done by the government or the private sector. Without it, we will be right back where Clark Kent Ervin, the inspector general of Homeland Security, said we are now: without ''a sufficient basis at this time to determine conclusively whether the pilot airport screeners performed at a level equal to or greater than that of the federal screeners.''

HEADLINE: Planning Group Opposes Jets Stadium for West Side

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
After a year of study and months of political arm-twisting by the Bloomberg administration, the Regional Plan Association has written a draft report opposing construction of a $1.4 billion football stadium in Manhattan for the New York Jets.
 The association, an influential private planning organization, effectively became the first major civic group in the city to publicly criticize a key element of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ambitious $6.5 billion plan to redevelop the far West Side with an expanded convention center, a new subway extension, skyscrapers, apartment houses, parks and a stadium. 
 City officials, including Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, addressed the association's board of directors Tuesday afternoon in a last-minute attempt to convince the group that the stadium would help revitalize the West Side, urging that the draft report be revised. But Peter Herman, chairman of the group, said the final report would not substantially differ from the draft. He said it would be revised to take into account the board meeting and the city's environmental impact statement for the West Side plans. 
 ''There is no compelling need to place this facility in a part of the city that should be devoted to high-value, high-density office and residential development,'' according to the draft report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. It adds that no football stadium in the nation has produced the economic benefits predicted by the city and the Jets.
 The intense lobbying over the report is but the latest example of the turmoil within civic and business groups created by the city's far-reaching plans for the West Side. Some organizations have simply opted to ignore the topic, rather than risk angering the mayor or neighborhood groups opposed to the stadium.
 Despite the huge sums at stake and the potential impact on the city's budget, the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group that assesses municipal budgets, has no plans to evaluate the city's proposals, officials there said. Sidestepping the stadium issue, the Municipal Art Society recently proposed expanding the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center by going west rather than north, making an argument that both sides in the debate regarded as irrelevant to the real issue.
 The city's tourism and real estate industries have all come out in favor of the city's West Side plans, particularly the Javits expansion, along with the rezoning of the area for high-rise development and the subway line. Several leaders of those industries, however, have said privately that they have misgivings about the stadium but have been reluctant to alienate City Hall.
 ''It's never easy disagreeing with the mayor, and it's even harder when it's the core of what his administration wants to accomplish,'' said Gene Russianoff of the New York Public Interest Group, which also came out yesterday against the stadium.
 After suffering a defeat at the regional planning group, the Jets, who now play in New Jersey at Giants Stadium, immediately issued a news release highlighting an endorsement of the stadium plan by Paul T. Williams Jr., president of One Hundred Black Men, a civic group.
 ''It's unquestionably a bold initiative,'' Mr. Williams said yesterday. ''To some extent, that's what's kept some people on the sidelines. But the fact of the matter is we have acres of space that's laid fallow for decades.''
 Mr. Williams, whose group announced its support for the project two weeks ago at a City Council hearing, said he was in discussions with the Jets and the city about establishing opportunities for businesses owned by members of minorities and women in the redevelopment project.
 Mr. Doctoroff said the plan association report was simply the beginning of a dialogue, and reiterated his position that the development would have a profound impact on the city's economy. But the report may open the floodgates for other civic and environmental groups to weigh in. 
 ''The civic groups work best when they work in unison,'' said Eric Goldstein, a staff lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''The R.P.A. situation had slowed down any possible joint efforts. I wouldn't call it a consensus yet, but there are widespread concerns in civic and environmental circles concerning the stadium and the diversion of scarce city dollars from higher-priority capital projects.''
 Mr. Russianoff said the stadium would block public access to the riverfront on the Hudson.
 ''You could dress up the stadium with restaurants, flea markets and a deck to a waterfront park, but it's still a giant bulky box between the city and the waterfront,'' he said. ''There are some serious questions about whether the economic benefits they project are going to work out.''

HEADLINE: Dow Finishes 84 Points Higher, Thanks to a Late Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street had its second successive late-session rally yesterday, but market watchers are doubtful that the advances will hold as Wall Street awaits the Federal Reserve meeting and the transfer of power in Iraq next week.
 Investors have largely factored in the expected rise in interest rates and a shaky transition of power in Baghdad, so many analysts think the sideways trading of the last several weeks could continue even after those events have passed. But the late-day buying was still encouraging. 
 The idea that the smart money moves in at the end of the day is ''an old line,'' said Bill Groenveld, head trader for vFinance Investments. ''But it gives me a warm feeling. I think whenever more people decide to step up, it'll be to the upside.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 84.50 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 10,479.57. The Nasdaq composite index rose 26.83 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,020.98. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 9.65 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,144.06. 
 Despite strong corporate earnings and robust economic growth, concern about rising interest rates, higher fuel prices and the situation in Iraq has paralyzed investors in recent weeks.
 The next major development to propel stocks higher may not come until companies start reporting their second-quarter earnings next month. Until then, investors will be closely monitoring corporate forecasts and economic numbers, including the weekly labor market figures expected today, and the government's report on gross domestic product on Friday.
 They will also be watching to see what signals come from the Fed next week. Aside from the details of the initial rise in interest rates, investors will be looking for assurance that the Fed is willing to act more aggressively to curb inflation, should it become necessary, said Peter Cardillo, a market analyst with S.W. Bach & Company.
 ''Obviously the market is in a stagnant mood,'' Mr. Cardillo said. ''But we have some significant uncertainties in the Middle East, with Iraq, and the Fed. The market wants some confirmation and a statement that they will be ready to raise rates more next time, if they need to.''
 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco climbed $2.43, to $68.33, after news that its proposed $2.6 billion merger with Brown & Williamson had been approved by the Federal Trade Commission. The combination must still be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Reynolds shareholders. The American depository receipts of British American Tobacco, the parent company of Brown & Williamson, were up $1.35, to $32.12.
 FedEx gained $1.62, to $80.05, after reporting better-than-expected earnings on steady demand for ground services and international shipments.
 EBay rose $1.14, to $88.35, after announcing plans to buy Baazee.com, the most popular online shopping site in India, for $50 million. Internet usage is low in India, but eBay is betting it will rise.
 Treasury prices rose yesterday. The price of the 10-year Treasury note jumped 5/32, to 100 13/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.70 percent, from 4.72 percent on Tuesday. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 10/32, to 99 28/32. The yield dipped to 5.38 percent from 5.40 percent on Tuesday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Limits on Trips To Cuba Cause Split in Florida

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH and TERRY AGUAYO

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 23 

 BODY:
Miriam Verdura could hardly wait to visit family in her native Cuba next month, her second trip since immigrating to southern Florida in 1999. But the Bush administration has dashed her plans with restrictions that start next Wednesday. 
 ''It's inhuman,'' said Ms. Verdura, who was at the airport Wednesday morning seeing off friends who managed to book round-trip flights before the rules take effect and who were checking baggage with dozens of other travelers.
 Because she last visited in 2002, Ms. Verdura will be ineligible to return until next year. 
 ''Bush's priority should first of all be to not keep Cuban families apart, because we suffer a lot,'' she said.
 The rules, published over the last week, have been promoted by President Bush as a way to hasten the end of the Castro government and were formulated at the urging of Republican Cuban-American lawmakers and others here. They limit Cuban-Americans to one trip home every three years and make it nearly impossible for most other Americans to visit the Communist island. They also restrict cash transfers and gift packages to Cubans.
 ''The only way to get rid of Fidel is to get tight on him,'' said Mario Guzman, 75, who immigrated here in 1973 and was waiting to play dominoes in a park in the Little Havana section. ''The main reason why he's still in power is because the very Cubans he forced out are bringing him dollars back.''
 But if supporters of a hard-line position toward Havana are applauding the measures, other Cuban-Americans are not. The regulations have sent travel agents and many travelers spinning as they try to rearrange plans by next Wednesday, when the government-issued licenses that Cuban immigrants have used will become invalid, and violators of the rules will face up to $4,000 in fines.
 Charter companies are adding flights this week between Miami and Cuba, and travel agents are scrambling to find customers who have already left and warn them to return before Wednesday. Colleges and universities face canceling dozens of Cuban travel programs, and boaters can no longer dock there, even if they spend no money. 
 ''People are crying, saying, 'Please, can't you put me on a plane?''' Tessie Aral, vice president and chief executive of ABC Charters, said. ''One said, 'I have to go because my mother is dying.' They can't wait another three years.'' 
 The measures are part of a broader plan that President Bush announced last month to be tougher on President Fidel Castro and speed a transition to democracy in Cuba. Democrats and even some Republicans say the election-year crackdown is a nakedly political move to bolster Mr. Bush's support among Cuban-Americans in southern Florida, a crucial segment of his base in this swing state. 
 A debate is raging about whether Mr. Bush went too far and whether the crackdown could in fact hurt his re-election prospects.
 ''It's very important for people to vote against him because of this policy,'' Ms. Aral said. ''When we were helping check people into a flight last weekend, I said: 'Are you registered to vote? Then you need to vote this November.' Eighty percent said they would.''
 On the other side of the debate are older Cuban-Americans like Mr. Guzman who arrived here decades ago, who take a much harder stance than their younger counterparts against Mr. Castro and press Washington do the same. Many are more affluent and educated than recent immigrants, far more likely to vote and less likely to visit Cuba. They are steadfast Republicans who helped ensure Mr. Bush's 537-vote victory over Al Gore here in 2000. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Bush's campaign, Reed Dickens, said the rules were not a vote-getting tactic but an effort to free Cubans from Mr. Castro's hold. ''No one has a stronger record than President Bush in fighting the Castro regime while at the same time helping the oppressed people of Cuba,'' Mr. Dickens said. 
 Under the changes, United States residents will be allowed to visit relatives once every three years instead of once a year. They will be able to spend $50 a day, down from $167, plus $50 a day for transportation, if needed. Visitors will need a special license that will let them visit immediate family members only, for up to 14 days at a time.
 Until now, a ''general license'' has allowed them to visit relatives like cousins and aunts. 
 Another change limits gifts sent to the island to food, medical supplies, radios and batteries. Although any American older than 18 can now send up to $1,200 a year, the rules will allow only people with immediate family members in Cuba to send money, and just to those relatives. 
 Sergio Bendixen, a pollster here, said the changes might benefit Mr. Bush, because most Cuban-Americans who vote are rigidly anti-Castro. More recent immigrants, who tend to hold more moderate views, make up 15 percent of the Cuban-American electorate even though they make up half the Cuban-American population in Florida, Mr. Bendixen said. Of the 600,000 Cuban-American voters here, more than 80 percent supported Mr. Bush in 2000. 
 Joe Garcia, executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation, the most prominent exile group, said he would not be so sure, pointing to a survey by Telemundo that showed a 50-50 split among local viewers on the new rules. 
 ''I don't know if we are standing on strong moral ground here,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''Someone who has been as pro family as President Bush should not be affecting family relationships between exiles and Cubans on the islands.''
 Mr. Garcia said his group did, however, support other proposals that Mr. Bush made last month, including adding millions in spending to support Cuban dissidents and beaming anti-Castro broadcasts financed by the United States from a specially equipped plane. 
 Mr. Bush made his announcement seven months after he appointed a panel to recommend tighter sanctions and after Republican Cuban-American lawmakers complained that he should do more to bring down the Castro government. At the time, the lawmakers warned that Cuban-Americans might withdraw their support for Mr. Bush if he did not act boldly.
 Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Miami Republican who is one of the strongest anti-Castro voices here, said Cuban-Americans should not return to the island at all because they are political refugees.
 ''In any other country in the world,'' Mr. Diaz-Balart said, ''if you're an asylee, you cannot go back until the political conditions change.'' 
 As part of the crackdown, Mr. Bush is also prohibiting college students from visiting for courses that last less than 10 weeks and secondary school students from going at all. The change will eliminate dozens of short educational trips sponsored by American colleges and universities in conjunction with cultural groups. 
 ''We are all writing letters and urging that these measures be rescinded because they are a violation of academic freedoms,'' Wayne Smith, director of the Cuba Exchange Program at the Johns Hopkins University, said. 
 Last year, Mr. Bush banned cultural visits to Cuba organized by museums and other charitable groups, visits that President Bill Clinton began allowing in 1999. The United States has imposed a trade embargo against Cuba since 1962, three years after Mr. Castro seized power, though food and medicine sales are allowed case by case. Congress voted to end the travel ban to Cuba last fall, but removed the provision from an appropriations bill after Mr. Bush threatened to veto it. 
 In a sign that the government is beefing up enforcement, federal prosecutors on June 10 charged the organizers of several sailboat races between Key West and Cuba with violating the embargo and ''trading with the enemy.'' 
 ''This is simply an abuse of nautical rights,'' Commodore Jose Miguel Diaz Escrich, founder of the Hemingway International Nautical Club, said in a telephone interview from Havana. In a typical June, he said, at least 40 American boats docked there at a time. Now, Mr. Diaz said, there are none.

HEADLINE: Negroponte Is Sworn In As U.S. Envoy For New Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23 

 BODY:
John D. Negroponte was sworn in as the United States ambassador to Iraq on Wednesday and vowed to work with the government in Baghdad taking power next week to restore security, economic reconstruction and democracy.
 Speaking at a ceremony at the State Department, where Secretary Colin L. Powell administered the oath of office, Mr. Negroponte said that he was also committed to work with American military commanders and with other countries to heal some of the wounds left by a difficult American occupation. 
 ''When all is said and done, the freedom, security and prosperity of the Iraqi people matter to us, all of us in the community of nations, and we all must give that country our full support,'' said Mr. Negroponte, whose most recently was American ambassador to the United Nations.
 His words were greeted by loud applause from a large crowd packed into the Benjamin Franklin room on the top floor of the State Department. 
 Along with top administration officials, many in the crowd were veteran Foreign Service officers, including some who have voiced skepticism of the Bush administration's policies in Iraq. For them and some others, the return of Iraqi sovereignty also means a return to State Department control for the American representation in Baghdad.
 The event was filled with hopeful statements about Iraq's future, most notably from Secretary Powell, who has worked closely with Mr. Negroponte in the past. When Mr. Powell was national security adviser under President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Negroponte was his deputy. 
 Meanwhile, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, told reporters that after a recent visit to Iraq, he was convinced that the security situation had grown worse in the last year and that the United States needed to recruit troops from NATO or European nations to help.
 Mr. Biden said he had repeatedly been told by American military commanders, ''I have all the forces I need for my mission,'' but he asserted that such statements masked an underlying sentiment that more forces were needed to secure the country. 
 He dismissed with an epithet the assertion by some American authorities that 200,000 police and security forces were in operation in Iraq, saying that almost none of these forces had been properly trained or equipped. ''I don't think they've got their act together yet,'' he said of American officials in Baghdad. 
 At the ceremony for Mr. Negroponte, Mr. Powell said the administration would follow a ''five-step strategy'' after June 30, when Iraqi sovereignty is restored: transferring power, establishing security, building a new infrastructure, getting more international support and supporting a process of democratization.
 ''We have never sought an Iraq that was our client or dependency,'' Mr. Powell said. ''Quite the contrary. Ambassador Negroponte will guide our cooperation and will smooth out any differences that may arise, as all of the president's envoys do wherever they serve around the world.''

HEADLINE: Comdex, the Computer Show, Canceled for Lack of Interest

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 23 

 BODY:
This year's Comdex, the fall computer event that was once the nation's largest trade show, was canceled Wednesday as its owners cited the failure of the industry's largest companies to participate. 
 Executives at MediaLive International, the company that owns Comdex and other trade shows, said they decided to redefine the event and were hoping that it would re-emerge after a year's hiatus.
 Created in 1979 by Sheldon Adelson, a Boston financial consultant, Comdex rapidly gained prominence in the early 1980's with the emergence of the personal computer industry.
 The annual show became the place to showcase new computers and software, and a mandatory stopping place for industry luminaries. 
 Executives would flock to Las Vegas to hear a speech on the future of computing by Bill Gates or to visit a booth where Mitchell D. Kapor introduced the Lotus Development Corporation's Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program.
 ''I remember walking down an aisle at Comdex with Gates and watching the crowd part like the Red Sea making way for Moses,'' said Stewart Alsop, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who edited Infoworld, a personal computer industry newspaper, during the 1980's.
 Although some analysts suggested that the rise of the commercial Internet in the mid-1980's might lead to the demise of the trade show, it appeared initially to fuel its growth.
 Comdex reached a peak in 2000 during the Internet bubble when 211,000 people attended the show. Last year attendance fell to 45,000, and most of the world's largest hardware and software companies either decided to abandon the event or to cut back their presence. The number of exhibitors fell from a peak of 2,337 to 550.
 ''By the end of the 1990's Comdex had expanded its focus to include consumer electronics stuff and the Internet,'' said Tim Bajarin, an industry consultant who attended his first Comdex in 1981 and has been a longtime member of the show's industry advisory committee. ''In 2002 there was a complete shift in the market and the show lost its way.''
 One company that has backed away from the event is the EDS Corporation, the giant Texas-based technology integrator. In 2001 EDS made a marketing push at Comdex, including beaming in the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke via teleconference. More recently, the company decided that Comdex had become less relevant and stopped participating, said Jeff Wacker, an EDS technology executive.
 MediaLive International has a tentative reservation for the Las Vegas Convention Center the week of Nov. 13, 2005, said Eric Faurot, a company vice president.
 ''The market was obviously saying it couldn't support the show,'' he said. ''While we could still run a profitable Comdex, it didn't seem to merit the attention without the participation of the major industry players.''
 He said that he still believed that there was a trade show market for the $915 billion information technology industry. Last week, MediaLive said it was establishing an advisory group of technology companies to help redefine the event, including Advanced Micro Devices, Borland Software, Microsoft, Oracle, Samsung Electronics, Cisco, Dell and Intel.
 Comdex was originally known as the Computer Dealers Exposition. The founder, Mr. Adelson, sold Comdex in 1995 to the Japanese investment firm Softbank for more than $860 million. It became part of the company's Ziff-Davis media unit. Ultimately, the Ziff-Davis events business was spun off to shareholders as Key3Media and became a public company. That firm declared bankruptcy in February 2003. In June of last year, Thomas Weisel & Partners, the San Francisco investment firm, acquired its assets and title. 
 The company was taken private and renamed MediaLive International.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* ''BYZANTIUM: FAITH AND POWER (1261-1557),'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through July 5. This vast and humblingly beautiful show about the waning centuries of the Byzantine empire reminds us that political decay does does not necessarily mean artistic decline. Full of amazing exotica -- manuscripts, miniature mosaics, textiles, drawings, paintings -- the exhibition ends with a room of great Northern Renaissance art indebted to icons that proves Byzantium's continued reach. People who are not Eastern Orthodox believers can enjoy the earthly pleasures of aesthetic spectacle linked with historical enlightenment. Hours: Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Michael Kimmelman).

''CHILDE HASSAM, AMERICAN IMPRESSIONIST,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sept. 12. A grossly inflated retrospective of this immensely popular American Impressionist, he of the candied views of patriotic, flag-draped New York during World War I. Retrospectives are supposed to change one's notion of an artist, so I suppose you could say that this one succeeds by definitively ratcheting Hassam's reputation several notches downward. The show is full of Hassam's cheerful, nostalgic views of Americana; skillful, high-keyed scenes full of flickering light, which, while occasionally brilliant, look especially facile brought together by the dozens, as they are here. Hassam could do almost anything technically in a variety of media: a night scene, the glint of water on the side of a horse-drawn carriage, dappled sun through a scrim of autumn trees, people massing in a canyon of tall buildings, a Seville courtyard in the slanting light of the late afternoon. Anything except what mattered most, which was offer up something deeper and daring. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

* ''LIVING LEGACIES: THE ARTS OF THE AMERICAS,'' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, permanent installation. In conjunction with its new facade and lobby, the museum has opened its revamped Hall of the Americas, the spacious display arena for objects from its collection of North, Central and South American art. Redone in vibrant colors, the hall offers three thematic shows as Phase I of its new installation. ''Enduring Heritage: Art of the Northwest Coast'' is the fiercest and most startling, with dramatic animal masks and a giant totem pole. ''Threads of Time: Woven Histories of the Andes'' presents 38 textiles and related materials from ancient times to now and ''Stories Revealed: Writing Without Words,'' the smallest, conveys how Indian cultures used graphic art rather than words to record their histories. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Grace Glueck).

* ''MODIGLIANI: BEYOND THE MYTH,'' Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, through Sept. 19. The first big New York retrospective of Modigliani since 1951, believe it or not, this is an overstuffed show that includes predictable duds, but also a select group of his best sculptures and paintings, which belie the stereotype of Modigliani as an impulsive lunatic, hellbent on self-destruction, doing poster-ready work. The good works indicate someone of worldly intelligence, patience, discipline and steady concentration. Modigliani's huge popularity has always depended on his risque reputation and on his languid, pretty, easily digested and unmistakable brand of delicately abstracted Modernism. As with the work of Chagall or Ben Shahn, Modigliani's could frequently tip over into kitsch or parody. But at its best, it is original and exquisite and suggests someone beyond the bohemian cliche, clearly wrestling with issues besides the formal felicity of elongated shapes, who died prematurely. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, to 9 p.m.; Fridays, to 5 p.m. Admission: $14; $11.50 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

''NEXUS: TAIWAN IN QUEENS,'' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, through July 4. Twenty artists, all Taiwanese, are assembled for an exhibition about immigration, assimilation, isolation, cultural identity and related issues. Many works are straightforward illustrations of the theme: Lu Hsian Fu's installation of red paper Chinese lanterns threaded with strings of Christmas lights, for example, is about the immigrant's bicultural experience. Some works, like C. J. Yeh's cybernetic translations of Mondrian paintings, resonate more broadly. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission, $5 (Ken Johnson).

* ''PETRA: LOST CITY OF STONE,'' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, through July 6. Petra, an ancient city in what is now the Jordanian part of the Negev Desert, was at its zenith from the first century B.C. to the third century A.D. Prosperous, safe and abundantly supplied with water, it was a center of bustling trade in incense, ivory, textiles and other precious goods, which flowed through it by camel caravan from points east to the Mediterranean. And it was a highly sophisticated cultural crossroads whose inhabitants carved from rock not only a lively metropolis but also a necropolis of monumental tombs for their kings and leaders. While learned diggers are still uncovering its ruins, this show, said to be the first cultural collaboration between Jordan and the United States, offers a generous glimpse of Petra's vibrant civilization through art objects, architectural elements, photographs and film. The installation, set up with the museum's usual expertise and helpful graphics, is one of the busiest around, but undaunted, Petra comes through. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Timed tickets to the exhibition: $19; students and 60+, $16.50; children under 12, $13 (Glueck).

* AUGUST SANDER, ''People of the 20th Century: A Photographic Portrait of Germany'' and Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sept. 19. Although only a sampling of his vast inventory of portraits of German society, the show, naturally, is too big: the prints are vintage but uneven, and the best pictures are not given enough breathing room. But genius is genius, and you may leave nearly overwhelmed by the breadth and depth of Sander's obsessive ambition and humanity. An accompanying display, ''Indexing the World,'' is a gem, providing a brisk, buoyantly eccentric overview of the dubious role of photography in the quest to index the world. It is often remarked that Sander photographed one era turning into another, Weimar Germany into Nazi Germany, which is true. His work, despite its scientific pretense, is suffused with the unconscious melancholy of a world he could see was already fading. But another way to describe him is to say that his project was both deeply reactionary and revolutionary, and this tension became the central, illuminating paradox of his achievement. (Through July 9 a selection of Sander's photographs of women is at Yancey Richardson Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (646) 230-9610.) Museum hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

''TALKING QUILTS,'' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through Aug. 1. In the most impressive of the 20 or so quilts here, in which words figure prominently, the verbal and the visual are ingeniously integrated along with personal, domestic, religious, social and even political interests. In a 1930 quilt by Lena Moore, Psalm 23 in jaunty red letters fills the whole rectangle to hypnotically rhythmic effect. Jessie B. Telfair's red, white and blue ''Freedom Quilt'' repeats the word freedom like a chant; she made it after she lost her job when she tried to register to vote. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; students and 62+, $7. (Johnson).

* ''FRED WILSON, OBJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS: 1979-2000,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through July 4. Mr. Wilson, who represented the United States at the 2003 Venice Biennale, made his reputation with conceptually pointed, technically polished and visually engaging installations and objects that focused on excavating American racial history and illustrating the exclusionary power of cultural institutions shaped by social, economic and ideological domination. Elements of his subversive museum projects appear in this traveling show, along with sculptures and a fine, short new film. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; students and 62+, $3; children under 12, free (Holland Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

''MASTERWORKS OF SIX CENTURIES,'' David Tunick, 46 East 65th Street, (212) 570-0090; Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700; Didier Aaron, 32 East 67th Street, (212) 988-5248; all through July 2. You don't need a museum ticket for this three-gallery show. The Tunick spread of French prints, drawings and photographs from the Renaissance to Picasso and Eugene Atget includes treats like a naughty Fragonard etching and a complete set of commedia dell'arte figures by the innovative French engraver Jacques Callot (1592-1635). The Feigen display of watercolors by Joseph Gandy (1771-1843), a fine, poetic landscapist as well as an architect, gives Romantic glimpses of the British countryside that are fresh and vivid despite being small. The Aaron show of pastels by a present-day artist, Victor Edelstein, who paints the fountains of Rome, disappoints in its meticulous but postcardy renderings (Glueck).

GUY PENE DU BOIS, ''Painter of Modern Life,'' Graham, 1014 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 535-5767, through July 9. Pene du Bois (1884-1958) made some of the more appealingly peculiar paintings in early-20th-century American art. With a sensuously refined touch, he painted luminous, gently satiric pictures of doll-like, well-to-do people in situations of Henry Jamesian intimacy. This enchanting exhibition presents more than 50 paintings and works on paper from the first half of his career, 1905 to 1924 (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

GRETNA CAMPBELL/ ANNA HOSTVEDT, Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 2. Working outdoors in Maine, rural New Jersey and the south of France, Campbell (1922-87) painted landscapes with Abstract Expressionist verve. Works from the 1970's and 1980's are on view here. In a separate gallery hang Ms. Hostvedt's lonesome, tenderly realist pictures of a Long Island parking lot, painted in severely muted colors on 8-by-12-inch panels (Johnson).

JOHN MASON, Franklin Parrasch, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, through July 2. With Peter Voulkos, Mr. Mason helped revolutionize ceramics in California in the 1950's, turning it from craft into an infinitely malleable medium for Modernist sculpture. This show presents elegant new geometric works. With the exception of one constructed of rhomboid parts, each piece is a lucid complex of intersecting half-inch-thick sections of circles. With straight bands incised into subtly colored eggshell glazes, each has a refined dynamic equilibrium (Johnson).

CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI, ''Plague, Vol. 1/December,'' Luxe, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 404-7455, through July 2. This small gallery is crammed with an engaging jumble of boxes, in which scenes from David Lynch's film ''Blue Velvet'' are obliquely represented. There's the white picket fence and the red flowers in a box built into the wall; down near the floor you see the cut-off ear displayed like a sacred relic. A cardboard fire escape ascends within a tower of clear-walled boxes and the theater where Isabella Rosellini sang the movie's theme song is built into a Budweiser carton (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

* TONY FEHER, ''The Wart on the Bosom of Mother Nature,'' D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through July 2. Mr. Feher makes wryly poetic and visually enchanting sculptures out of the least promising of materials: plastic and glass bottles, bottle caps, foam packing material, bent wire, soda stacking crates, marbles, colored string, crushed aluminum foil and stones. A pyramid of green plastic strawberry baskets has a luminous, dematerialized look. A collection of brown bottles stopped by red and blue marbles is captivatingly sensuous and obliquely political (Johnson).

ALEXEJ KOSCHKAROW, Stellan Holm, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, through July 1. This Russian-born, Dusseldorf-based sculptor creates crafty, mysterious fantasy objects and environments. For the main event, you enter what turns out to be the massive, fireplace of a library in an ancient castle. With its shelves stocked with rumpled paper folios, a sky-lit ceiling divided by heavy, fake wood beams, a fake black marble floor and a skull wedged in among the papers on one shelf, it could be a room in Umberto Eco's ''The Name of the Rose'' (Johnson).

* CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN, ''Images a la Carte,'' Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through July 2. Made mostly on blue-lined notebook pages the size of index cards, using pencil, ink and watercolor, these wonderfully lively and keenly observed drawings depict shrimp cocktails, crab cakes, salads, sandwiches, a banana split, tarts, cheesecakes and other restaurant fare, interspersed with simpler items like a lemon slice, an apple core and a piece of cornbread. Mr. Oldenburg drew them; his longtime partner, Ms. van Bruggen, contributed ideas (Johnson).

''PUBLIC.EXE: PUBLIC EXECUTION,'' Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 31. This group exhibition is all but invisible at Exit Art itself, where another, long-running exhibition takes up most of the space. ''Public.ex'' has just two installations on the premises, along with some handouts, including a funky newspaper and a CD. But the bulk of the work consists of politically inflected events, video screenings and activist Internet sites. A result is a show that as far as possible sidesteps the institutional authority and moves out into the everyday world, where art and life, equally silly and serious, seem to interact on the random, non-linear model of the Internet itself. The exhibition web site is www.exitart.org/public.exe. (Cotter).

* ''TERRORVISION,'' Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 31. Terror comes in all sizes, shapes and degrees, and this show runs the gamut, with exhibits by about 50 artists facing up to their most ''extreme fears,'' from the general threats posed by Al Qaeda and its franchises to the traumas of personal catastrophe like breast cancer and heart operations. The gallery's multidisciplinary emphasis is manifest in film, video, audio and computer-generated creations, along with media as simple as prints and photographs. It is a mix of successful efforts and some that don't quite make it, the lightweight with the more substantial. But it is alive and kicking (Glueck).

Galleries: SoHo

RICHARD ARTSCHWAGER AND ED RUSCHA, Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212) 925-4338, and Leo Castelli, 18 East 77th Street, (212) 249-4470, through July 1. This expansive, intellectually and visually provocative two-gallery show presents works from five decades by Mr. Artschwager, the New York-based object maker, and Mr. Ruscha, the Los Angeles-based maker of signlike paintings. Working with incisive wit in an area in which Pop, Surrealism and Conceptualism overlap, they share a commitment to epistemological ambiguity. Together they offer a heartening and entertaining antidote to the worldwide rise of fundamentalist ideologies (Johnson).

''PLAYPEN,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 24. Process, the notion of art as action, is a fundamental dynamic in this mildly experimental show. Much of the work is site-specific and finished, including David Brody's mural-like wall drawings and a suite of sculptures by Gedi Sibony. Other pieces are both stationary and interactive. The exception is across the street in the annex gallery called the Drawing Room, where the collective Red67 has a project titled ''New York Public Archive,'' to which visitors can contribute material, on the utopian principle that everyone is an artist and everything can be art (Cotter).

''REPEAT PERFORMANCE,'' Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970, through July 3. Seven artists mimic significant predecessors in slyly ironic ways. Nancy Drew makes confectionary full-scale copies of classic paintings by Jackson Pollock and Clyfford Still, using glitter and flocking; Jill Miller intrudes herself dancing into an early John Baldessari video; Jeff Feld presents a photograph of himself performing ''the only part of Robert Rauschenberg's 'Pelican' that I know''; and Mungo Thomson has made a kitschy bumper sticker of Bruce Nauman's famous saying, ''The true artist helps the world by revealing mystic truths'' (Johnson).

GERHARD RICHTER, ''Two Sculptures for a Room by Palermo,'' Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through July 31. Here is one of the very few sculptures made by Mr. Richter, the immensely influential German painter. It consists of two plaster heads cast from life, slathered in gray paint and mounted on pedestals. One head is Mr. Richter's; the other is of his fellow German painter Blinky Palermo. Facing each other with closed eyes, in a gallery that is empty but for a small study version in a shadow box on the wall, the faux classical sculptures create an ambience of dry existential ennui (Johnson).

* ROBERT RYMAN, ''Works on Paper, 1957-1964,'' Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Sept. 25. Although Mr. Ryman is usually referred to as a Minimalist, he began his career as something more like an abstract conceptualist, making paintings at least as interesting to think about as to look at. This stimulating, richly varied exhibition of 30 works on paper catch him at a pivotal point in his career, which coincides with a fertile one in American art. They include paintings, drawings and collage, often in combination, and show an artist using abstraction's strangeness and uncertainties to think his way into his creative place in the world (Cotter).

Other Galleries

''ARCHITECTURE BY NUMBERS,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through July 9. Although the premise of this show is promising, an investigation by architects of ''architecture and its essential relationship with the numerical,'' its theory load is heavy and the visual quotient is low (Glueck).

* FELIX GMELIN, Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212) 431-4977, through July 31. Utopianism, time-faded and tinged with doubt, is the subject of the spare but trenchant New York debut show of this Swedish artist. The centerpiece is his re-creation of a 1968 video shot by his father, who was at the time a teacher in Berlin. In the original, students carry a large red flag in a kind of marathon relay jog through the city: one figure taking the banner from another. In 2002, Mr. Gmelin recreated the performance, using his own students as runners, and the two videos, old and new, run side by side in the gallery. The ideas conveyed are contradictory; the juxtaposition very moving (Cotter).

* ''LASTING IMPRESSIONS,'' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690, through July 31. Regarding books as visual treasures, the club's library is an awesome repository of the history of printing and collecting in the Western world. The more than 150 objects on view here include not just bound rarities, but also manuscripts, prints, drawings, paintings, photographs and statues. Treasures range from a collection of tiny printed volumes going back to the 17th century, some so small they could fit on your thumbnail, to a handwritten inventory of the library of Mme. de Pompadour. This is a show that's worth its weight in quality time (Glueck).

SZE TSUNG LEONG, ''History Images,'' Storefront for Art and Architecture, 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, through July 31. A photographer who divides his time between New York and Bejing presents extremely detailed, medium-large color pictures of construction and demolition sites in Chinese cities. Taken from elevated distances, the images convey a sense of the awesome scale of development in that huge, rapidly modernizing country (Johnson).

* LIGORANO/REESE, ''Free Speech Zone,'' Brooklyn Public Library, Grand Army Plaza, (718) 230-2122, through tomorrow. The subject of this site-specific installation by the activist artist team Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese, is the history of book censorship in the United States. Two L.E.D. signs are installed on the library's mezzanine level. The titles of censored books, from ''Ulysses'' to ''Heather Has Two Mommies,'' scroll vertically on one screen, while offending phrases run vertically on the other, like a perpetual-motion poem. Accompanying each screen are photographic portraits of Brooklyn residents who use the library, but who in this case wear blindfolds, like prisoners. Ligorano/Reese has been producing public protest art for a long time now, and they're very good at what they do. (Cotter)

* ''THE REALITY OF THINGS,'' Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783, through July 11. Some things in this intriguing, 12-artist show are just what they seem, and some are not. Seemingly real cantaloupes by Martha Friedman are made of cast and painted urethane foam but Tony Feher's stacked brown and black milk crates involved no deception. Most stealthily surprising is Hans Accola's plastic jug of carpenter's glue. Tara Donavan's cube of straight pins, Robert Gober's fake newspaper advertising fliers and Shinique Smith's thrift store overcoat with added silver pinstripes further compound one's sense of existential slipperiness (Johnson).

''WORLDSCAPES: THE ART OF ERRO,'' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through July 17. The career of Erro, a prodigiously productive Pop-style painter and an acclaimed Icelandic artist, is featured in a nearly 50-year retrospective at the Grey Art Gallery. It will not persuade you that he is a great painter, but you may be taken by his manic graphic activity, antic humor and promiscuous sampling from popular culture. If so, you may also want to see ''Femmes Fatales'' at the Goethe Institute, 1014 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 439-8700, through July 17, which offers 10 colorful paintings from an Erro series devoted to female comic-book superheroes (Johnson).

Last Chance

* ''CONSTABLE'S SKIES,'' Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606, through today. The masterly English landscapist John Constable (1776-1837) considered the proper rendition of skies essential to landscape painting, and he took great pains to get them right. About half of this show is devoted to the intense bout of cloud studies he did in 1821 and 1822, incredibly nuanced observations of nebuli color and behavior. The rest are landscapes and seascapes from 1820 to 1830, in which skies play a principal role (Glueck).

* ''FASHIONING FICTION IN PHOTOGRAPHY SINCE 1990,'' Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 33rd Road and Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400, through Monday. With its first exhibition of fashion photography, the Modern dips a toe into a very large body of water, and dithers. The works by 13 artists and fashion photographers, including Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, Phillip-Lorca diCorcia and Cedric Buchet, focuses on the recent uses of narrative in magazine features and advertising. How recent this development is could be debated, but mainly the Modern seems determined to make everything look like appropriation art. This seems unnecessary in a museum known for showing all kinds of everyday design objects. The show sticks too closely to the mainstream fashion press, which keeps it too superficial, too polite and in some ways misleading. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Smith).

* ''GARDEN IN DELFT: WILLEM DE KOONING LANDSCAPES 1928-1988,'' Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400, through tomorrow. For the centennial of de Kooning's birth, this exhibition of 14 canvases represents a jubilant skip through his long career, with emphasis on his relationship to landscape. Never mind that the suggestion of abstracted still lifes sometimes seems equally strong, especially in two unfamiliar canvases from the late 1930's. A third painting, titled ''Still Life'' and from around 1929, may be the earliest de Kooning painting most of us have ever seen. Its crisp shapes and deep primary colors suggest the influence of Joseph Stella and look forward to David Hockney (Smith).

* ''GOLDEN FANTASIES: JAPANESE SCREENS FROM NEW YORK COLLECTIONS,'' Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, (212) 517-2742, through Sunday. The painted folding screens in this small but splendiferous exhibition date from the 16th and 17th centuries, when a still-feudal Japan was undergoing major social and cultural changes. Both a ruling military elite and a rising mercantile bourgeoisie used art to create a dynamic and refined self-image. Few societies have produced power objects more persuasive than the types of screens seen here, each a tour de force of high-end artifice. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).

''MARIUS DE ZAYAS AND THE STIEGLITZ CIRCLE,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sunday. This small show, focusing mainly on caricatures drawn by an associate of the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, is getting the jump on the 100th anniversary of the 1905 founding of Stieglitz's immensely influential Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession. De Zayas, an artist and later an art dealer from a celebrated Mexican family, drew images in charcoal and ink of Stieglitz and other photographers like Edward Steichen and Gertrude Kasebier and of artists like Max Weber and John Marin. They are always formally elegant and materially sumptuous, and some are almost illegibly abstract. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).

''O.K., AMERICA!'' Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, through tomorrow. It is mildly amusing, but the point of this exhibition of artists from eight countries, organized by the Viennese curator Peter Noever, remains obscure. Note Ghazel's videos of herself garbed Islamic-style and performing absurdist activities; Kendell Geers's drinking glasses dusted for the fingerprints of their more or less famous owners; Raymond Pettibon's ironically melodramatic cartoon narratives; and big photographs of cartoons drawn in red ink on human fingertips by Escape Group (Johnson).

* ''CHINESE EYES: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY FROM CHINA,'' Goedhuis Contemporary, 42 East 76th Street, and Goedhuis Contemporary at the Annex, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 535-0256, through tomorrow. This show is a valuable supplement to ''Between Past and Future'' at the International Center of Photography and Asia Society. Goedhuis shares some artists with the larger survey, but adds several of its own, among them such interesting figures as Weng Peijun and the team of Shao Yinong and Mu Chen. The presentation is expert and documented by an attractive catalog (Cotter).

PERSON: Robert W. Bemer

HEADLINE: Robert W. Bemer, 84, Pioneer In Computer Programming

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Robert W. Bemer, an early computer programmer, who helped devise Ascii, a system for representing letters and numbers in code that is still in use, died Tuesday evening at his home in Possum Kingdom Lake, Tex., west of Fort Worth. He was 84.
 The cause was cancer, his stepson, Glen Peeler, said yesterday.
 Mr. Bemer was introduced to computers while doing engineering work on military aircraft for the Rand Corporation in California in 1949. ''There I met early I.B.M. computers and fell in technical love,'' he wrote in a series of personal recollections on his Web site. ''I just knew that the computer business was what I had been designed for.'' 
 The computer business was in its infancy, and programming was bespoke work; typically it involved setting up machines to run calculations one job at a time. It was not until 1958 that the first published mention of ''software'' as a computing term appeared. Software was not a separate business, but merely a cost of getting the big room-sized computers to do their work. Building the machines was considered a science, but programming seemed more of an art, and programmers were regarded as the unruly bohemians of computing.
 Bright, fast-talking and irreverent, Mr. Bemer seemed to fit right in during the freewheeling early days of programming. He worked for aircraft companies -- including Lockheed -- in California until 1955, when he joined the programming research department of I.B.M. in New York.
 There was no formal training for programmers, and for a while Mr. Bemer was in charge of recruiting. An I.B.M. newspaper advertisement seeking programmers noted, ''Those who enjoy playing chess or solving puzzles will find this work absorbing.'' 
 His particular talent, his former colleagues said, was coming up with technical insights and inspiring others. 
 Mr. Bemer played an important role in helping develop a standard system of translating letters and numbers into digital code that can be processed by a computer, known as the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, or Ascii (pronounced AS-kee). Before Ascii, computer manufacturers had their own systems for encoding letters and numbers, making it difficult or impossible to exchange data between machines from different computer makers.
 In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Mr. Bemer was one of the foremost advocates who pushed for the standard, under the guidance of the American National Standards Institute (it was later adopted by the International Standards Organization). Ascii was put into effect in 1963, expanded and modified over the years, and it is an enduring standard in computing.
 Mr. Bemer firmly supported Ascii, even though the senior management of I.B.M. backed its home-grown encoding standard. In 1962, Mr. Bemer left I.B.M. to join Sperry Rand's Univac division.
 In its way, the Ascii standard was a forerunner of the standards for exchanging and reading data that enable communication across the Internet and World Wide Web. Ascii allows basic information to be exchanged from one machine to another, while the Internet standards are for data communication across a network.
 In the late 1950's, Mr. Bemer played a role in another important computer standard, the Cobol programming language. The Defense Department wanted a common language for accounting and business data, and the result at the end of 1959 was Cobol, for Common Business Oriented Language. Though the language was developed by others, Mr. Bemer and Grace Hopper, a rear admiral in the Navy and a software pioneer, were advisers.
 Mr. Bemer was born on Feb. 8, 1920, in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. In high school, he became a skilled musician, playing both the cello and trumpet, and he received a music scholarship to Albion College, where he majored in mathematics.
 Mr. Bemer was married six times, and twice to Bettie Seals Peeler Bemer, who survives Mr. Bemer. The couple was divorced in 1984 and remarried in 1999, said his stepson, Mr. Peeler.
 Mr. Bemer is also survived by a stepdaughter, Betty Rae Peeler; six children, Jan Bemer, Kristina DuVall, Mark Bemer, Derek Bemer, Gretchen Moore and Bruce Bemer; nine grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Keeping Trout Cool Conflicts With a Thirsty New York

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: HANKINS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The Delaware River runs low and lazy around here, an unspoiled stretch of wild water that in some spots is little more than ankle deep. But it is widely recognized as one of the premier fly-fishing streams in the country because trout seem to love it, especially when the water is cold enough to make many ankles turn blue.
 Trout are so sensitive to temperature that they can sense a change of one-half of one degree. That's why Joe McFadden, a professional fly caster who has fished these waters most of his life, posts the river's temperature every day on a white board outside his fly and tackle shop. 
 Trouble is, despite a wet and cool spring, water temperatures have been spiking at around 75 degrees several times this season, enough to nearly boil the life out of a rainbow or a brown trout. Mr. McFadden blames New York City. 
 Although Hankins, a village on the Upper Delaware, is 120 miles and a universe away from the city, it lies within the New York watershed. Recent changes in the way the city manages its water supply have caused ripples here, splitting the usually close community of fishermen and raising concerns about the impact on the region's economy. 
 For a half-century, since three huge New York City reservoirs were completed on tributaries of the Delaware, fishermen have pleaded with the city to release enough cold water to satisfy the trout that have flourished in the river's headwaters from Hancock to Callicoon, about 25 miles south. New York City, focused on meeting the drinking water needs of its millions of users, paid little attention to anglers' concerns. 
 That finally changed in April when a plan was adopted that, for the first time, takes both the fishery -- an environment and economic activity that is important to this region -- and the citizenry into account as the city manages the 271 billion gallons of water in its three Delaware reservoirs. Protecting the city's drinking water remains the top priority, and the plan makes more water in the reservoirs available for use in case of drought. But in years when there is no threat of drought, like this year, the extra water can be used to cool the Delaware and its tributaries so that the trout can thrive. Christopher O. Ward, commissioner of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection, considers this an important achievement. He told the City Council recently that the plan would ''establish a new standard for fostering ecological benefits through water management decisions'' without jeopardizing the city's drinking water supply. But some fishermen have reservations about the plan, while others have rejected it outright. 
 ''This whole new agreement stinks,'' Mr. McFadden said from behind the counter of his shop, surrounded by boxes of fishing line and dozens of hand-tied flies. While he welcomes the city's willingness to take the fishery into account, Mr. McFadden said that word had already spread that fishing on the Delaware is not as good as it used to be. ''I've got no more than two people a day coming into the store, and I get calls constantly asking about the water temperature,'' Mr. McFadden said. Business, never booming, has fallen off so dramatically that this month he put his shop up for sale. 
 ''I know they're not going to tell anyone in the city, 'Don't wash your car' just so I can fish up here, '' Mr. McFadden said. ''But all I want is to get a common ground so both of us can utilize this unique system.'' 
 There is no easy common ground when it comes to water rights on the Delaware. It took decisions by the United States Supreme Court in 1931 and 1954 to uphold New York City's right to divert as much as 800 million gallons of water a day from the river.
 But to guarantee that Philadelphia, Trenton and other downriver communities get their fair share, the court required the city to make sure the river keeps flowing at 1,750 cubic feet a second as it leaves New York and enters New Jersey. 
 If the Delaware is flowing strongly enough to meet that target on its own, the city does not have to do anything. But when the level of the river drops, the city has to release water from its reservoirs to bring the flow up to the court-mandated minimum.
 Those releases come most often from the bottom of the Cannonsville Reservoir in Delaware County, where the water can be as cold as 42 degrees. Those irregular releases make the river temperature swing from hot to cold back to hot again without warning. The colder it is, the more the trout like it. But as temperatures rise, the fish tend to congregate in cooler eddies and sink holes, where they are so easy to catch that fishing is no longer fun for purists like Mr. McFadden. Above 70 degrees, the trout start to show stress. If it gets much hotter than that, they can die. 
 When fishermen complained about the erratic water releases, the city generally ignored them, and resentment grew. But things are about to change. 
 As part of a new drought plan, PPL Corporation , which operates a hydroelectric plant at Lake Wallenpaupack in Pennsylvania, agreed to release more water from the lake during dry months. That water flows into the Lackawaxen River, which finds its way into the Delaware about 25 miles south of Hankins. 
 The Lake Wallenpaupack water can be used to meet the court-ordered 1,750-cubic-feet-a-second flow requirement. New York would then catch a break and not have to release its supplies to satisfy the court order. 
 That extra cushion of water has also enabled officials to do something else the fishermen had asked for many times over the years -- set guaranteed levels downstream from the dams on the east and west branches of the Delaware, and on the Neversink River, which runs into the Delaware. In the past, levels fluctuated wildly, which harmed the trout and interfered with the hatching of insects on which they fed. The target flow levels, based on historical records, are intended to make the river flow far more consistently. And those records will be updated over the next three years and lay the groundwork for a long-range water management plan. 
 All this might have been expected to please even the grumpiest fishermen. But, in fact, it divided them into two camps. Trout Unlimited has conditionally endorsed the interim plan. Rocci Aguirre, a representative of the state and national Trout Unlimited councils, said that while the plan was not perfect, it was ''a step forward.'' 
 But another group, the Friends of the Upper Delaware, sees the interim plan as ''the most severe threat to the river in over 35 years.'' The basic problem, said Craig Findley, 59, president of the group, is that the plan does not make enough water available to keep the Upper Delaware as cool as the fish and the fishermen would like. 
 Mr. Findley's group wants the city to release 600 cubic feet per second of cold water consistently from April through October, regardless of whether the water is needed to meet the court's mandate. This would keep the river cold and extend the trout season by several months.
 Mr. Findley said he was worried about what would happen if there is another summer as hot and dry as it was in 2001. Under the new plan, water released from Lake Wallenpaupack would eliminate the need for the city to pour any cold water into the Delaware. Without that extra amount of cold water, he said, the river could heat up fast.
 ''And if that happened,'' Mr. Findley said, ''it would devastate the Delaware fishery.'' 
 Such a calamity would shake the already weakened economy of places like Hankins, population 250, where tourism and fishing are the only viable future. 
 The New York City official most responsible for drawing up the interim plan, Michael A. Principe, director of the Bureau of Water Supply, said he understood the pressing need to ensure adequate flows in the river. 
 ''The last thing any of us wants to see is a fish kill,'' Mr. Principe said. 
 But, he said, the fishermen must understand that nothing can put New York City's drinking water supply at risk. What they are asking for, Mr. Principe said, is enough water to create an optimal habitat for the trout. The city's reservoirs simply do not hold that much water, he said, which means the fishermen will have to learn to be content with a river that is good for trout, but not ideal. 
 For now, Mr. McFadden still watches the river carefully, and every day he records temperatures and flows on the board outside his shop. He worries that if the water temperatures stay high, and the trout end up huddled in sinkholes, he may have to add another note. 
 ''If it gets too hot out there,'' Mr. McFadden said, ''I'll put up a sign that says 'Please do not fish. Leave 'em alone.'''

Fishermen along the Delaware River have long been concerned about how New York City and its reservoirs affect temperatures on the river and its tributaries. When the river slows down, temperatures rise, harming the trout. The city can sometimes release cold water from its reservoirs, creating a better environment for the fish.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods and Job Data Are Disappointing

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24 

 BODY:
Orders to factories for durable goods fell for the second consecutive month in May, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday. Sales of new homes rose to a record for a single month, the department said.
 The Labor Department reported that the number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits increased last week by a seasonally adjusted 13,000, to 349,000. The four-week moving average of initial claims, which tends to smooth out weekly fluctuations, rose 1,000, to 344,250. 
 Durable goods orders, for costly manufactured products expected to last at least three years, dropped 1.6 percent in May from the level in April. The weakness was broad based, with the demand slackening for cars, machinery, computers and other items.
 The decline, which came after a 2.6 percent drop in April, was disappointing to economists, who had forecast a 1.5 percent rise. The figures suggested that economic growth this quarter could turn out to be slower than the 4.4 percent annual pace in the first quarter, some economists said.
 Orders for transportation products, including cars and aircraft, fell 4.1 percent in May, after a 4.6 percent drop in April. Excluding transportation products, orders declined 0.7 percent after a 1.7 percent drop in April.
 Still, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers, Jerry Jasinowski, said he viewed the declines as temporary. ''New orders for durable goods have taken a quick breather after a yearlong sprint,'' he said.
 The Commerce Department said that new-home sales surged 14.8 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.37 million, a one-month record. That showing, which was stronger than analysts had expected, came after sales dropped 7.9 percent in April.
 David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, predicts that new-home sales for all of 2004 will set a record.
 By region, sales in the Northeast rose 53.2 percent, to an annual pace of 121,000, the highest level since January 1989. In the South, sales rose to a record pace of 663,000, up 20.3 percent from April. Sales climbed 6.5 percent in the West, to a pace of 379,000. In the Midwest, sales were flat in May at a pace of 206,000.

HEADLINE: 36 Hours Fort Worth

BYLINE: By SUZANNE HAMLIN

 BODY:
ONCE the dusty, dowdy sidekick to Dallas, Fort Worth seems well on its way to becoming the liveliest two-step in Texas, an irresistible combination of cowboys and culture. In a two-decade overhaul, significantly helped by generous oil-rich natives, the little fort that was created to protect Dallas has grown up to become a center of innovative architecture, art, music, ballet and opera. Sundance Square, the revitalized, spirited downtown, is a model of urban planning. ''Where the West begins'' was Fort Worth's 1800's descriptive -- and still, with more big blue sky than skyscrapers and more sidewalks than freeways, the city proper (population over 500,000) is unabashedly hospitable to drop-ins. As for that Texas summer heat: no problem. Curled brim, high-vented cowboy hats are sold and worn everywhere, even inside with air-conditioning. SUZANNE HAMLIN

Friday
 Most major carriers serve Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, which is a hub for American and Delta. Downtown Fort Worth is about 25 minutes from the airport by cab.
 There is no shortage of rooms in Fort Worth, and up-to-date hotel package deals are listed on www.fortworth.com.
 The Courtyard by Marriott/Blackstone, (601 Main Street, 817-885-8700) is a newly renovated hotel in the heart of downtown. It has an indoor whirlpool and outdoor heated pool. Rooms range from $99 to $179. 
 Etta's Place Bed & Breakfast, (200 West Third Street, 817-255-5760) is named for Etta Place, the sometime girlfriend of the Sundance Kid. Its 10 rooms have period furnishings. Rates are $125 to $280.
 Since 1907, the Stockyards Hotel, (109 East Exchange Avenue, 817-625-6427), has served cattle barons and a few crooks, notably Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. Its 52 rooms and suites have period decor. Sunday-to-Thursday rates are $139 to $425; Friday and Saturday, $169 to $425.


4 p.m.
1. Fueling Up
Take a detour on the way in from the airport to see for yourself why many locals say that ''life is too short to live in Dallas.'' A landmark on the nation's barbecue map, the Railhead Smokehouse (2900 Montgomery Street, 817-738-9808) is a family-run wood-paneled pit stop that serves smoked ribs, turkey, brisket, sausages and other seriously succulent ranch favorites. Pump yourself a goblet of beer and get in the cafeteria line. The tab will be under $10 a person.

6 p.m.
2. Saddle Up for Drinks
Head over to the Stockyards District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Starting about 11:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. each day, the longhorn drive moves down East Exchange Avenue. The coast should be clear by now, so it's safe to visit the Stockyards Hotel (109 East Exchange Avenue, 817-625-6427). Pass through the Wild West lobby of overstuffed chairs and palms and turn left into the ''no-strangers-here'' bar. Choose your bar seat -- a stool or a saddle -- and cool down.

8 p.m.
3. Dinner at the Hacienda
Joe T. Garcia's (2201 North Commerce Street, 817-626-4356) is about a half mile from the Stockyards, but it might as well be in the middle of Mexico. Once a private home, now a square city block of tiled rooms, courtyards, patios, fountains and hanging plants, it's like a continuing fiesta, including mariachi bands and a wedding party or two on weekends. There is always a line (no reservations for small parties) and only cash is accepted, but the high spirits are free, the service is great and the family-style menu is reasonable, including the enchiladas ($9.75), fajitas ($11.75) and the margaritas by the pitcher ($19.25).

9:30 p.m.
4. Jumbo Jamboree
Billy Bob's Texas (2520 Rodeo Plaza, 817-624-7117) was built as a cattle barn in 1910 and used as an aircraft plant in World War II. In 1981 it became what is billed as the ''the world's largest honky tonk,'' and with room for 6,000 people in 100,000 square feet, who's going to argue? Admission on weekends ($6.50 to $10.50 after 6 p.m.) provides access to 32 bar stations, a pool hall, a Texas-size dance floor and nightly entertainment beginning at 8. Willie Nelson is scheduled on July 4.

Saturday

9:30 a.m.
5. Japanese Tranquillity
Time for a Zen moment before the rest of your excursion. The Japanese Garden at the Botanic Garden (3220 Botanic Garden Boulevard, 817-871-7686) awaits. A onetime gravel pit, now carved into 7.5 acres of Japanese landscapes and structures, the garden is centered around a serpentine pond, with schools of astoundingly large, lively and friendly rainbow-colored koi.

11 a.m.
6. Wild West Women
If you've ever fallen in love with a cowgirl, or wished you were one, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame (1720 Gendy Street, 817-336-4475) is a must. Not just chicks in chaps, it's a celebration -- through multimedia presentation, films and costume exhibitions -- of Western women, including celebrity singers, writers and artists, as well as a multitude of lesser-known names -- women who rode and ranched across the West, and still do.

12:30 p.m.
7. Art Park Afternoon
The city's foremost art museums are in an architectural dreamscape, each building seamlessly linked by elegant landscaping and walkways. The newest is the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (3200 Darnell Street, 817-738-9215). Designed by the architect Tadao Ando to house mid 20th-century to contemporary art, the building is a series of soaring glass pavilions surrounded by shallow water and river-stone pools. Fortify yourself at the Cafe Modern just inside the lobby; the menu includes a venison meatloaf brioche sandwich ($12). Smaller in size but no less arresting, the Kimbell Art Museum, above, (3333 Camp Bowie Boulevard, 817-332-8451) is down the walkway. Designed by Louis Kahn and completed in 1972, it holds recognizable masterpieces -- including works by Mondrian and Goya -- balanced by the serenity of arched stone galleries. Just ahead is the Amon Carter Museum (3501 Camp Bowie Boulevard, 817-738-1933). Designed by Philip Johnson, it opened in 1961, and its gallery space has tripled. Its American and European collection is extensive, but it is perhaps best known for its Western art and photography.

6 p.m.
8. Sundance Stroll
Sundance Square, 20 blocks of old brick-paved streets, is filled with spiffy hotels, restaurants, clubs and shops. At dusk, street strolling becomes a major activity among the locals. Cruise the quirky shops and boutiques and drop in at the Sid Richardson Collection of Western Art (309 Main Street, 817-332-6554), the late oil patriarch's admission-free gallery of paintings and sculptures by Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell.

8 p.m.
9. Dinner at the Ranch
Film buffs will recognize Reata as the ranch in the 1956 movie ''Giant.'' And Reata, the restaurant, (310 Houston Street, 817-336-1009) is a big enough concept to invite comparison. Spread over several floors of an old building in the heart of Sundance Square, its polished Western ambience is well-served by a professional staff, an extensive wine list and a sophisticated interpretation of Western cuisine. It is moot whether Reata's ranch hands feasted on pan-seared pepper-crusted tenderloin with a port wine sauce ($29.95), bone-in double pork chop with a Bourbon apple sauce ($18.95) or tortilla-crusted salmon with a salsa verde ($20.95). Just don't question -- or miss -- the dessert tacos with caramelized bananas and chocolate gravy ($6.95). For a nightcap, the fourth-floor bar has a panoramic skyline view. If your stamina holds up, the hot clubs around Sundance Square stay open until at least 2 a.m.

Sunday

8 a.m.
10. Hometown Breakfast
Wherever you're from, the downtown Corner Bakery Cafe (615 Main Street, 817-870-4991), a combination coffee shop and a deli, will seem like home. There is a cross-country panorama of breakfast selections, all $6 or less. And check the take-out menu of salads and sandwiches for an in-flight lunch on the trip home.

10 a.m.
11. Rocket Science
The only downside to the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History (1501 Montgomery Street, 817-255-9300) is that the interactive marvels -- from a dinosaur dig, above, to the experiments of ''Hands on Science'' -- make it hard to leave. Although many of the hands-on exhibits are geared to children and families, almost everyone is enthralled by the continuing dramas in the Noble Planetarium or the Omni Theater.

HEADLINE: India Resounding in New York

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
WHEN ''Bombay Dreams,'' the musical about making it in the Indian film capital known as Bollywood, was imported from London to Broadway this spring, it introduced some listeners to the madcap eclecticism of filmi, the song-and-dance numbers that punctuate Bollywood's sprawling musicals.
 But Broadway was the last to know about the rendezvous of Indian and Western music. The profound improvisations of South Asian classical music -- from revered figures like Ravi Shankar as well as younger masters like the tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain -- have long been welcome in the city's concert halls, although the classical circuit is largely quiescent in summer.
 Jazz musicians have been absorbing ideas and collaborating with Indian musicians at least since the 1960's. Hip-hop has latched on to Indian rhythms, most notably last year when Jay-Z added a rap to Panjabi MC's ''Mundian To Bach Ke'' to remake it as ''Beware of the Boys.'' In New York's clubs, the sounds of Bollywood and other South Asian fusions have been drawing crowds for years: some to dance, some to listen, some to mingle and network. 
 As often happens, the music follows demographics. In the 1960's, a change in immigration law brought a wave of white-collar Indians and Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to the United States. Now their sons and daughters are establishing their place in the arts as well as in the wider American economy, and they are making sense of a musical upbringing that is likely to include Bollywood tunes alongside hip-hop, Western classical music, Indian classical music, rock and jazz. ''Everybody's got a different diaspora,'' says the producer, vocalist and disc jockey DK Khambata.
 Aladdin, a Bangladeshi comic who grew up in Spanish Harlem, is developing a one-man show for the Public Theater about growing up surrounded by hip-hop and salsa, tentatively titled ''Indio,'' and a play called ''The Halal Brothers,'' about a Muslim restaurant in Harlem. ''Our generation lived with the complexities of growing up in America,'' he said.
 For South Asian and Asian-American musicians, producers and disc jockeys who have been building their own scene in New York, the latest East-West hybrids are not just occasion for musical connections and experiments. They are also affirmations of an identity that grows ever more complex and cosmopolitan. ''If you come from India,'' Ms. Khambata said, ''you can't help integrating the social aspect. There are so many things that just get intertwined in the music.''
 Vijay Iyer, a pianist who brings his Indian background to jazz, said: ''Making music is very much aligned with activism and sociopolitical cultural work, and that actually is something that does unite this community. It's not just making music to be cool or look hip or be sexy, but actually to make a difference in the world. Especially in New York, that's a mobilizing force for the South Asian community.''

Beginnings in England
 The New York wave of South Asian music was preceded by influential South Asian hybrids from England. ''Mutiny: Asians Storm British Music,'' a documentary by Vivek Bald now making the rounds of film festivals, details the way established Indian and Pakistani communities in London confronted racism with music. (The documentary was partly financed by six years of monthly dance parties in New York, also called Mutiny, at which Mr. Bald and friends were disc jockeys mixing South Asian music with hip-hop and club beats.)
 In the 1970's and 80's, bands in London merged Indian elements -- notably a 4/4 Punjabi beat called bhangra -- with other music that connoted resistance, like punk, reggae and hip-hop. And in the 1990's, studio wizards came up with styles that became known as Asian Underground, which swirled together South Asian music with the beats and textures of electronica.
 The music traveled to New York, not just at Mutiny but also at another party that continues to take place monthly at S.O.B.'s: DJ Rekha's Basement Bhangra, which has been renamed Bhangra Against Bush during election season. ''It's very urban, very New York, and that's what makes it exciting,'' Rekha said. ''We play big-room hip-hop and a little bit of dancehall as well as bhangra, and the music has gotten a lot more intense. The drums are more pronounced; the production is much better. The music has come of age.''
 Regular visitors include groups of young South Asians who participate in intercollegiate bhangra dance competitions around the country. ''I can look down from the D.J. booth and see the kids on the team, doing these highly choreographed, acrobatic moves,'' she said. ''They're second-generation kids trying to focus toward cultural preservation, reinscribing a tradition which may or may not have existed back in India.''
 Two years ago, Rekha started another dance party: Bollywood Disco, which takes place monthly at Blur in SoHo. 
 AR Rahman, who wrote the songs for ''Bombay Dreams,'' is one of the top modern filmi composers, but also one of the most Western-flavored, and while the Broadway show hints at styles from across the subcontinent, many numbers end up sounding like mildly exoticized Andrew Lloyd Webber. Through the decades, filmi have tossed together everything from electro to salsa to surf music to funk with vocals that hint at ancient Indian traditions; there's a daring shamelessness to the way they steal from and one-up their sources.
 ''They've been sampling the West longer than the West has been sampling them,'' said Mr. Iyer, the pianist who has been melding Indian structures with jazz.
 The sounds of older and nuttier filmi, and some of the American music they drew on, have been drawing crowds to Bollywood Disco. ''We play some of the really kitschy stuff, the ripoff of the ripoff,'' Rekha said. ''I had grown up on 1970's and 1980's Bollywood, and I'm really into the retro stuff, but I had never gotten much of an opportunity to play it. Now, we get a lot of people who are just Bollywood freaks. They request songs; they sing along with them. And there's really no other place that's embracing it this way.''

A Spiritual Undercurrent
 A few weeks ago, the sound of a man singing a ghazal, a love poem from an ancient Persian tradition that made its way to India, hovered above the room at Kush, a lounge on the Lower East Side done up in quasi-Moroccan style. So did the haze of a drug that's now illegal in most other New York City clubs: tobacco, wafting from hookahs on the bar.
 There was a buzz of conversation from a crowd of people in their 20's, about half of whom looked Indian or Pakistani. Soon, an electronic bass line slipped in below the ghazal, and then the muffled thump of a downtempo drumbeat. It was suave international lounge music; it was also unmistakably Indian. Karsh Kale was at the turntables, wearing one earphone to cue the next song and keeping an eye on the crowd; he smiled as a few people started to sway. It was a night of Kollective, a weekly gathering for fans of Asian Massive, a New York blend of South Asian and Western music.
 ''It's not really to define a particular South Asian identity, but to explore many different forms of how South Asian identity has also become a Western identity,'' Mr. Kale said. ''In South Asian art, what I feel most attracted to is that there's a sense of struggle and tragedy in the music that is always kept intact. It's eloquent at the level of Shakespeare in being able to express emotion. I'm not trying to share some sort of spiritual or political sentiment as much as I'm trying to share pure sentiment.''
 Kollective returns to Kush in September, but Mr. Kale, a tabla drummer and producer as well as a disc jockey, will be busy this summer. Tonight he will be among the disc jockeys at Turntables on the Hudson, along with a kindred spirit from India: Guarav, who is one-half of the Midival Punditz, a pair of disc jockeys and producers from New Delhi. Mr. Kale also leads a band, Realize, that mixes electronica and rock with Indian vocals and complex tabla rhythms.
 ''The greatest thing about the culture that I come from, and that I'm able to share within a club setting or on an album,'' Mr. Kale said, ''is that even though we live in a modern society and work at a modern pace, there's this timelessness in the music of South Asia that reminds us about being reflective at the same time as we're living in the moment.''

'A Second Language'
 Mr. Iyer has collaborated with disc jockeys and Indian classical musicians as well as jazz improvisers. His own compositions and arrangements reach deep into both the labyrinthine harmonies of modern jazz and the rhythmic cycles of Indian music. Mr. Iyer said he was inspired to look into Indian music after hearing the way the pianist Randy Weston drew on African music. Just as Mr. Weston's piano can sound like a set of tuned African drums, Mr. Iyer's piano can suggest the skittering patterns of tabla drumming.
 Mr. Iyer grew up in Rochester, surrounded by American culture as much as by the Indian music his parents had brought with them. ''I went to hundreds of Indian music concerts,'' he said. ''Without trying to pretend that I'm an expert on it, because that's something you have to devote your whole life to, it's a second language that something in my heart was really drawing me toward. It was really about trying to make sense of who I am. I'm not trying to recapitulate Indian music or pretend that I'm playing Indian music.''
 In a solo set on Wednesday night at Merkin Hall, he will be playing American songs arranged so that they are, as he puts it, ''camouflaged'' by Indian rhythmic cycles. His other local performances include a set with the jazz quartet that includes his longtime collaborator, the saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, and an appearance at the Lincoln Center Festival in a program organized by DJ Spooky called ''Transmetropolitan,'' on a bill that also includes DJ Rekha and an Anglo-Indian producer, Nitin Sawhney.
 ''It's very trendy right now to be associated with all things South Asian,'' Mr. Iyer said. ''I don't know how long that's going to last. But I can't escape it; this is what I am. And I'm going to be with this forever.''

HEADLINE: Legislature In New Jersey Works Late On a Budget

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 25 

 BODY:
The New Jersey Legislature worked into the early morning hours today, debating Gov. James E. McGreevey's $28 billion budget.
 The budget, for the fiscal year beginning next week, would increase spending by 16 percent over the current budget approved last summer. The growth reflects New Jersey's newly healthy economy and the ascendancy of the Democrats, who backed Mr. McGreevey's requests for higher spending on property tax relief, schools and social and health programs. 
 To pay for the increases, the proposed budget raises income taxes on the state's highest earners, the first income tax increase in 14 years, and imposes or raises taxes on cigarettes, telephones, new tires and some real estate sales. The state is also borrowing $1.9 billion in the form of new bonds to balance the budget.
 Although the budget legislation emerged from both houses' budget committees on Wednesday, neither could vote on it until a full calendar day had elapsed, meaning not before 12:01 a.m. Friday. The legislators' debate began before the deadline and continued afterward. The long day was the last scheduled before their summer recess.
 The most contested item was the $1.9 billion bond issue, which Republicans say violates the State Constitution's requirement of a balanced budget. While too heavily outnumbered to stop the measure in either house, the Republicans plan to challenge it in court immediately. 
 They also said the borrowing would further tarnish the state's bond rating. Rating agencies have criticized past bond issues, and in March, after the governor's budget address, Moody's Investors Service placed New Jersey on its watch list for possible downgrades.
 Robert Kurtter, an analyst at Moody's, said on Thursday that the agency had reservations about the state's reliance on borrowing and other one-time revenue measures. But Mr. Kurtter said his agency would not take any action before reviewing the budget over the next three to four weeks. 
 Republican legislators were also incensed by the spending growth. ''Never in the 10 years we controlled Trenton did we increase a budget by anywhere near this amount,'' the Assembly minority leader, Alex DeCroce, said.
 But Democrats responded that nearly all of the added spending would go directly to health care and nursing homes, schools and, in the case of property tax rebates, to residents. Mr. McGreevey has presided over deep cuts in many of these programs from the time he took office in 2002. 
 As the economy wobbled for two years, the governor also raised minor taxes and fees, overhauled the corporate business tax to raise an additional $1 billion, and borrowed additional billions. 
 After his fellow Democrats won control of the Senate and tightened their grip on the Assembly in November, Mr. McGreevey was able to propose restoring many cuts and borrowing yet more. 
 During the current fiscal year, tax collections exceeded projections, allowing the state to spend $600 million more than the $24.1 billion authorized in the budget. The current budget was approved by the Legislature in June 2003.

HEADLINE: Share The Music

BYLINE: By Kembrew McLeod. 
Kembrew McLeod, an assistant professor of communication studies at the University of Iowa, is the author of ''Owning Culture.''

DATELINE: IOWA CITY, Iowa 

 BODY:
On Tuesday, the Recording Industry Association of America filed another round of lawsuits against people who allegedly downloaded and shared copyrighted music. In doing so, the association finally topped the 3,000-served mark.
 The association argues that file sharing is directly responsible for the widely reported slump in CD sales from 2000 to 2003. This, however, ignores the fact that the economy was in a post-Sept. 11 recession and that many other industries suffered even greater declines in their sales at the time. Still, it is reasonable to assume that downloading was a cause of some drop in CD sales. 
 But this simple narrative is a bit more complicated. The two primary direct competitors for young music buyers' dollars -- video games and DVD's, both also widely and freely traded on the Internet -- continued to do quite well. And during the first quarter of 2004, CD sales in the United States rose 10.6 percent over the previous year, an upturn that the recording industry association confidently attributed to its lawsuits. But a report issued in April by the Pew Internet and American Life Project stated that the number of people who said they had downloaded music files during the same first quarter had increased by 5 million, to a total of 23 million, from the project's previous survey in late 2003.
 In other words, at the exact moment file-sharing activity rose, so did CD sales. These numbers supported an economic study by Profs. Felix Oberholzer-Gee and Koleman S. Strumpf. Their findings indicated that file sharing had no measurable effect on music sales. ''At most, file sharing can explain a tiny fraction of this decline,'' the professors concluded. These men are not anti-copyright activists by any measure -- Mr. Oberholzer-Gee is a professor at the Harvard Business School and Mr. Strumpf is a visiting fellow at the Cato Institute. 
 With its new round of lawsuits, the recording industry association is once again demonstrating its failure to recognize the obvious: file sharing isn't going away. Consumers have grown attached to it, and more and more musicians believe file sharing can help promote their music in an age of limited play lists at radio stations. Given its hold in our culture, downloading, in some form, must be part of any solution to this impasse. 
 A blanket license model, like that legalizing the use of copyrighted material by cable television and radio, can point us to a future system that might work for file sharing. There would be differences, of course, but there's no need to reinvent the wheel. Various lawyers, professors and organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to protecting individual freedoms in the digital age, have offered workable solutions. 
 Simply put, these varying proposals go like this: given that the movie, video game and software industries continue to grow -- and file sharing's harm to the music industry is debatable -- additional fees needn't be exorbitant. The foundation's plan calls for generating a $3 billion pot of money -- the amount the industry says it is losing annually -- by charging consumers a $5 monthly licensing fee. The fee could come bundled with, for instance, a consumer's broadband Internet access bill and would be similar to paying a cable bill. Rather than replace the music industry's business model, this would supplement it with a steady revenue stream.
 Some critics call these plans unrealistic, but a legally sanctioned cable television system also seemed like a pipe dream in the 1960's because of the television industry's resistance.
 It would be dishonest, and foolish, to suggest that hammering out a compromise palatable to all sides is going to be easy. But the alternative -- to do nothing, or to pass new industry-backed legislation -- would continue to criminalize the everyday behavior of millions. And it would continue to stifle an innovative way to distribute artistic works.

HEADLINE: Stock Options Debate Comes to Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., June 24 

 BODY:
At a protest rally that filled a downtown plaza on Thursday, there were more khakis and clip-on cellphones than denim and flannel as hundreds of technology workers opposed a change in accounting regulations that they think threatens the lifeblood of Silicon Valley. 
 Hardware engineers, software programmers and chirpy marketers carried placards with slogans like ''Save Our Stock Options,'' and every person who was asked was able to offer a business card.
 The demonstrators were assembled several blocks from a public hearing at a nearby hotel held by accounting regulators, who want to require that every publicly traded company report as an expense the value of stock options they give to employees. 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board heard from executives at big corporations, venture capitalists and others, about its proposal. A second public hearing will be on Tuesday in Norwalk, Conn., where the board has its offices. 
 The protesters arrived on yellow school buses, chartered by companies up and down the valley, to spend their lunch hours applauding, cheering and even awkwardly chanting slogans that were heartfelt, if not quite as selfless as those heard at social protest rallies. 
 ''Stock options are the most powerful incentive we have to attract employees,'' Andy Bechtolsheim, a founder of several Silicon Valley companies, including Sun Microsystems, told the demonstrators. ''Why else would someone leave a large company and take the risk'' of joining a start-up firm? 
 Without options, three out of four start-ups that succeeded in Silicon Valley would have failed, because they would not have been able to attract high-quality employees, Mr. Bechtolsheim said. 
 ''Eventually, companies will stop issuing options to employees'' if the accounting change is approved, said Don Zerio, a controller at Linear Technology, a semiconductor maker, while waiting for the rally program to begin. ''It's not Silicon Valley fat cats who are going to lose out,'' Mr. Zerio said, ''but rank-and-file employees.''
 Rally organizers provided an information sheet that asserted that 14 million American workers have stock options. Roughly 90 percent of those people, it said, hold nonmanagement positions.
 At the hearing, where three dozen accountants, stock analysts, academics and corporate executives were asked to give their views, the conversation was more technical, though occasionally contentious. 
 Rick White, the head of TechNet, an industry lobbying group, said the accounting change was ''more about accounting theory and less about practical consequences.'' 
 ''There are some things that we let experts decide and some things we don't,'' Mr. White said in an interview several days before the hearings. ''You can't just let any academic theory run amok.'' 
 Options are a more popular form of compensation within the technology sector than any other industry -- and not surprisingly, technology trade groups are leading this fight. The earnings of the Standard & Poor's 500 would have been 8 percent lower in 2003 had the companies been required to treat options as an expense, according to a report from Credit Suisse First Boston. By contrast, the operating earnings of the 100 largest companies traded on the technology-heavy Nasdaq stock market would have been 44 percent lower that year, according to an analyst at Bear Stearns. 
 ''This is priority one, two and three for us right now,'' Mr. White said.
 Two questions dominating the morning debate at the hotel were whether option expenses made sense and how to place a monetary value on the benefit. 
 ''The whole debate is based on a false premise,'' said Donna Dubinsky, a co-founder of Palm, the hand-held device maker (now palmOne). The cost of employee options, she said, would be ''a fictitious expense on the income statement, one that is not related to cash in any way.''
 Andrew Dral, a former stock broker who is an analyst at a pension fund, which he declined to name, was among those disagreeing with Ms. Dubinsky's argument.
 ''An option has economic value,'' he said. ''It's an egregious distortion not to take this into consideration on the income statement.'' 
 That sentiment was supported by Mark Casey, an analyst at Capital Research who favors the accounting change. Mr. Casey worked at Siebel Systems, a business software maker whose stock price rose through much of the 1990's. When Siebel offered him a job, Mr. Casey said, ''I cared about those options five times more than the salary.'' 
 A major point in the dispute was the difficulty of determining prices for options when their value could only be known some years later. 
 ''Stock options might be worth something or they might be worth nothing,'' said Kim Polese, a founder of Marimba, a software maker based in Mountain View, Calif. The price of stock in her company has varied from $1 to $60 a share, and a large portion of Marimba employees were granted options when the stock was closer to the midpoint of those numbers, she said. Shares of Marimba closed on Thursday at $8.20. 
 ''To assign an arbitrary value to options makes the financial statements incredibly complex and misleading,'' Ms. Polese said.
 Mr. Casey acknowledged that ''perfect accuracy isn't possible.'' But he added that ''lots of other things in accounting are impossible to measure with perfect accuracy.''

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

* MONTY ALEXANDER, ERNEST RANGLIN, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Mr. Alexander, a jazz pianist originally from Jamaica, has often refitted reggae songs and steel-drum sounds for a jazz-trio context. But this weekend he is appearing with Ernest Ranglin, a great Jamaican guitar player now in his 70's, who is one of the backbones of reggae's history. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10; cover charge is $25 (Ben Ratliff).

BLUE RODEO, SAM ROBERTS, O SUSANNA, Central Park Summerstage, mid-park at 69th Street, (212) 360-2777. The annual delegation from Canada to Summerstage, leaning heavily on folk-rock this year. Sunday at 3 p.m.; free with donations requested (Jon Pareles).

* URI CAINE, JVC Jazz Festival, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Over the last decade, the pianist Uri Caine has forged a relationship with the German label Winter & Winter that brings to mind Keith Jarrett's relationship with ECM for its look of complete control granted to an artist. There's another connection with Mr. Jarrett, too. Mr. Caine has put in plenty of time playing in jazz trios around his native Philadelphia; hence his pure-jazz sets tonight. But has also played a lot of the classical repertory and popular American songs. And instead of presenting solo piano works in their pure state, he builds elaborate postmodern playgrounds on them, whether it's baroque music or Tin Pan Alley. Tonight is his ''Blue Wail'' quartet, with Greg Osby, Drew Gress and Ben Perowsky. Tomorrow is his version of Bach's ''Goldberg Variations,'' refitted for DJ, jazz ensemble and singer. On Sunday night he brings his jazz trio, with Drew Gress and Ben Perowsky. Sets are at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 set tomorrow night; cover charge is $30 (Ratliff).

* CAT POWER, East River Amphitheater, East River Park, Lower East Side, www
.eastrivermusicproject.com. Last year Chan Marshall, who records as Cat Power, released perhaps her best album yet: on ''You Are Free'' (Matador), she perfected her own desolate, disjointed version of folk music, singing angular love songs and galloping odes to ambivalence. Her live performances are notoriously unpredictable, but it's a free concert, so you may as well show up and hope for the best. Tomorrow afternoon at 2, with Double Leopards, 2/5 BZ and Valley of the Ashes; free (Kelefa Sanneh).

* GEORGE CLINTON AND THE P-FUNK ALL-STARS, Apollo Theater, (212) 864-0372. George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. The band is large enough to be a party all on its own, with ranks of guitarists, singers, horn players and keyboardists to pump out songs that encompass decades of American musical history. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $38 to $48 (Pareles).

COCOROSIE, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. CocoRosie, an unlikely sister act that specializes in whispery, gospel-tinged experiments. The debut CocoRosie album, ''La Maison de Mon Reve'' (Touch and Go), is alternately annoying and enchanting, although it may take the duo some time to live down ''Jesus Love Me,'' a wildly ill-advised foray into African-American dialect that includes an epithet they probably should have avoided. Tonight at 8, with Celena Glenn and Tarantula; tickets are $10 (Sanneh).

* OSCAR D'LEON, PONCHO SANCHEZ LATIN JAZZ BAND, JVC Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-7800. It's the annual ''Salsa Jazz Jam'' within the JVC Festival. Mr. Sanchez, a conga player from the San Francisco Bay area, has been a mainstay in Latin jazz since the early 1980's; Oscar D'Leon, the Colombian bassist, leads a charismatic, heavy-duty salsa band. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $45 to $85 (Ratliff).

* ROSIE FLORES, Midsummer Night Swing, Lincoln Center Plaza, (212) 875-5766. Rosie Flores has situated herself at the junction of Tex-Mex, rockabilly and honky-tonk. That means singing about both broken hearts and the gumption to get over them. For this crowd, she's bound to lean on the honky-tonk dance tunes. Tonight at 7:30; admission is $15 (Pareles).

* ARETHA FRANKLIN, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Aretha Franklin can sing anyone off a stage when she's in the mood. And playing a premium-priced show at a club this small may give her the opportunity to shrug off her overelaborate concert arrangements and let her voice soar. Tonight at 8; tickets are $150 to $425 (Pareles).

WYCLIFFE GORDON-RAY ANDERSON, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Two expressive, super-entertaining jazz trombonists, with a wide range of band experiences between them, from Wynton Marsalis to Anthony Braxton. Tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).

WAYNE HANCOCK, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500. Wayne Hancock is a time-warped Texas singer who carries the music back more than half a century to the heyday of Western swing and early honky-tonk. In a tangy voice with a touch of a yodel, he sings about what hasn't changed in country music: highways, heartbreaks and the bottle. Three sets tonight, starting at 10 p.m.; free (Pareles).

* HANDSOME BOY MODELING SCHOOL, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. This should be an odd event: the underground hip-hop producer Dan the Automator conducts a performance by his free-floating supergroup, Handsome Boy Modeling School. Announced guests include Cat Power, Dres from Black Sheep, Domino and Casual. Tomorrow night at 11; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 at the door (Sanneh).

INCUBUS, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741; Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000. The nice guys of new metal, Incubus can easily punch out choppy hard-rock laced with turntable scratching and outbursts of angst. But its commercial advantage is in its sincere ballads, full of positive thinking and promises of devotion. At Madison Square Garden tonight at 8, with Spart opening; tickets are $45. At Nassau Coliseum tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $40.50 (Pareles).

PATTI LABELLE, Central Park Summerstage, mid-park at 69th Street, (212) 360-2777. Nothing exceeds like excess in the singing of Patti Labelle. She tears into her love songs with the over-the-top emotionality of a well-traveled soul diva, soaring toward the heavens or growling to get earthy. In this concert for dancers and diva-lovers, she shares the bill with the house disc jockeys Timmy Regisford and Sting International. Tomorrow afternoon at 3; free, with donations requested (Pareles).

LES SAVY FAV, Q AND NOT U, Volume, 99 North 13th Street, near Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-3588or www.volume.tv. The propulsive post-punk band Les Savy Fav headlines, but arrive in time for Q and Not U, a band from Washington that updates (slightly) the spiky, anxious sound of the British new-wave group Gang of Four. Tonight at 10, with El Guapo; tickets are $16 (Sanneh).

HAROLD MABERN TRIO, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. A fine bop-and-blues pianist, originally from Memphis; he is usually heard in George Coelman's band, but not so often leading his own. He appears with the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $16 (Ratliff).

* PINETOP PERKINS, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Pinetop Perkins was the longtime pianist in Muddy Waters's Chicago blues band. He has the entire blues vocabulary in his fingers, from boogie and shuffle bass lines to florid barrelhouse trills and filigrees. But he plays his solos like a card sharp who only shows what he needs to, and his ruthless economy translates into pithy, ornery blues. His band will be led by the guitarist Bob Margolin, who spent most of the 1970's in Muddy Waters's band. Tonight at 7; tickets are $25 (Pareles).

CHRIS ROBINSON'S NEW EARTH MUD, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. Chris Robinson, whose bluesy rasp and rock-star moves were the center of the Black Crowes, has started another band, New Earth Mud, that pushes his voice upward and has more than a touch of Neil Young and the Allman Brothers. Sunday afternoon at 4; admission is $25 (Pareles).

LINDA RONSTADT, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Linda Ronstadt has applied her lush voice to rock, bluegrass, Tin Pan Alley standards, mariachi and operetta. She is performing at this concert hall with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $48 to $84 (Pareles).

* WAYNE SHORTER-HERBIE HANCOCK-DAVE HOLLAND-BRIAN BLADE QUARTET, JVC Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 247-7800. The great jazz musicians Mr. Shorter and Mr. Hancock played some duets on record and in performance several years ago, but their fans were really waiting for them to reconnect with a great band. (They were two-fifths of the Miles Davis quintet of the 1960's, one of the best ever.) Those wishes have come true, and the band -- put together for a few summer festival concerts, and beyond that, who knows? -- seems well chosen. The bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Brian Blade are consummate ensemble players with their own strong musical personalities. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 to $75 (Ratliff).

* LEW TABACKIN QUINTET WITH RANDY BRECKER: ''PORTRAIT OF BEAN,'' JVC Jazz Festival, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. Coleman Hawkins, also known as Bean, was the first major stylist on tenor saxophone and one of the best musicians jazz ever produced. The saxophonist Lew Tabackin often evokes something of his luxurious, harmonically sophisticated sound. This concert is based on Hawkinsiana. Tonight at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum (Ratliff).

TEMPTATIONS REVUE, BOBBY WOMACK, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Dennis Edwards is soldiering on with a group to join him in the hard-charging Motown songs he sang with the Temptations. But this concert has an additional draw with Bobby Womack, the gutsy soul man, guitarist and songwriter who has been belting songs like ''It's All Over Now'' since the early 1960's. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $48.50 to $93.50 (Pareles).

GEORGE THOROGOOD, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800. With a growly voice, a strategic stutter and a blaring slide guitar, George Thorogood rediscovered John Lee Hooker and Elmore James for a 1980's audience that heard the blues as hard-drinking, rowdy good-time music. The blues has survived worse, and like Delaware's answer to the early Z.Z. Top, Mr. Thorogood and his band keep on pumping out basic blues-rock. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $40 (Pareles).

PAUL VAN DYK, Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, entrance at East 72nd Street, Central Park, (212) 360-2756; Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-9477. ''Reflections'' (Mute), the recent album by this German progressive-house producer and D.J., is a rather banal collection of pop songs interrupted by slightly less banal rhythmic breaks. But if you go to Central Park tomorrow (or to the afterparty tomorrow night), expect to hear the usual dancefloor-pleasing devices: heroic synthesizer lines, sudden (or gradual) volume changes and lots of wooshing sounds. At Rumsey Playfield today at 6 p.m., with doors opening at 4:30; tickets are $42 (including a $2 donation to Rock the Vote). At Spirit, with doors opening tomorrow night at 11; $25 advance tickets are available (from ticketweb.com) only to revelers who have already bought tickets to the Central Park gig, $30 at the door (Sanneh).

* DOUG WAMBLE, RAUL MIDON, MIGUEL ZENON, JVC Jazz Festival, Bryant Park, Avenue of the Americas between 40th and 42nd Streets, (212) 501-1390. Mr. Wamble, the guitarist and occasional singer, connects the dots between rural acoustic blues and pretty sophisticated jazz; Raul Midon, an acoustic guitarist and singer with his background in high-stakes Latin pop, is much smoother and more virtuosic; Miguel Zenon, the Puerto Rican alto saxophonist, has proven in the past few years to be a major talent both as an instrumentalist and as a composer. The free concert starts today at noon (Ratliff).

BUSTER WILLIAMS QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Williams, an agile bassist with a liquid tone, has been setting up bands stocked with the best players in New York. This one includes the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, the pianist George Colligan and the drummer Lenny White. Tonight through Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, $20 on Sunday (Ratliff).

* HAL WILLNER'S NEIL YOUNG PROJECT, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, (718) 855-7882, Ext. 45. Neil Young's songs -- blunt and dreamy, plainspoken and oblique, folky and earthshaking -- will be performed by a carefully chosen assortment of performers: Cat Power, Ron Sexsmith, Iron and Wine, Jane Siberry, Antony, the Be Good Tanyas, Jenni Muldaur, Stan Ridgway and others. Tomorrow night at 7:30; free with a $3 donation requested (Pareles).

PERSON: Lillian Seril

HEADLINE: Lillian Seril, 95, Dies; Landlord at Center of Rent Strike

BYLINE: By STUART LAVIETES

 BODY:
Lillian Seril, who as landlord of a grand Upper West Side apartment building, the Belnord, became the central figure in one of New York City's longest rent strikes, died on Monday at New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and had been living as a tenant at the building she once owned, at 225 West 86th Street. 
 Her death was announced by her family in a paid notice in The New York Times.
 The 16-year battle between Mrs. Seril and her tenants played out on a suitably historic stage. The Belnord, an ornate Italian Renaissance building 12 stories tall, occupies the entire block between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. It was advertised as the largest apartment house in the world when it was completed in 1908 and was designated as a New York City landmark in 1966. 
 Designed to be one of the city's most luxurious residences, it has huge, high-ceilinged apartments and surrounds a half-acre courtyard. It became a center of the Upper West Side's intellectual life, home over the years to figures like the Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Actors Studio founder Lee Strasberg and the actor Zero Mostel.
 But the Belnord was more than a glamorous address; it also was one of Manhattan's biggest real estate bargains. When Mrs. Seril and her husband, Nathan, became sole owners of the building in 1974, two-thirds of its 225 apartments were covered under the city's rent control law, which originated as a federal plan in World War II to prevent war profiteering. With prices averaging $60 per room, tenants of rent-controlled 10-room apartments could pay less than $500 per month, well below the market rate even then.
 Upon taking over the building, the Serils said some tenants owed back rent and accused others of infractions from illegal subletting to ripping out fixtures to installing appliances that put a dangerous strain on the building's wires and pipes.
 Tenants had their own complaints: elevators frequently went out of service; pipes burst; the roof leaked; plaster fell from ceilings: the building often had no hot water, or no water at all. The tenants also said the Serils would not allow them to make repairs themselves.
 To the Serils, these problems were a simple matter of economics. As their son-in-law, Owen C. Pell, later told said, ''If you keep the rents in the building lower than they are in the South Bronx, how do you stop the property from running down?''
 The rent strike began in 1978, joined by nearly half of the Belnord's residents. It was soon followed by litigation that became so bitter that the Manhattan Housing Court judge originally assigned to the case withdrew in 1980 after the collapse of a settlement he had arranged, saying that the two sides ''deserved each other.'' 
 When the city's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development was asked to intervene in the dispute four years later, he said, ''I'm not going to get myself into a West Beirut situation, where one or both parties are shooting at us.''
 The battle continued through the 1980's, outliving Mr. Seril, who died in 1981. At one point, a court-appointed administrator was put in charge of the building, a step usually taken against slumlords. Later, a justice of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan found that many strikers were withholding rent to force Mrs. Seril to sell the building or to convert it to condominiums or cooperatives; he also found that some of the strikers were failing to place their withheld rent in escrow, in effect living rent free.
 The strike finally came to an end in October 1994, when Mrs. Seril agreed to sell the building to investors for $15 million, or about $66,000 an apartment. Experts estimated that she could have asked two or three times as much if the rents had been at market level and the building had been in better shape. 
 Her opponents were surprised when she finally sold the Belnord.
 ''Mrs. Seril has turned down many offers from buyers,'' a tenant leader said. ''The tenants have even offered to buy the building. This is not about money.''
 Born Lillian Trachtenberg, Mrs. Seril is survived by her daughters Barbara and Pearl, her stepdaughter Zena Carp, her sisters Ada Hinden and Gladys Feigenbaum, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. 
 Mrs. Seril remained a part of the Belnord saga even after selling the building. In a long speech before the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1996, she criticized the new owners' renovation plans and their intention of putting a large supermarket in the building's basement. This time Mrs. Seril, who lived in a 3,000-square-foot, $450-a-month, rent-controlled apartment in the Belnord, was speaking as a tenant.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Brooklyn: Homes Are Rehabilitated

BYLINE: By David W. Chen (NYT); Compiled by George James

 BODY:
Officials of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development and of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development visited a rehabilitated building in Bedford-Stuyvesant yesterday to announce that they were close to rehabilitating more than 300 properties that had been caught up in a home mortgage scandal. Under a scheme to defraud HUD's 203(k) program, real estate speculators bought hundreds of dilapidated properties in the late 1990's and sold them at vastly inflated prices to nonprofit groups inexperienced in housing. 
Those groups then defaulted on the loans, prompting city and federal officials to embark on a $168 million program to renovate the properties. Twenty people have been arrested, and 13 have pleaded guilty. David W. Chen (NYT)

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Take Small Steps on Trade

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 24 

 BODY:
After nearly a week of prickly discussions on trade, China and the United States agreed to meet twice a year with the aim of eventually granting China the status of a market economy.
 Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, ended a six-day visit to China on Thursday. Mr. Evans and Elaine L. Chao, the labor secretary, who was also in Beijing, pressed China to make trade-related changes including loosening its currency controls, privatizing its banking system, strengthening workers' wages and bargaining rights, and rolling back the role of government in the economy.
 ''Far too many key assets and means of production within the Chinese economy are owned and operated by the state,'' Mr. Evans said this week in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. ''We have seen too few 'for sale' signs on the commanding heights of the Chinese economy.'' 
 Trade officials and lawyers said that reclassifying China as a market economy would make it easier for Chinese companies to fend off dumping charges, but they stressed that it might be many years before China reaches the necessary conditions.
 ''There's no doubt they're committed to reforms that bring China closer to a truly market economy,'' said Grant D. Aldonas, the Commerce Department's under secretary of international trade, in an interview in Beijing, ''but it will take some considerable time.'' 
 A senior American trade official will travel to Beijing in July to start the talks, he added.
 The United States is China's biggest export market and the United States' trade deficit with China hit $124 billion last year. That trade gap has drawn growing trade complaints from American manufacturers and unions.
 China is currently classified as a ''nonmarket economy'' under American trade rules, which makes it vulnerable to complaints from the United States of selling goods like furniture, clothes and televisions at below-market prices. 
 ''If an economy is not a market economy, then the U.S. no longer uses exporters' home market as the normal price for goods,'' said Patrick Norton, a trade lawyer with O'Melveny & Myers in Beijing. China is usually assessed in American antidumping cases by using surrogate prices from India, which is classified as a market economy.
 ''That leads to some very strange and unpredictable results,'' Mr. Norton said.
 The far-reaching changes China will have to undergo to meet these criteria include removing the government's influence over commercial bank loans, which often go to failing state-owned companies, and allowing currency convertibility on current and capital account transactions. 
 China now allows relatively free currency conversion for current account transactions, which primarily deal with traded goods, but it maintains strict controls over the inward and outward flows of capital accounts -- money used for investment.
 ''What we're concerned with is the free flow of capital, not the precise exchange rate,'' Mr. Aldonas said. ''This is about the pace of reform.''
 The United States also hinted that it might encourage China's steps to full market status by using revised rules in a case against Chinese wooden furniture makers.
 Last week, the United States imposed duties worth $1.2 billion on Chinese wooden furniture exports after complaints from American manufacturers and trade unions. Although China's wooden furniture industry is overwhelmingly privately owned, China's nonmarket status makes it difficult for private manufacturers to prove that their cheap prices are a result of market competition, not government manipulation. 
 United States trade officials, however, may consider classifying China's private furniture makers as a ''market-oriented sector,'' thus sparing them many possible sanctions imposed on government-owned makers, Mr. Aldonas said. 
 When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it agreed that the United States did not have to reconsider China's nonmarket status until 2015. Other countries, including New Zealand and Thailand, have recently given China market status; the European Union is also considering making the switch.
 But as a market economy, China would be exposed to antidumping charges brought because of unlawful financial subsidies, rather than distorted prices, Mr. Norton, the trade lawyer said.
 ''You can't bring an antisubsidy case against a nonmarket economy,'' he said. ''It's going to be out of the frying pan and into the fire.''
 During discussions with Mr. Evans, top Chinese trade officials also repeated their interest in buying American-developed nuclear power technology and pressed their American counterparts for assurances that a potential deal would not be derailed by political disputes or security concerns.
 ''They were very interested in the nuclear issue. They want the latest technology, but they are also afraid of light-switch diplomacy,'' said Mr. Aldonas, referring to the risk of a sudden suspension of any deal. Chinese trade officials warned that any reversals of agreements would endanger cooperation in the nuclear power field, Mr. Aldonas added. 
 China's chief trade negotiator, Vice Premier Wu Yi, cited a Chinese proverb, ''Once bitten by a snake, one is terrified of the mere sight of a piece of rope,'' Mr. Aldonas said, adding that Washington would seek to develop a set of measures to address Chinese concerns.
 The Westinghouse Corporation, which is based in Pittsburgh, has lobbied China to buy its latest model AP1000 reactor, but French and Russian companies are also vying for contracts under a Chinese plan to substantially expand the use of nuclear energy.
 Mr. Evans and senior Chinese officials also discussed arrangements for inspection visits to ensure technology exports with potential military applications are not diverted from agreed civilian uses.
 Mr. Evans said he was satisfied with Chinese efforts to further protect the copyrights of American investors in China but added that ''there is much work to be done.''
 In trade talks in April, China agreed to strengthen criminal punishment of sellers of pirated goods, and to open a nationwide campaign against unlicensed computer software and other forms of piracy.

HEADLINE: Telecommunications Shares Send Indexes Downward

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, led by telecommunications shares, after the AT&T Corporation cut its profit and revenue forecast. Weaker-than-expected reports on durable goods orders and jobless claims contributed to the decline.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index erased its earlier gain to close near its low. Attacks in Iraq and Turkey, along with investor anticipation of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase next week, kept the market in check. 
 The S.&P. 500 slipped 3.41 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,140.65. An index of phone companies had the steepest drop among 10 industry groups. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 35.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,443.81. The Nasdaq composite index shed 5.41 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,015.57.
 All three indexes fell for the first day in three.
 Fifteen stocks rose for every 14 that dropped on the New York Stock Exchange. The S.&P. 500 bounced between gains and losses, rising 0.2 percent and falling 0.4 percent. Some 1.4 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, the 19th day in the last 20 that trading has lagged this year's daily average.
 Stocks fell as durable goods orders unexpectedly dropped and the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits rose more than estimated. New home sales surged 14.8 percent in May to a record, helped by job and income gains that have offset an increase in mortgage rates, the Commerce Department said.
 The Federal Reserve is expected to lift its overnight lending rate by 0.25 percentage point from a 46-year low of 1 percent when policy makers meet Tuesday and Wednesday.
 ''The entire world seems focused on June 30,'' said Brian R. Bruce, who manages $11 billion as head of equity investments at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston. ''As soon as that clears the market, people will take a step back and say, 'Hey, earnings are pretty good.'''
 Profits for companies in the S.&P. 500 are expected to jump 20.8 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Financial. At the end of March, analysts had expected 14.9 percent growth. For all of 2004, analysts forecast growth of 18.6 percent. The benchmark is up 2.6 percent this year.
 AT&T, the nation's No.1 long-distance phone carrier, declined $1.60, to $14.81. The 9.8 percent loss was the biggest in the S.&P. 500. The company said operating income this year might fall by as much as two-thirds, as a drop in sales to business customers accelerates and prices for consumer phone calls plunge.
 The company forecast profit of $1 billion to $1.4 billion for 2004, down from an earlier prediction of up to $2.5 billion and last year's $3.66 billion. Revenue may reach $30.5 billion, below earlier forecasts of as much as $32 billion.
 MCI, the long-distance telephone company, declined 15 cents, to $13.55. Ido Cohen, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said MCI faces lower prices after AT&T's forecast. The analyst downgraded MCI to underperform from neutral and expected it to drop to $10 in 12 months.
 An index of telecommunications companies slid 1.4 percent. Sprint shed 30 cents, to $16.95, while Citizens Communications lost 86 cents, to $12.29.
 ATI Technologies increased $1.54, to $18.33. The company, a maker of computer graphics chips, expects sales this quarter of as much as $550 million, topping the $494.6 million average analyst estimate in a survey by Thomson.
 WMS Industries led an advance in slot-machine makers, gaining $1.21, to $27.87. International Game Technology, the world's biggest maker of slot machines, climbed $1.44, to $36.70. Penn National Gaming added $1.24, to $32.03, and the Alliance Gaming Corporation, a maker of slot machines, rose 50 cents, to $16.37.
 There is a ''more than reasonable chance'' that Pennsylvania will pass legislation next week allowing slot machines, a J.P. Morgan Securities analyst, Harry C. Curtis, wrote in a report. 
 Treasuries gained after a drop in durable goods orders bolstered speculation that the Federal Reserve will stick to its plan for measured interest rate increases. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32 to 100 26/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.65 percent, from 4.70 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Kerry Returns to Health Care in Latest Appeal to Swing States

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
This advertisement from Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts began running in 13 swing states on Tuesday. It is the second in a row from his campaign to focus on health care.

Producer: Shrum, Devine & Donilon

ON THE SCREEN: The spot opens with the following black writing on a white screen, ''John Kerry on Health Care in America.'' Then Mr. Kerry appears. As he speaks into the camera the screen flashes phrases emphasizing his points, ''Reduce the cost of health care,'' ''Lower premiums,'' ''Save billions on costs.'' The spot ends showing Mr. Kerry in slow motion, smiling broadly as he walks across a dais, apparently to address a crowd.

THE SCRIPT: Mr. Kerry says, ''We spend about $1.5 trillion every year on health care in America. Three hundred and fifty billion of that has nothing to do with care. It's all paperwork. Administrative overhead. I have a health care plan that can reduce the cost of health care. We can lower their premiums. And we will save literally billions of dollars in health care costs in America by becoming more streamlined and more efficient. I am John Kerry and I approve this message.''

ACCURACY: Mr. Kerry is basing his claim that Americans spend $1.5 trillion every year on health care upon a report this year from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which estimated that Americans spent $1.6 trillion in 2002. His claim that $350 billion of that goes to administrative costs is based in part on a report in The New England Journal of Medicine that such costs were an estimated $300 billion in 1999. But like Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bush has proposed improvements to help lower administrative health care costs, namely by expanding the use of electronic medical records. Mr. Kerry has promised to provide coverage for 27 million uninsured Americans and to cut premiums by 10 percent over all, among other things. Republicans say it relies too much on the federal government to provide health care.

SCORECARD: Mr. Kerry seems to be treading into ripe territory by focusing on health care costs in this advertisement. Voters are naming health care costs among their top campaign issues. And, as other economic indicators improve, a continued rise in health care costs is squeezing many middle-class voters. Then again, terms like ''administrative overhead'' are not likely to stick in television viewers' minds like, say, ''the Real Thing.'' Still, with Mr. Bush's team taking a pause in its advertising, Mr. Kerry has a window in which to deliver his campaign message, and score some points, without competition from spots from Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Bush and Kerry Offer Plans for High-Tech Growth

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., June 24 

 BODY:
Having paid less attention than their predecessors to Silicon Valley for much of the campaign, Senator John Kerry and President Bush today announced new proposals to aid the growth of high-tech businesses. Not surprisingly, each argued that the other's plans would stifle innovation.
 Here in San Jose, where corporate chiefs and venture capitalists are cautiously celebrating the end of a four-year downturn, Mr. Kerry promised to use tax credits of 10 percent to 20 percent to expand broadband Internet access to inner cities and rural areas, where there is little penetration of high-speed access. He vowed to increase government financing for technology research, and in a new tax cut proposal he said he would work to eliminate capital gains taxes for investments in small businesses, a step he said would spur the creation of start-ups by making more capital available. 
 As they campaigned on opposite coasts, the challenger and the incumbent highlighted the same novel advance in telemedicine. Mr. Kerry spoke of a cardiologist in rural Virginia who had recently spotted a congenital heart defect on an ultrasound beamed from a patient from 75 miles away. Mr. Bush, speaking at the Commerce Department after viewing a demonstration of how broadband technologies allowed a doctor standing with him to offer a diagnosis to a patient in Maryland, repeated a promise to make sure broadband access is available in all corners of the country by 2007.
 ''On a per capita basis, America ranks 10th amongst the industrialized world,'' he said. ''That's not good enough. We don't like to be ranked 10th in anything. The goal is to be ranked first when it comes to per capita use of broadband technology. It's in our nation's interest. It's good for our economy.''
 But Mr. Bush offered few new programs, endorsing a continuation of a ban on taxing Internet access and promising to auction parts of the government-controlled radio spectrum to allow greater use of wireless broadband connections. 
 In such appearances, Mr. Bush emphasizes the job-creation capabilities of technologies like broadband without mentioning the more politically sensitive point that the same technology has made the outsourcing of American jobs possible. Call centers in Bangalore, India, and software engineering centers in China are possible only because such technology makes it possible to put work previously done here into the hands of lower-wage workers who can provide answers over the phone or design chip circuitry overnight and send it back to the United States.
 At San Jose State University on Thursday morning, his first visit to the high-tech capital since securing the Democratic nomination, Mr. Kerry said, ''We need a leadership that says if Bangalore in India can be completely wired, then so should all of America, and it will be.''
 ''In the last century, across a continent that stretched from sea to shining sea, there were entire islands of darkness in America,'' he added, citing Franklin D. Roosevelt's Rural Electric Administration as a model. ''Today, visionary national leadership can build a bridge across the digital divide and bring the promise of broadband technology to every home in America, just the way we brought electricity to every home in America.''
 Mr. Kerry has spent much less time courting Silicon Valley than Bill Clinton or Al Gore did, and he has less support than his predecessor Democrats among technology executives, some of whom were miffed by his denouncing in the primaries ''Benedict Arnold'' chief executives who send jobs to other countries. Mr. Kerry's aides now say that was what one called ''overheated rhetoric.'' 
 Nonetheless, Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, along with nine other technology leaders, recently endorsed Mr. Kerry. And Mr. Kerry raised $2 million for his campaign and his party at a fund-raiser on Wednesday in San Jose, which local officials said was a record for any political candidate there.
 Mr. Kerry's new initiatives would cost $8 billion over 10 years, his aides said, which would be paid for by auctioning space on the spectrum. Mr. Kerry's campaign estimated that would raise $30 billion, part of which would be devoted to research.
 Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush each dwelled on the advantages for rural areas. Mr. Kerry invoked the image of a schoolboy in a poor community who could find the same research for a science project as his counterpart in the wealthiest suburb, or an Iowa grandmother too frail to walk who could order groceries and medicine online. ''It's about fairness,'' he said. ''It's about who we are as a country.'' 
 Mr. Bush made a similar point: ''A lot of people in rural America like living there. The quality of life is really good. You walk down your street and know who you're looking at, and, generally, they'll say: 'How are you doing? It's good to see you. I hope you're having a wonderful day. What can we do to help you?' And it makes sense to be able to take the potential of broadband to rural America.''
 Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for Mr. Bush's campaign, said broadband access had increased 300 percent over the past three years, and was now available in 93 percent of the nation's ZIP codes. He pointed to votes Mr. Kerry had made to allow states to tax Internet access, saying, ''His record of voting against the interests of high-tech companies fits the doom-and-gloom pessimism he brought with him to California.''
 The visit to Silicon Valley was part of Mr. Kerry's two-day campaign swing through California, culminating in a concert late Thursday that was expected to raise $5 million for the Democrats. The concert, at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, postponed from earlier this month because of Ronald Reagan's death, was to feature Barbra Streisand, Billy Crystal, Ben Affleck, Leonardo DiCaprio, Willie Nelson and Ben Stiller.

HEADLINE: Switching Candidates, Iacocca Backs Kerry

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, June 24 

 BODY:
Pitching his plans for the new economy, Senator John Kerry was embraced on Thursday by an icon of the old, Lee A. Iacocca, the former chairman of the Chrysler Corporation.
 Mr. 
Iacocca, an outspoken supporter of President Bush in the 2000 election, said he was endorsing Mr. Kerry this year because ''the bottom line is simple: We need a new C.E.O. and a new president.''
 ''All of my best friends are Republicans,'' Mr. Iacocca said as he introduced Mr. Kerry, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, for a speech on technology at San Jose State University, ''and they ask me, 'Are you crazy or something? Why are you doing this?' I tell them the world is changing, our country is changing, and we need a leader who will understand that change taking place.''
 Mr. Iacocca appeared in campaign commercials and on the stump for Mr. Bush in 2000 in Michigan, a state the Democrats ended up winning by five percentage points. (''We forgive you!'' someone called from the crowd on Thursday.) Noting that his first ballot was cast for Harry S. Truman and that he had been ''friendly with every president since Lyndon Johnson,'' Mr. Iacocca, 79, said his decision to endorse Mr. Kerry was made ''not as a partisan but as an unabashed patriot.'' 
 He said he planned to campaign actively this fall in Michigan, Ohio and his native Pennsylvania.
 Mr. Kerry, for his part, praised Mr. Iacocca as ''a man of common sense'' and said that ''the Chrysler minivan has been the vehicle of success in winning my elections.''
 Nowadays, of course, the company Mr. Iacocca built is the German-owned DaimlerChrysler. And Mr. Kerry is ferried to and fro in black Chevrolet Suburbans driven by Secret Service agents.

HEADLINE: Movement on North Korea, Finally

 BODY:
North Korea's nuclear arms program has been the biggest unconventional weapons threat to the United States since the day President Bush took office. But it took three years of posturing, in which North Korea probably processed enough plutonium to make several bombs, before the Bush administration took real action. It has now put some specific proposals on the table that could lead to a satisfactory solution. 
 Yesterday, North Korean negotiators, as if on autopilot, were still warning of a possible nuclear test. But Kim Jong Il, the country's unpredictable dictator, has not yet decided how to respond to the American proposal. Rejecting it would be a mistake. North Korea can ensure a safer and more prosperous future for itself by coming to terms with Washington than it can by barricading itself behind a nuclear firewall while its economy disintegrates.
 The Bush administration is at last offering Mr. Kim specific inducements to give up the nuclear weapons programs that he believes are his best shield against the kind of pre-emptive war Washington launched against Iraq. The administration has also dropped its insistence that North Korea complete full nuclear disarmament before any rewards are delivered.
 North Korea has feared that once it fully disarmed, Washington would no longer feel pressed to complete its side of the bargain. But the new American proposal envisions a sensible two-stage process, which would start with the North acknowledging all its nuclear weapons programs and agreeing to give them up within three months. South Korea and other countries could start delivering badly needed fuel oil, and North Korea's security would be guaranteed during the disarmament period.
 If North Korea met the deadline, it would open the way to a broader and more permanent set of rewards, including its removal from Washington's list of states sponsoring terrorism, the elimination of some sanctions, improved diplomatic relations with the United States and greatly increased international economic assistance. 
 The Bush administration put forth this proposal because it had to. A military solution to the North Korean nuclear issue was never a credible option, and it is much less so after the disastrous Iraq operation. Had the administration refused to shift course and give North Korea specific inducements, Japan, South Korea and China might have started giving the North the aid and assurances it wanted without any nuclear quid pro quo. That would have left the White House vulnerable to campaign charges that it was letting North Korea build nuclear weapons with no effective American response. Political considerations aside, the administration deserves credit for finally offering a realistic plan to defuse this threat. We hope it's not too late.

HEADLINE: Errors on Terror

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''Tonight, I am instructing the leaders of the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the Homeland Security and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location. Our government must have the very best information possible.'' Thus spoke President Bush in the 2003 State of the Union address. A White House fact sheet called the center ''the next phase in the dramatic enhancement of the government's counterterrorism effort.''
 Among other things, the center took over the job of preparing the government's annual report on ''Patterns of Global Terrorism.'' The latest report, released in April, claimed to document a sharp fall in terrorism. ''You will find in these pages clear evidence that we are prevailing in the fight,'' Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage declared. But this week the government admitted making major errors. In fact, in 2003 the number of significant terrorist attacks reached a 20-year peak. 
 How could they get it so wrong? The answer tells you a lot about the state of the ''war on terror.''
 Credit for uncovering the report's errors goes to Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist, and David Laitin, a Stanford political scientist, who are studying patterns of terrorism. Mr. Krueger tells me that as soon as they looked at the latest report, they knew something was wrong. 
 All of the supposed decline in terrorism, they quickly saw, resulted from a fall in the number of ''nonsignificant'' events, which Mr. Krueger and Mr. Laitin say ''are counted with a squishy definition.'' Even the original report showed significant attacks -- a much less squishy category -- rising to a 20-year high. And the list of significant attacks ended on Nov. 11, 2003, but there were several major terrorist incidents after that date. Sure enough, including these and other omitted attacks more than doubled the estimated 2003 death toll. 
 Was the report's squishy math politically motivated? Well, the Bush administration has cooked the books in many areas, including budget projections, tax policy, environmental policy and stem cell research. Why wouldn't it do the same on terrorism?
 The erroneous good news on terrorism also came at a very convenient moment. The White House was still reeling from the revelations of the former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke, who finally gave public voice to the view of many intelligence insiders that the Bush administration is doing a terrible job of fighting Al Qaeda. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush was on a ''Winning the War on Terror'' campaign bus tour in the Midwest.
 Mr. Krueger, a forgiving soul, believes that the report was botched through simple incompetence. Maybe -- though we can be sure that if the statistics had told the administration something it didn't want to hear, they would have been carefully checked. By the way, while the report's tables and charts have been fixed, the revised summary still gives little hint of how bad the data really are.
 In any case, the incompetence explanation is hardly comforting. In a press conference announcing the release of the revised report, the counterterrorism coordinator Cofer Black attributed the errors to ''inattention, personnel shortages and [a] database that is awkward and antiquated.'' Remember: we're talking about the government's central clearinghouse for terrorism information, whose creation was touted as part of a ''dramatic enhancement'' of counterterrorism efforts more than a year before this report was produced. And it still can't input data into its own computers? (It should be no surprise, in this age of Halliburton, that the job of data input was given to -- and botched by -- private contractors.)
 Think of it as just one more indication that Mr. Bush isn't really serious about this terrorism thing. He talks about terror a lot, and invokes it to justify unrelated wars he feels like fighting. But when it comes to devoting resources to the unglamorous work of protecting the nation from attack -- well, never mind.
 Speaking of numbers: in 1980, middle-income families with children paid 8.7 percent of their income in income taxes, not 8.2 percent, as I reported on June 8. But it's still true that their combined income and payroll taxes rose under Ronald Reagan.

HEADLINE: City Money to Rescue Jobs Of 140 Lawyers for the Poor

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD and SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
The city agreed yesterday to rescue the Legal Aid Society from its financial straits, averting layoffs of at least 140 defense lawyers for the poor with an $11 million infusion of cash. 
 Under the budget agreement reached earlier this week between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council and approved by the Council last night, the city will provide Legal Aid with the one-time bailout to help shrink a deficit that was projected to swell to $20 million next year. The mayor also agreed not to seek a $2 million cut he had proposed.
 The money is expected to cancel the planned layoffs of 140 lawyers, which advocates for the agency said would have had devastating consequences for tens of thousands of poor defendants. Legal Aid's 880 lawyers handle 210,000 cases a year. 
 The agreement is also an important step in helping the agency repair its crumbling finances. Legal Aid nearly ran out of money this spring, and city officials said the agency had been operating with little or no financial accountability, a sticking point in negotiations, though the agency has recently taken several steps to improve its accounting.
 As a condition of the bailout, the city will appoint a team to oversee the agency's spending and conduct regular audits of its books, a practice that officials said the agency had virtually ignored.
 There will be some layoffs at the agency, however. Pat Bath, a spokeswoman for Legal Aid, said 42 nonunionized employees, including several managers, would lose their jobs. The fate of 72 more employees, including 16 lawyers in noncriminal divisions, is the subject of negotiations with two unions, the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys and Local 1199, she said. 
 But Ms. Bath said the agency would rescind the layoff notices sent to 140 lawyers in the criminal division.
 Amid the turmoil at the agency, Daniel L. Greenberg, its executive director for the past 10 years, resigned on June 9, saying, ''I believe that a change in leadership would be beneficial as the society navigates these difficult financial times.''
 A city official said yesterday that while Mr. Greenberg's resignation was not a condition of the bailout, it helped convince officials that the agency was making a serious effort at reform.
 John Feinblatt, the city's criminal justice coordinator, declined to address Mr. Greenberg's resignation in the context of the bailout, saying only, ''We have seen that board has taken some steps to put its fiscal house in order and that signaled to us a willingness to take steps that were necessary to take.'' 
 The budget agreement also restores $2 million that Mr. Bloomberg had proposed cutting in his budget on April 26, meaning it will again get $68.8 million instead of $66.8 million. The rest of the agency's $150 million budget comes from federal and state money and private donations.
 Legal Aid had won support from several City Council members, including the speaker, Gifford Miller, who raised concerns that the layoffs would stir turmoil in the courts and shortchange the legal rights of poor defendants, who are required by law to receive representation in court. 
 Mr. Miller said more costly private lawyers would have to be found for people represented by laid-off Legal Aid lawyers, many of whom were handling dozens of cases.
 ''The city would pay more for less,'' he said. ''My colleagues and I feel strongly legal services for the poor are an important part of living up to the American legacy of legal and civil rights.''
 Legal Aid lawyers tend to have enormous case loads, said Don Saunders, director of civil legal services for National Legal Aid and Defender Association. 
 ''It's not like you can just walk away from them,'' he said. ''It's not like the criminal justice system is going to take a month off until things are worked out.''
 The agency handles about 90 percent of the indigent criminal cases in the city, with alternative agencies and court-appointed and private lawyers taking the rest.
 For the past several months, the Legal Aid board has sought to stem the fiscal bleeding. In January, the chief financial officer, Theresa de Leon, stepped down, and a board task force was created to find solutions.
 Mr. Greenberg, in an e-mail message to employees in May announcing the layoffs, sought to explain the financial problems.
 ''The context of the problems we are addressing is that we have put client service foremost in our decision making over a number of years, despite a persistently fragile economic posture,'' he wrote. ''Like most not-for-profits in New York City, we were hit hard by the events following the September 11 terrorism. Our programs operated at a deficit through this time, as we focused our attention on clients' needs.''
 The board task force found that the agency was operating without basic financial reporting and accounting practices, including an accounts payable system, according to internal board documents.
 Legal Aid has operated with a deficit in several of the past 10 years, but the financial problems came to a head this year as the budget deficit swelled to $10 million for the fiscal year that ended Wednesday and to $20 million for next year. 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 30, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about New York City's agreement to rescue the financially ailing Legal Aid Society misstated the share of indigent criminal cases that the society handles citywide. It is about 61 percent, not 90 percent.

HEADLINE: Council Gives Its Approval To Budget With Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The New York City Council unanimously passed a $47.2 billion budget early today that is expected to provide tax relief to many city residents, including a $400 rebate to most homeowners for each of the next three years, and will significantly expand school, library and subsidized day care programs.
 The Council vote ratified a budget deal that was struck by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the Council speaker, Gifford Miller, earlier this week, and clears the way for it to take effect at the start of the city's fiscal year next Thursday.
 While the broad outlines of the budget were already known, the budget books distributed to council members last night provided the first detailed breakdown of expenditures. There was $250 million set aside for the $400 tax rebates advocated by Mayor Bloomberg, which prevailed over Mr. Miller's alternative proposal for a 2 percentage-point rollback of last year's 18.5 percent property tax rate increase. 
 Mr. Miller said in a television interview before the Council vote last night that the tax rebate was a mistake, but many of his members disagreed. For his part, Mr. Miller won $50 million in the budget for an earned-income tax credit for the working poor, which is expected to benefit as many as 700,000 taxpayers, Council aides said.
 Both tax proposals have yet to be approved by the State Legislature, but Albany leaders have pledged to support them. 
 In a written statement, Mayor Bloomberg praised the budget for reflecting the priorities of the city and its residents. ''This is a sound and responsible budget that is good for all New Yorkers,'' he said. ''It will help us keep the streets clean and safe while we work to improve our schools, create jobs and improve our quality of life.''
 The budget books were released unusually late last night -- around 10:30 p.m. -- allowing scant time to study them before the vote, just after midnight today. As reporters and lobbyists waited impatiently for the books, Mr. Miller found time to do a television interview, while other council members attended a fund-raising dinner for the Bronx Democratic Party before returning for the budget meeting. The Council chamber itself was being used until 9 p.m. for a non-Council event -- an awards celebration for Gay Pride Week.
 The budget contained a total of $215 million to maintain a host of social service, health and cultural programs at current levels. The money had been left out of the mayor's budget proposal in January.
 In addition, the budget allocated more than $76 million to significantly expand a number of city services, a significant turnaround from last year's cost-cutting measures. For instance, there was $10 million more to pay for at least 1,400 additional children in subsidized day care programs for low- and moderate-income families; and $10 million more to extend library hours to six days a week at many branches.
 ''There's more money to go around this year,'' said Councilman David I. Weprin, the chairman of the Finance Committee. 
 There was even a surplus of $1.9 billion, most of which will be rolled over to next year's budget. The city is facing a projected $3.8 billion budget gap next year. Several new programs pushed by council members received funds, including a $10-million initiative to address long-term unemployment.
 At a time when both the mayor and speaker seek to take the lead on education issues, a total of $35 million was also allocated for a program that will reduce class sizes by hiring more than 200 teachers for kindergarten and grades one through three. The Council put in $10 million of that, and the Department of Education, $25 million. 
 In what has become a time-honored tradition in city politics, the Council's 51 members each took home additional money to their districts, including more than $240,000 for local programs that mainly serve the young and the elderly -- for a total of more than $12.2 million. 
 The speaker also distributed tens of millions of dollars in discretionary money to favored council members for their causes and pet projects, but the exact amount was impossible to pinpoint because it was buried in thousands of itemized entries in the budget books. For instance, one group, Friends of the High Line, received $200,000, and the New York Junior Tennis League received $486,500. Both count Mr. Miller among their supporters.

HEADLINE: Kerry and Single Voters

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 I want to assure Bella M. DePaulo, the author of ''Sex and the Single Voter'' (Op-Ed, June 18) -- and anyone concerned with the importance of single women voters -- that the Democratic Party is eager to discuss issues of concern, including health care, equal pay, economic opportunity and retirement security.
 Ironically, on the day this article appeared, Senator John Kerry was speaking about the importance of raising the minimum wage, a serious economic issue for women. The day before, the Democratic National Committee hosted six congresswomen speaking about the importance of child care and after-school care for hard-pressed parents, many of them single mothers.
 The overwhelming majority of single women will vote for John Kerry for president this year because of real issues that make a difference in their lives. Focusing on those issues is the best way to increase voter turnout.

HEADLINE: Kerry Message Begins Leaning Toward Center

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry has yet to produce a popular catchphrase for his political philosophy, like Gov. Bill Clinton's 1992 promise of a ''third way'' or Gov. George W. Bush's pledge in 2000 of ''compassionate conservatism.''
 But Mr. Kerry's Democratic message for the general election campaign is emerging, many Democrats say -- on the campaign trail, in the party platform now being written and in the major speeches he has delivered in recent weeks.
 His message, in part, is a return to the promise of Clintonian centrism: reducing the deficit, spurring economic growth, trying to ease ''the squeeze on middle-class America,'' as Mr. Kerry puts it, from things like the cost of health insurance and college tuition. 
 Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council and a longtime Clinton aide, fretted openly during the heyday of Howard Dean last year that the party was moving to the left. Today, Mr. Reed describes Mr. Kerry approvingly as ''a pragmatic centrist in the Clinton mode.''
 Familiar faces from the Clinton years, like the economic adviser Gene Sperling, are now at Mr. Kerry's side; James P. Rubin, a State Department spokesman in the Clinton years who advised Gen. Wesley K. Clark during the primaries, is now traveling with Mr. Kerry full time.
 But Mr. Kerry's message also reflects a very different time from the 1990's, framed by three unsettling years of terrorism, war and political division. Mr. Kerry's favorite refrain these days is a plea to ''let America be America again.'' It is a quotation from a Langston Hughes poem that he uses to evoke the idea of restoration -- for the economy, for a tax code that he asserts is increasingly unjust, for the dreams of the middle class and, perhaps most of all, for the country's foreign policy.
 Mr. Kerry's basic campaign speech has a distinctive edge, reflecting the Democratic Party's fury at President Bush and his handling of an increasingly unpopular war.
 At a fund-raiser in San Francisco this week, Mr. Kerry described the Republicans' governing philosophy as ''my way or the highway'' and asserted: ''George Bush talked about being a uniter, not a divider. But he's been the greatest divider as a president in the modern history of this country.''
 In a break with at least a generation of Democratic candidates, and certainly with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kerry's primary emphasis these days is often foreign policy and national security. ''This will be more like a cold war election than the elections of the 1990's,'' said Elaine Kamarck, a leading strategist for the Clinton-era ''new Democrats,'' now a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. 
 The son of a foreign service officer and the veteran of both the Vietnam War and 20 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Kerry is comfortable on this terrain, campaigning on the promise of a safer, more secure United States that is respected by its allies.
 Just as he invokes Mr. Clinton on the economy, Mr. Kerry summons the legacy of John F. Kennedy, Harry S. Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt when it comes to the United States' role in the world -- a kind of muscular internationalism. He pledges an end to a ''go it alone'' foreign policy. He is regularly cheered when he talks about a return to the days of alliance building, arguing that alliances make the United States stronger, not weaker.
 And he invariably brings Democratic loyalists to their feet when he declares: ''The United States of America should never go to war because it wants to. We should only go to war because we have to.''
 His advisers say that by virtue of his background Mr. Kerry is uniquely suited to re-establish the Democratic Party's credibility on national security, an essential threshold for any challenger after Sept. 11, 2001. The Republicans have long had an institutional edge on such issues.
 Mr. Kerry draws heavily on his experiences in Vietnam when he talks about the role of commander in chief, implicitly making the contrast with Mr. Bush, who served stateside during that war.
 ''I believe we need a president who knows the responsibilities of the commander in chief in the gut, and in the heart, and who keeps his word to the American people,'' Mr. Kerry said in Ohio recently. When it comes to deploying troops, he said, a president needs to ''be able to look into the eyes of parents, face to face, and tell them, 'I did everything in my power to avoid the loss of your son and daughter, but the threat to our country was so great that we had no choice.''' 
 Mr. Kerry also regularly offers a pledge that is strikingly similar to one by Mr. Bush in 2000, when he promised to restore ''the honor and dignity of the White House'' after the turmoil of the Clinton impeachment. Mr. Kerry declares: ''If it ever comes to the issue of war and peace, I will tell the truth to the American people. I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.''
 Unlike Mr. Clinton, a Southern Democrat who thought long and hard about how to reposition the national party, Mr. Kerry spends little time -- at least publicly -- on the pros and cons of liberal orthodoxy and the party's image. Many Democrats say he has no need to. ''Kerry is building on what Clinton did,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts.
 Asked last month where he hoped to lead the party, Mr. Kerry said, ''We are going to keep faith with the history of our party and the principles.'' Among those principles, he said, were ''understanding the problems and addressing the problems of the middle class that builds America and always has.''
 But Mr. Kerry said that in defending these principles, ''we need to keep our minds open'' to new solutions and new approaches. ''A great example is what we did for welfare reform in the 1990's,'' he said, alluding to the landmark legislation passed by a Republican Congress and signed by Mr. Clinton. ''I voted for it. I embraced it.'' He added: ''I don't want to be pigeonholed. I don't want our party to be pigeonholed.''
 One of Mr. Kerry's new ideas is his health care proposal. Unlike the ill-fated Clinton plan, the Kerry proposal would not try to reinvent the health care system, but would have thegovernment pick up the cost of the most expensive, catastrophic cases, which he argues would lower the cost of premiums with minimal government involvement. 
 Like any nominee moving toward a general election, Mr. Kerry is increasingly reaching out to voters in the middle. 
 He also increasingly talks about values. Attacking Mr. Bush's budget, Mr. Kerry said last week: ''Scripture tells you where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. Let me tell you where my heart is. My heart is with the working families, who built this country.''
 But even as he moves his appeal to the center, Mr. Kerry must stay aware of Ralph Nader on his left. And Republicans have fought and will continue to fight the idea that he will be strong on national security and centrist on taxing and spending.
 The platform, Democrats say, will try to be positive and highlight Mr. Kerry's core themes of strength at home and abroad while still presenting the case against Mr. Bush.
 In what may be the sternest test of Mr. Kerry's current message, he brought it before his colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus this week. ''He gave a short presentation, and he got a long, sustained standing ovation,'' said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota. Of course, another senator noted, it was also the day a Washington Post/ABC News poll was published showing Mr. Kerry with a decided edge in the race for the presidency.

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Parts Ways With a Chief

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
John J. Mack is leaving the Credit Suisse Group because of a clash with his board over strategic direction just three years after he was hired to clean the regulatory decks at the group's scandal-plagued investment banking division and guide it back to profitability.
 Mr. Mack, co-chief executive of Credit Suisse, petitioned the board in recent months to consider a merger with another financial institution to better compete in a rapidly consolidating industry, according to people close to the investment bank, Credit Suisse First Boston.
 The board refused and Mr. Mack was informed unexpectedly of its decision not to renew his contract, which expires on July 12, at a meeting yesterday in New York, said a person involved in the situation. 
 Oswald J. Grubel, who had shared the top title with Mr. Mack, becomes sole chief executive of the group. Succeeding Mr. Mack as chief executive of First Boston, the investment banking division, will be Brady W. Dougan, 44, who has been with the firm since 1990 and who now oversees the equities and fixed-income division.
 Mr. Mack, 60, has reached elite status as a fund-raiser for President Bush. He is also one of Wall Street's most highly regarded chief executives, having spent close to 30 years at Morgan Stanley before losing a power struggle. 
 Mr. Mack, an intense, highly competitive man, known as Mack the Knife, is considered unlikely to choose early retirement, despite having a net worth of more than $200 million. His new status among Wall Street's unemployed could unleash inquiries from financial institutions seeking a new leader.
 All the same, he leaves a mixed legacy at Credit Suisse.
 Mr. Mack is applauded by stock analysts and peers for reaching a series of agreements with regulators and improving the firm's profitability, and Credit Suisse had isolated investment banking successes, including the designation of co-underwriter of the Google public offering. But the firm was never able to secure a permanent spot alongside investment banking giants Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.
 Part of the dissension on the board was related to the dual chief executive structure, which never totally appealed to Mr. Grubel, who is based in Zurich, and Mr. Mack, who was in New York.
 ''We have no interest in pursuing a merger with another financial institution,'' Walter B. Kielholz, chairman of the board, said in a statement explaining Mr. Mack's departure.
 Mr. Kielholz dismissed concerns that Mr. Mack's exit could precipitate an exodus of senior bankers, many of whom are extremely loyal to Mr. Mack.
 ''I feel comfortable that management is rallying around Mr. Dougan,'' Mr. Kielholz said
 Mr. Dougan, who turns 45 in August, will be the youngest chief executive of a major Wall Street firm. 
 Mr. Dougan, considered an expert in derivatives, had close ties to Allen D. Wheat, the former chief executive at Credit Suisse, who was fired in the first wave of regulatory scandals. In fact, he was one of the few executives to survive the purge of the senior management when Mr. Mack joined the bank in 2001. 
 Along with pushing to merge the Credit Suisse group, Mr. Mack had been exploring the possibility of either selling or merging the investment bank, according to Credit Suisse bankers. He had made very preliminary inquiries with Deutsche Bank and Bank of America, according to people close to the discussions.
 ''The past three years have been among the most rewarding of my life,'' Mr. Mack said in a memorandum to his colleagues. ''I've been honored to have the opportunity to work with you, and will continue to cherish the many friendships I have forged here.''
 Mr. Mack replaced Mr. Wheat, who had presided over the bank's large buildup in personnel to take full advantage of the bull market in technology stocks. 
 When he arrived in 2001, Mr. Mack oversaw a radical restructuring, laying off legions of bankers and forcing many others who had rich contract guarantees to scrap them for lesser amounts. He guided the battered firm, which lost $1.2 billion in 2002, back to profitability.
 At Credit Suisse, Mr. Mack is perhaps best known for his tangled relationship with Frank P. Quattrone, the star technology banker at Credit Suisse, who was recently convicted of obstructing a federal investigation. 
 Mr. Quattrone left Morgan Stanley in 1996, having been rebuffed by Mr. Mack in an attempt to build a larger investment banking fief with his own research analysts, based in Silicon Valley in California.
 At Credit Suisse, Mr. Wheat allowed Mr. Quattrone to set up his own investment-banking unit, which became one of the dominant underwriters of technology stocks. 
 But it soon attracted the attention of regulators, who later said that Mr. Quattrone improperly pressured his research analysts and allocated hot public offerings to favored clients, a practice known as spinning.
 Despite his mandate to restore Credit Suisse's reputation, Mr. Mack did not make any overt moves to push out Mr. Quattrone. He did succeed in renegotiating the banker's pay, which peaked at $100 million a year. 
 Mr. Mack, the son of a Lebanese-American grocer from a small town in North Carolina, rose to prominence as a hard-charging bond trader at Morgan Stanley in the mid- 1980's. 
 Known for his ability to inspire loyalty, he combined savvy trading skills with a brash, earthy persona and became president in 1993.
 In 1997, together with Richard B. Fisher, he helped engineer the merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, then run by Philip Purcell, that combined Morgan's blue-chip clients with the more middle-market retail brokerage network of Dean Witter.
 A landmark merger, it set off a round of similar mergers among financial institutions.
 Mr. Mack left Morgan Stanley in 2001, having been outmaneuvered by Mr. Purcell, who insisted on remaining chief executive of the firm.
 When Mr. Mack took over at Credit Suisse, the firm was mired in losses and was the focus of federal and regulatory investigations into its banking practices.
 Mr. Mack took quick steps to restore the firm's reputation with regulators, hiring Gary Lynch, a former head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 In 2002, Credit Suisse reached a settlement with the commission and NASD, agreeing to pay $100 million to settle claims that it received extra large commissions from investors in exchange for allocations of hot public offerings.
 It was one of the first major settlements by an investment bank with regulators over conduct during the bubble and sent a broad message to the market that Mr. Mack was intent on reviving the bank's reputation.

HEADLINE: Army Used Speed and Might, Plus Cash, Against Shiite Rebel

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
In April, as festering resistance exploded into full-fledged rebellion, soldiers of the First Armored Division were given their final mission in Iraq: to wrest control of a string of southern towns from a radical Shiite militia intent on disrupting the scheduled transfer of sovereignty on June 30. 
 These American soldiers, some of whom had already left Iraq and others just short of leaving after a year in combat, would instead spend nearly three months in one of the most significant campaigns of the war.
 The division's operation against the militia of Moktada al-Sadr, a rebellious Shiite cleric, is already being studied by an Army struggling to learn the lessons of a war that continues to evolve even as the formal occupation of Iraq changes gears next week. 
 As described by top commanders in Iraq and senior policy makers in Washington, the campaign was a mix of military tactics, political maneuverings, media management and a generous dollop of cash for quickly rebuilding war-ravaged cities -- a formula that, if it survives the test of time, could become a model for future fighting against the persistent insurrections plaguing Iraq.
 But on the eve of the transfer of power, the question is whether the tactical successes the commanders are quick to claim have guaranteed a lasting strategic victory. 
 As the division's new date for departure approaches, Mr. Sadr remains at large. Despite an Iraqi arrest warrant for the murder of a rival cleric, he recently hinted that he would challenge the new government in the political arena. 
 When the First Armored Division got orders to mount its counterattack against the Sadr militia, one-fourth of its 30,000 soldiers and more than half of its 8,000 tanks, armored vehicles and artillery pieces had already left Iraq. The division, along with the Second Light Cavalry Regiment, also under its command, did an about-face, recalling troops, unpacking gear and receiving unwelcome orders to extend its stay by 90 days.
 ''I called together all my commanders, and I told them that we were going to demonstrate that a heavy force could be agile -- to put heavy and agile in the same sentence, a place where they had never been before,'' said Maj. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, commander of the First Armored Division, whose signature weapon is the 70-ton Abrams tank.
 ''And 15 hours later, from a standing start in Baghdad, we moved 170 kilometers down to Najaf, and were in contact with the enemy,'' General Dempsey said, referring to a distance of just over 100 miles.
 As quickly as the military spent its ammunition, though, it spent its money in an effort to heal some of the wounds it was inflicting, and those dealt by the militia as well.
 From the moment the Americans recaptured Kut, the first town where they reclaimed control, officers switched from military to civil operations. Having scattered the enemy, they pulled them back together and put them to work in an amusement park destroyed in the fight.
 ''These are young men who have been poisoned, unemployed, disenfranchised and very poorly led,'' General Dempsey said. ''We found a local tribal sheik who said he could corral them. We hired him to repair the amusement park, and he in turn hired these young men.''
 The example was repeated in Diwaniya and all across south-central Iraq, where General Dempsey spent several hundred thousand dollars to pay locals to remove rubble, rebuild roads and finance claims for damaged homes and businesses. 
 The campaign against the Sadr militia in south-central Iraq also had to be fought elsewhere -- inside military headquarters in Baghdad, in the command-and-control ''Tank'' at the Pentagon, inside the National Security Council at the White House and even at the United Nations, as senior commanders debated with civilian policy makers how best to counter this menacing militia presence that grew in the shadows of the American occupation.
 On one side were those who believed that Mr. Sadr could be sidelined, and that to attack him would only stoke support among his followers in Iraq and beyond its borders. This view was convincing to the uppermost level of commanders in Iraq, and certainly was the stance of Bush administration officials, especially after they heard the opinions of Iraq's own nascent leadership. On the other side were those, mostly field commanders, who argued that Mr. Sadr was a growing threat in advance of the June 30 transfer of sovereignty, and that eventually he would have to be arrested or eliminated to guarantee the future of a stable and democratic Iraq.
 Mr. Sadr had taken refuge in one of the shrines in Najaf, the holiest site in all of Shiite Islam, making a direct assault on him very difficult without inflicting large civilian casualties and possibly damaging the shrines.
 ''We never had an operation to go after Sadr inside the holy city,'' said Maj. Gen. John Sattler of the Marine Corps, director of American military operations for the Middle East. ''We did not want to endanger the holy shrines. We stayed clear of those.'' 
 So the plan focused on chipping away at the Sadr militia with controlled strikes, and working behind the scenes with more moderate Shiite clerics to isolate him and undercut his local support.
 ''The more he and his followers occupied towns like Najaf and Kufa, the more Iraqis were becoming fed up with the negative impact on their towns,'' General Sattler said. ''We felt very strongly he was being marginalized.''
 During this period, other Shiite leaders made public calls for Mr. Sadr to withdraw his forces from the holy cities and return the cities to police and civil defense units operating under American command.
 Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the senior American commander in Iraq, said this did not mean ceding territory. But others, even within the military, worried that the Americans had in effect allowed large parts of southern Iraq to slip out of their control.
 A number of field officers had argued -- as a few still do -- for a swift strike at Mr. Sadr himself.
 One senior administration official said that after June 30, the decision about how to deal with him ''is no longer up to us.'' The new Iraqi government will be making those calls.
 But back in early April, officers and policy makers were wondering whether America was about to lose Iraq. General Dempsey, whose troops had previously been in charge of securing Baghdad and its suburbs, planned a far-reaching campaign to seize control of provincial capital after provincial capital. 
 ''In Baghdad, our area of operations was 750 square kilometers, and now we were looking at 20,000 square kilometers,'' General Dempsey said. ''In Baghdad, we had strictly urban terrain, and now we were looking at a complex mix of rural, tribal and some urban elements. My immediate decision was that we really didn't need to control the white spaces between the urban areas.''
 ''What Moktada al-Sadr was trying to do was take a very narrow uprising -- it was not a broad-based popular uprising; it was narrow -- and demonstrate his ability to stand up to the coalition and in so doing broaden his support base,'' General Dempsey said. ''We decided that we can't allow that to happen. It had to be dealt with very aggressively, very rapidly, very decisively.''
 His division would retake Kut, Diwaniya, Karbala and then Kufa and Najaf, and in that order.
 He issued the order, and 19 hours later a brigade and 112 combat vehicles had made the 180-mile trip from Najaf to Kut.
 The Americans first had to cross a bridge that engineers said could withstand the weight of their tanks -- maybe.
 Instead, General Dempsey sent smaller, armor-plated Humvees of the Second Light Cavalry charging over the bridge into the militia forces. The heavier tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles sidestepped 46 miles north to a stronger bridge at Numaniya and then back south along the river bank to Kut, attacking simultaneously and catching the militia fighters in the pincer.
 Within 48 hours, the Americans recaptured the municipal building, the local TV station and bridges in and out of Kut. The Americans then took back Diwaniya, relieving a Spanish brigade that then withdrew after the new Spanish prime minister summoned them home, and securing a provincial capital that sits between two of the occupation forces' major supply routes.
 The offensive into Karbala presented the Americans with their first battle in a town with a shrine, as Sadr militiamen had taken over a holy site and the adjacent main thoroughfare. Seventy-two hours of intense fighting brought hundreds of Iraqi casualties, but the militia still could not be dislodged.
 ''We didn't want to take our combat vehicles right up to the shrine, so we conducted a feint,'' General Dempsey said. ''We ran a tank company team on each side of the ring road, north and south of the holy shrine.''
 The militiamen left the mosque area to confront the rolling and dismounted troops, not knowing that General Dempsey had put a pair of AC-130 gunships aloft to attack the exposed militiamen with devastating Gatling guns, cannons and howitzers.
 ''By the next day,'' General Dempsey said, ''they had disappeared.''
 It was important, though, to prevent the militiamen, wherever they were encountered, from shooting and escaping to fight another day. ''If you drive through an ambush, or get ambushed and seek shelter before returning fire, they will get away from you,'' the general said. ''This is not going to be something where they can get away with shooting and scooting.''
 Yet another goal was to discredit Mr. Sadr inside Iraq.
 Brig. Gen. Mark P. Hertling, a First Armored Division assistant commander whose responsibilities include information operations, said the Americans ''advertised'' what Mr. Sadr had done on radio and TV and with handbills and posters. The list of accusations included stealing money from shrines and mosques to finance his organization, running an illegal religious court in all the major cities, using amusement parks in Kut, Najaf and Karbala to store weapons, establishing illegal checkpoints to shake down travelers and ruining businesses during pilgrimage periods in Najaf and Karbala.
 Commanders wanted their offensive to be seen as ''deliberate, patient, sensitive and precise'' in its broader goals, in particular that the shrine in Najaf -- the holiest site in Shiite Islam -- would not be violated, General Hertling said. But other mosques would be hit if they were used as snipers' nests or arms depots, and soldiers and the news media accompanying them -- Arabs as well as British and American reporters -- were urged to document those militia violations of the laws of war. 
 On the battlefield, though, ''we wanted to be seen as rapid, overwhelming, lethal and relentless,'' General Hertling said. Reporters were brought on missions for that reason, too.
 The militia uprisings were set off in April after L. Paul Bremer III decided to crack down on Mr. Sadr by shutting down a popular Baghdad newspaper, Al Hawza, which American officials said had become a mouthpiece for Mr. Sadr's incendiary criticisms of the Americans. But Mr. Bremer's order caught American commanders by surprise.
 A few days later, allied forces arrested a cleric who was a senior aide to Mr. Sadr, Mustafa al-Yaqubi. Within 24 hours, Mr. Sadr decided to escalate his fight, and Sadr militiamen were rampaging all across south-central Iraq.
 The scale of the uprising caught Americans by surprise, but General Dempsey argued that the timing turned out to hurt Mr. Sadr in the end. ''The enemy made a strategic error in timing its uprising when it did,'' he said. ''If he had waited two more weeks, I was gone. First Armored would have been home. The American military never runs out of options. Other forces would have taken the mission. But these options all had a greater degree of risk.''
 General Dempsey lost soldiers during the Sadr campaign, soldiers who might otherwise be home alive if the division's tour had not been extended.
 Asked what he would say to those families, General Dempsey replied, ''I don't think they would expect me to say anything different than I would have to the family of a soldier who was killed in our first week here.''
 At the beginning of the uprising, commanders thought there were perhaps 200 hard-core militiamen in Kut and the same number in Diwaniya; that number is now down to under a dozen in each city. In Karbala, there were perhaps 750 armed Sadr supporters at the start, and there is no remaining evidence of the militia today. In the twin cities of Najaf and Kufa, commanders estimated about 2,000 militiamen at the start of the insurgency. Today, there are estimated to be 150 to 200 remaining, mostly inside the shrine in Najaf. They are contained, at least for now, though it is not clear whether they could regroup, since Mr. Sadr remains at large, and the arrest warrant against him was never executed.
 In April and May, ''Moktada al-Sadr could move with impunity, he and his militia, in virtually any of those places,'' General Dempsey said. ''Now he moves with impunity around the holy shrine in Najaf, and that's it.''

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS.

 BODY:
In years past, American liberals have had to settle for intellectual and moral leadership from the likes of John Dewey, Reinhold Niebuhr and Martin Luther King Jr. But now, a grander beacon has appeared on the mountaintop, and from sea to shining sea, tens of thousands have joined in the adulation.
 So it is worth taking a moment to study the metaphysics of Michael Moore. For Moore is not only a filmmaker; he is a man of ideas, and his work is based on an actual worldview. 
 Like Hemingway, Moore does his boldest thinking while abroad. For example, it was during an interview with the British paper The Mirror that Moore unfurled what is perhaps the central insight of his oeuvre, that Americans are kind of crappy.
 ''They are possibly the dumbest people on the planet . . . in thrall to conniving, thieving smug [pieces of the human anatomy],'' Moore intoned. ''We Americans suffer from an enforced ignorance. We don't know about anything that's happening outside our country. Our stupidity is embarrassing.''
 It transpires that Europeans are quite excited to hear this supple description of the American mind. And Moore has been kind enough to crisscross the continent, speaking to packed lecture halls, explicating the general vapidity and crassness of his countrymen. ''That's why we're smiling all the time,'' he told a rapturous throng in Munich. ''You can see us coming down the street. You know, 'Hey! Hi! How's it going?' We've got that big [expletive] grin on our face all the time because our brains aren't loaded down.''
 Naturally, the people from the continent that brought us Descartes, Kant and Goethe are fascinated by these insights. Moore's books have sold faster there than at home. No American intellectual is taken so seriously in Europe, save perhaps the great Chomsky. 
 Before a delighted Cambridge crowd, Moore reflected on the tragedy of human existence: ''You're stuck with being connected to this country of mine, which is known for bringing sadness and misery to places around the globe.'' In Liverpool, he paused to contemplate the epicenters of evil in the modern world: ''It's all part of the same ball of wax, right? The oil companies, Israel, Halliburton.''
 In the days after Sept. 11, while others were disoriented, Moore was able to see clearly: ''We, the United States of America, are culpable in committing so many acts of terror and bloodshed that we had better get a clue about the culture of violence in which we have been active participants.''
 This leads to Michael Moore's global plan of action. ''Don't be like us,'' he told a crowd in Berlin. ''You've got to stand up, right? You've got to be brave.''
 In an open letter to the German people in Die Zeit, Moore asked, ''Should such an ignorant people lead the world?'' Then he began to reflect on things economic. His central insight here is that the American economy, like its people, is pretty crappy, too: ''Don't go the American way when it comes to economics, jobs and services for the poor and immigrants. It is the wrong way.''
 In an interview with a Japanese newspaper, Moore helped citizens of that country understand why the United States went to war in Iraq: ''The motivation for war is simple. The U.S. government started the war with Iraq in order to make it easy for U.S. corporations to do business in other countries. They intend to use cheap labor in those countries, which will make Americans rich.''
 But venality doesn't come up when he writes about those who are killing Americans in Iraq: ''The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not 'insurgents' or 'terrorists' or 'The Enemy.' They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow -- and they will win.'' Until then, few social observers had made the connection between Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Paul Revere.
 So we have our Sartre. And the liberal grandees Arthur Schlesinger, Ted Sorenson, Tom Harkin and Barbara Boxer flock to his openings. In Washington, a Senate vote was delayed because so many Democrats wanted to see his movie. 
 The standards of socially acceptable liberal opinion have shifted. We're a long way from John Dewey.
 Perhaps inspired by Moore, I got a fact wrong in my previous column. Bill Clinton did not win the evangelical vote in 1992 and 1996. I had relied on a report that was later corrected.

HEADLINE: Growth for First Quarter Is Now Put at 3.9%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25 

 BODY:
The economy, weighed down by the trade deficit, grew at a slower pace in the first quarter of the year than initially estimated, the Commerce Department said Friday. The rate of 3.9 percent suggested a still-sturdy recovery but raised questions about the economy's strength in the months ahead. 
 The estimate for the gross domestic product had been 4.4 percent. The final quarter of 2003 grew at a 4.1 percent pace. The gross domestic product measures the value of all goods and services produced within the United States. 
 A main culprit in the downward revision was the trade deficit. That shaved seven-tenths of a percentage point off the first-quarter gross domestic product, which was twice as much as estimated a month ago. Consumers also spent more modestly, and businesses did not increase spending to buy equipment and to build inventories as much as previously thought. 
 The 3.9 percent growth rate, while the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2003, was still considered healthy, economists said. 
 In other economic news, sales of previously owned homes climbed in May to a record annual rate of 6.8 million units, a 2.6 percent increase from April's level, the National Association of Realtors reported Friday. Even with higher mortgage rates, home sales are expected to set records for all of 2004, economists said. 
 In another report, the mood of consumers brightened in June, according to the closely watched University of Michigan report on consumer sentiment. The report showed a reading of 95.6, compared with the 95.2 in the preliminary report on June sentiment and the 90.2 for May. The index was 94.2 in April. 
 Estimates for economic growth in the second quarter ranged from a rate of 3.5 percent to just more than 4.5 percent. Even on the low end of that scale, the rate would be enough to generate jobs, analysts said. 
 Growth would be stronger if not for the expectation that higher energy prices will crimp consumer and business spending, they said. Some economists said the lower reading on first-quarter gross domestic product raised questions about business investment and the nation's trade picture, factors that can affect the vigor of the economy in the months ahead. 
 ''It doesn't look like investment spending will be all that great in the second half of this year,'' said Richard Yamarone, economist at the Argus Research Corporation. ''I think corporate chieftains are a little reluctant to invest.'' 
 Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, said he was forecasting second-quarter gross domestic product at around a 5 percent growth rate; in light of the first quarter's downward revision, however, he believes the rate will be closer to 4.5 percent. 
 Still, with the economy growing solidly, analysts widely expect the Federal Reserve to increase short-term interest rates for the first time in four years when they meet next week. The Fed's benchmark rate is at a 46-year low of 1 percent. Most economists are forecasting an increase of one-quarter percentage point. 
 An inflation gauge tied to the gross domestic product report showed that core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose at a 2 percent rate in the first quarter, up from a 1.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. That suggests that inflation, while still low by historical standards, is clearly on the rise.

HEADLINE: 2 Koreas Sidestep U.S. to Forge Pragmatic Links

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: INCHON, South Korea, June 24 

 BODY:
Wielding wrenches on a rainy morning, South Korean marines methodically dismantled a wall of 48 olive-green loudspeakers that only days earlier had been blaring news and pop music to sentries and rice farmers working on the North Korean bank of the Han River.
 On Saturday, the marines will start removing a 20-foot computer-controlled sign board that blinked news flashes across the demilitarized zone.
 After half a century of cross-border propaganda, all is now quiet on South Korea's northern front. By Aug. 15, the hundreds of propaganda signs and loudspeakers are to be entirely removed from both sides of the inter-Korean border.
 The Koreas are entering more than a summer of detente. Quietly ignoring Bush administration efforts to isolate North Korea, South Korea has become North Korea's largest source of aid, trade and tourism. It is also North Korea's most consistent diplomatic advocate. 
 Even though the two Koreas are still technically at war, their athletes will march again under one ''Unification'' flag at the Athens Olympics in August.
 While older people and conservative politicians get nervous each time the United States announces a troop withdrawal, as it did earlier this month, younger South Koreans typically cheer. To them, and increasingly to the more liberal members of the South Korean government, North Korea is no longer seen as a military threat.
 The conciliatory stance causes uneasiness -- and confusion -- in Washington, where the White House tries to keep a united front with South Korea and Japan to induce North Korea to drop its nuclear weapons program. 
 The latest round of talks, which also include China and Russia, are to end Saturday in Beijing. 
 ''You could call it engagement, you could call it neutrality,'' said Victor D. Cha, a Washington-based Korea specialist visiting Seoul this week. ''We don't know what South Korea's grand design is.'' 
 Outside the peninsula, North Korea is a pariah, a Stalinist dictatorship that runs a string of harsh labor camps, and that allowed one million people to starve to death in the 1990's rather than accept foreign aid. Its missiles and artillery have long threatened rapid annihilation of Seoul, a megalopolis that holds nearly half the nation's 48 million people. 
 But in South Korea, where years of confrontation with North Korea have yielded little progress toward greater security, a hear-no-evil, see-no-evil policy took root five years ago under the previous president, Kim Dae Jung. Mr. Kim's ''sunshine policy'' was devoted both to avoiding a second Korean war and to diminishing the huge social and economic gap between the neighbors.
 Today, South Korea's central bank is the best source of statistics on North Korea's economy. South Korea's Agriculture Ministry is drawing up plans to revive North Korea's failed farm sector. Other ministries are working to rehabilitate the North's electric power system and railroads. 
 On the information front, South Korea's Unification Ministry is planning to start broadcasting North Korean news programs next month on the ministry's Web site. Backed by Seoul's new, liberal-controlled Parliament, Unification Minister Chung Se Hyun said Thursday that he might allow southerners to travel in July to the capital, Pyongyang, for the 10th anniversary of the death of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founder.
 ''South Koreans have gone the full circle,'' said C. Kenneth Quinones, director of the Korea Peninsula Program at International Action, a Washington research group. ''Ten years ago, anyone who went north was painted pink. Today, anyone who does not go north is not a real Korean.''
 For years, under a military dictatorship and the conservative government that succeeded it, contacts with the North were seen as virtually treasonous, despite the longing of many ordinary Koreans who had relatives and ties in the north. A new generation of South Koreans also came of age with no memories of the horrors of the Korean War.
 To avoid offending North Korea, government officials rarely remind the public about the military threat from the North, so younger South Koreans come up with their own theories about the military alliance with the United States. Many believe the United States and Japan simply want to keep the Koreas divided.
 In ''The Third Scenario,'' a novel by Kim Jin Myung, the United States centralizes its Asian military command in Japan, concentrates troops on Guam, then provokes a full-scale war between the two Koreas. The goals are to keep Korea weak and to increase sales for American weapons manufacturers. In the three weeks since the book went on sale, it has sold 1.6 million copies.
 ''They have gotten themselves in a position where defending the alliance will offend the North Koreans,'' Mr. Cha, a Georgetown University professor, said of Seoul's silence. 
 Whatever South Korea's designs, they do not include unification, at least not anytime soon. Instead, South Korea wants to nudge North Korea down the road toward a free market and economic development, postponing the day when a Germany-size reunification bill will come due.
 With efforts to destabilize the North completely out of fashion, relations are steadily improving. Bilateral trade, for instance, soared to $724 million last year, from $400 million in 2000. 
 Starting this summer, North and South Korean ships plan to trade directly for the first time, as each country opens seven ports to ships from the other. In the fall, a South Korean-run industrial park is to open with 15 factories in Kaesong, about 15 miles north of the border.
 On the eastern side of Korea, day trips are to start July 3 across the demilitarized zone to Mount Kumgang, a North Korean tourists' enclave. Expecting a flood of tourists, Hyundai Asan, the tour operator, is devising ''smart cards'' to speed tourists through border controls.
 Since Mount Kumgang opened to foreign visitors in 1999, nearly 700,000 South Koreans have made the tour. Critics call Mount Kumgang a Potemkin village, where North Korea collects $100 from each visitor and minimizes contacts between citizens of the two countries.
 But even outside this enclave, 15,280 South Koreans visited North Korea last year, double the number in 2000. North Korea allowed only 1,023 citizens to visit South Korea last year, but that also doubled the level of 2000.
 Mindful of the staggering cost of unifying the two Germanys, South Korea has made North Korea its primary recipient of foreign aid.
 ''When a rich brother goes to visit a poorer brother, the rich brother should not go empty-handed,'' Mr. Kim, the former president, told The Financial Times last week when asked why Seoul surreptitiously paid $100 million to facilitate the summit meeting. ''We wanted to provide $100 million of support. But there was no legal way to do it.''
 Most aid appears to be in the open.
 Last week, for example, a South Korean charity group opened a 100-bed children's hospital in Pyongyang. The group, which brought 11 South Korean children to the opening, is also building a dairy plant in Pyongyang.
 This relaxed atmosphere reassures foreign investors and keeps South Korean flight capital at a low level.
 ''There is no fear here -- that is the striking change,'' Selig S. Harrison, an American academic who has been visiting the Koreas for decades, said in Seoul on Wednesday. 
 At the Jaejok Peak border post, it is hard to quantify the impact the loudspeakers and sign boards had on the northern side of the Han River. Over the last five years, the only known defector in this region was a North Korean Army officer who floated across the river in a raft made of empty plastic jugs.
 As the soldiers unbolted the loudspeakers, a visitor peering through field binoculars could only imagine what impact the information effort had had on the minds of seven farmers who could be seen, dressed in black and toiling in a field, cut off from the world by more than coils of rusty barbed wire on the crest of a muddy riverbank.

HEADLINE: Dithering As Others Die

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ALONG THE SUDAN-CHAD BORDER 

 BODY:
The ongoing genocide in Darfur is finally, fortunately, making us uncomfortable. At this rate, with only 250,000 more deaths it will achieve the gravitas of the Laci Peterson case.
 Hats off to Colin Powell and Kofi Annan, who are both traveling in the next few days to Darfur. But the world has dithered for months already. Unless those trips signal a new resolve, many of the Darfur children I've been writing about over the last few months will have survived the Janjaweed militia only to die now of hunger or diarrhea. 
 I've had e-mail from readers who are horrified by the slaughter, but who also feel that Africa is always a mess and that there's not much we can do. So let me address the cynics.
 Look, I'm sure it's terrible in Darfur. But lots of places are horrific, and we can't help everyone. Why obsess about Sudan?
 The U.N. describes Darfur as the No. 1 humanitarian crisis in the world today. The U.S. Agency for International Development estimates that at best 320,000 more people will still die of hunger and disease this year -- or significantly more if we continue to do nothing.
 Moreover, apart from our obligation to act under the Genocide Convention, acquiescence only encourages more genocide -- hence the question attributed to Hitler, ''Who today remembers the Armenian extermination?''
 Haven't we invaded enough Muslim countries?
 The U.S. is not going to invade Sudan. That's not a plausible option.
 But we can pass a tough U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing troops, as well as more support for African peacekeepers. If Germany, France and Spain don't want to send troops to Iraq, then let them deploy in Darfur. And we must publicly condemn the genocide.
 What good is a speech in the U.N.? Why would Sudan listen?
 Governments tend to be embarrassed about exterminating minorities. In Sudan, a bit of publicity about Darfur coupled with a written statement from President Bush led Sudan to agree to a cease-fire in April and to improve access for aid agencies. More publicity prompted it to promise to disband the Janjaweed raiders.
 Sudan lies and wriggles out of its promises, but its genocide is still calibrated to the international reaction. Likewise, it is still denying visas and blocking supplies for emergency relief, but pressure has led it to improve access.
 So, Mr. Bush, if a single written statement will do so much good, why won't you let the word ''Darfur'' pass your lips? Why the passivity in the face of evil? You could save tens of thousands of lives by making a forceful speech about Darfur. Conversely, your refusal to do so is costing tens of thousands of lives.
 If the Sudanese were notorious pirates of American videotapes, if they were sheltering Mullah Omar, you'd be all over them. So why not stand up just as forcefully to genocide?
 Mr. Bush seems proud of his ''moral clarity,'' his willingness to recognize evil and bluntly describe it as such. Well, Darfur reeks of evil, and we are allowing it to continue.
 What can ordinary Americans do?
 Yell! Mr. Bush and John Kerry have been passive about Darfur because voters are. If citizens contact the White House or their elected representatives and demand action, our leaders will be happy to follow. 
 Readers can also contribute to one of the many aid agencies saving lives in Darfur. (I've listed some at www.nytimes.com/kristofresponds, Posting 489.)
 Be realistic. We don't have our national interest at stake in Darfur.
 But we do. Sudan's chaos is destabilizing surrounding countries, especially Chad, which is an increasing source of oil for us. Moreover, when states collapse into chaos, they become staging grounds for terrorism and for diseases like ebola and polio (both have broken out recently in Sudan).
 In any case, America is a nation that has values as well as interests. We betrayed those values when we ignored past genocides, and we are betraying them again now.
 In my last three columns, I wrote about Magboula Muhammad Khattar, a 24-year-old woman struggling to keep her children alive since her parents and husband were killed by the Janjaweed. Each time I visited the tree she lives under, she shared with me the only things she had to offer: a smile and a bowl of brackish water.
 Is a cold shoulder all we have to offer in return?

HEADLINE: Union and N.H.L. Spar Over Goalie-Pad Rule

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., June 25 

 BODY:
An effort to change N.H.L. rules to increase offense was already losing momentum because general managers feared unexpected results from radical reform.
 Now the campaign -- and, specifically, a proposal to reduce the size of goalie pads -- has become complicated by an objection from the N.H.L. Players Association, which is also debating the league about a new collective bargaining agreement.
 ''In terms of moving forward, I want to slow things down a little bit,'' Commissioner Gary Bettman said Friday after meeting with general managers on the day before the entry draft. 
 ''The union objected to the reduction of goalie pads. I'm not looking to pick any fights with the union.'' 
 Bettman spoke of a rule to reduce the width of leg pads to 10 inches from 12. The union filed a grievance this month objecting to the move as a health and safety issue and said such a change, without consent of the union, would be an unfair labor practice.
 While not conceding that the union had the right to object, Bettman said the proposal would be part of collective bargaining talks. 
 The agreement ends Sept. 15. Without a new deal, next season could be delayed or canceled by a lockout.
 In a statement released by the N.H.L.P.A. on Friday, Ian Pulver, associate counsel of the union, said: ''By unilaterally attempting to implement changes, the league tried to circumvent the C.B.A. and labor laws. In response, the N.H.L.P.A. filed grievances and an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board.
 ''In a recent settlement of these matters, the league has abandoned its attempt to unilaterally implement changes to goaltender equipment and has agreed to address and resolve these changes through collective bargaining.''
 Colin Campbell, executive vice president and director of hockey operations for the league, expressed irritation at the development. 
 ''I was hoping that a lot of these things would have been separate from the economic issues,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, it's been merged, washed in. It's frustrating. It's bogged down now.'' 
 In Saturday's draft, primarily of 18-year-olds, the top choice is expected to be Aleksandr Ovechkin, a left wing from Dynamo Moscow of Russia. 
 The Washington Capitals hold the top pick. The Pittsburgh Penguins are second, and Yevgeny Malkin, a center, also of Russia, is considered the second-best prospect.
 The top American is thought to be Al Montoya, a goalie from the University of Michigan. 
 The reduction of goalie pads is one of several ideas in circulation after the average number of goals a game fell to 5.1 last season, the lowest in half a century. Other ideas include moving the nets back two feet toward the boards -- to 11 feet from 13 -- and forbidding goalies to touch the puck behind the goal lines.
 The rule against goalies handling the puck would most radically affect the game because modern goalies have become adept at it. Although the union has not filed a grievance against this idea, many executives have had reservations about it because it would also change the way forwards and defensemen play.
 Bob Gainey, general manager of the Montreal Canadiens, said Friday that he was not opposed to reducing goalie involvement behind the goal lines. But he said it might be risky to pass such a rule without knowing its unintended consequences. ''Why don't we wait and let some of the silt settle to the bottom?'' he said.
 Lou Lamoriello, general manager of the Devils, said some of his colleagues had changed their feelings about the rule regarding goalies' puck handling. His goalie, Martin Brodeur, is one of the best in the league at it. ''Right now, it's status quo,'' Lamoriello said of the rule. ''It appears it will probably stay the same.''
 Gainey said one rule change causing the most debate would allow whistles to stop play for icing immediately after the puck is shot over the goal line from the other side of the center red line by an attacking team. Currently, a player on the defending team must touch the puck before the whistle blows. This leads to races between players and increases the risk of injury. Icing is called automatically in international hockey. 
 Gainey said he supported the change because the consequences could be seen in hockey outside the N.H.L. But he said general managers were divided on the idea.

HEADLINE: A Quiet Revolt Puts Costly Journals on Web

BYLINE: By PAMELA BURDMAN

 BODY:
When Dr. Miguel Nicolelis, a neurobiologist at Duke University, decided to release a groundbreaking study in an upstart online journal, his colleagues were flabbergasted. The research, demonstrating how brain implants enabled monkeys to operate a robotic arm, was a shoo-in for acceptance in premier journals like Nature or Science. 
 ''Usually you want to publish your best work in well-established journals to have the widest possible penetration,'' Dr. Nicolelis said. ''My idea was the opposite. We need to open up the dissemination of scientific results.'' The journal Dr. Nicolelis chose -- PLoS Biology, a publication of the Public Library of Science -- aims to do just that by putting peer-reviewed scientific papers online free, at the Web site www.plosbiology.org. 
 The high subscription cost of prestigious peer-reviewed journals has been a running sore point with scholars, whose tenure and prominence depend on publishing in them. But since the Public Library of Science, which was started by a group of prominent scientists, began publishing last year, this new model has been gaining attention and currency within academia.
 More than money and success is at stake. Free and widespread distribution of new research has the potential to redefine the way scientific and intellectual developments are recorded, circulated and preserved for years to come. 
 ''Society pays for science,'' said Dr. Nicolelis, whose article in the October issue of PLoS got worldwide attention. ''We have the technology, we have the expertise. Why is it that the only thing that has remained the same for 50 years is the way we publish our results? The whole system needs overhaul.''
 At the big-sticker end are publications like The Journal of Comparative Neurology, for which a one-year institutional subscription has a list price of $17,995. Access to Brain Research goes for $21,269, around the price of a Toyota Camry XLE.
 According to the Association of Research Libraries, journal prices went up 215 percent from 1986 to 2003, while the consumer price index rose 63 percent. 
 Though the highest-priced journals are in the sciences, libraries have had to offset those price increases by buying fewer books, often in other disciplines like literature and the humanities, association officials and librarians at the University of California said. 
 For those plotting end runs around for-profit publishers, a prime target is the Amsterdam-based Elsevier, which publishes some 1,800 journals in science, medicine and technology, including Brain Research. 
 ''Elsevier doesn't write a single article,'' said Dr. Lawrence H. Pitts, a neurosurgeon at the University of California at San Francisco and chairman of the faculty senate of the 10-campus system. ''Faculty write the articles for them, faculty review the articles for them and faculty mostly edit the journals for them, and then we get to buy the journals back from a company that makes a very large profit.''
 Similar sentiments motivated the editors and entire editorial board, 27 people in all, of Elsevier's Journal of Algorithms to defect en masse recently to start a nonprofit competitor, ACM -- Transactions on Algorithms -- said David S. Johnson, one of the editors.
 Elsevier's managing director, John Regazzi, says the problem is not Elsevier's prices, but tight university budgets that can't meet the increasing volume of research worthy of publication. ''Very few of our customers pay list price across all of their collections,'' he said. ''If you look at the full cost of what an institution pays and you look at the number of downloads by users of the system, you're basically looking at $2 to $3 articles. We have a wide range of options for how universities can decide to subscribe.'' The company's pretax profit for the last three years has been between 30 and 34 percent, Mr. Regazzi said. 
 But more and more academics are viewing traditional publishers as obstacles to wide dissemination of studies paid for by public monies. Several open access alternatives are being hotly debated in academic online discussion groups and in the mainstream science press. The criticism even extends to some nonprofit publications, like the journal Science, which nearly tripled prices for its largest subscribers over the last two years. 
 Late last year, two scientists at the University of California at San Francisco called for a global boycott by authors and editors of six molecular biology journals published by Elsevier. They timed the campaign to coincide with the moment that the the University of California system was renegotiating its contract with the company.
 ''The mission and mandate of scientific publishing is to provide a formal record of scientific discovery, not to make publishing companies rich or editors famous,'' said one of the organizers, Keith R. Yamamoto, a prominent microbiologist and the vice dean for research. 
 Since University of California professors write, vet and edit a significant portion of Elsevier's wares, a deal was struck. The public university system reduced its bulk cost for online and print access to about 1,200 journals from $10.3 million last year to just $7.7 million annually for the next five years, according to published reports confirmed by Daniel Greenstein, the librarian of the university system. Other prestigious, but smaller universities are pursuing a different strategy.
 ''We have been cutting Elsevier journals and other for-profit journals as their prices have risen higher than inflation,'' said Michael Keller, the university librarian at Stanford. ''The result is a fairly limited list -- 400 Elsevier subscriptions.''
 PLoS became a publisher last year following a failed campaign to persuade journals to open up articles within six months of publication, said Michael B. Eisen, a computational biologist at Berkeley. Mr. Eisen is a co-founder of PLoS, with the biologist Dr. Patrick O. Brown of Stanford and Dr. Harold E. Varmus, a Nobel laureate who is chief executive of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and former director of the National Institutes of Health. 
 The editors of PLoS follow normal peer review procedures. For revenue, they rely on author fees of up to $1,500 per article (typically drawn from research monies), voluntary university memberships, and grants. Although these voluntary university memberships can run into the thousands, Mr. Eisen said, the advantage is unlimited public access to priceless intellectual heritage. 
 But Mr. Keller of the Stanford libraries, who produces the online versions of Science and about 360 other nonprofit journals through Stanford's HighWire Press, argues that the voluntary memberships are just subscriptions in disguise.
 Dr. Nicolelis's appearance in PloS Biology's debut issue helped vindicate this new model. PLoS has since attracted papers from leading lights in science like Dr. Robert Sapolsky, a Stanford researcher and a winner of a MacArthur ''genius'' award. Wired magazine also favored the founders with an award in April for ''cracking the spine of the science cartel.''
 Traditional publishers hint that despite their new cachet, open access publications aren't sustainable in the long run. PLoS Biology and the new PLoS Medicine, due out this fall, are heavily subsidized by grants.
 Dr. Alan I. Leshner, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, says his publication, Science, already coping with the loss of print subscribers and advertisers, would have to charge authors $10,000 an article to survive in the open access mode. He also noted that revenues from Science -- which was started by Thomas Edison -- support some of association's programs, including one to provide free access to scientists in the developing world. 
 ''I agree with the motivation,'' Dr. Leshner said, but added, ''We just can't throw away a business model developed by Thomas Edison in 1880 based on 'Trust me, it will work.' ''
 But to others, old models are precisely the problem. ''Surely the combination of uncertainty and hope associated with this unproved model is vastly superior to the certainty and hopelessness that surrounds the current and failed commercial one,'' Mr. Greenstein of the University of California system wrote as part of a running debate about open access publishing on nature.com.
 The pressure is beginning to have an effect. More publishers have begun opening their archives 6 to 12 months after publication. Molecular Biology of the Cell, published by the American Society for Cell Biology, now opens up its archives after two months, and as its editor-in-chief, Mr. Yamamoto hopes to convert the journal to open access soon. Even Elsevier made a recent concession to university libraries that are moving into digital publishing and archiving, offering blanket permission for authors to post their journal articles on their own institutions' Web sites.
 ''We're watching open access very carefully,'' Mr. Regazzi said. ''We're trying to learn from it.''

HEADLINE: Bernard Russell Seidman, 84, Advocate for Social Security

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Bernard Russell Seidman, at the forefront of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s efforts to improve Social Security and pension benefits, died on Thursday at his home in Falls Church, Va., the A.F.L.-C.I.O. announced. He was 84.
 For decades, Mr. Seidman worked closely with George Meany, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, serving as its representative in Europe, as an economist for the federation and later as an adviser on pensions, health care and Social Security. 
 Bernard Russell Seidman was born on Sept. 22, 1919, in Brooklyn. After he graduated from Townsend Harris High School in 1934, he attended City College. He transferred to the University of Wisconsin, earning a bachelor's degree in economics in 1938 and a master's degree in economics in 1941. 
 Mr. Seidman, a pacifist and socialist, was a conscientious objector during World War II and as alternative service he helped build the Blue Ridge Parkway.
 After the war, he became assistant executive secretary of the Workers Defense League. There, he met Annabel Henry, whom he married in 1948. She died last year. 
 In 1948 he joined the A.F.L.'s staff, working as an economist in its research department until 1962.
 From that year until 1966, he was the federation's European representative. 
 From 1958 to 1976 he was a member of the American delegation to the International Labor Organization.
 From 1966 to 1990, when he retired from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., he headed the federation's Social Security department.
 In retirement he was a founder of Save Our Security, one of the earliest groups to oppose privatizing Social Security.
 He is survived by three daughters, Margaret Seidman of Fairfax, Va., Joan Seidman Welsh of Arlington, Va., and Elizabeth Seidman Garaufis of Queens, N.Y.; two brothers, Lloyd G. Seidman and Benedict S. Seidman, both of New York; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Sulfur-Laden Fuels Contribute to Growing Pollution Problem

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 23 

 BODY:
With toxic lead finally disappearing from most of the world's gasoline, a new air pollution fight is emerging around the globe over how much sulfur to allow in fuel. Rapidly developing countries like China, India, Thailand, Mexico and Brazil, where ownership and use of cars and trucks is soaring, are on the front lines. 
 High levels of sulfur contamination occur naturally in some crude oil, especially from the Mideast and Russia. This ''sour'' oil is ordinarily harder to sell and fetches a lower price than ''sweet'' low-sulfur crude, because it is more difficult to refine and because environmental laws in the United States and Europe already impose tight ceilings on sulfur in fuel, limits that are set to grow still tighter over the next decade.
 But this year, oil producers are pumping and selling all the oil they can to meet surging demand, and the extra oil they are able to bring to market is, to a great extent, high in sulfur. With sweet crude commanding the highest prices, many refineries in China and elsewhere are buying cheaper sour crude, and turning it into fuels that may contain many times more sulfur than the gasoline and diesel sold in the United States or Europe. 
 Environmentalists call sulfur the world's biggest single contributor to air pollution. It forms noxious gases like sulfur oxides, and it causes diesel engines to spew more soot. And high-sulfur fuel quickly ruins the catalytic converters installed on new gasoline-powered cars, defeating one of the main efforts in countries like China to cut down on the harm that vehicles do to air quality. 
 ''Sulfur is definitely the lead of the future,'' said Robert Cox, the fuels manager at the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association, a London-based trade group supported by oil companies. 
 The oil industry has called on automakers to develop new catalytic converters that are more sulfur tolerant, while acknowledging that sulfur is a significant problem, especially in developing countries with limited budgets. Mr. Cox said that in September or October the trade association would issue its recommendations for what levels of sulfur are attainable for countries at various levels of economic development, adding that ''sulfur has got to be the next issue.''
 The problem is especially acute in China, where car sales have been rising by close to 80 percent a year, creating huge traffic jams and contributing to some of the world's worst air pollution. At the same time, Chinese refineries have emerged as the world's most aggressive buyers of high-sulfur crude oil.
 ''They really need to ratchet down very quickly on their emissions standards, or their cities are going to become unbearable,'' said Michael P. Walsh, a former top American air-quality regulator who now works as a consultant to the Chinese government and other developing countries on air-quality issues.
 The World Bank has just released a report contending that developing countries should reduce sulfur levels as quickly as possible, though not necessarily to American and European levels. Instead, each country should set its sulfur ceiling based on the emissions-control equipment, if any, that has been installed in local vehicles, said Todd Johnson, a senior environmental specialist at the bank who helped write the report.
 The problem in China goes far beyond cars, Mr. Johnson said, noting that coal-burning power plants emit large quantities of sulfur as well. 
 Most auto industry executives in China are reluctant to discuss the problem publicly, because the government controls the refining industry. Still, they complain privately that the gasoline is so bad in parts of the country that the modern engines and pollution-control equipment now being introduced in cars in China will not run properly on it.
 ''They are very, very seriously damaged -- the malfunction almost entirely stops the function of the catalytic converter, and that doesn't just increase the emissions, it also hurts fuel economy,'' said an official for one multinational automaker.
 Chinese government officials say they are trying to address the issue. ''This is a major problem for the gasoline,'' said Zhang Jianwei, the top civil servant at the China Automotive Technology and Research Center, a government agency that drafts automobile regulations.
 Mr. Zhang said his agency was beginning a yearlong nationwide program to test gasoline at service stations and assess its effect on vehicles and their emissions. The results will be submitted to the powerful State Development and Reform Commission. 
 Automakers doing business in China are so concerned about what sulfur is doing to their cars that a broad coalition, including multinationals like General Motors, Ford, Hyundai and Toyota and domestic manufacturers like First Auto Works and the Dongfeng Automobile Company, is donating money to the agency to pay for the study. BASF, a major chemical company, announced on Wednesday that it would set up a separate fuel-testing program with a unit of the State Environmental Protection Administration.
 Foreign and domestic automakers in China are required by regulations to send a sample car of each new model for emissions testing by a third agency, the China Automotive Technology and Research Center, at a cluster of brick buildings in the aging industrial port of Tianjin in northeastern China. The agency has copied the emissions test procedures used in Europe. But to get the vehicles to pass the test, the agency must buy special low-sulfur fuel from the only gas station in Tianjin that sells it, Mr. Zhang said.
 Sulfur is not the only problem with the country's fuel supply, the automakers say. Honda now recommends that gasoline filters in its cars be replaced twice as often in China as elsewhere, to catch the sludge sometimes found in Chinese gasoline. Even with that precaution, the company worries about the harm done to its engines and their pollution-control equipment by burning Chinese gasoline.
 ''Because of the quality of the fuel, the deterioration level will be rather high compared to other countries,'' said Koji Kadowaki, who just retired from his post as president of Guangzhou Honda.
 Chinese ceilings for sulfur in fuel are considerably more lax than those in the United States or Europe, and the automakers say that some of the gasoline and diesel in the country exceeds even those limits. But it is not clear who is producing these fuels.
 Evan Jia, a spokesman for Sinopec, China's biggest refining company, said that it was aggressively importing high-sulfur oil because it is $1 a barrel cheaper than sweet crude. The added cost to Sinopec of removing sulfur in the refining process to meet Chinese national standards is as little as 10 cents a barrel, he said, and all of the gasoline and diesel it sells meets those standards.
 Mr. Jia said that the company was investing heavily to improve its ability to remove sulfur and that it expected to be able to meet highly strict new sulfur standards that the cities of Beijing and Shanghai plan to impose soon. But while these cities and several others already have somewhat stricter rules than the national standards, the benefits have been limited, because of widespread smuggling of cheaper high-sulfur fuel from smaller cities and rural areas, Chinese environmental experts say.
 Mr. Jia acknowledged that some gasoline and diesel in China has very high levels of sulfur, but he said that it was produced by small refineries owned by private companies or local governments, and not by Sinopec or the other main state-owned refiner, PetroChina. 
 A PetroChina spokesman said that the company imported very little oil and ran its refineries instead mainly on the naturally low-sulfur crude it produces itself in the oil fields of northeast China. The country was self-sufficient in oil until the mid-1990's. 
 When the Chinese economy boomed and demand started to outrun supply, China initially imported only sweet crude, buying from Indonesia and from Oman, the one country in the Middle East with output that is mostly low in sulfur. But as China has outstripped Japan to become the world's second-largest oil consumer after the United States, it has come to rely heavily on oil from other Mideast countries with much higher sulfur content, according to figures from the International Energy Agency in Paris.
 The big question mark for China and other developing countries will be the cost of building better refineries. Investment bankers estimate that China alone will have to spend as much as $10 billion in the next few years to satisfy rising demand for fuel and meet tighter sulfur standards.
 ''Reducing sulfur in fuel is becoming probably the major battle'' in air pollution, said Kelly Sims Gallagher, the director of the Energy Technology Innovation Project at Harvard. ''That's going to require a major investment.''

HEADLINE: MCI to Cut 2,000 More Jobs And Consider Curbs in Service

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Stephen Labaton, in Washington, contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
MCI said yesterday that it planned to eliminate 2,000 jobs at four call centers as it struggles to compete in the long-distance phone market.
 MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, may also be preparing to stop marketing phone services to some residential customers, according to some officials in Congress and at the Federal Communications Commission. Its rival, AT&T Corporation, announced a similar move earlier this week. 
 The 2,000 jobs to be eliminated come on top of 13,200 other job cuts announced by MCI earlier this year. MCI will close call centers in Colorado and Kansas and reduce the work force at centers in South Carolina and Iowa. The company has been cutting costs to compensate for declines in long-distance rates and intensified competition for customers.
 ''Telecom market realities, including industry, economic and regulatory conditions, require MCI to take these actions as part of its ongoing cost reduction effort,'' said Peter Lucht, a spokesman for MCI. 
 The company has said it may leave markets or reduce services in response to a court decision that allows the Bell companies to charge long-distance competitors higher fees to use their local networks. 
 MCI's announcement comes just two days after AT&T cut its revenue and income forecasts for 2004. AT&T also said it would stop marketing its services to residents in seven states.
 AT&T attributed its action to the Bush administration's refusal to challenge the court decision that allows the Bells to raise their access fees. MCI may take similar steps, but it may want to attract less attention in doing so, F.C.C. officials and members of Congress said. 
 Other critics of the decision, however, are not so coy. Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina and the ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, accused the Bush administration and Michael K. Powell, the F.C.C. chairman, of reducing competition in local phone markets.
 The job cuts at MCI, Mr. Hollings said, ''are likely the first of many that will flow from this administration's calculated decision to cede residential markets to the incumbent Bell monopolies.''
 ''Less competition means job losses today,'' he added, ''and higher prices after the November election.''

HEADLINE: Cheney Owns Up to Profanity Incident And Says He 'Felt Better Afterwards'

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: SIOUX CITY, Iowa, June 25 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney, long portrayed by his aides as unperturbed by partisan attacks, admitted Friday that he ''probably'' cursed at a senior Democratic senator this week, said he did not regret it and added that he ''felt better afterwards.''
 Then Mr. Cheney quickly reverted to type, flying here for a tightly scripted campaign rally where he never mentioned the incident in a speech on terrorism and the economy to an adoring Republican crowd.
 The revelation, if that is what it was, that Mr. Cheney is comfortable with the use of four-letter words and is willing to direct them at political opponents, was the latest in a string of developments over the past few weeks that have put the vice president squarely in the spotlight. And as he takes on a higher political profile, it is hard to tell who is happier, Republicans or Democrats. 
 At the rally here, Mr. Cheney was immediately forgiven by some members of the invited crowd for swearing at Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont on the Senate floor on Tuesday. It showed him, they said, to be a real person who is forceful in the face of unwarranted criticism.
 ''It tells me Cheney is very human,'' said Dennis Lumphrey, a hospital worker from Moville, Iowa, who was in the crowd. ''It also tells me he's not going to get pushed around. He'll fight back. A lot of people around the world want to tell America what to do. We need to have our own direction and priorities.''
 President Bush's political aides said they anticipated no negative aftereffects. In fact, the White House announced that Mr. Cheney's campaign schedule would only intensify. Next weekend, he will take a bus tour through Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. And senior Republicans said he had proved himself a voice of wisdom and reassurance to voters on the two big topics of the race, the economy and the fight against terrorism.
 ''He's a tremendous asset to the Republican party,'' said Ed Gillespie, chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''The rank-and-file Republican voters out there just love Dick Cheney. They appreciate his loyalty to the president, and they appreciate that he feels solid.''
 But Mr. Cheney has been drawing even more partisan fire than usual over the last few weeks. His aggressive defense of the administration's assertions that Iraq was working with Al Qaeda intensified the long-running partisan and ideological clash over whether he helped lead the nation to war under false pretenses. 
 He won a short-term legal victory when the Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a lower court had acted ''prematurely'' when it rejected his request to block disclosure of records from his energy policy task force. But the ruling brought the issue to the fore again, allowing Democrats to renew their attacks that he has sought to work behind closed doors to further the interests of energy companies.
 Now more than ever, his opponents call Mr. Cheney among the most polarizing figures in politics. Democrats portray him as the power behind the throne and the personification of militarism, corporate corruption and government secrecy.
 ''We've got to get the White House back from a man who has abused his power as the leader of the free world,'' the comedian Billy Crystal told the crowd at a Democratic fund-raiser in Los Angeles on Thursday night. ''Dick Cheney has got to go.''
 Mr. Bush's Democratic rival, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, regularly repeats Mr. Cheney's name in much the same way Republicans have long used that of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton-- as a symbol of all that is wrong with the policies and personalities of the opposing party.
 ''Cheney's definitely turned into a big, fat albatross around the president's neck,'' said Jim Jordan, Mr. Kerry's former campaign manager.
 ''His public image is very bad and getting worse,'' Mr. Jordan said. Mr. Cheney's aides and supporters said one of his great strengths as a campaigner was his ability to remain stoic about the way he is portrayed by Democrats and immune from the pressures of responding to the ups and downs of daily news cycles.
 But the exchange with Mr. Leahy on Tuesday suggested that Democrats manage to get under Mr. Cheney's skin.
 Interviewed by Fox News on Friday after a speech in Saginaw, Mich., Mr. Cheney did not specifically acknowledge using the expletive that he has been widely reported to have used. ''Well, I expressed myself rather forcefully, felt better after I had done it,'' Mr. Cheney said. Asked whether he was angry about Mr. Leahy's suggestions that the Halliburton Company had received no-bid contracts in Iraq because Mr. Cheney ran the company before joining the Republican ticket four years ago, the vice president said that was part of it.
 ''Also, it had to do with -- he is the kind of individual who will make those kinds of charges and then come after you as though he's your best friend,'' Mr. Cheney said.
 Mr. Leahy's aides said the incident occurred when Mr. Cheney gathered with members of the Senate for a formal portrait on the Senate floor on Tuesday. Mr. Leahy was chatting with Republicans, they said, when he spied Mr. Cheney and approached him. When Mr. Cheney turned away, Mr. Leahy, the aides said, joked that the vice president was unwilling to talk to Democrats.
 After Mr. Cheney expressed his ''dissatisfaction'' with Mr. Leahy, as the vice president put it to Fox News, Mr. Leahy ''told Mr. Cheney that he and Senate Democrats didn't appreciate being called anti-Catholic,'' said David Carle, Mr. Leahy's spokesman. Mr. Leahy was referring to Republican accusations that Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were ''anti-Catholic'' because they refused to confirm a judicial nominee, William H. Pryor Jr., who opposed abortion. Mr. Leahy is the senior Democrat on the panel. 
 Then Mr. Cheney stalked off, Mr. Leahy's aides said, using an obscene phrase to describe what he thought Mr. Leahy should do. 
 In a statement issued after Fox News broadcast its interview with Mr. Cheney, Mr. Carle said, ''It appears the vice president's previous calls for civility are now inoperative.''
 By forcing Mr. Cheney to address his personal conduct, the incident brought a rare moment of improvisation to the vice president's campaign, which has so far been a highly orchestrated affair directed primarily at raising money and rousing the Republican faithful.
 Mr. Cheney does not do rapid response, the daily back and forth between the campaigns, and he rarely addresses issues like education or Mr. Bush's ''compassionate conservative'' agenda. He plays the traditional vice-presidential role of attacking the opposition, but his stump speech parrots the same lines about Mr. Kerry that Mr. Bush uses in his speeches.
 Mr. Cheney's strength, his aides and supporters said, is in setting out what the stakes are in the election.
 ''We'll have him do what he does best and has done best, which is to take the needed step back to provide perspective about the challenges we face and the policies we need,'' said Mary Matalin, a former senior aide to Mr. Cheney who will join him on the campaign trail this summer. ''He's a political reality zone.''
 To soften up Mr. Cheney's somewhat wooden public persona, he is often introduced, as he was here, by his wife, Lynne Cheney. She told a story about how she wore a strapless red dress made by her grandmother on her first date with Mr. Cheney and how she credited the dress with their having a second date.
 Republican strategists said Mr. Cheney, a former House member, takes a keen interest in the nuts and bolts of electoral politics. 
 ''He has a very well developed sense of campaign strategy and campaign tactics,'' said one prominent Republican in Washington who has close ties to Mr. Cheney. ''He understands how to read a poll and the cross tabs. He'll delve into message and the things that inform campaign decisions. But he's less likely to involve himself in detail than to try to spark people's thinking or challenge people's thinking.''

HEADLINE: Bush Is Out of Touch on Economic Ills, Kerry Tells Laid-Off Ohioans

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: MASSILLON, Ohio, June 25 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry took his promise of better jobs for struggling Americans to a bellwether county in a battleground state on Friday, telling laid-off steelworkers and programmers here that the Bush administration was woefully out of touch with working people. ''George Bush is going around the country talking to people about how, 'Gee, this is terrific, we've just had two or three months where a few jobs have been created,''' Mr. Kerry said at a high school just outside the city of Canton. But he said Mr. Bush had still presided over a net loss of 1.9 million jobs despite the Republican's assertions that his tax cuts would create more than 5 million new ones. Worse, Mr. Kerry said, ''The jobs that are being created pay $9,000 less than the jobs being lost.''
 Although he acknowledges the upturn in labor statistics, Mr. Kerry has been emphasizing not just that Americans need work but that they need more high-skilled, high-wage jobs in particular, the kind he says would be created by an administration that does more to promote research and innovation. 
 ''No disrespect to fast-food stores,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''They're part of America. But they're not the future of the kinds of jobs that we need to raise people's quality of living.''
 This was Mr. Kerry's eighth visit to Ohio since wrapping up the Democratic nomination in March. Aides said it was the first campaign appearance in Stark County by the party's standard-bearer since Jimmy Carter came here in 1976 but failed to carry the county.
 Republicans now hold every major office in the county, but it is a swing area in presidential races, having voted with the winner in 9 of the last 10 elections. Mr. Bush defeated Al Gore here by less than 2 percent of the vote in 2000.
 The state has lost more than 200,000 jobs since Mr. Bush took office and Democrats say that plant closings and contractions are putting the county and the state's 20 electoral votes well within reach. Hoover is cutting 330 jobs in North Canton. Rubbermaid shuttered a plant with 850 workers in the next county, and Ford is putting 1,200 people out of work in Lorain, 50 miles away, next year.
 Referring to Mr. Kerry, Rich Waiken, 38, an electrician who has not worked in two months and says he has been told not to expect to again this year, said: ''The way the economy's looking, I think he has a great chance. My neighbors are saying they're definitely for Kerry this year.''
 In Canton, the Kerry campaign singled out the Timken Company, a maker of steel and bearings, to show that the president's economic plans were not working. Mr. Bush visited Timken last year to promote his tax cuts as a recipe for job growth, but in May the company said it would close three factories and eliminate 1,300 jobs after failing to renegotiate its contract with the steelworkers union.
 As an added bonus for Mr. Kerry, the company's owner, Tim Timken Jr., is a major backer of President Bush and was co-chairman of a fund-raising effort that reaped $55 million for the presidential library of Mr. Bush's father.
 Scott Albertson, 41, a mechanic at the company for 23 years, said in a town-hall meeting staged by the Kerry campaign that the plant closings would be ''devastating'' for Canton. ''I have no idea what I'm going to do,'' Mr. Albertson said, reading from notes. ''In the current job market, for someone my age to find gainful employment, there are just no good job opportunities left in this community.''
 He added that he could not imagine being able to pay for his children's education. ''I want to believe in a better America, as my parents did for me,'' he said.
 Mr. Kerry waded into the Timken-union dispute last month, calling on Mr. Bush to appoint a federal mediator. A spokesman for the company, Jason Saragian, called the plant closings ''a decision by a private-sector company to shift some of its operations to more competitive facilities that in this case largely happen to be in the U.S.''
 ''So yeah, the company finds it curious that Senator Kerry has chosen to focus on this particular matter,'' Mr. Saragian added. ''It's a business issue, not a political issue.''
 The Bush-Cheney campaign fired back at Mr. Kerry by issuing statements from several Ohio Republicans, including Mayor Janet Creighton of Canton, accusing Mr. Kerry of ''preaching pessimism'' and doom and gloom.
 ''The people of Stark County and the rest of Ohio are not interested in John Kerry talking down the Ohio economy,'' Ms. Creighton said. ''John Kerry continues to relentlessly heap negativity onto an economy that is recovering and creating jobs.''
 But Mr. Kerry took care to mix his somber warnings with hopeful notes. In the meeting, he said health care costs, college tuition and gasoline prices were all skyrocketing, while wages were ''stuck or going down'' and the administration was trying to roll back overtime pay.
 ''All the things they're doing are moving our country in the wrong direction,'' he said. ''I believe in America. I believe we can go in the right direction. I believe we can restore fairness to the workplace.''
 He said an Ohio food bank had seen its traffic jump 44 percent, despite ''how difficult it is for somebody who has the pride of a job, the pride of a check, the pride of an income, to suddenly have to turn to a food bank to put food on the table.''
 ''But you know what the administration was quoted as saying in The Dispatch?'' Mr. Kerry added, referring to the Columbus newspaper. ''They said that these people are just looking for the easy way out. That's the response of this administration.
 ''Well, we're going to show this administration the easy way out on Nov. 2,'' he said to a standing ovation. ''Then they'll understand what's going on.''

HEADLINE: Rowland's Successor to Chart New Economic Path for State

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY; Alison Leigh Cowan contributed reporting for this article

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 25 

 BODY:
Ethics was the first subject on which Lt. Gov. M. Jodi Rell sought to distance herself from the man she will replace next week. Economics might be the second.
 Mrs. Rell, who will be sworn into office July 1, the same day the resignation of Gov. John G. Rowland becomes effective, boasted on Friday that at least $50 million would be deposited into the state's Rainy Day Fund thanks to higher-than-expected income tax revenue that could give Connecticut a $100 million surplus in the fiscal year ending June 30. 
 But while Mr. Rowland also talked about bolstering the Rainy Day Fund, Mrs. Rell said she supported using about $20 million of the surplus to reduce the state's debt. Already this week she has hinted at tightening controls on spending, including possibly streamlining some state agencies and seeking greater private investment in economic development projects in which the state, under Mr. Rowland, has invested heavily.
 Under Mr. Rowland, Connecticut's per capita debt load has risen to $3,558 from $2,813 in October 1995, Mr. Rowland's first year in office, according to Moody's Investors Service. The current per capita debt load is five times the national median.''We must find every avenue we can to lower our debt costs moving forward,'' Mrs. Rell said in a statement announcing how the surplus would be used.
 Mrs. Rell, a Republican, also noted Friday that credit agencies had affirmed the state's strong bond rating, in part because of conference calls she and the state budget director, Marc S. Ryan, had with credit agencies weeks ago, before Mr. Rowland announced his resignation.
 Mrs. Rell said she ''wanted to assure them at that time, if in fact at any time there would be a transition to another governor, that it would be me and that I certainly had the experience and the background. They certainly appreciated the phone call and my participation.''
 The lieutenant governor spoke after presiding over the State Bond Commission meeting, a monthly session usually run by the governor during which the commission votes on major state capital spending projects. 
 Mr. Ryan, one of Mr. Rowland's closest aides, said Friday that the conference call with the credit agencies followed meetings he had with credit agencies this spring in which some financial analysts expressed concern about the state's political stability. ''It was a question I had to deal with,'' he said.
 Mr. Ryan said Mrs. Rell's involvement was not evidence of any secret understanding that Mr. Rowland would be leaving office. He said the calls followed discussions with Mr. Rowland's office. 
 Mr. Ryan also said he would be willing to continue in his position under Mrs. Rell. 
 While Mr. Rowland played to the center as governor and invested hundreds of millions of dollars in capital projects, including an $800 million convention center under construction along the Connecticut River in downtown Hartford, Mrs. Rell might prove to be more fiscally conservative.
 Tom D'Amore, a lobbyist who once headed the Republican Party in Connecticut, said that there was little for the party faithful to fear. On fiscal matters, ''she'll be a female version of John Rowland,'' he said. ''If anything, she may be more conservative than him.''
 Mrs. Rell met Friday afternoon with some of the state's constitutional officers, including the treasurer, Denise Nappier, who echoed a desire for ''getting a better handle on our per capita debt burden.''
 Asked if her administration would be more financially cautious than Mr. Rowland's, Mrs. Rell said: ''You can never be too careful with money. Any time that we can streamline or lessen our expenses or in fact even enhance revenue, I think the better we are all served for that.''

HEADLINE: Drivers Getting Break as Many Insurers Cut Rates

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
With gasoline prices at more than $2 a gallon this summer, there is at least one bit of good news for drivers: the cost of auto insurance is starting to fall.
 State Farm, the nation's largest insurer, and two other big auto insurers, USAA and the Farmers Insurance Group, are cutting prices in many states and dozens of other insurers across the country are following their lead, industry experts say.
 ''Millions of drivers are going to see the cost of auto insurance fall this year,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade organization in New York. Rather than announcing across-the-board rate decreases, insurers including giants like Allstate, Progressive and Geico are more aggressively offering lower prices to customers with good driving records and significantly raising prices for those who have been involved in crashes or have received tickets for speeding and other violations. Since most drivers fall into favorably rated categories, the net result is expected to be lower costs for millions of drivers. 
 ''Many of the national players are strategically reducing rates,'' said Anthony Diodato, a supervisor of analysts at A.M. Best, a source of data on insurance.
 Over all, the average cost of insurance is still increasing, albeit at a much lower rate: instead of last year's average rise of 7.8 percent, prices for auto coverage across the country are expected to increase by 3.5 percent, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
 The rate reductions are expected to apply to all categories of passenger vehicles, from tiny compacts to monster S.U.V.'s, and should be felt across the country over the next 12 months.
 ''You're at a tipping point,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''It takes a year or so for rate changes to ripple through the industry.''
 As painful and irritating as the high cost of gasoline may be for drivers, it will probably help propel the downward trend in auto insurance prices. 
 ''When consumers use their cars less, that tends to result in fewer accidents,'' said Steven A. George, a senior vice president for underwriting at USAA.
 After nearly 25 years of rising auto insurance rates, prices leveled off in 1997 and 1998, then dipped to an average cost of $680 per car across the country in 1999 and 2000. But the insurers said costs began to get ahead of them again and they began raising prices to an average of $842 per car last year.
 Prices for auto insurance are now falling just as the rates on many other kinds of insurance, including property insurance for corporations are also declining.
 Though many disparate factors go into pricing insurance, the industry in general has attained high profit levels after several years of soaring prices and is now easing up on customers. 
 It is those profit levels -- and the desire to avoid the ire of state insurance regulators -- that as much as anything are responsible for the cuts in auto insurance prices. After four years of raising rates, the insurers overshot their goal significantly last year and reported extraordinary profits, potentially attracting the attention of the regulators who have the authority to control prices. 
 Ira Zuckerman, an analyst at Nutmeg Securities in Fairfield, Conn., estimates that earnings among car insurers jumped more than 25 percent in 2003, more than double the usual growth in profits.
 Costs for the insurers came in lower than expected as the rate of auto accidents continued to decline with the aging of the baby boomers, who like drivers before them, are becoming more cautious as they grow older. Earnings from investments also improved. 
 Some insurers hope to attract new customers with the lower prices, analysts said. But for others the goal is to avoid losing business to competitors, who flush with profits, are now in a position to also lower prices. J. Paul Newsome, an analyst at A.G. Edwards, said that while he knew of no pressure from regulators so far, ''you can't keep raising prices; eventually the regulators will force you to lower them.'' 
 Because insurance is regulated state by state and conditions vary widely, charts on auto pricing look like a patchwork quilt. For example, even though State Farm is cutting rates in 28 states, often by 4 percent or 5 percent, it is raising them in 11 states, by as much as 7.5 percent in North Dakota. USAA says it is cutting rates an average of 7 percent in 44 states and the District of Columbia and raising them an average of 3 percent in one state, Massachusetts.
 Compared with the other two companies, rates at Farmers seem to be on less of a downward slope. It is cutting rates in 7 states and raising them in 19, from less than 1 percent in many cases to 12.1 percent in Mississippi. Still, that is an improvement for customers over the rates in 2003 when Farmers raised prices in 27 states. In New York, the pattern of prices so far this year is mixed. Farmers is raising rates 10.3 percent and prices at USAA are going up three-tenths of a percent. But State Farm, saying its costs for fraudulent claims and auto theft have fallen sharply in New York, is dropping prices more than 12 percent, its deepest cuts in the country. 
 Mr. Hartwig said that drivers in Florida and Massachusetts should not expect to see much improvement in auto insurance prices because of above average rates of fraudulent claims in those states. New York also has been plagued by fraudulent claims, but tighter laws that went into effect this year have begun reducing costs for insurers, Mr. Hartwig said.
 State Farm is an example of how fortunes have improved for the insurance companies. It reported net income in 2003 of $2.8 billion on premiums of $48.9 billion, an about-face from the previous year when it reported a loss of $2.8 billion on premiums of $44.4 billion. At Farmers, net income jumped to $88.9 million in 2003 from $17 million the year before. At USAA, net income tripled in 2003 to $1.5 billion. 
 In 2000, the auto insurers were losing money, paying out $1.10 in claims and other expenses for every dollar they took in, Mr. Hartwig said. But last year, he said, they reported paying out an average of 97 cents for each dollar taken in.

HEADLINE: You Deserve a Raise. Now Try Telling the Boss.

BYLINE: By CHERYL DAHLE

 BODY:

Q. You've patiently toiled through the last three years of wage and promotion freezes at your company. Now that the economy is beginning to thaw, isn't it about time to ask for a raise?

A. Quite possibly -- particularly if your company is performing solidly in a recovering industry. While you don't want to make a request that will make you look out of touch with reality, you shouldn't assume that merely asking for a raise will hurt you, said Rayona Sharpnack, an executive coach and founder of the Institute for Women's Leadership in Redwood City, Calif.
 Ideally, you have been saving any internal e-mail messages praising your performance, and you have a portfolio of accomplishments to mention. Remember that you need to present evidence that you did more than just fulfill your job responsibilities.

Q. Should you produce a written proposal?

A. Sure, if that's appropriate, given your boss and the company culture. A few years ago, Courtney Attwood, director of product management at a Web publishing company in San Francisco, received a one-page proposal from one of her subordinates, making a case for a raise and a promotion. Ms. Attwood found the document useful in lobbying her superiors about the raise. ''I knew the quality of her work, but that succinct summary made it easier for me to go to my managers and to the budget controllers to really advocate for her.''

Q. Just what about the woman's proposal for a raise was so persuasive?

A. The brief outlined the woman's recent accomplishments but, more important, it noted company goals and how her skills could contribute to them in a new role. ''She demonstrated not just what she was capable of in her existing role, but how she had looked to what we were doing strategically, and what she brought to the table on that front,'' Ms. Attwood said.

Q. Should you do anything else to prepare to ask for a raise?

A. It certainly helps to know the salary ranges in your field and how your request meshes with the company's tiers of compensation. If you have reached the top of your work classification, you'll need to make a case for a promotion as well, or have a good answer for why your job should be an exception, Ms. Sharpnack said.

Q. What if the boss says no?

A. You still have several options. If the denial is based on the idea that the money just isn't available, you can suggest alternative compensation -- a performance bonus or a perk like some unofficial days off.
 A marketing manager at a telecommunications manufacturer in Silicon Valley was able to negotiate a performance bonus for herself recently, despite the company's four-year raise freeze. ''They gave me a $2,000 performance bonus as recognition for my efforts,'' she said. ''While that wasn't a raise, I saw this as very positive, in that it required approval from two levels above my boss, thereby gaining me exposure as a top performer.'' And it will provide more evidence to justify a raise once the company is flush again.

Q. What if a bonus isn't good enough?

A. You don't have to give up at the first ''no.'' An artist at a computer graphics company in the San Francisco area recently got a raise after lobbying for more than a year. His job description changed in February 2003, moving him from working for a single department to coordinating the work of several departments. At the time, his superiors didn't see the job shift as a promotion.
 The artist thought differently. After he repeatedly -- and calmly and politely -- emphasized that point, he was offered a bonus. He turned it down on principle, saying that his work merited a raise, not a bonus. (Bonuses, of course, don't figure into future percentage raises.)

Q. By rejecting a bonus, aren't you shooting yourself in the foot?

A. In this case, persistence won out. The artist kept bringing the conversation back to the unique value he had created for the company in his new role. He recalled: ''At one point, a manager actually said to me, 'The way I see it, you have the coolest job at the company.' I had to talk through the fact that just because I do, indeed, like my job doesn't mean I don't deserve to be compensated.''
 Ultimately, he got an 18 percent raise.

Q. Are there any pitfalls to avoid?

A. Whatever you do, don't whine, Ms. Sharpnack said. And remember that if your company doesn't have the money or vision to reward its employees, there are other companies out there that do. It's not a bad time to start looking, she said.


Q. So how should you make your pitch for a raise?

A. Before you do anything, check your attitude. ''Your story line for the request should be something a little more aggressive than, 'I'd just be happy if they just noticed me,''' but it should not convey any arrogance or feeling of entitlement, Ms. Sharpnack said. Such mind-sets can show up in your voice and body language and sabotage your case. Try to develop an internal voice that repeats something like: ''I bring considerable demonstrable value to the company, and it's completely appropriate that I ask to be compensated for that.''

Q. How do you make the case for the value you bring to your job?

A. Establish a connection between what you have accomplished over the last year and the company's success. If your division's customer-retention rates have gone up and you handle customer service, bring that up, Ms. Sharpnack said.

HEADLINE: The Golden Rule Is Taking A Beating

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
IT'S called ''gazumping'' in England, the process by which someone selling a piece of property accepts an offer from one buyer, maybe even going so far as to shake hands on it, then quickly -- and often surreptitiously -- accepts another, higher, offer from a second buyer, leaving the first buyer with his pockets agape and his heart broken. Gazump is a glorious, full-bodied word, with a lusty feel in the mouth; the behavior it outlines, however, is anything but satisfying. 
 As the buying season of 2003-04 winds to a close -- and it is winding down, as the temperature and interest rates continue to rise -- it will be remembered for its record prices, and its gazumps. 
 ''There are a million stories of people getting the gazump,'' said Betsy Dean, managing director of Stribling & Associates. ''It's been a year of very unhappy people. Well, unhappy brokers and unhappy buyers. The sellers are a pretty happy bunch. True, there's a morality question here, but this is a business.'' 
 It may feel like a queasy place ethically -- it may scream ''bad behavior'' -- but there's nothing illegal about the practice, unless you happen to live in Scotland, where a handshake and your word are still legally binding.
 Here, the only binding agreement between buyer and seller is a fully executed contract -- that is, one signed by both parties and sealed with a cashed check tucked safely into an escrow account. Nonetheless, until recently, there was the perception that the phrase ''accepted offer'' carried the promise of a move toward a contract. 
 ''Those words have been honored in the breach,'' said Bruce Rabbino, a broker with the William B. May Company. ''Which means the words come out but the follow-through isn't there. I think a sense of fairness has been lost.'' Mr. Rabbino described a recent deal characterized by, as he put it, the off-center behavior of a client, who accepted an offer, held back on a contract, and then trawled for another, higher bid. ''I had to say my piece, which is that I think this is just not a legitimate way to do things,'' he said. ''In the end, the 'accepted' offer was not accepted and more money was found. I had my say, but the seller had the right to sell to anyone they chose for the highest price.'' 
 Under the code of ethics promulgated by the Real Estate Board of New York and modeled from state law, a broker has a fiduciary responsibility to the seller, said John Doyle, a vice president for government affairs at the board, who handles ethics complaints. He said the broker also has a responsibility ''to get the highest price and the most qualified buyer and to pass along every bid that comes along. 
 ''It is the seller, however, who determines what the process is going to be like,'' he added. ''If the seller decides to violate the bidding rules they themselves have laid down, there's nothing a broker, or the Real Estate Board, can do about it.'' 
 Mr. Doyle reports an ''uptick'' in complaints from buyers smarting from a burn, and decrying the newly fungible nature of ''final and best.'' 
 ''Before, complaints from the general public were all over the place,'' he said. ''This year, they're about being outbid in this way, and they're not happy about it.'' 
 One young investment banker and his wife, a public relations executive, were on the wrong end of a deal that flip-flopped, for a 1,700-square-foot three-bedroom on Irving Place. It had been on the market for at least eight months; while the space and details were top-notch, the place languished because it had no curb appeal, said the banker, who along with his wife asked that they not be named because of privacy concerns. ''It was horribly decorated,'' he said, ''and there were toys all over the place.'' 
 In any case, late last year, its asking price had slipped from $1.3 million to $1.2 million, and its broker said confidently to the couple's broker, Richard Geiringer of Douglas Elliman, that if the couple made an offer of $1.1 million, the apartment was theirs. ''We shook hands with their broker on the corner outside,'' said the wife, still amazed. 
 The husband took up the tale. ''We received a contract a week later, and then they had an open house,'' he said incredulously. ''The next day we got word from Richard that someone had made an offer of $1.125 and that if we matched it, it would be ours. Of course, they had told us it was ours, but it would really be ours. So we did. Then they came back and said the other bidder, a B-level celebrity, according to their broker, had beat us at $1.175 and told us if we met them at $1.2 million it was ours.'' 
 At that point, the couple balked. ''We knew it was still a good deal, but we were feeling totally jerked around,'' the husband said. ''For a long time they had no offers, and we made them a good one, the only one, and we shook on it.''
 The wife said: '' You expect people to do the right thing but maybe you can't have that expectation in New York. This was a loss of innocence for us.'' Stung, the couple retreated from the market. 
 Pamela D'Arc, a broker at Stribling & Associates, described an even stickier deal. Her clients were a family moving back into the city from Larchmont, N.Y., for whom she found a three-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side in the $2 million range. 
 ''We were told after visiting the apartment twice that the sellers would be receiving 'final and best' offers that Friday,'' Ms. D'Arc said. ''After spending hours with my clients, formulating an offer well over the asking price and writing a persuasive letter detailing it and the particulars of my clients, financial and otherwise, I presented the offer before the deadline.'' 
 Her presentation was met with the news that the sellers already had a fully executed contract. Their broker, abashed, confided that he was under orders from the sellers not to reveal the truth that a contract had been signed, Ms. D'Arc continued, ''because they didn't believe they would get the higher price and they wanted backups.''
 ''I had never encountered this situation before, but this, of course, has been a market of firsts,'' she said. 
 Deborah Straubinger, a 20-year industry veteran, worked with a couple who were gazumped four or five times over a year, in one case coming so close to a deal that they had written their deposit check. 
 ''I think the market is such an incredibly nasty place now,'' said Ms. Straubinger, an agent with Eychner Associates. Both she and her clients, she says, are learning to prepare psychologically. ''We're starting to deal with it a little better now,'' she said. 
 When potential buyers are burned, most brokers say, they lick their wounds and move on, vowing to move more quickly and more aggressively. As a result, lawyers and mortgage brokers are working triple-time. 
 ''There is immense pressure now to get the deals done very, very rapidly,'' said Paul Wolsk, who has been a real estate lawyer for 35 years. ''Most sellers don't want to listen to whether or not a buyer is going to get a mortgage, or wait for days while their lawyer does due diligence.''
 Mr. Wolsk's firm can perform due diligence and get a contract signed in 24 hours, if necessary. ''Mortgage brokers used to be pleased to get a call from us,'' he said. ''Now, they shudder.'' 
 There are instances, as suggested by Mr. Doyle's complaint file, when the pain is too great to move on. One couple, reeling from a deal that flamed out after two weeks, have cried foul.
 Jane Praeger, a media trainer, and her husband, Terrence O'Brien, a theater director, made a play for an ''as-is'' apartment in a former parsonage on lower Park Avenue owned by the Community Church of New York Unitarian Universalist. 
 Theirs was one of multiple bids, but since their bid, of $1.64 million, came with no financial contingency, two of the four representatives of the church (can you see murky waters ahead?) accepted it. A few days later, another offer came from a potential buyer within the building, for $1.7 million. The broker representing the church, Julie Perlin of Stribling & Associates, recommended that the offer from the second buyer be accepted.
 At the same time, she allowed Mr. O'Brien and Ms. Praeger continued access into the property for an architect's visit and informed their broker, Ms. Straubinger, that a higher bid had trumped theirs. A day later, they raised their offer to $1.66 million, only to learn that a fully executed contract had been made the previous day. The tale devolves at this point into a case of who said what at which point. Ms. Praeger and Ms. Straubinger state that their offer was rebuffed unfairly, because Ms. Perlin claimed she hadn't received their lawyer's information. Ms. Perlin will tell you that she made each bidder's information available, as she received it, to the church's representatives, who made their own decision to go with the higher bidder. What's confusing is that a number of individuals represented the church: two members of the congregation, the church's general counsel and others. 
 While the counsel, Paul M. Godlin of Opton, Handler & Feiler, averred that ''the church is very happy with the sale,'' the two congregation members, according to one of them, Jo Ann Corkran, felt very uneasy. 
 ''We had given our word to the first buyers, the Praeger-O'Briens,'' she said. ''I'm not saying the extra $20,000 or $30,000 wasn't useful, but we're a church.'' 
 Mr. O'Brien and Ms. Praeger wrote letters of protest to various managers at the Stribling offices and to the Real Estate Board of New York. Stribling's managers are sympathetic, but fatalistic. 
 ''What would really be bad behavior,'' said Kenneth Scheff, a senior vice president at Stribling who addressed the Praeger-O'Brien complaint, ''is if a broker did not relay all bids to a seller. That is a broker's legal responsibility.''
 ''I feel that there is tremendous distrust because the facts are constantly changing,'' he said. ''A buyer's broker needs to convey the flavor and tenor of the market to the buyer. Don't forget that at the same time a seller has the right to accept a higher or more appealing offer, the buyer always has the right to back out.'' 
 When asked why they are pursuing the matter so strenuously, Ms. Praeger said: ''I guess I just felt that we were dealt with unethically and that we had no recourse, except to file a complaint. An apology would have been nice: They say that the lawyers who get sued are the ones who don't apologize.'' She continued, musingly, ''I felt that we had been strung along, had gone through a lot of angst, and in the end the impression was that the other buyer was being favored.'' 
 Ms. Straubinger, their broker, said she respected the couple's decision to make a stand. ''I told them they could complain to anyone they wanted and it wasn't going to get them the apartment,'' she said. ''But I can't say that it's wrong for them to point out the fact that this market has gotten really mean and nasty.'' 
 As for the investment banker and the public relations executive, theirs is a happier ending. Mr. Geiringer unearthed the only deal they would take: a new condo development in Kips Bay. ''All I had to do was walk in and say I'll take it,'' the banker said. ''They sent a contract the same day. 
 ''I still get angry because of the way we were treated on Irving Place,'' he said. ''But as mad as I am, I can see that this was a family with three kids, and that extra hundred thousand they got, from whoever that B-list celebrity was, represented three years' worth of private school tuition.''

How Buyers Can Dodge a 'Gazump'
 HAVE you been gazumped? Agreed to buy a home only to find the seller has accepted another, higher bid behind your back? In many red-hot markets, the practice -- unethical, though not illegal -- is becoming increasingly common, brokers say.
 Until recently, few may have heard of the word ''gazump,'' which, according to Edmund Weiner, deputy chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, is an English word common in Britain that means to swindle and dates back to around 1928. 
 There isn't a fail-safe method of dodging a gazump, but there are ways to improve the odds. Most brokers suggest that buyers bid at or above the asking price. They also recommend that the buyers be flexible: that they have no financial contingencies on the sale; that they are pre-approved for a mortgage and ready to meet, say, with a co-op board, and that they be open about a closing date. They should also be quick to draw up a contract.
 ''This only works with a buyer who has seen the market, knows what he or she wants, and what that's worth, and maybe even has been burned once or twice,'' said Lisa Lippman, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group who specializes in family-sized apartments.
 ''Then,'' she said, ''I will go to the seller's broker and say, 'What will it take for you to only keep showing the property for backup?' Sometimes it's a long close, or a certain number. When there is a meeting of the minds, between a seller and buyer, as to what it will take to hold the apartment, I have never had a buyer 'gazumped.' '' PENELOPE GREEN

HEADLINE: Waiting for the Fed, the Markets Stay Calm

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market was still stuck in a rut last week. Many investors stayed out of the action, waiting for the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates this Wednesday. 
 Trading volume and volatility remained low and there were few major short-term market trends, although some individual stocks, particularly in the technology sector, had huge runs during the week. 
 Altera, the maker of programmable semiconductors, jumped 24.2 percent on expectations of a strong earnings report this week. It had the biggest weekly gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, followed by Ciena, which gained 22.3 percent, and JDS Uniphase, up 18.6 percent. Both companies build fiber optic networks, and rose on expectations of increased spending by their customers.
 For the week, the S.&P. 500 fell 0.59 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,134.43. The Dow Jones industrial index fell 44.57 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 10,371.84. The Nasdaq composite index rose 38.74 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,025.47. 
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell to 4.64 percent from 4.71 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: A New Place to Keep Track Of Real Estate Mania

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
FORGET $42.5 million apartments, interest-only mortgages and other forms of irrational exuberance. For students of recent history who fear the real estate bubble may be ready to pop, there is now ''CNNfn Open House,'' a daily half-hour show for the property obsessed that makes its debut tomorrow on the financial cable channel. As if to underscore the way Americans have replaced their fixation with the stock market with a real estate jones, ''Open House'' will bump ''Money and Markets'' off the schedule.
 Day traders glued to the financial channels were a hallmark of the technology bubble. Now, market-timing Web surfers on Realtor.com can tune in to ''Open House'' twice a day, at noon and 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Deja vu is only a cul-de-sac of the mind. 
 Not to worry. The show's host, Gerri D. Willis, played down ''bubble fear mongering'' in her 2003 book, ''The Smart Money Guide to Real Estate Investing.'' She did find one notable exception. ''The only cities vulnerable to a crash are the ones that enjoy the biggest runups in the first place,'' she wrote, ''and that largely means coastal cities. If you're living in the heartland, though, you should be able to sleep soundly.'' 
 Ms. Willis laughed when asked whether her show's debut could be seen as a harbinger of the bust. ''We'll be looking at all aspects'' of the real estate boom, she said. ''Can housing prices continue to rise? Where will they rise? That's something people care about, the trend going forward on housing prices.''

Seeing Red Over Blue Bricks
 After a two-year court battle, workers are moving ahead to strip the signature blue bricks off the facade of the co-op apartment house at 27 East 65th Street, at the corner of Madison Avenue.
 A panel of the Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court ruled this month in favor of the co-op board in its long-running dispute with Elliott E. Sutton, 62, a real estate investor who controls the building's ground-floor commercial space as an equal partner with the co-op board.
 The ruling cleared the way for the co-op board to get a $6.8 million mortgage that will refinance an existing loan and provide some $3 million to replace the blue bricks with ordinary red ones, according to Gil Feder, a lawyer for the firm Reed Smith, which represents the board.
 The wrangling began in early 2002, when city inspectors said the facade of the 17-story building, which was built in 1963, was in danger of crumbling and ordered a scaffold erected.
 Because they are glazed, the blue bricks retain water, which freezes in the winter, causing cracks and leaks. The co-op had brought in engineers, who recommended removing all the bricks and replacing them.
 Mr. Sutton worried that his ground-floor restaurant, Ferrier, and other tenants including a Citibank branch, would lose business the longer the project took and he argued for a quick job that would merely replace bad bricks in patchwork fashion. The two sides landed in court, and both the blue bricks and the scaffold stayed, and stayed and stayed.
 The co-op applied for a mortgage to finance the brickwork, but Mr. Sutton, as joint owner of the property, refused to sign the loan papers. After a series of arbitration and court decisions, a judge finally ruled that the co-op could sign on behalf of its unwilling partner. That decision was upheld by the appellate panel.
 Mr. Sutton, however, says he will ask the New York State Court of Appeals in Albany, the state's highest court, to take up the case.
 Work initially began in March after the 55 or so co-op owners agreed to a maintenance increase. The money is to be reimbursed when the loan goes through.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Sutton said he would soon close Ferrier because of poor business. Mr. Feder, the board's lawyer, said the work would have been done by now, and the scaffolding gone, if Mr. Sutton had not put up a fight.
 in a court hearing last January, Justice Jane S. Solomon of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan wondered aloud about the long-running feud. ''Does your client have an emotional connection to blue brick?'' she asked one of Mr. Sutton's lawyers.
 The judge's question was repeated to Mr. Sutton last week. ''I don't care if it's blue, black, green or orange,'' he said. ''I only own the ground floor. I don't look up.''

A Big Sale, And Back Rent
 David Marvisi, a Manhattan nightclub owner, has been busy. Two weeks ago he sold, for $10 million, the East 65th Street town house once owned by Irene Silverman, the woman who was murdered by Sante and Kenneth Kimes.
 A month earlier, he sold a four-story building at 668 Avenue of the Americas, near 21st Street, for $2.38 million, which he said he originally acquired in exchange for his stake in the Limelight nightclub. 
 Now, Joel Bernstein, a Manhattan lawyer, wants to get in on the action.
 Mr. Bernstein took Mr. Marvisi to court in April 2001 for walking out on four months of rent for a loft apartment in Lower Manhattan at 77 Warren Street. The building is owned and managed by companies tied to the Gindi family, which is best known for running the Century 21 department store. A civil court judge ruled in favor of the landlord last July. But Mr. Bernstein said his client has yet to be paid the $75,368 in rent, fees, interest and legal costs awarded by the court. 
 Mr. Marvisi said he was unaware that a judgment had been entered. In a deposition, Mr. Marvisi had said the building was still being renovated when he moved in more than four years ago, paying $6,500 a month.
 ''The place was not in a condition to live,'' he said. ''I had a name for it, Living Hell.'' 
 He said he got stuck in the elevator at least three times, on one occasion for more than two hours. ''We were lucky we didn't die,'' he said in the deposition. Mr. Marvisi also said there were problems with heat and air-conditioning and that water from an overflowing washing machine stained his all-white furniture. The landlord testified that he had quickly fixed all of the problems.
 Mr. Marvisi, who drives an orange Bentley and owns the Exit nightclub, testified he lived in the Warren Street loft for 14 months while renovating a duplex condo he owns in the Regatta Building in Battery Park City. He said he is selling his New York property because he is moving to Miami.

HEADLINE: In an Age of Terror, Safety Is Relative

BYLINE: By GREGG EASTERBROOK. 
Gregg Easterbrook, a senior editor at The New Republic and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of ''The Progress Paradox.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
ON the subway a few weeks after the Madrid bombings, I noticed a parcel under a seat. I asked other passengers, but no one claimed the object. I looked inside the parcel and saw some papers and an elaborately wrapped object the size of a grapefruit. The train pulled into Metro Center, the main station of the Washington subway. I contemplated that I might be about to pick up a bomb, but then I'd already been stupid enough to look inside, so I carried out the package, put it on a bench and told the station manager. Officers appeared quickly, though trains continued running and people kept milling past.
 When I first saw the package, should I have used the emergency intercom to alert the motorman? Should he have stopped the train and evacuated everyone? When I alerted the manager, should she have closed the station, bringing the entire system to a halt? Had it turned out to be a bomb, pundits second-guessing the disaster that followed might have said the station manager and I were fools for not pushing the panic button. But what if a trainload of frantic people had been evacuated into a dark tunnel with a high-voltage rail, all because of an elaborately wrapped grapefruit? 
 This is an example of the practical limits to security in the post-9/11 world. With the introduction of sophisticated airport inspections, bomb-screening of checked bags, security stops at building entrances, better passport controls, ''smart borders'' with improved computers and identity scanners, and hundreds of radiation and bioweapon detectors installed in urban areas, security has significantly improved in just three years. This summer, residents of New York and Boston are seeing lots of extra patrols, bomb-sniffing dogs and police drills, in preparation for the political conventions. 
 But some of what's being done is primarily psychological: to make people feel more safe, regardless of whether they really are. And though the government must try any reasonable idea to counter terrorism, in the next round of security improvements to come there will be serious limits to practicality and affordability. 
 Consider train safety. Recently the Transportation Security Administration tested screening of Amtrak passengers at the New Carrollton, Md., stop. Riders walked one by one through a device that sniffs the air for molecules associated with explosives. Probably anyone carrying a bomb would have been detected. But Amtrak has about 500 stations, half unstaffed whistle-stops. To add bomb-sniffers, plus personnel, to every station would be a significant expense.
 The New Carrollton stop is a quiet suburban station handling roughly 1,000 passengers a day. The Washington subway system carries half a million passengers a day. Many enter at downtown stations that are mob scenes; to make everyone walk through sniffer machines would be incredibly cumbersome. The New York subway system carries 3.8 million passengers a day, boarding at 468 stations. Screening all those riders would be a logistical nightmare, even if cost were no object. Many New York stations would need extensive re-engineering, and the lines would stretch up the stairs. 
 And cost is an object. An estimated $11 billion has been spent to improve American airline security since Sept. 11, 2001. The airlines board about 1.5 million passengers a day. With the New York subway system alone carrying more than twice that, screening might cost about twice as much as has been spent on airline security.
 Maybe there's a way to avoid subway passenger screening. Starting in July, Boston transit police will hand-search the packages of travelers on the storied T subway system. Riders will continue to board unscreened. Officers, some with explosives-sniffing dogs, will wander through cars and demand that passengers open packages, briefcases or backpacks. Already there is an excruciating legal dispute about whether the officers should be scanning for those who fit terrorist profiles, or making random searches: that is, ordering grandma to show what's in her purse while ignoring the Middle Eastern-looking young man with the backpack.
 Set aside the legalities and concentrate on the practical. The Boston system has 247 transit officers, only a fraction of whom will be on trains at any particular time. What are the odds officers will stumble onto the one person, among hundreds of thousands, who is carrying something dangerous?
 People will feel safer knowing that officers are there, and making people feel safer may be the next best thing to actual safety. In the months after 9/11, National Guard units in battle fatigues patrolled airports: those camouflage outfits would hardly have helped Guard members blend in against a backdrop of vacationers and Chick-Fil-A stands. Officers with assault rifles now walk Times Square, though the chances an assault rifle will be needed are slim. 
 Amtrak now demands that ticket buyers show a driver's license or similar identification. Maybe this will catch a lone deranged person, but the 9/11 attackers made sure their paperwork was in order. Many office buildings now require visitors to show a driver's license, which a low-wage desk worker glances at perfunctorily. During the Democratic National Convention in July, the police will close much of the highway system of downtown Boston. 
 How much has been spent on real action? Steven M. Kosiak, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington research group, estimates that since Sept. 11, 2001, about $26 billion has been invested in improving the security of critical infrastructure in the United States. Domestic security over all (personnel and preparedness as well as infrastructure) is a $41.3 billion line in the current federal budget, and President Bush has requested $47.4 billion in fiscal 2005, a request that includes allotments like $3.6 billion to stockpile vaccines and antidotes. Domestic antiterrorism spending is now at nearly 10 times the level of President Bill Clinton's final budget for it. Nonetheless, last year a Council on Foreign Relations report said domestic security was drastically underfinanced. 
 Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, says he wants still higher spending. He advocates 100,000 more firefighters, 5,000 new police officers trained specifically for antiterrorism, special funds for states and cities whenever an orange-level security alert is issued and other new investments. 
 But money for more security must be weighed against other priorities. The Council on Foreign Relations study, for example, noted, ''Only 10 percent of fire departments in the United States have the personnel and equipment to respond to a building collapse.'' Yet should most fire departments have millions of dollars' worth of equipment to handle a building collapse, when the chances of this happening in any one place, even any one big city, are tiny? 
 Further improvements in security may prove impractical, or threats to liberty. Should bus passengers be screened? Israel, that most security-conscious of nations, has found bus attacks nearly impossible to stop. Should all cars be inspected before entering parking garages? The first World Trade Center attack involved a van bomb in the parking garage. (Cars entering the parking lots at many federal buildings are now inspected; this is not done at most commercial lots under private skyscrapers.) Should everyone carry an identity card with ''biometric'' data coded into it? The economic considerations are just as daunting. Mr. Kosiak estimates $407 billion has been spent in the wake of 9/11, a figure that includes military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. If the estimate is correct, then more than 1 percent of the gross domestic product since 9/11 has gone to security improvements and to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. National prosperity has declined slightly as a result. 
 Extra security layers also burden the economy. Roadblocks slow the movement of goods; complex inspections of shipments add to processing costs; restricting entry to the United States of the 99.9999 percent of foreign citizens who mean no harm is bad for tourism, for movement of intellectual capital and other aspects of the economy. One reason America has prospered is that it invested heavily in removing friction from the economy by making trade, travel and transactions as convenient as possible. Since 9/11, ''we've been putting the friction back in,'' Brian Michael Jenkins of the RAND Corporation has noted. 
 Consider movement of shipping. Some 20,000 shipping containers a day arrive at United States ports, with perhaps 1 percent inspected. An estimated 250 million shipping containers are in motion around the world. The Central Intelligence Agency is believed to have concluded that a crude atomic bomb or other terror weapon is far more likely to arrive in the United States via shipping container than on a missile from a rogue state.
 But 20,000 shipping containers per day cannot be fully inspected without significantly slowing the economy. The Department of Homeland Security has a program to place American inspectors overseas at ports like Rotterdam and Singapore. But there's a practical limit to how secure shipping can be, just as there are practical limits to many ideas to improve security.
 In a world of six billion souls, all it takes is one person a day willing to commit suicide to cause harm and sustain the sense of civilization in jeopardy. Governments will keep trying to improve public safety, but no matter how much is spent, there may be a limit to buying security against that one person.

HEADLINE: Iraqis Laud New Turbine, Despite Shortfalls

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 26 

 BODY:
There may be no term for Murphy's Law in Arabic, but at the dedication on Saturday for a new turbine generator at a power plant here, Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Iraq's electricity minister, Ayham al-Samaraie, encountered it in its purest form.
 As Iraqis suffer through repeated blackouts because of electricity shortages, the ministers held a ceremony heralding the end of major construction for an new American-financed turbine that would add large amounts of power to the national grid. But even before the speeches began, Iraqi engineers pointed out not only that more work must still be done before the plant will be able to produce more electricity than before but that an earlier American project -- also unveiled to much fanfare -- that was supposed to let the plant operate on cheap crude oil had ceased to function because of a lack of spare parts.
 Instead the plant, called Qudas, which has long been notable among Iraqi engineers for its inefficiency, was still operating on diesel fuel. 
 ''We completed the project,'' Omar Ghiyath, chief of operation at the plant, said of the earlier work, ''but there are points which are suspended right now.''
 As for why the project, undertaken by the United States Agency for International Development, had not been able to continue, Mr. Ghiyath said, ''The problem is that they do not actually ask for the advice of the Iraqis on this.''
 The day seemed emblematic of the enormous challenges that the United States and its allies face as they try to continue rebuilding Iraq's tumbledown infrastructure in the face of sabotage attacks, shortages and a multitude of other problems before the transfer of sovereignty to a new Iraqi government led by Dr. Allawi on Wednesday.
 But the day was not all long faces. Before the visit, an official with the Coalition Provisional Authority announced that because of a variety of power projects around the country, Iraq's grid was now routinely producing about 10 percent more power than it did before the American-led invasion last year -- a peak of about 4,800 megawatts of electricity over the past few days.
 Still, as power demand rises over the summer here, the official said, ''we are not able to chase the demand target as fast as it's growing.''
 Engineers at Qudas more than confirmed that gap, saying electricity in their own homes fell far short of needs. One of the engineers, Ali Talib, said he was ashamed to tell his neighbors what he did for a living. ''We are generating electricity, but we don't have electricity in our neighborhood,'' he said.
 Occupation authorities have asserted that because they have enforced an equitable distribution of electricity around the country and because Saddam Hussein favored Baghdad, complaints on the issue are most intense here.
 Qudas, which opened only in 2002, was known as something of a flop from the start. Built by a Chinese company, the plant was supposed to be able to run on crude oil, which is plentiful in Iraq. But the company never completed that part of the job, and it became a highly inefficient consumer of diesel. ''Qudas had been consuming 15 percent of Iraq's available diesel,'' according to a report by the development agency.
 The agency's ''fuel conversion'' project, completed earlier this year at a cost of $3 million, according to the aid agency, let the plant operate for a short time on crude oil. But Waleed Salman, the plant manager, said the high temperatures and pressures needed for operation with crude meant the turbines had to be serviced twice as often and parts had to be replaced at a correspondingly higher pace. But money has not been provided for that purpose.
 A spokeswoman for the aid agency said that after the completion of the fuel conversion project, it was the responsibility of the Electricity Ministry to procure spare parts.
 But the dedication went on. The ceremony focused on construction of the first of several new turbines -- not yet in service -- that would put out enough power to increase Iraq's electricity production by 10 percent.
 The $145 million project, led by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, is expected to be completed by the end of August, officials said. Dr. Allawi called the work ''a gift from the people of the U.S.A. to the people of Iraq.''
 When asked about the fuel conversion project, the electricity minister, Mr. Samaraie, said only minor issues stood in the way of a return to burning crude at the plant.
 ''I am getting almost -- most of the parts right now,'' Mr. Samaraie said. ''In the next three to six months, we will have all these spare parts. It will be behind us.''

HEADLINE: Dancer in 'Cats' Finds a 2nd Act in Law

BYLINE: By Betsy Cummings. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS dance careers go, Hans Kriefall's was somewhat atypical. Like most professional dancers, he spent his childhood obsessed with the profession. ''All I ever wanted to do was dance,'' Mr. Kriefall, 38, said.
 But it wasn't until college, when many dancers have already spent years at their craft, that he first explored it himself through jazz dancing and ballet classes at Princeton. 
 In 1988, a year after graduating, he landed a part as a dancer in a European tour of ''West Side Story,'' the show that inspired him as a child. Other touring shows followed: ''Me and My Girl,'' ''A Chorus Line'' and ''Jesus Christ Superstar.'' In 1995, at 29, he landed his first Broadway performance as Alonzo in ''Cats,'' a role he would perform for four years. 
 But a year and a half into his stint as Alonzo, Mr. Kriefall's attitude toward his career began to change. He did not predict how substantial that change would be. He started to audition for other shows, but nothing interested him.
 Early in his dance career, Mr. Kriefall (pronounced KRY-fahl) craved the validation that being selected as a performer gave him. But later, he said, ''I realized I didn't care anymore whether I got the job.''
 ''If they wanted to hire me, great,'' he continued. ''If not, it was no skin off my nose.''
 What to do next, however, was not so apparent. Many dancers face a similar quandary: where to turn professionally when a career has dried up or lost its appeal. 
 Another dancer told Mr. Kriefall about Career Transition for Dancers, an organization with offices in New York and Los Angeles that has helped thousands of dancers to change careers. ''Dancers spend their whole life, from 5 or 6, having tunnel vision about dance and being a Broadway or modern or jazz dancer,'' said Mary Lou Westerfield, national director for policy at Actors' Equity Association, an actors' union that helped found Career Transition for Dancers in 1985. ''We try to get dancers empowered to see if they hadn't been focused on dance what they might have done.''
 In Mr. Kriefall's case, that meant taking a series of professional and personality tests and career questionnaires that his caseworker at Career Transition had him complete. Dancers receive such help free if they meet the program's eligibility requirements of 100 weeks of paid performance over seven years. Those who qualify can use the service for life.
 Since the group was created, 2,700 dancers nationwide have received career counseling services, most of them in New York, and 2,033 of them currently participate in career or other services the group offers, said Alexander J. Dube, the center's executive director.
 The age of the average client has recently dropped to the teens and early 20's. ''This is the next generation of dancers, and they understand that when their career comes to an end, they need to have tools to jump-start and move into another career that is as fulfilling as dance,'' Mr. Dube said. The average dancer ends his career at 29, he added.
 At the same time that Mr. Kriefall's passion for ''Cats'' was waning, his interest in volunteer work at Actors' Equity was increasing. His career counselor noticed a pattern of legal work through his union activities and suggested that he pursue internships in that field. He interned in the office of State Senator Franz S. Leichter of Manhattan, served on his church's council and continued his work with Actors' Equity. ''No matter where I was working, there was a lawyer engaged at some level being very helpful,'' Mr. Kriefall said. ''I thought I'd like to be one of those people actually offering concrete advice.''
 He eventually applied to Columbia Law School and graduated in 2002. His second summer internship was at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton L.L.P. , where he now practices as a lawyer in corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions.
 ''Dance is very disciplined, focused and organized. You're an artist within very specific parameters,'' Mr. Kriefall said, suggesting a link between dance and the precision of law. 
 ''Looking back, I miss the expression of dance,'' he said. ''And the great camaraderie that dancers have is different than the relationships that people have in the corporate world. But it's nice to have been able to step away from it. Now when I take dance classes, it's fun because I'm not worried that I can't do splits or my pirouettes are sloppy. I think I'm dancing better now than I used to.''

A.F.L.-C.I.O. Suspends Officials of Long Island Local
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said on Tuesday that it had removed Jack Caffey, the president of the Long Island local, and about 30 other officials after an audit of the local's financial practices.
 Jose Alvarez, the Northeast regional director of the federation, has taken over administration of the local, known as the Long Island Federation of Labor, said Lane Windham, a spokeswoman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Washington.
 Mr. Alvarez said the officials were suspended pending a final report from Buchbinder Tunick & Company, an auditing company in Manhattan. He said the federation would not disclose the charges made against the officials of the local until a final report. No date was set for the report.
 Mr. Alvarez said that the officials who were suspended had acted correctly in initially bringing their concerns to his attention.
 Ms. Windham said the suspensions were required by A.F.L.-C.I.O. policy and did not imply guilt.
 The Long Island Federation of Labor consists of the collective memberships of about 60 unions, representing about 200,000 members in Nassau and Suffolk.

Dowling Business School
 On Wednesday, Dowling College renamed its business school after Paul and Terry Townsend, longtime owners of Long Island Business News and influential figures in Long Island's economic development for nearly 50 years.
 The Townsends bought the paper in 1957, when it was still called The Long Island Commercial Review, and published it on weekly -- and, for several years, daily -- until Mr. Townsend's declining health prompted the couple to sell the paper, in 1998, to Dolan Media.
 Mr. Townsend was the paper's editor, extolling projects, plans and ideas he considered ''good for Long Island.'' Mrs. Townsend concentrated on building the paper's advertising base and managing operations. 
 In more than 30 years at the paper's helm, Mr. Townsend founded dozens of professional organizations, bundling the price of a Long Island Business News subscription into each membership fee. He inspired the formation of dozens of groups, including the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Fundraising Professionals of Long Island and Long Island Forum for Technology. Many of these organizations remain active.
 The business school includes both graduate and undergraduate programs.

HEADLINE: Transit By Pedal Or Foot

BYLINE: By PAULA GANZI LICATA

 BODY:
SETH KNEER, 38, of Northport, runs most errands on his bicycle. ''Why drive around the block?'' he said. ''I can get there faster and get some exercise at the same time.'' 
 Mr. Kneer lives in an apartment on Main Street above an antiques shop. He chose Northport specifically for its pedestrian- and cycle-friendly appeal. ''When I come home from work, I don't want to leave -- it's all right here,'' he said. ''Any traveling I do is on foot or bike.''
 Mr. Kneer is a member of the hardy band who defy Long Islanders' reputation for driving everywhere. The need for exercise, the desire to enjoy their neighborhoods, as well as the rising cost of gasoline have enticed these suburbanites out of their cars and onto bicycles and sidewalks. 
 Not all areas of the Island provide such options, and those looking for car-free lives often have to search for the right place to put down roots. ''Towns like Dix Hills, you would have to ride on a 55 m.p.h. road with little to no shoulder, and the shoulder you do have is covered with debris,'' Mr. Kneer said, ''not to mention the people in the cars are driving 65 m.p.h. while drinking coffee and talking on their cellphones.''
 Alice McLerran, 70, an author of children's books, was house-hunting on the Island four years ago for a pedestrian-friendly community. Her husband, Larry, a physicist, was being wooed by Brookhaven National Laboratory; he is now the head of Brookhaven's nuclear theory group. The couple had lived in California, Texas, Minnesota and Illinois, and in each new hometown Mrs. McLerran wanted to be able to walk. Long Island was a challenge.
 ''I didn't want to come here,'' she recalled. ''Long Island seemed like the last place I'd be happy, primarily because it's suburban sprawl.''
 Bellport, Sayville and Port Jefferson made the McLerrans' short list. ''But the last grocery store in Port Jefferson is now a Gap,'' Mrs. McLerran said. ''Sayville might have done it, but by the time I found a house, I had already lost my heart to Bellport. It's a village with a lot to offer. We even have sidewalks here.'' They live off South Country Road just a few blocks from the center of the village. 
 Mrs. McLerran, the editor of the Bellport Civic Association's newsletter, describes her walks as full of social potential. She used to drive but now relies solely on her feet. ''When the weather is good I am deliberately inefficient, and I will make many runs downtown,'' she said. ''I think I get my essentials done as efficiently and have a lot more fun doing it.'' 
 Instead of driving four blocks, Joann Pappalardo of Massapequa puts her two sons in a double stroller and walks to the supermarket. On the way, they stop at the Tackapausha Pond on Merrick Road to feed the ducks. ''The still of the morning and the peace of the pond make Long Island the place to live,'' Ms. Pappalardo said. ''It's a win-win situation. The kids are happy, I'm relaxed, and an errand is done.'' 
 Louis Alexander, 81, of Farmingdale, says that people are beating the higher gasoline prices by walking instead. ''Far more people are walking in the past two weeks,'' he said, adding that he now hesitates to drive his 1994 Oldsmobile. But it's not just penny-pinching that has Mr. Alexander and his wife, Frances, 64, regularly walking to downtown Farmingdale. 
 ''The benefit is you see more people and stop and talk,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''It brings a pretty sizable community of Farmingdale to a small town.'' 
 That small-town or downtown sentiment is what the ''smart growth'' movement -- incorporating mixed-use development, higher density and walkability in suburban planning -- is all about. Such communities are meant to be particularly inviting to cyclists and pedestrians.
 ''More folks are leaving vehicles behind,'' said Eric Alexander, the director of Vision Long Island, a nonprofit smart-growth group in Northport.
 Mr. Alexander, who walks the three blocks from his apartment to his office, ticked off the advantages of smart growth. ''The practices of smart growth and livability,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, ''should result in protection of open space and the environment, strengthening of the local economy, improved sense of community, decreased or stabilizing auto congestion, reduction in auto dependency, preservation of historic structures, enhancement of community character and aesthetics, efficient use of public money, safe and secure communities and improvement in overall quality of life.''
 April Crispo, 26, of Deer Park enjoys relaxing weekend walks to nearby shops. ''Commuting Monday through Friday into Manhattan can really get to me, so to take a nice walk and not be rushed or bothered with any type of transportation is a nice change,'' said Mrs. Crispo, a legal secretary who walks a half mile to get her nails done. ''I don't have to be stressed with finding a parking spot, which is very difficult on the weekend.''
 Cyclists are using their bicycles for more than recreation. Craig Fligstein, 36, of Northport is a development consultant for nonprofit agencies and has been biking seriously for 10 years. Though his primary interest is fitness, he uses the bicycle for errands, too. ''I often go food shopping with my bike and backpack,'' he said. ''The grocery stores are very cool about my leaving the bike inside the store. This way I don't have to lock it up outside.'' 
 Gary Sirota, the owner of Brands Cycle in Wantagh, said that in the last couple of months he has noticed an increase in sales of adult tricycles. ''People use them to go shopping,'' Mr. Sirota said. ''They can be locked up like any bike.'' In addition, his bicycle rack sales have increased. ''I sold one to McDonald's in Wantagh, one to a police station, and also to apartment buildings and commercial stores,'' he said. 
 Not all cyclists find their hometowns cycle-friendly. ''Since I live in a downtown, I walk for my daily errands,'' said Neal Lewis, 42, of Massapequa, a lawyer who is the executive director of Long Island Neighborhood Network, an environmental protection group. ''For other things -- grocery, laundry -- I take the car. Taking a bike to the deli, drugstore and other stores is not very convenient. There is usually no place to lock the bike.'' 
 Mr. Lewis lives in an apartment over a delicatessen in a two-story brick building, part of a block of shops. ''I was looking for something pedestrian-friendly,'' Mr. Lewis said, ''a walkable quarter-mile where I could take care of a good portion of my errands.''
 A more pedestrian- and bike-friendly environment may be in the Island's future. The goal of the Long Island Non-Motorized Transportation Study, sponsored by the Metropolitan Transportation Council and the State Department of Transportation, is to ''identify a long-range regional bike and pedestrian plan for all of Long Island with a 25-year time horizon,'' said David Glass, the project manager. 
 A survey was begun six months ago on the study's Web site, www.walkbikeli.com, which lists questions about safety and opportunities for pedestrians and cyclists. So far, it has received more than 750 responses, Mr. Glass said.
 The study is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2004. Mr. Glass said that proposals might include enhancing pedestrian and bicycle access to Long Island Rail Road stations by improving traffic signals, sidewalks and crosswalks; developing ways to teach motorists to respect pedestrians and cyclists; working with Long Island Bus to equip buses with bicycle racks; and working with the Nassau County Health Department to encourage more elementary students to walk to school.
 Last month, Governor Pataki announced $2.7 million in financing for local pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements in eight communities across Long Island: the Villages of Westhampton Beach, Port Washington and Port Jefferson; the Towns of North Hempstead, Southampton, Brookhaven and Huntington; and the City of Long Beach. 
 Long Island has not been the safest place for cycling or walking. According to National Highway Transportation Safety Administration figures for 2002, the most recent available, Nassau ranked 14th in pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities out of 1,249 counties nationwide, and Suffolk ranked 37th.
 Joe De Palma, 48, of Lake Ronkonkoma, a bicycle advocate and a member of the technical advisory committee of the Non-Motorized Transportation Study, takes a cautious attitude when he is behind the handlebars. ''I never ride on a Friday,'' he said. ''Everyone's in a rush to get home. The roads are just horrendous.''
 Mr. Fligstein, the development consultant, said that Northport, his hometown, is bicycle-friendly because the police enforce the 30 m.p.h. speed limit. ''Northport is really a smart growth community, which is why I have chosen to call it my home,'' he said. ''I even found my home in Northport while I was out biking.''

HEADLINE: Changing the Face of Real Estate Developments

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
DESPITE a consensus that Long Island must change its housing and development patterns or face a less livable future, builders seeking approvals to create the kind of pedestrian-friendly, urbanized communities in vogue around the country are meeting skepticism and outright opposition when they try to import these ideas.
 Earlier this month, a consortium of New York developers planning a ''smart growth'' community on the site of the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center pulled out of the project, citing the state's failure to settle land ownership issues. The chorus of cheers from community leaders and Smithtown officials disclosed the lack of meaningful support among civic leaders and local politicians.
 The Kings Park pullout leaves only ''four or five smart-growth type proposals'' under consideration in Nassau and Suffolk, said Eric Alexander, the director of Vision Long Island, a planning organization in Huntington. Nationally, at least 650 such communities have been built or are planned or under construction, according to The New Urban News, a newsletter published in Ithaca, N.Y. These include the Kent Lands in Gaithersburg, Md., University Park in Cambridge, Mass., and CityPlace in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
 In many cities and suburbs, planners, builders, architects and government officials have made the principles of smart growth their common cause. Smart growth, which is sometimes called new urbanism or sustainable development, addresses land preservation, affordable housing and the reduction of sprawl.
 Developers are granted zoning variances that allow them to put up office buildings, stores and multifamily housing on land that would otherwise be restricted to low-density clusters of single-family homes. In return, the developers create parkland, devise alternatives to automobile travel, create appealing Main Streets and add significantly to the supply of lower-cost housing.
 The movement ''is really a return to the practice of how cities developed,'' said Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. 
 But efforts to build smart-growth developments on Long Island have come to naught, so far. Despite a groundswell of support for cheaper housing and reducing traffic congestion and high taxes, developers have been unable to persuade Long Islanders to ease up on two issues: density and rentals.
 In Smithtown, where the town zoning code calls for a minimum lot size of one acre for each single-family house, civic leaders battled the Kings Park developers' original plan to build 3,031 housing units on 361 acres. They negotiated the number of units down to 2,000 and were still fuming when the developers walked away. 
 ''I don't think anybody was against the concept of what they were proposing in terms of smart growth,'' said Frank DeRubeis, Smithtown's town planner. ''People were scared by the numbers.''
 Mr. DeRubeis says that many people unfairly equate higher density with overcrowded schools. ''Smart growth projects bring in people like seniors, young childless couples and single young people,'' he said. ''They aren't the ones sending children to the schools. Those are the people in single-family homes.''
 But the misperception persists, he said. 
 Rental housing is also an evil to be opposed, in the view of many civic leaders and politicians. Neal Lewis, the executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, an environmental protection group, said that adding rental units would help alleviate the region's housing problems but that rentals are routinely opposed by neighborhood groups. ''The assumption is that the socioeconomic status of people who rent is lower than that of the people who own,'' he said. ''It's often a class issue.''
 Two major Long Island projects now being planned both market themselves as smart-growth developments. Heartland Town Plaza, proposed last year, would put as many as 9,000 housing units at the old Pilgrim Psychiatric Center in Brentwood. Old Plainview, proposed earlier this month, would construct 770 housing units on one of the largest remaining undeveloped spaces in Nassau, the 160-acre site of a former tuberculosis hospital in Plainview and Old Bethpage.
 Gerald Wolkoff, who until now has been known mainly as the developer of the Heartland Industrial Park in Brentwood, said he conceived the idea for Heartland Town Square during a visit to CityPlace in West Palm Beach a couple of years ago.
 Mr. Wolkoff said he was stuck by the way CityPlace was designed to pull people to the downtown area and keep them there. He recalled admiring the well-landscaped public areas with their fountains and piped-in music. People sat outside at restaurants and greeted friends and neighbors walking by.
 ''You could walk to everything,'' Mr. Wolkoff said. ''Nothing like Long Island.''
 Mr. Wolkoff said he envisioned Heartland Town Square as accommodating people who often cannot find suitable housing on Long Island: single people and empty-nesters. 
 ''In Manhattan, you go out after work, and every place is jammed for happy hour,'' Mr. Wolkoff said. ''The density makes for great socializing. It's great for young people and people who are divorced and starting over. Where do you have that on Long Island?''
 To attract singles and empty-nesters as residents, Mr. Wolkoff plans to create a vibrant downtown entertainment zone with restaurants, movie theaters and stores that stay open late. ''You could live here and not need a car,'' he said.
 Housing options would range from four-bedroom single-family houses to studio apartments. Ninety-five percent of the units would be rentals, Mr. Wolkoff said. 
 ''Prices might start at $800 or $900 and go up to a couple of thousand dollars,'' he said, slightly below market prices. 
 Charles B. Wang, an owner of the New York Islanders and the former chairman of Computer Associates, is a principal investor in Old Plainview, which takes a different tack. The developers plan to build about 770 housing units, at least two-thirds of which would be privately owned. Prices are expected to begin at about $200,000. 
 Plans call for the rental units to be priced at market rates; there would be no lower-cost units or so-called affordable housing or work-force housing. 
 Old Plainview would set aside 40 acres of parkland, and residents could hop on and off buses along Old Country Road. Office and retail space are planned, and Hyatt Regency plans to build a four-star hotel and conference center on the property, said Abraham Poznanski, a principal in Northern Bay Properties, Mr. Wang's real estate company. 
 ''This is definitely a smart-growth community,'' Mr. Poznanski said. 
 Richard Amper, the executive director of the Pine Barrens Society in Manorville and one of Long Island's leading environmentalists, took issue with that notion. In his view, developers muddy the waters by affixing the smart-growth label to nearly every high-density project.
 ''Developers swing the term 'smart growth' around,'' Mr. Amper said. ''It's a nice-sounding name. It just doesn't have any meaning.''
 Still, he said, Long Islanders need to support projects that are truly smart growth. Why don't they?
 ''Developers have a tradition of paving the place over from west to east,'' Mr. Amper said. ''We're skeptical. We should be skeptical.'' 
 On the other hand, some people may be taking a head-in-the-sand approach or exhibiting what might be called a knee-jerk opposition. ''We know what we need,'' Mr. Amper said. ''Why do we block what we need? It's almost just plain perverse.''

HEADLINE: Waterfront Rentals for Older Adults

BYLINE: By CAROLE PAQUETTE

 BODY:
AFTER being an eyesore for 36 years, the site of a former oil depot in the village of Roslyn along the picturesque wetlands of Hempstead Harbor on Nassau County's north shore is about to take on new life as an upscale rental community for people 55 and over. The development is to include a public waterfront park and promenade that for the first time will connect the harbor to the village's historic downtown, less than a half mile away.
 The 11-acre property on Bendell's Landing Road at the harbor's edge was bought in 1997 by the New York City-based Sterling Glen Communities, which has built nine residences in the Northeast for older people. Four are on Long Island, and another is under way in Lynbrook. 
 Construction will begin next week in Roslyn on the 160-unit, 189,000-square-foot rental apartment building after seven years of public hearings and a $2.5 million environmental cleanup of the site. The $65 million project, named Sterling Glen of Roslyn, is expected to be completed by May 2006. 
 A separate, but similarly designed, 67,000-square-foot building with 50 apartments, named Horizon at Roslyn, will be constructed by the Hauppauge-based Horizon Development on 4.2 acres of the site. Horizon bought the parcel complete with permits intact for $3.3 million and expects to spend $18 million on the building. 
 The $2 million ''wild beach park will have three ponds and will be created by a naturalist who will design it to bring in wildlife typical of wetlands,'' said Michael D. Daly, Sterling Glen's president. 
 THE waterfront promenade will eventually join a proposed walking trail on a 2.5-acre adjacent parcel that Sterling Glen bought from the town of North Hempstead for $850,000 and then donated to the village of Roslyn. The village will create a trail that will provide access to the harborfront from the downtown. 
 In exchange for making this contribution, Sterling Glen received permission to increase the number of units to 210 from 140 through a village development incentive program. Sterling Glen's project will have 160 of the units, and Horizon's, 50. 
 Sterling Glen paid about $1 million for the entire property in a tax foreclosure and paid more than $1 million in back taxes, Mr. Daly said. 
 ''The site had been a mess,'' said Nolan Myerson, Roslyn's deputy mayor. ''It had gas and oil tanks from an old Texaco depot and prior to that had been an ash dumping ground.'' 
 According to Mr. Daly, the Sterling Glen residence will be for the ''active independent person over 55'' but will have optional support services offered by the company's on-site licensed home care service -- which for an additional fee provides services like assistance with bathing.
 Amenities are to include a concierge, a formal 120-seat restaurant, a casual cafe with waterside dining and a 40-seat theater. 
 Of the apartments, 70 percent will have water views, and of those 60 percent will have balconies. Each unit will have a full kitchen with a washer and dryer.
 There will be 90 one-bedroom units of 650 to 750 square feet, which are to rent for $3,500 to $4,500 a month. Twenty other one-bedroom apartments will have an extra room with no window and will range from 750 square feet to 850 and rent for $4,500 to $5,500. There are to be 50 two-bedroom apartments of 850 square feet to 1,200, renting for $5,500 to $7,000. The charge for a second occupant in an apartment would be an additional $800 a month. 
 Included in the monthly rent are daily continental breakfasts, 30 meals in either of the building's two restaurants, weekly housekeeping and linen service and an activities program. There will be a 160-car enclosed garage with latticed walls that will be beneath the building but above ground.
 According to Mr. Daly, the Sterling Glen residence is expected to generate $545,511 in school taxes and $40,103 in village taxes annually. 
 THE adjacent three-story Horizon at Roslyn residence will also have full kitchens and a similar garage, but will not have services like those offered at Sterling Glen, according to David Marom, an owner of Horizon, which is also building a 90-unit condominium nearby in Westbury. 
 The Horizon project will have 10 three-bedroom units, each with a water view and balcony. They are to range in size from 1,500 to 2,400 square feet and to rent for $3,300 to $4,800 a month. There will be 39 two-bedroom apartments of 1,100 to 1,600 square feet, renting at $2,800 to $3,500. There will also be one studio apartment available at a lesser undetermined rent.
 Because it is near Roslyn's historic district, which has houses dating back to the early 20th century, Sterling Glen has worked with the village to preserve the ambience, Mr. Myerson said, adding that one of the village's main concerns was the size of the project.
 To break down the scale of the three-story Sterling Glen building, the facade was designed with various sized wings and porches and a series of raised and lowered pitched roofs, said Paul Whalen, a partner with the Manhattan-based Robert A. M. Stern Architects, which is working on the project in collaboration with SLCE Architects, also of Manhattan. 
 The style will be typical of the early 1900's houses in the historic district but with a variety of new touches, like oval windows, Mr. Whalen said. ''We are taking a turn-of-this-century look at colonial revival and classical revival that is typical of this village,'' he added.
 Since the village was ''especially concerned about vistas, the roof was designed to be attractive'' as it will be visible from Northern Boulevard, a main North Shore road, which runs across a nearby viaduct, Mr. Daly said. All the mechanical equipment is to be out of sight, and kitchen exhausts will be hidden in brick chimneys.

HEADLINE: It's Almost Unanimous

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
AT this stage, the most unusual thing about this week's big economic events is that most analysts, for once, seem to be in close agreement about what is going to happen.
 The major event of the week, of course, is expected to be the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates on Wednesday. And almost all of the 134 predictions tracked by Bloomberg say that Fed policy makers will raise their short-term rate target a quarter point, to 1.25 percent, the first increase in more than four years. 
 As for how much further the Fed will go, Joel Prakken, the chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis, expects a steady stream of quarter-point jumps until the Fed's target reaches 4 percent next year.
 But even if the Fed acts exactly as expected on Wednesday, it's not easy to predict the market reaction. The last time Federal Reserve policy makers announced a well-anticipated rate increase was on June 30, 1999. The market loved it, and the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.4 percent that day.
 The market responded positively then, because analysts interpreted a Fed smoke signal to mean that another rate increase would not be coming soon. 
 They were wrong. The Fed raised the short-term rate another quarter point, to 5.25 percent, at the next meeting in August. But the Dow slipped just 0.1 percent that day. In response to the last 13 Fed rate increases, including the 7 that began in February 1994, the up days barely outnumber the down days, 7 to 6.

HOW MANY JOBS? -- The other significant economic news this week is the June employment report, due on Friday. After months of disappointing jobs growth, the last three months have come in strong, and the same is expected for June. The median of 53 forecasts is for 250,000 new jobs, with a high of 310,000 and a low of 175,000. If the actual number is much stronger than expected, that will probably be bad for stocks.

HEADLINE: In Boulder, Both Boom and Bust

BYLINE: By ALEX MARKELS

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo. 

 BODY:
THE house was quintessential Boulder: a century-old Queen Anne-style cracker box with a little porch overlooking the historic downtown, and behind it, the vertiginous red rock cliffs of the Flatirons -- veritable magnets that have long attracted newcomers to this quirky mountain town on the Rockies' eastern edge. The views were even better from the master bedroom upstairs, where you could just make out the greenbelt of open space that surrounds the city and, off in the distance, the road to Denver, about 25 miles to the southeast.
 A ''cupcake house,'' as its seller described it, the place was only about 1,500 square feet. The lot, too, was small -- just 50 by 65 feet -- and it backed right up to a house just above it on a steep bluff. But to Paula Shepherd, it was ''my little dream house,'' she said, remembering her reaction when she first drove by it in May, a day after it went on the market for $599,000. 
 Evidently, she wasn't the only one who thought so. Despite a local real estate market that had been in the doldrums for several years, there were three offers for the house in three days. Ms. Shepherd's was one of them. And thanks to her real estate agent, who advised her to ''step up to the plate'' with a $605,000 no-contingency bid, her cellphone was soon abuzz with good news. ''Financially, I felt like I was out of my mind,'' the part-time medical technician said of her winning bid. ''But I knew it would pay off because it's Boulder. I see it appreciating.''
 This is an area of two divergent real estate patterns. On the one hand, the market for houses in choicer neighborhoods, like the one where Ms. Shepherd found her house, is strong. But Boulder County's overall housing market has slumped badly because of a weakened economy. For the year ended March 31, the Boulder area ranked next to last -- behind only Austin, Tex. -- for home price appreciation in the nation's 220 largest metropolitan areas, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, logging a scant 1 percent increase for the year, far below the national average of 7.7 percent. 
 Even as some buyers are engaged in bidding wars, some sellers are desperately trying to unload properties and finding no bidders, driving foreclosures to their highest level in a decade. 
 Before the recent slowdown, prices had been rising quickly throughout the 1990's, as companies like Sun Microsystems and Level 3 Communications set up shop here. Surrounded by open space aggressively bought by a forward-looking city, Boulder saw prices grow at 11.6 percent annually through that decade, and surge more than 14 percent in 2001 to an average of $410,000 for a single-family home.
 Even outside the greenbelt, prices climbed just as fast in eastern Boulder County boomtowns like Lafayette and Longmont. Those who couldn't afford to live within the city limits snapped up houses in the outlying subdivisions. ''Boulder County is such a prestigious place to live, we figured the rising tide would lift all boats,'' said Cristin Anson, who, together with her husband, John, bought a small house in Lafayette in 1989 and remodeled it into a 5,600-square-foot showplace.
 But then the recession hit Boulder County. About 30,000 jobs were lost, many of them the high-paying technology jobs that had fueled the real estate boom. Rental vacancy rates surged and desperate landlords began offering up to three months of free rent. New housing developments swelled inventory and eventually depressed the resale market. ''Why buy a house that's three years old when you can buy a new one just down the street for less money?'' said Holly Fernandez, a real estate agent in Boulder. 
 The Ansons, like others who could not maintain the same level of income, began to fall behind on their mortgage payments. Reluctantly, they put the house on the market last fall for $550,000. But it didn't sell. They soon dropped the price by $100,000. Still, no takers. ''Now we're just hoping to sell it for $400,000 and get out,'' said Mrs. Anson, who last month was notified that foreclosure proceedings had commenced.
 Although such scenarios are mostly limited to outlying areas, they helped drive up foreclosures in the county by 67 percent last year, the highest in a decade, according to Boulder County records.
 Even at the high end of the market in Boulder, where speculators had bought $500,000 tear-downs and transformed them into million-dollar-plus McMansions, sellers have been forced to knock hundreds of thousands of dollars off asking prices. ''And some of them still aren't selling,'' said Paul Danish, a Boulder County commissioner, who lives near one such house. ''If a rising tide raised all boats, then a lowering tide is bound to bring them down, too,'' he said. 
 And if interest rates tick up sharply in the months ahead, ''things could get very, very serious,'' said Sandy Hume, Boulder County's public trustee. ''There's a lot of people who have been too optimistic. They've borrowed too much, remodeled too much, speculated too much.''
 Yet Mr. Hume, who oversees foreclosures, thinks people like Ms. Shepherd -- and, if they can hold on, even people like the Ansons -- will make out in the long run. ''We don't have the sprawl that places like Phoenix or south Denver have,'' said Mr. Hume, who noted that foreclosure rates in other areas along Colorado's Front Range are even higher than they are in his county.
 ''All the open space we've purchased and the growth planning we've done has been a net good for development,'' he said. ''Clearly, some people got ahead of themselves. But the truth is, most of us live in a state of grace in Boulder County.''
 At least, that's what Ms. Shepherd is counting on.

Being chosen first in the National Hockey League draft on Saturday was a singular honor for Aleksandr Ovechkin of Russia, but it also thrust him into a changing business climate filled with wrangling and uncertainty.
 When the Washington Capitals took Ovechkin, a 6-foot-2, 200 pound left wing from Dynamo Moscow, he became the second player from Russia to be selected with the first pick over all. The other was Ilya Kovalchuk, by Atlanta in 2001.
 Ovechkin said that he was eager to make his North American debut at the elite World Cup tournament in late summer and that he was capable of playing in the N.H.L. next season. Although both would be rare for an 18-year-old player, most scouts seem to agree with him. 
 ''I've been waiting for this day for two years,'' Ovechkin said. ''If you go first, you are the best. I always want to be the best. Yes, I can play in the N.H.L. I can score goals. I can play defense. I like a physical game. I love hockey.''
 Although the World Cup tournament should proceed as scheduled in late August and early September, the regular season could be delayed by a labor lockout unless N.H.L. owners and the N.H.L. Players Association can negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. The current one expires Sept. 15.
 Even if that is settled, the N.H.L. and the International Ice Hockey Federation need to negotiate a new policy for transfer payments for European players like Ovechkin when they are signed by North American teams.
 In particular, the Russian federation is demanding a better deal. With Ovechkin picked first and Yevgeny Malkin of Russia selected second, by the Pittsburgh Penguins, the Russians have leverage. When a television interviewer asked Ovechkin to greet fans from back home, he smiled and said in his native language: ''Russia, let's go! In Russia, we are the best!''
 Among other intriguing first-round selections was the Rangers' choice of goalie Al Montoya of the University of Michigan with the sixth pick. 
 The Islanders used the 16th pick to take Petteri Nokelainen, a center from Finland; the Rangers traded up with Calgary to choose 19th, selecting Lauri Korpikoski, a forward from Finland; and the Devils traded up with Dallas for the 20th pick to take Travis Zajac, a center from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Of the 30 players selected in the first round, 13 were from Europe, 11 from Canada and 6 from the United States. The Czech Republic led the European nations with four picks.
 The N.H.L. formula for rookie salaries is a dilemma for Washington. Should the Capitals sign Ovechkin before the collective bargaining agreement expires, they would have to pay him $1.295 million in addition to guaranteed performance bonuses that could significantly increase his income.
 Should the Capitals wait for a new labor deal, perhaps in hope that the rookie rates will be decreased, they could alienate Ovechkin, who could return to Russia, play professionally there indefinitely and request that his rights be transferred to another N.H.L. team.
 George McPhee, the general manager of the Capitals, said, ''There's a lot of uncertainty as to what's going to take place in the future, so we'll take our time.''
 Ovechkin's father played professional soccer and his mother won Olympic gold medals in basketball. The N.H.L.'s central scouting report describes Ovechkin as ''a complete package; superb skater; excellent acceleration and top speed; superb stick handler, passer and playmaker; skates well through traffic; superb hockey sense; can hit and take a hit; has all the tools, including attitude, on and off the ice.''
 Although everyone agrees about Ovechkin's skills, not everyone agrees about who holds his rights. Ovechkin said, ''I'm free, I don't have a contract with Dynamo.'' 
 But Don Meehan, his agent, was not so sure. ''He's under contract to date,'' Meehan said, choosing his words carefully. ''In relation to next year, there is an issue involved, a rather complicated issue.''
 Bill Daly, the N.H.L.'s executive vice president and chief legal officer, said, ''I've been told Dynamo has a claim of a contractual status for next year.''
 Rene Fasel, the president of the International Ice Hockey Federation, said by telephone from Switzerland that he would travel to Moscow on Monday to try to negotiate with the Russian federation, which wants a separate agreement for transfer fees for its players, something that the N.H.L. is resisting.
 Until now, the league has dealt only with the international federation, which has distributed money among European teams for transfers. Fasel said the Russians, under the old agreement, would have received $220,000 to $250,000 for Ovechkin's rights. ''He is worth more,'' Fasel said. ''He is one of the reasons the Russians do not want to join the other European teams.''
 Ovechkin indicated that he understood his economic value. One of his ambitions, he said, was to buy a new car, a BMW.

Bonk in Three-Team Trade
 In a three-team trade Saturday, Montreal acquired Ottawa forward Radek Bonk and Los Angeles goaltender Cristobal Huet.
 The Senators traded Bonk to the Kings for a third-round pick, then Los Angeles dealt him and Huet to Montreal for goalie Mathieu Garon and the Canadiens' third-round choice, No. 95 in the draft. With that pick, Los Angeles selected Paul Baier, a defenseman from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts.
 Bonk is due to become a restricted free agent Thursday, and the Senators would have had to make a $3.5 million qualifying offer to retain his rights. (AP)

HEADLINE: Talk Is Revived Of Legalized Sports Betting

BYLINE: By JENNIFER GOLDBLATT

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
AS opportunities to play the slots grow just beyond New Jersey's borders, some political and business leaders are reviving a campaign to bring sports betting to Atlantic City. They say it could provide something this city hasn't had in more than a decade: a monopoly on a type of gambling.
 ''Sports betting is a good opportunity to remain competitive and, more than the actual revenue, it would create more of a tourist destination,'' said Assemblyman Jeff Van Drew, a Democrat from Cape May. ''We know that there's going to be increased competition. And this is an opportunity for Atlantic City to offer an activity that's unique.''
 The idea of adding another form of legal gambling comes as the city is in the middle of a vast makeover intended to lure a hipper, more-well-heeled crowd that wants to do more than just play the slots. 
 But before any New Jerseyan can slap down 10 bucks here on the Jets to win the next Super Bowl, this part of Atlantic City's makeover will need some extreme luck. Even if supporters of sports betting can overcome stiff, organized opposition, a waltz with the federal courts would be required and then a wooing of the state's voters to approve a constitutional amendment. Still, there are those in the state who are optimistic.
 Legalized sports betting is just one of the ways that Atlantic City wants to put distance between itself and its other gambling competitors. The city's casinos are in the middle of adding 3,353 hotel rooms and developing nearly one million square feet of upscale eating, shopping and meeting facilities. The hope is that the investment will bring even more people to the city, and help elevate it to a Las Vegas-caliber destination. The number of visitors to Atlantic City has been flat in recent years, in the 32 million to 33 million range.
 ''Las Vegas is the mecca of gaming in the world,'' said Dennis Gomes, president of the Casino Association of New Jersey and president of resort operations for Aztar, the Tropicana's corporate parent. ''Atlantic City could at least be the mecca of gaming in the Eastern half of the United States, no matter what develops around us.'' This fall, the Tropicana will open the Quarter, a $265 million 1940's-style, Havana-themed complex that will include a 502-room hotel tower, and shops like Brooks Brothers and bluemercury spa.
 ''The more things we're able to provide,'' Mr. Gomes said, ''the more we'll be able to become that mecca.''
 In Las Vegas, at least half of all revenue comes from nongambling sources, like hotel stays, restaurants, retail and entertainment. In Atlantic City, nongambling activity generates less than 10 percent of revenue, Mr. Gomes said. Las Vegas's gaming revenue totaled $6.1 billion in 2003, while Atlantic City's was $4.5 billion.
 Gambling expansion is considered all but certain in Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York, the states from which Atlantic City gets most of its visitors. For Atlantic City, it is considered crucial to provide more than the possibility of repetitive stress injury in pursuit of a big payoff.
 ''If your goal is to pull a lever on a slot machine,'' said Jeff Vasser, executive director of the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Bureau, ''you're not going to have to travel very far from home in the not-too-distant future.''
 No one expects that sports betting alone will be a jackpot. While about $1.9 billion was wagered on sports in Nevada last year, that amounted to just 1 percent of all money wagered there, according to the state's gaming control board. In addition, bets on sports there have been slipping for the past decade. Experts attribute that to the illegal market and the explosive growth of the Internet, where sports betting is the most popular form of gambling, accounting for about half of all wagers. Bettors spent $2.6 billion on Internet sports bets last year, a figure expected to swell by 130 percent by 2010, according to Christiansen Capital Advisors, a New York gambling research firm.
 The allure of sports betting is its potential to draw hordes of people to the casinos for major events like the Super Bowl and N.C.A.A. basketball's Final Four. About a quarter-million people traveled to Las Vegas for Super Bowl weekend earlier this year, many of them to attend opulent Super Bowl parties at the casinos. The occupancy rate at the city's hotels swelled to 95.8 percent, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, and the nongambling economic impact hovered at around $100 million.
 ''During these premier athletic events, the casinos and entertainment venues are packed,'' said Joe Lupo, vice president of operations at Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, who previously oversaw the sports book for the Stardust in Las Vegas. Mr. Lupo estimates that Atlantic City casinos could draw about $1 billion in sports bets a year.
 ''We'd see people come in here and stay for March Madness and over the Super Bowl,'' he said, ''and see hotel and restaurant revenue increase.''
 The opposition, however, has already readied itself for a battle in Atlantic City.
 Jay Moyer, special counsel to the National Football League, testified before the Assembly's Tourism and Gaming Committee last month that sports betting would threaten the public confidence in the integrity of the sport, and send a bad message to young athletes. 
 National Collegiate Athletic Association officials say they are watching the debate closely. ''We are very concerned about what New Jersey may be considering,'' said Bill Saum, the N.C.A.A.'s director of agent, gambling and amateurism activities.
 And Tom Grey, executive director of the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, said that New Jersey is a crucial battleground for the issue. ''If we do not stop it and they are able to expand it,'' he said, ''we'll see New York, that its casinos have to have it. We'll see a stampede for widespread sports betting.'' 
 With so many states looking to expand gambling, he added, ''this would be a pivotal battle.''
 Opposition or not, those involved in Atlantic City's gambling industry believe that sports betting could also help draw a new generation of visitors. The average Atlantic City visitor is 55 years old, contrasted to 50 in Las Vegas. Last fall, Atlantic City adopted ''Always Turned On'' as its marketing slogan, and the Borgata is trying to lure the 25-to-39 set by marketing itself as energetic and sensual, offering amenities like showers built for two, in-room high-speed Internet access and restaurants that serve Asian-Latin fusion fare and turn into nightclubs as evening sets in.
 Still, there is a long way to go to transform a city awash in rainbow and aquamarine color schemes, where sequined bartenders croon show tunes while mixing bloody mary's, matzo-ball soup is a fixture on buffet menus, and rather than stroll the boardwalk, visitors can hire people to push them in rolling chairs.
 The debate over sports betting in New Jersey was last alive a decade ago. In 1992, with the help of a major drive from former United States Senator Bill Bradley, Congress banned sports betting in every state except Oregon, Montana, Delaware and Nevada, which had had it before. At the time, the prospect of riverboat gambling and Indian casinos loomed. New Jersey was given until the end of 1993 to get a bill out to citizens to vote on, but legislation stalled.
 Now, as surrounding states seek new revenue streams, competition has emerged again.
 In Maryland and Pennsylvania, debate has focused on where and how to legalize slot machines. Pennsylvania's governor, Edward G. Rendell, is pushing for slots at racetracks and elsewhere to help lower property taxes. In Maryland, some lawmakers want slots to help close a budget shortfall. In New York, slots arrived at three racetracks earlier this year, and they are authorized for five more. There are four Indian casinos up and operating and authorization for four more. That includes one in Sullivan County, which would put gambling just 90 miles away from New York City, about 35 miles closer than Atlantic City. Earlier this month, Gov. George E. Pataki signed an agreement with the Cayuga Indian Nation, which laid the groundwork for that facility.
 In New Jersey, lawmakers would have to get an exemption from the federal sports betting ban. But that is something that Mr. Van Drew, the assemblyman, is optimistic about, since sports betting does not involve interstate commerce.
 ''If we challenge it, we have a significant opportunity to overturn it,'' said Mr. Van Drew, who chairs the Assembly's Tourism and Gaming Committee. ''This would be purely intrastate, it would begin and terminate in the state with no exchange of goods and services across state lines.''
 If New Jersey were to get an exemption from the federal courts, a state constitutional amendment, authorized by the state's voters, would then be required.
 Mr. Van Drew expects another state-level hearing on sports betting by the early fall.
 Louis Greenwald, the Assembly's budget committee chairman and a Camden County Democrat, also supports sports betting. He has suggested that the state's share of revenue from sports bets could be used to help bolster the state's charity care fund, which helps pay for the uncompensated care New Jersey hospitals provide.
 Representative Frank LoBiondo also supports sports betting in the state. ''It's an opportunity we missed 10 years ago, and that was a mistake,'' Mr. LoBiondo said. ''It would certainly fit nicely into what is already a well-established and strictly run gaming industry. It's a natural extension.''
 Governor McGreevey has not taken a position on sports betting. ''But he is certainly interested in anything that might provide more revenue for seniors, as the casino revenue has done,'' said Micah Rasmussen, the governor's spokesman. ''It's something we'd certainly take a look at. At the same time, we're aware of the federal limitations that would have to be overcome.''
 Proponents of sports betting and industry say that bringing sports betting to the state is a bit of a long shot. ''The industry would certainly welcome it,'' said Michael Pollock, publisher of the Gaming Industry Observer. ''But my sense is it's largely viewed as somewhat quixotic.''
 A recent effort nearby to get sports betting did not get far. In Delaware, where taxes on slot play are the fourth-largest source of revenue to the state's general fund, and nearly half of the state's players come from Maryland and Pennsylvania, officials from the state's three combination racetracks and casinos pushed for sports betting last year. 
 They argued that sports betting, which had been dormant in the state, would draw about $150 million in wagers annually and create an East Coast gaming monopoly. But Delaware's governor, Ruth Ann Minner, was opposed, and religious groups and major league sports officials rallied against it, and the discussion died.

HEADLINE: Camden's Billion-Dollar Gamble

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
DAY after day, Mary Cortes races around Cramer Hill in her late-model black Mustang, handing out bumper stickers that say ''Don't Tread on Me'' and signs with the word ''Cherokee'' crossed out by a large red slash.
 On one such foray, Ms. Cortes found a willing recipient in Margaret Grossmick, who now has one of the signs hanging from the front porch of her tan, two-story house on Harrison Avenue -- a last-ditch effort to save her home of 48 years from being torn down in the name of progress and prosperity. 
 ''My husband and I have lived in Cramer Hill all our lives,'' said the 72-year-old Ms. Grossmick, reaching for an inhaler tucked beneath the elasticized neckline of her pink polyester blouse. ''We struggled paying off our mortgage, then we got siding six or seven years ago. Then we bought the lots next door. We've got it nice here and now they're saying we have to go.'' 
 Ms. Grossmick and her husband are among the 1,200 families facing an uncertain future if a redevelopment plan with a price tag of almost $1.3 billion for this working-class neighborhood in northwest Camden -- home to a predominantly Hispanic population with a sprinkling of blacks and whites -- is passed by the City Council as expected on Wednesday. 
 For decades, this section of Camden -- physically cut off from the rest of the city by railroad tracks and two rivers -- has been largely ignored by government officials, a condition underscored by the rutted roads, shattered streetlights and a perpetual flooding problem. 
 But these days Cramer Hill, with its two-mile-long stretch along the Delaware and across the river from Philadelphia, is the latest object of desire among planners, who are shifting their focus from the waterfront downtown to this upriver neighborhood that abuts Pennsauken. 
 Around the country, urban planners have seized on the realization that waterfront land offers the greatest potential for economic revitalization. Through millions of dollars in public subsidies and tax incentives, cities have made great strides trying to duplicate the success of the Inner Harbor in Baltimore or the Riverwalk in San Antonio. There are few locations where this phenomenon more apparent than at the northern end of the state, where development along the Hudson River in Jersey City and what is known as the Gold Coast -- embracing once-gritty towns like Secaucus, West New York, Guttenberg and North Bergen -- has transformed the riverfront into a miles-long stretch of office towers, high-end town houses, condominiums and fashionable shops and restaurants. 
 Now Camden -- the state's poorest city, so depleted in resources and spirit that headline writers long ago grew weary of grasping at adjectives to describe its deprivations -- is poised to reach for its golden ring with the help of the state and private industry. The state stepped in two years ago with a $175 million bailout package, most of which has already gone toward improvements to Cooper Hospital and the state and county colleges. With just $35 million in aid left, Camden officials began looking toward private investors, like Cherokee Investment Partners of North Carolina, who last December were chosen for the $1.298 billion redevelopment of Cramer Hill.
 With plans to build 6,000 new homes, 500,000 square feet of commercial space, a marina, and perhaps most unlikely of all -- an 18-hole golf course on the long-abandoned Harrison Avenue landfill -- over the next 10 years, the redevelopment plan would be one of the largest such projects the state has undertaken. 
 For the City of Camden, the potential is even more significant: if private companies -- in this case, Cherokee -- can be lured to invest in Camden, and in the process reinvent a neighborhood, why not spread the wealth to other sections of the city that are in far worse condition?
 ''The private sector said, 'We believe in this neighborhood and are prepared to invest a substantial amount of money,''' said Melvin R. Primas, a former mayor here who Governor McGreevey appointed to oversee the city's revitalization effort. ''Camden has not been in this position for many years. We now have developers looking all over Camden.'' 
 For many of Camden's residents, 46 percent of whom live at or below the poverty line, the contemplation of such sweeping change is daunting. Where city and state officials see prosperity, many wary residents envision neighborhoods being gentrified to the point where they will be forced out and left with few places to move in the city or surrounding suburbs.
 Indeed, Mr. Primas acknowledged that according to the city's master plan, every neighborhood here will be designated a redevelopment zone, giving it the right to acquire properties through eminent domain. 
 In Cramer Hill alone, up to 1,000 houses and 21 businesses are listed ''to be acquired,'' while another 200 houses and 19 businesses ''may be acquired'' (plus an additional 64 homes to be razed to make way for a new elementary school). More than 500 of these homes are in two government-subsidized housing projects: Ablett Village, run by the Camden Housing Authority, and Centennial Village, a privately owned apartment complex that is largely subsidized by the federal government. 
 Over the past several months, much of the discussion at two planning board meetings -- where the redevelopment plan passed unanimously despite the presence of about 800 angry residents -- focused on the displacement of the public housing residents. 
 For now, the Cramer Hill plan calls for building 1,200 affordable homes -- sprinkled among new homes that will sell for as much as $200,000 -- to offset some of the public housing that is to be torn down, and city officials have promised residents that they will have the chance to move back into the neighborhood or elsewhere in the city.
 Nevertheless, many questions have arisen over what constitutes ''affordable'' in a poverty-riddled city and where the poorest residents will be able to go.
 Arijit De, executive director of the Camden Redevelopment Agency, insists that residents of Ablett Village will be given priority in the city's other public housing projects and will continue to pay the same rent; those living in Centennial Village will be given vouchers that can be used for similar rent-subsidized apartments. 
 ''Nobody is going to be rendered homeless,'' Mr. De said. ''We are asking you to believe that we are here looking out for your interests.''
 But Olga Pomar, a lawyer from South Jersey Legal Services who is representing the families in the two housing projects as well as many homeowners and businesses in the neighborhood, contends that the overall number of public housing units in the city has been reduced by about 30 percent in the past 10 years and that the competition for existing units is fierce. 
 Currently, there are 373 people on the waiting list for public housing similar to the units scheduled for demolition at Ablett Village, according to Ms. Pomar, who also pointed out that the number of landlords willing to accept vouchers for rent subsidies has also dropped.
 ''Even though they may not love Ablett and Centennial, they represent a very valuable resource for the city,'' Ms. Pomar said, ''one that in this current funding climate we can't afford to lose.''
 Moreover, city planners agree that Camden, the recipient of four large public housing grants from the federal government over the last 10 years, is unlikely to receive any more; President Bush has repeatedly tried to slash funds for public housing. 
 Bruce Katz of the Brookings Institution's Center on Urban and Metropolitan Housing called the endangered federal housing program the most effective one for providing new housing and revitalizing tough neighborhoods in the last 50 years, but said its future ''would depend on the election, if we have a pro-housing government or not.''
 Regardless of the status of the federal program, city planners say they have no desire to build another housing project in Cramer Hill, but rather want to scatter the affordable housing throughout the area.
 ''We are not going to build a large low-income property in Cramer Hill,'' Mr. Primas said. ''We don't want to build pockets of poverty. We have the lessons of many years to learn from, to do it right this time.''
 From his perspective, Mr. Katz warned that city planners trying to turn around deteriorating neighborhoods not lose sight of the residents. ''Some public housing agencies have paid more attention to the redevelopment than the housing,'' he said. ''They haven't paid attention to the needs of the families or provided enough support to families before and after they move.'' 
 While many in Camden are willing to trust city officials' promises to protect the interests of public housing residents, it is the homeowners -- many of whom are not much better off than those living in public housing -- whose status seems far less certain.
 To try to attract private developers, city planners came up with an ambitious vision that included far more land than a contaminated landfill or vacant lots scattered throughout the neighborhood. ''We've often focused on filling in the gaps, applying Band-Aids,'' Mr. De said. ''That's been the history. Here there was the opportunity to assemble enough land to have a real impact, that a large-scale change in the environment was in fact conceivable.''
 Of the developers who responded to the city's request for proposals last year, Mr. De said, Cherokee was the only one to come back with a ''holistic response'' -- a plan that would allow for the removal of about 700 private homes in areas desirable for redevelopment. Yet with some homes and businesses dating back more than a century, local residents feared not only the loss of their houses or workplaces but also the history and character of Cramer Hill. 
 The one-square-mile neighborhood got its start in the late 1800's, when a real estate developer, Alfred Cramer, came up with the idea of selling building lots to working people on monthly installment plans. By 1897, he had sold 5,000 lots in Cramer Hill and East Camden, and by World War II, much of the present housing stock was in place.
 To some, Cramer Hill is best known as the site where Howard Unruh passed through a barber shop, a drugstore, and a local tailor shop on 32nd Street on a September morning in 1949, killing 13 people in 12 minutes. 
 Today, Cramer Hill is a quiet neighborhood, with one of the city's more stable residential populations and a healthy business district along River Road. Hispanics make up 65 percent of the area's 10,000 residents, and about a third of the people live below the poverty line, according to the 2000 Census. 
 A survey conducted by the Hillier Group, a private architectural firm, for the purposes of creating a redevelopment plan concluded that 28 percent of the area's 3,816 parcels of land was substandard or deteriorating, thereby fulfilling one of the state's criteria for a redevelopment designation. The drive-by survey found that 35 percent of the homes were in poor condition and 60 percent were in fair condition, according to the head of the Camden planning board, Charles Lyons Jr., though he acknowledged that the assessments were ''subjective'' and based solely on exterior examination.
 Ms. Cortes, a teacher's aide who has been leading the fight to block the Cherokee development, said the findings were not a surprise. In an effort to avoid attention -- both of the tax assessor and would-be thieves -- Ms. Cortes said many of her neighbors did not worry what the outside of their houses look like. But behind the patchwork vinyl siding and occasional boarded up windows, residents have worked to build their own notion of heaven, Ms. Cortes said 
 ''We are not a blighted area,'' said Ms. Cortes, who bought a four-bedroom split level house on Arthur Avenue 10 years ago for $27,000. ''I have seen shacks that are falling apart turned into mansions.''
 Mike Hagan, a native of Cramer Hill, moved to San Francisco in the 1970's then returned in 1985 to be closer to his mother and bought what is referred to locally as ''the Castle,'' a blue, three-story turreted house on 32nd Street near the Delaware.
 ''This used to be the dumps, the wrong side of the tracks,'' said Mr. Hagan, who bought the house -- then in foreclosure -- for $4,727 and like many in the neighborhood has lived mortgage-free for many years. ''Now it's a real estate land grab in the guise of redevelopment.'' 
 Mr. Hagan, a part-time house painter and pianist, went on: ''It's the American dream to have a house paid for. These are people who paid off their houses long ago and thought they were good to go for the rest of their lives.''
 To allay such concerns, Mr. Lyons said that homeowners who have maintained their properties and do not owe taxes will be paid the full appraised value for their homes and will be provided relocation assistance. 
 Recent census data lists the median price for a home in Cramer Hill at $42,900, but Mr. Lyons said homes in the area have been selling for $60,000 to $85,000 in the last 90 days. In addition, state guidelines provide homeowners with up to $15,000 in relocation aid, which Mr. Lyons said would be paid for by the developer.
 ''If you are in a two-bedroom home and you have paid off your mortgage, we will make sure you're in another two-bedroom home in or as near to Cramer Hill as you care to be,'' said Mr. Lyons, adding that the city will ''attempt to equalize the cost, within reason.'' 
 Still, some have questioned why established neighborhoods had to be included in the redevelopment, rather than focusing on upgrading the public housing and cleaning up the 96-acre Harrison Avenue landfill. 
 For their part, city officials said there was no incentive for a private developer to simply clean up the landfill, an assessment supported by the head of Cherokee.
 ''We looked at individual sites and concluded that we needed to improve a larger area to make it worthwhile,'' said the chief executive of Cherokee, Tom Darden. ''There are not much economics in a golf course. If you're trying to support the closure of a landfill with a golf course, it's not feasible.''
 Others are challenging the value of an 18-hole golf course is planned for one of the poorest cities in the United States -- particularly when there is neither a movie theater nor a soccer field in all of Camden. They see the course as symbolic of the kind of gentrification they fear for the neighborhood, separating the haves -- who will be living in homes worth as much as $200,000 or more -- from the have-nots.
 ''Golf is a little rarefied for the population,'' said Howard Gillette, a professor at Rutgers University-Camden who is finishing a book on the history of Camden. ''But it is not too rarefied to attract those middle- to upper-middle-class people they're trying to get.'' 
 For Cherokee, one of the nation's largest companies involved in the remediation of brownfields, building golf courses has offered one of the most affordable and expedient solutions for recycling contaminated land. In fact, the company is currently building two courses on 700 acres of landfill in the Meadowlands, and four weeks ago proposed another billion-dollar, mixed-use development for Pennsauken's waterfront. 
 While the City Council appears virtually certain to approve the Cramer Hill project, skeptics are concerned about where the money is going to come from, particularly the public financing. Included in the plan as ''potential funding sources'' are $100 million from the state's Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, $75 million from the state Department of Community Affairs, $50 million from the federal Department of Transportation, and $35 million from the Camden Recovery Board for neighborhood improvement. At this point, however, none of those agencies have committed themselves to this project.
 Mr. Primas said parts of the plan, like a new $100 million bridge across the Cooper River and the affordable housing units, will be covered by public subsidy, while the market-rate housing and retail development will be the responsibility of private developers. Cherokee will pay for the landfill remediation, but can expect to recoup 75 percent of that cost through tax credits and environmental cleanup funds, Mr. Primas said.
 ''The redevelopment plan is a general plan,'' he noted. ''It hasn't been costed out to the penny. ''These are rough numbers, what we think it's going to cost. Once we get the plan approved, then we can begin the process of negotiations.''

HEADLINE: A Political Convention, With Beats

BYLINE: By TAMMY LA GORCE

DATELINE: Newark 

 BODY:
THE political conventions will always be with us this summer. Or, at least, it will seem that way as the Republicans and the Democrats put on their quadrennial revues in New York and Boston. Then, there will also be the covey alternative conventions. But one political convention has already come and gone. And if you blinked -- or don't listen to rap -- you may have missed it.
 The National Hip-Hop Political Convention was held here June 16-June 19 with the goal, according to its Web site, of creating ''a political agenda for the hip-hop generation.'' The phrase ''stupid white men'' floated freely throughout the four days. 
 The convention, according to its organizers -- a loose collective of politicians, writers and activists -- attracted 600 delegates and 2,300 others from 33 states. It offered up a mix of politics and culture, including rap artists like Busta Rhymes, Rah Digga, Floetry and Chuck D, who lately is a talk-show host on the Air America radio network.
 So, here are a few snapshots from a political convention that had panel topics like ''Why We Don't Have Any Money: Reparations, Gentrification and Your Bad-Ass Credit.''
 No sightings of Young Republicans were reported.

Which Way Is Newark?
 Of course, when you're dealing with thousands of 20-somethings, getting anywhere can be part of the adventure. Kevin Burke took a $10 bus from Boston's Chinatown to New York's Chinatown, then caught a ride to Newark.
 ''You're dealing with young people, and they don't have the same resources,'' said Bakari Kitwana, a writer and one of the convention's co-founders. In some cases, they wanted to come but they can't reserve hotels because they don't have credit cards. There's one woman here who caught a flight from Chicago to Cleveland for $80, and then took the bus. People are doing what they can to get here, but it's not always easy.''

Old Roots, New Roots
 Before the opening-day platitudes and welcomes from Gayle Chaneyfield Jenkins, a Newark councilwoman at-large, and Hector Ward, a Newark councilman, the convention's co-chairman, Baye Adofo-Wilson, said that those attending should be mindful of the convention's opening and closing dates: Tupac Shakur's birthday was the 16th, and Juneteenth -- June 19 -- was the day in 1865 day when slaves in Texas were told of their freedom. 
 The rapper Doug E. Fresh, in Mushmouth cap and sunglasses, asserted that the convention was ''about mobilization. Us watching them'' -- the politicians -- ''step by step, move by move'' to keep them accountable.

After the Raps, Vote
 A Youth Summit aimed at high school students drew 400 people on opening day and found Afi Daitey, a cheerful 17-year-old finishing her junior year at the Morristown-Beard School, feeling optimistic about the future and her culture's role within it. 
 ''Hip-hop is such a big phenomenon,'' Ms. Daitey said. ''It's time for us to have a political voice.'' Of the music that brought them together, she added: ''There's violence and an overuse of the n-word. And that gets on my nerves. But positive things are going to come out of it.''
 Teenagers checked each other out to the thumping bass issuing from the Essex County College gymnasium speakers before Cousin Jeff, a BET political commentator, dug into the topic ''Taking My Life to the Next Level.'' 
 Teenage pregnancy, poverty and political apathy got the not-too-preachy treatment, and Rock the Vote's make-a-difference message was reinforced as the crowd was reminded that ''the hip-hop generation is 33 percent of the total American electorate, and most of them did not vote in 2000.''

They Got Issues
 A pit-like private room in the rear of Flavas restaurant on the night of June 17 was the site of ''Sistas Rant Fest,'' sponsored by the convention's women's caucus and a New York City nonprofit, We Got Issues. After a pink-haired discussion leader vented her frustration at men in politics who dictate ''what I can and can't do with my body,'' an Asian-American participant in a red minidress and fingerless red gloves countered that ''men can't even fathom the enormous amount of power we have.'' 
 Later, talk turned to the graphic sexuality in Li'l Kim's lyrics. ''I'm like, come on -- she in her 30's now,'' one woman said. 
 ''She taught women to devalue their bodies,'' added a Whoopi Goldberg look-alike. ''If we're going to buy your records, change what you're speaking about.''

Singing the Questions
 On the night of June 18 in Military Park, hands-in-the-air sets by MC Lyte, Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick give way to Wyclef Jean and a song that resonated with the crowd long after Mr. Jean finished singing.
 ''If I Was President'' meaningfully speculates about the fate of a black president in the United States, wonders aloud whether he or she could serve a full four years -- or end up assassinated.

Hip-Hop, Don't Stop
 The energy at the ''historic national vote,'' held in Essex County College's gym on June 19, was palpable as delegates from each state power-huddled before presenting their agendas. After the speeches, five topics to be tackled at the local level were agreed upon: education, criminal justice, economic justice, health care and human rights.
 When Chuck D, formerly of Public Enemy, arrived, the gym echoed with whoops and foot-stomps. He passionately addressed the generation that he had helped establish, restating his message of hip-hop upheaval. 
 In a telephone conversation after the convention, Chuck D talked about its importance: ''It's time for a redefinition in hip-hop. How can the music be 25-years-old, and at the same time we're always addressing the youth? In the media it's always 'hip-hop youth,' and I consider that derogatory. Anybody over 18 in the hip-hop nation needs to consider themselves adults.
 ''In this culture exploited by big business, there's still real people who do real things -- feed people, clothe people, house people. We as adults have to use this art form to address real things.''

Busta Rhymes, and Reasons
 On the final night, 2,000 hip-hop fans stormed Military Park for an old-school-style music festival. Busta Rhymes, Rah Digga and Floetry, lighted up the night, rocking the park till past midnight to hand-clapping, full-body-bouncing appreciation.
 Leo Jackson, a delegate from Minneapolis, mouthed every fierce word Busta Rhymes rapped. ''I was like five when this music came out,'' he said. ''They started the movement, and they're still sending the message. They're connecting us to it. It's what we're going to take back with us.''

HEADLINE: 135 Days of Counting Sideways

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE stock market has been in pause mode for 135 days. That stall is likely to continue for a while, because the 20.5 percent surge in corporate profits expected for the second quarter and the 947,000 jobs created since March are not enough to offset the bad news from Iraq, the uncertainty of a presidential election year and $40-a-barrel oil.
 ''Given how good the profits and jobs numbers have been, one might have expected the market to have moved higher by now,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, the chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman Sachs. ''The waiting game,'' she added, ''may continue until there is clarification on Iraq, energy prices and the election.'' 
 How long could the market be stuck? A hint comes from history, which shows that these sideways periods have occurred fairly regularly and have sometimes been painfully long. This market pause is already the eighth longest of 12 since 1983, based on the performance of the Dow Jones industrial average. In the 11 previous cases, the Dow often touched new highs while mired in these trading ranges, but stocks then slipped again and, over all, there was no definite trend in the market. The average rise during these periods was 3.5 percent. 
 The longest market pause since 1983, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm in Westport, Conn., was in a period that in some ways was a mirror image of the current one. That trading range, during which the Dow rose 5 percent in the 310 days from Feb. 19 to Dec. 26, 1991, came after the Persian Gulf war and during a jobless economic recovery. At the moment, of course, the United States is bogged down in Iraq, but the number of jobs is growing.
 The shortest of the 11 pauses was 87 days, from March 23 to June 18, 1987. The average length of the 11 episodes -- before the current one -- was 181 days.
 When the market broke out of these trading ranges, in 8 out of the 11 cases it rose over the next three months. After the 1991 pause, for example, the Dow climbed 6 percent; after some other pauses, however, the gains were tiny. The sharpest decline came after a 232-day market pause that ended on Dec. 31, 1999. That turned out to be just days before the Dow touched its all-time closing high and then began a three-year plunge. In the next three months, the Dow fell 5 percent.
 For the market to go much higher, investors must be willing to buy stocks. One way to gauge that willingness is to look at what analysts call the equity risk premium. It compares the return on stocks, calculated as a yield, to that on government bonds and shows how much extra return investors are demanding to take the added risk of buying stocks. The higher the risk premium, the more worried investors are.
 Based on several current measures of that premium, investors are pretty wary. 
 A global measure followed by Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International, shows that the equity risk premium in world stock markets is now twice what it was at the end of the 1990's, when investors seemed willing to ignore all risk in stocks. The premium has been higher only a few times. One was in March, when terrorists bombed trains in Madrid and attacks accelerated in Iraq. Another was in August 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and oil prices started a run up to $40 a barrel.
 Another version of the measure, focusing on American markets, compares the yield of the earnings for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to that of the Treasury's 10-year note. That equity risk premium is now 8.4 percentage points, according to Thomson Financial. That means investors now demand 8.4 points more return from stocks than bonds.
 That risk premium is below the high of 9.4 points in September 2002 and the 9-point reading in March this year. But it is well above the average of 7.2 points since January 1987.
 Mike Thompson, director of research at Thomson Financial, says that if the Federal Reserve begins raising short-term interest rates this week, as expected, investors may demand even higher returns from stocks before they are willing to make a commitment to them.
 On the other hand, it is possible that the high risk premium means that investors have already discounted rising interest rates, high oil prices and turmoil in Iraq. 
 Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, says that if this is the case, the high premium ''suggests that if the bad news moderates, there is some material upside for the stock market.''

HEADLINE: Befriending the Hudson

 BODY:
Only 30 years ago, the Hudson River was little more than a 350-mile-long sewer stretching from the Adirondacks to the Battery in Manhattan, choked with untreated municipal waste and industrial chemicals. Today, thanks to state and federal clean water laws and citizen vigilance, the river pulses with life. The fish are more numerous than they have been in years, boating is booming, and towns that once turned their backs on the river teem with tourists.
 But the Hudson is not home free, which makes the new Hudson River Congressional Caucus a welcome addition to the ranks of the river's advocates. The caucus was formed by three House members from Westchester County -- Nita Lowey, a Democrat, and John Sweeney and Sue Kelly, both Republicans -- and includes eight others. Its first objective is to find money to build the rivers and estuaries center in Beacon, an educational and research facility proposed by Gov. George Pataki four years ago. Its longer-range mission is to round up support for open space preservation, waterfront restoration and economic development. 
 These are laudable goals. But they are not necessarily compatible goals. Careless management of commercial and residential pressures, for example, will inevitably undermine the river's ecological integrity as well as the landscapes and unhurried way of life that appeal to residents and tourists alike. A case in point is the unresolved struggle over a company's plans to build an enormous new cement plant on the east bank of the river just south of Hudson, N.Y. The plant is billed as economic development, but it would be an eyesore in a region increasingly dependent on cultural tourism.
 Caucus members say they hope to steer clear of such conflicts, but they are fooling themselves if they think they can avoid hard choices. To take another example, they want no part of the lingering controversies surrounding the Environmental Protection Agency's decision in 2001 requiring General Electric to clean up the PCB's the company dumped into the river years ago. The caucus says this is already a done deal. True, but the actual cleanup will not begin until 2006. The caucus can exercise an important oversight function by making sure there is no backsliding. It can hardly call itself a true friend of the river otherwise.

HEADLINE: Top Relievers Earning Saves By Putting Out Others' Fires

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The remaking of the major league bullpen has begun, only a year after the status quo was starting to look invincible. 
 During the first few months of this season, teams have taken baby steps away from the bullpen model of the last two decades, in which managers essentially allowed a single statistic to dictate their strategy. Closers took the mound only when they could be awarded a save and usually when that save would be as easy as possible. Entering the game with the bases empty and pitching no more than an inning became the norm. 
 Who, after all, would want Eric Gagne, the nastiest reliever in years, getting your team out of a jam when you could have a journeyman trying to do so? As a matter of fact, some of today's managers would.
 The game's established closers -- the ones who have been doing the job for at least a couple of seasons -- are coming into more games this year when a runner is on base than they did in either of the last two years. One-sixth of their appearances in 2004 have come with a runner on, up from one-eighth last year. The closers are also pitching longer than an inning slightly more frequently than in the past. And the portion of their appearances that do not qualify for saves, such as when they enter a tie game, has risen to 41 percent this year from 37 percent in 2003. It is all a small triumph of good sense over tradition. 
 ''There's more of a situational awareness,'' said Chris Antonetti, assistant general manager of the Cleveland Indians. The idea, he added, is to ''use your best relievers at the most critical, highly leveraged point in the game.'' 
 Marlins Manager Jack McKeon did exactly that on May 20 when he handed the ball to closer Armando Benitez with his team ahead of the Astros, 6-2, and two outs in the eighth inning. But with the bases loaded and Lance Berkman, the Astros' best hitter, coming to bat, McKeon saw it as the game's signature moment. Benitez struck out Berkman on a sinker that kissed the outside corner of the plate and then set down the Astros in order in the ninth. It was one of 11 times, through Friday, that Benitez entered a game with at least one runner on base. 
 To somebody coming to baseball for the first time, all this would seem blazingly obvious. Of course a team should use its best pitchers when it absolutely needs to get an out, the same way that a basketball team turns to its finest jump shooter when it needs a basket. 
 But starting in the 1980's, teams began becoming slaves to the save rule. Even with the recent changes, top relievers still regularly pitch the ninth inning with a three-run lead, one of the most painless routes to a save.
 ''To be honest with you, it's driven by the fact that it's a stat that the players get paid for,'' said Jim Colborn, the Dodgers' pitching coach. ''It's a part of baseball I don't particularly like.''
 Even an average pitcher protects a three-run lead about 97 percent of the time. Elite relievers can have a much greater effect when their team, say, has a two-run lead in the eighth inning, there are no outs and the bases are loaded. Facing that threat, a team goes on to win just 48 percent of the time, said Ben Polak, an economist at Yale, and Brian Lonergan, an economic consultant. They have studied the chances of victory in every game situation. If the team gets out of the jam -- and who better to make that happen than Mariano Rivera or John Smoltz? -- the odds soar to 92 percent. 
 ''A single with the bases loaded costs you two runs,'' Antonetti said. ''A single to lead off the next inning doesn't.''
 The reform rumblings began last year, when the Red Sox said they would use their best reliever whenever they thought he could make the biggest difference. ''Using your relief ace to protect a three-run lead,'' Bill James, the statistical maven who advises the Red Sox, has written, ''is like a business using a top executive to negotiate fire insurance.'' 
 The only problem for the Red Sox early last season was that their best reliever was neither obvious nor very good. On opening day, the bullpen blew a lead to lowly Tampa Bay and performed little better in the weeks that followed. Pedro Martinez, Boston's ace, grumbled about the plan. The dean of Boston's sports columnists, Dan Shaughnessy, compared it to New Coke.
 During the off-season, the team signed Keith Foulke, one of the best closers, in what seemed like the ultimate bow to conformity. But Foulke is actually part of the changes. When Red Sox Manager Terry Francona was asked why he did not hold back Foulke for a save situation during an extra-inning victory over the Yankees on April 24 and instead pitched him for two innings when the score was tied, he told reporters, ''That holding stuff, it's not going to happen.'' Less than half of Foulke's 2004 appearances have come during save situations.
 The reforms remain fairly minor so far, but a small amount of progress is still progress. You will know teams have taken the next step when they no longer leave their closer in the bullpen during a tie game, only to lose and then bring him to the mound during a blowout a few nights later to get him some work, as managers say. There are more than enough meaningful innings to keep a top reliever busy.

HEADLINE: Election-Year Cuba Policy

 BODY:
It is outrageous that the people of a communist nation have just been told they can see their relatives living outside the country only once every three years. Not only that, the types of items and amounts of money they can receive from overseas will also be curtailed, along with their exposure to visitors on cultural and academic exchanges.
 What's most outrageous, however, is that the government ordering this crackdown is the Bush administration, not the communist regime in Havana. America's policy, followed for decades, of trying to force change in Cuba by means of an economic embargo has been an abject failure, but the administration is about to embrace it with renewed gusto. 
 The notion that further isolating Cuba will weaken Fidel Castro's dictatorial grip is belied by both history and America's approach to other totalitarian societies. Washington has long operated on the view that the more we engage these countries and inundate them with American culture, the more irresistible they will find freedom. Even many Republicans now feel this is the approach to be taken with Havana, too, which is why Congress voted last year to lift the broader ban on all travel to Cuba. The Cuba item was dropped, at the White House's request, in a last-minute reconciliation of Senate and House versions of a larger bill.
 Now the administration is pulling, once again, in the opposite direction, to tighten the embargo, perhaps more interested in solidifying the Republicans' Cuban-American base in Florida than in forcing real change in Cuba. In that sense, Cuba is simply a different kind of red state looming large in this year's presidential election.
 The toughened policy, which cynically victimizes families, will backfire over time. Polls show that about half the Cuban-American community in Florida resents the intrusive new sanctions. But this split within the Cuban-American community has not yet registered at the polls, because those advocating a tougher embargo are older, from the waves of exiles who arrived in the United States in the 1960's and 1970's, and are far more likely to vote. They are offended that supposed political exiles feel free to go back and forth to their old country. In many cases, they can afford to feel that way because they are less likely to have close relatives still in Cuba. When the more recently arrived Cuban-Americans become a political force in Florida, the odds of a more effective American policy toward Havana will increase substantially.

HEADLINE: Going Topless

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
FEW people are as tireless as Thom Bess, a retired chief court reporter by profession and a preservationist by avocation, in promoting the cornices of Harlem.
 In his pearl Cadillac, he has taken Brooke Astor on a tour of the stately Stanford White townhouses of Strivers Row, on West 138th Street, where, he recalls, Ms. Astor commented airily: ''Well, I could live here.'' (To which Mr. Bess responded, ''We all could, if we could afford it.'') 
 And he never tires of pointing out the one Strivers Row townhouse, as conspicuous as a missing tooth in a pretty smile, whose owner stripped off the cornice, adorned with a flower pattern, in a misguided attempt, Mr. Bess says, to make the building safer for firefighters if a fire were to break out.
 Most New Yorkers are too jaded and too hurried to look up at the often stunning architecture that surrounds them. But to some, like Mr. Bess, who do, every building with a top denuded of pressed tin, copper, cast-iron, stone, terra-cotta or even wood cornices and ornamentation stands out like a disfigured part of the urban landscape.
 Many of those naked tops are the unintended consequence of Local Law 10, passed less than a year after Grace Gold, a Barnard student, was struck and killed by a falling piece of masonry at 115th Street and Broadway 25 years ago last month, and of its even more stringent successor, Local Law 11, passed in 1998.
 The law, which requires that exterior walls and projecting ornamentation be inspected for safety by an engineer every five years, applies to the 12,000 city buildings -- 60 percent of them in Manhattan -- that are taller than six stories. Preservationists say the laws have contributed to the attitude that old buildings are inherently dangerous and should be stripped of decoration as a preventive measure rather than take a chance that a piece of masonry or cornice will fall off. As a result, ornamentation may be removed independently of the facade-inspection law, as was the case with the building on Strivers Row.
 The neighborhoods most affected are often long-neglected jewels like Harlem and Fort Greene, Brooklyn, where the architecture is beautiful but ill-maintained, and where building owners are more likely to comply with safety requirements by taking the cheapest route instead of the most aesthetically pleasing one.
 It is hard to miss the evidence of destruction wrought in the name of safety. Lintels have been shaved off windows, leaving behind a flattened shadow of the former ornament. Apartment buildings have been capped by ribbons of ''ghosting,'' layers of bare brick or stucco parging where massive overhanging cornices once hung like beetled brows. Such ghostings can be seen along Columbus Avenue in Manhattan Valley. Buildings have been scalped on nearly every block of Lenox Avenue in Harlem. 
 ''Local Law 10 plays a big role,'' said Charles Wittman, owner of Architectural Fiberglass on Long Island, who estimates that his company has manufactured more than 10 miles of replacement fiberglass cornices for buildings throughout the city, including many city-sponsored gut rehabilitations. Often the damage is in the structural steel, and to get there, the facade ornaments have to be hammered or blasted off.
 Few critics would dispute that the facade-inspection law stemmed from the noblest of motives: to make the city safer for pedestrians. But preservationists argue that removing ornamentation can be a superficial fix that may not address underlying problems of water seeping into the facade and may even worsen them.
 The old cornices, critics note, were designed to deflect rain like an umbrella. Once they have been removed, the brick facade is directly exposed to the elements and may actually wick moisture away from the surface, where it freezes and thaws, destabilizing the brick.
 Covering the exposed wall with ribbons of stucco can lead to water absorption and be just a temporary fix. ''In many cases we have found they are Band-Aids,'' said Alan Epstein, president of Epstein Engineering. He said his firm discouraged stripping cornices for both aesthetic and waterproofing reasons.
 Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the Historic Districts Council and a critic of the consequences of the law, said, ''You've got a choice; either you are responsible for the repair and maintenance of the cornice, or you could just take it off. Of course it was easier to just take it off. Listening to the people responsible for promulgating these rules, they would have you believe there are dozens of people killed every day because of cornices falling off of buildings.''
 CRITICS of the law cite evidence that many more injuries have been associated with construction errors involving falling cranes, flying beams and scaffolding accidents than with crumbling facades. And whether the facade-inspection law has made the city safer is hard to determine. The city has no central system to track falling building debris, said Jennifer Givens, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department. Out of the 12,000 buildings over six stories, about 1,100, or 1 out of 11, were found to have unsafe conditions during the most recent five-year inspection cycle, which ends next January. 
 A few people have tried to mitigate the architectural damage. Mr. Bess has been so concerned about the stripping of facades in Harlem that in 1994 he persuaded the National Trust for Historic Preservation to put ''The Cornices (and Buildings) of Harlem'' on its list of 11 Most Endangered Places of that year, along with Cape Cod, Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin and the oldest surviving McDonald's.
 Franny Eberhart, an Upper East Side preservationist and former executive director of the Historic Districts Council, helped document missing cornices on buildings in Fort Greene and on the Upper West Side in 1996 and 1997, hoping -- in vain, as it turned out -- that the city would support a tax-incentive program making it easier for building owners to replace them. Her survey found that 68 of 825 buildings in the Fort Greene historic district were missing cornices, and 24 of those had been shaved off after 1978, when the area was declared a landmark. It found missing cornices on 84 buildings on the Upper West Side from roughly 69th to 95th Streets.
 Once cornices and other ornamentation have been removed, the economic incentive to replace them is slight. ''It doesn't really add to the rent,'' said Robert Quinlan, a developer and a fan of cornices who has renovated several 19th-century buildings in Chelsea and on the Upper West Side.
 Restoring a cornice, he said, costs about $250 per linear foot, or $5,000 for a 20-foot building and much more for an apartment building. Facade restoration, he said, is a long-term investment, one not likely to be realized until the building is resold. 
 One encouraging sign for those who value the aesthetics of old buildings is that the real estate boom has made landlords appreciate the value of old ornamentation, leading to less stripping and more restoration.
 ''I see less of it in general,'' said Mr. Wittman, the fiberglass manufacturer, ''and I see people calling us not because they have to. They're just doing it as a matter of course, where they recognize the residual value of their ornamentation.''

HEADLINE: Taste of Tahoe In Borscht Belt: Here's the Tab

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, N.Y. 

 BODY:
THEY held a party here Thursday night at Carpenito's restaurant to celebrate a day many people thought would never come. The old, bedraggled Monticello Raceway will reopen Wednesday as Mighty M Gaming at Monticello Raceway, the first gambling emporium in what many people hope will be a new era of casino gambling in the Catskills. Goodbye Concord and Grossinger's. Hello Cayugas and Mohawks.
 ''I bought this restaurant 16 years ago thinking that one day we'd have casinos here, but I had no idea what it would take to make it happen,'' said Jimmy Carpenito, at a party for the workers who built the new casino, which will feature 1,800 video lottery terminals, which are virtually identical to slot machines. ''I feel like a white elephant has turned into a golden goose.'' 
 Cliff Ehrlich, Mighty M's senior vice president, has waited even longer. His family, which used to own the old Pines Hotel, has been working for 30 years to bring a casino here.
 Mighty M, part of the state program to allow lottery terminals at existing racetracks, is billed as the hors d'oeuvre before the main course: casinos, which are still the subject of negotiations between at least three Indians tribes and local, state and federal officials. First up is supposed to be the $500 million casino that the Cayugas and Empire Resorts, Mighty M's owner, plan to build at the raceway site.
 But a funny thing has happened on the slow ride from borscht belt to slots belt. Increasingly, despite local officials' cheerleading for the casinos, there are voices in Sullivan County here, and in neighboring Ulster and Orange, asking if the radical surgery of megacasinos is the way to save a patient who is already beginning to jump up and dance. 
 Indeed, while officials have lobbied for casinos as a way to bring back the glory days of the old resort hotels, much of the Catskills has been in the midst of a renaissance attributable to second-home buyers, refugees from the city and the overflow from rapidly developing Orange next door.
 When a public hearing was held on casino development last week, almost all the speakers were opponents. So whether Mighty M is the first chapter in a preordained new era or just an opening bid in a hand still to play out isn't at all clear.
 ''The real estate market has been good and really building over the past three years,'' said Peter Belgard, who heads a successful real estate business and has not been active, pro or con, in local casino politics. ''I personally think this area will do fine whether or not we have gambling. We joke at lunch that if it happens we'll make a lot of money and then we'll have to move because we won't be able to live here anymore.''
 The case for the casinos is simple, and a visit to the decrepit downtowns in Monticello and Liberty, with their boarded-up ghosts of the old days, can make it seem compelling. If the Catskills died a slow death as the old hotels faded away, the way to bring visitors back is to do what has drawn millions of visitors to Atlantic City and Foxwoods, only closer to New York and with the spectacular Catskills scenery thrown in.
 Charles Degliomini, a spokesman for Empire Resorts, said the model was more Lake Tahoe than Atlantic City, and many people with roots here think casinos can complement the natural attractions of the area.
 ''What I'd like is something that would meld the concept of the old days and something like Las Vegas, make it a family destination like it used to be,'' said Richard Gold, who grew up in Liberty and works in New York as an interior designer. ''I don't see any other alternative right now.''
 But others say that the model of 30 years ago, before the second home boom, before telecommuting, before 9/11, is not the right model now. And they say that the casino industry's own projections present a nightmare scene of hellish traffic, overcrowded schools and uncontrolled growth.
 A STUDY commissioned by the county by Spectrum Gaming, an industry consultant, projects that three full-scale casinos would produce 18,000 new workers in a county that now has 30,000, and add 5,000 students to schools that are already overcrowded. It also estimates that the casinos would result in 2.7 million more car trips a year, 80 percent along Route 17, the main road into the Catskills from New York.
 This in an area that has prospered as a slower, quieter, alternative to the Hamptons and other getaways and where unemployment is now lower than it is in about two-thirds of the counties in the state. 
 Casino opponents know they're late -- maybe too late -- to organize. But they say the casino cure is worse than the disease.
 ''There's a difference between growth and sustainable economic development,'' said Richard Riseling, who owns a farm in Callicoon Center, northwest of Monticello. ''If I put on 40 pounds, that's growth, but it doesn't mean that's a good thing. Casinos are not going to bring the glory days back to Sullivan County. The glory of Sullivan County is a magnificent physical ecology that needs to be preserved. There's nothing glorious about having a casino.''

HEADLINE: No River Wide Enough

BYLINE: By MARC FERRIS

 BODY:
SPACE at the Half Moon Bay Marina in Croton-on-Hudson is so scarce that one owner, Steven Plotkin, has imported a Florida invention: ''dockominiums.'' A slip to accommodate a 27-foot boat starts at $36,000.
 ''There's a shortage of slips along the Hudson,'' Mr. Plotkin said. ''Land values are going through the roof, and they're going to keep climbing.''
 Traffic on the river has increased so much that the Yonkers Police Department recently added a boat to its force, and Hastings-on-Hudson, Dobbs Ferry, Irvington and Tarrytown have explored the possibility of sharing a patrol boat, said George Longworth, the Dobbs Ferry police chief. 
 All this activity reflects the big strides that the Hudson has taken toward cleanliness in recent decades. Until the mid-1990's, unappetizing riverbanks in Westchester and Putnam Counties were largely avoided, according to boaters, environmentalists and officials. 
 Yet the land rush has also created new frictions. River access points are not unlimited, as enthusiasts of powerboating, kayaking and other competing sports are painfully well aware. 
 One reason for these limits is the railroad tracks that have paralleled the river in Westchester since the 1840's, as well as the riprap -- irregularly laid chunks of large stone and demolition debris -- that lines long stretches of the bank. As environmental conditions have improved, these obstacles have only added value to the relatively few harbors accommodating recreational boats and protected, sandy beaches serving as perfect kayak launches. 
 To complicate the issue further, each contested access site along the river seems to accentuate a deepening culture clash between ''passive use'' enthusiasts like kayakers and the more traditional outboard-motor fans. In the words of one powerboater unhappy with the proliferation of kayak launching sites, ''Green is in these days.''
 North of the Yonkers train station, where warehouses and a bus depot line the waterfront, leaders of two boating clubs are battling over a prime patch of real estate adjacent to a new county park.
 In Westchester and Putnam Counties, powerboaters claim that their interests are being overlooked as more and more amenities are being built to cater to kayakers, cyclists and walkers.
 Owners of personal watercraft, popularly known as Jet Skis, the bane of kayakers and motorboaters alike, also complain about the lack of launches in Westchester. A state law passed in 2002 has left municipalities in a position to ban the craft.
 The Hudson River Valley Greenway, a state agency, has distributed $8 million in the last seven years, said its executive director, Carmella Mantello. Some of that is to help build launches and other amenities for kayakers and hand-powered boats from New York City to Waterford, where the Hudson merges with the Mohawk. 
 A stated goal of the Greenway is to stimulate tourism. But one person who would dispute its success in that area is John Dmytryszyn, president of the Hudson River Boat and Yacht Association. He sees the Greenway as promoting kayaker amenities at the expense of powerboaters -- who, he asserts, have more spending power in the maritime economy. 
 ''Land trusts like Scenic Hudson, Open Space Institute and the state control the purse strings, and they don't give back to the powerboating community,'' Mr. Dmytryszyn said, expressing frustration with the ''excessive amount'' of kayak launches. 
 ''I represent 32 mom-and-pop clubs that have been around for 75 to 100 years,'' Mr. Dmytryszyn added. ''For years, no one cared about the river and people called us river rats. I'm trying to let the politicians know that we vote, too.''
 Certainly, kayakers are the focus of the Greenway's current plans for Irvington and Croton: the agency will install information kiosks and provide locking kayak racks, bathrooms and showers to accommodate overnight trips at the launches and campgrounds it has helped support, where possible.
 Moreover, the agency's crown jewel on the lower Hudson, the $460,000 Annsville Creek Paddlesport Center in Peekskill, which opened in 2002, is the first state park to cater primarily to kayakers. Atlantic Kayak Tours runs an outfitting and touring concession from a building that once served as a state Department of Transportation garage. 
 Then, in 2001, the Village of Irvington closed its public motorboat launch, about the same time that it opened a $35,000 kayak access point at nearby Scenic Hudson Park. This also riled motorboaters, Mr. Dmytryszyn said, even though the motorboat launch had been open only to Irvington residents. 
 The village's decision to close the launch was influenced by silting problems. According to John H. Vargo, publisher of Boating on the Hudson magazine, silt is slowly choking the river's harbors and marinas, but dredging cannot occur until the river bottom is tested for toxic chemicals -- a process that few marinas can afford. 
 Irvington received $25,000 from the state Department of Environmental Conservation to study the feasibility of relocating the launch, but the proposed site isn't big enough for vehicles to turn around, said Larry Shopfer, the village's clerk-treasurer. If a suitable spot is never found, he added, Irvington will be required to return $15,000 of the grant.
 A similar problem has affected Horan's Landing in Sleepy Hollow. Although its beach is now an official Greenway kayak launch, the nearby boat ramp is silted up and trailer launches are forbidden, even at high tide.
 There are eight public launches for trailer-borne boats in Westchester. Some have residency restrictions and are available only at high tide. All are day-use only; amenities include parking and the occasional bathroom, but little else. A seasonal permit for nonresidents of Buchanan is $200; at George's Island County Park, it's $100 plus $4 every visit for parking. Launching at the John F. Kennedy Marina in Yonkers costs $10, no permit required.
 For powerboaters seeking higher-quality amenities along the Hudson, the options are limited and may even be diminishing. In Tarrytown, for instance, reports have long circulated that village officials seeking to develop the waterfront might pursue eminent-domain proceedings to gain control of the Tarrytown Boat Club, a privately operated site founded in 1908.
 ''The village is considering options with respect to the area as part of a hard look at the future of the waterfront,'' said Stephen McCabe, the village administrator, although he added that lawyers had not yet been hired.
 It is not clear what use the village would find for the boat club site, if it took it over. But the club's vice commodore, Jerry Gregory, did acknowledge that as things stand, the enterprise barely breaks even and relies on volunteer help. 
 Farther up the Hudson, Putnam County has its own share of river-access conflict, playing out along similar lines. Cold Spring's battles, connected with two key properties, have been dragging on for five years. 
 Detritus from 19th-century heavy industry, complete with railroad tracks and a complex of docks, has made riverfront rehabilitation in Cold Spring a particular challenge. In 1996 the federal government completed a Superfund cleanup of a site called Foundry Cove, which had been saturated with nickel and cadmium. 
 Although the cleanup was welcomed, however, the fate of Foundry Cove since then has been contentious. Like any old factory town adjusting to a tourist-driven economy, Cold Spring has had its problems with the influx of commuters, weekenders from New York City and recreational enthusiasts from around the region.
 Once again, kayakers and motorboaters have found themselves at cross-purposes.
 In 1996, Scenic Hudson, a Poughkeepsie-based environmental group, bought the 83-acre Foundry site, including Foundry Dock Park, a small parcel that has a protected beach. As kayakers began flocking to the park, said Mayor Anthony Phillips of Cold Spring, their presence irked longtime residents who had used the cove to launch their small fishing craft, known as johnboats, for more than 60 years. 
 Scenic Hudson made few friends among old-time residents when, after the purchase, it banned personal watercraft and discouraged johnboats from launching at the cove, the mayor added. But it has since relented somewhat, agreeing in its most recent proposal to the village planning board to allow a limited number of permits for boats with up to 20-horsepower engines, said Steve Rosenberg, executive director of the Scenic Hudson Land Trust. 
 Jan Thacher, a kayaker and riverfront advocate who lives in Cold Spring, calls the proposal a sellout. ''Things are at the point where almost no one is happy,'' Mr. Thacher said.
 The site is already heavily used by kayakers, he added, and the plan envisions a single-lane entryway for trailers carrying boats, which will result in long lines if johnboats are allowed back in. 
 As if this feud were not enough for one town, there has also been strife over a nearby five-acre lot known as Dockside, which offers unobstructed views of the Hudson Highlands and Storm King Mountain. 
 In the 1800's, Dockside was the site of an iron company whose 100-foot-tall stack ''belched forth great volumes of flame and smoke,'' according to a witness quoted in a 19th-century newspaper article. 
 By the 1960's, the space had evolved into a private marina and swim club. Relics of this era included an underground swimming pool, a restaurant and a gravel boat launch. 
 Twenty years later, the Hudson River Foundation bought the property to halt a proposed condominium development. Then, in 1999, the Manhattan-based Open Space Institute bought it. The state Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation has given the institute about $100,000 for improvements at Dockside, and the state Department of Environmental Conservation has provided $18,000 for a wetland restoration feasibility study.
 Though it plans to refurbish the park and hand the land over to the village, the Open Space Institute made two unpopular decisions, said Mayor Phillips of Cold Spring. The first was to demolish the restaurant, in October 2003. Tracks left by the heavy machinery are still imprinted in the dirt.
 Groups like Open Space, Mr. Phillips says, come into a community, buy property, ''then tell the residents what's good for them.'' He added: ''They leveled the restaurant and started carrying on with this kayak and canoe nonsense. Everyone enjoyed the views from the restaurant. My son was married there.''
 The institute further antagonized residents by refusing to consider allowing motorboats to launch at the site, said Mr. Dmytryszyn of the Hudson River Boat and Yacht Association, who lives in Cold Spring. 
 Even Mr. Thacher agrees that small motorboats should be allowed to launch at Dockside instead of kayaks, which are already covered by another launching site. ''Each party is looking at its individual packet but is not considering the waterfront as a whole,'' he said. 
 Mr. Phillips also advocates the use of Dockside for a motorboat launch, if adequate parking and turning areas can be constructed. ''Why do they need all of that property for another park next to a park?'' he asked. ''We're surrounded by parks here.'' 
 But Joe Martens, president of the institute, countered that opening Dockside to the trailer launches needed for motorboats would disturb kayakers and require too much paved surface at the site -- which would satisfy one constituency at the expense of others. 
 The institute, he added, had considered keeping the restaurant, but had concluded that any economically healthy enterprise would have to cover too large a part of the property. 
 ''Everyone has a different idea about access,'' Mr. Martens said. ''We're trying to balance those interests the best we can. We bought the property to protect it and make it publicly available.''
 Mr. Thacher and other kayakers contend that motorboaters might also launch at the Cold Spring Boat Club, a private site that leases village-owned land. Philipstown residents can launch free of charge; others pay $15. The club lacks parking, however, so daytrippers generally launch their craft, park at the train station (free on weekends) and then walk back to the club. 
 Kayakers, however, are unwelcome to old-timers there. The fashionable look for local kayakers includes Teva sandals and cutoff shorts. The men wear ponytails. On the other hand, Mr. Phillips, a major club presence who is now serving his sixth term as mayor, wears a buzz cut and talks like a drill sergeant. Mr. Phillips says he numbers newcomers among his backers, and he expresses support for tourism -- as long as it doesn't overburden the infrastructure.
 ''I have to take care of the people who have lived here for a long time,'' he said. ''We have newcomers on the planning and zoning boards who have a feeling for the village like we do and want to maintain what we have here.''
 Mr. Rosenberg of Scenic Hudson said he empathized with this viewpoint. ''The situation is becoming more common around the Hudson Valley where you have traditional uses of the river that are re-evaluated over time and communities that are experiencing change from various quarters, whether economic, social, or cultural,'' he said. ''Organizations like ours can be perceived as threatening because people are concerned about the potential for losing something, but we are adding value. We cleaned up Foundry Cove from a garbage dump.''
 Despite the rancor, there are many signs of cooperation along the river. The private Hudson Water Trail Association, which is working with the Greenway to establish kayak-friendly campsites every 10 to 12 miles along the river, has become partners with the county Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation to create a free campground at Croton Point Park for small boaters who arrive by water. 
 Also in Croton, more than a dozen entities are financing an extensive project to open the riverfront for walkers, bikers and kayakers. 
 That plan, however, does not include new public motorboat access, much to Mr. Dmytryszyn's dismay. ''We have to be able to fit all users,'' he insisted. ''The river is big enough to enable us to all work together.''

A Question in Yonkers: Whose Boat Club Is It, Anyway?
 OVER the years, members of the Yonkers Canoe Club, which dates to 1886, have won Olympic medals. Now, the canoe club's commodore is competing with a group of rival boaters over its name, its possessions and its identity.
 ''They are falsely representing themselves as the inheritors of the Yonkers Canoe Club and its heritage,'' said the commodore, Stephen Macknowski, who won a gold medal at the 1948 Games in 10,000-meter canoeing pairs. ''It's identity theft, pure and simple.'' 
 But Jack Gilman, a co-founder of the rival Yonkers Paddling and Rowing Club, maintains that the canoe club was defunct when his group moved into the boathouse in 1999 and resurrected recreational boating on the Yonkers waterfront.
 ''The Yonkers Canoe Club had been an elite training ground for racers,'' Mr. Gilman said, ''but they never made the transition to recreational paddling. They stopped taking members 10 years ago and have no programs or activities anymore.'' 
 Mr. Macknowski, 82, disputes that claim but declined to provide membership figures. While asserting that some offspring of original members would ensure the club's future, he did not provide contact information for any of them. 
 At first, Mr. Macknowski said, his group welcomed the newer club to the boathouse. But he became alarmed when he came across e-mail correspondence asserting the rival club's determination to have ''complete administrative control of the club.'' The new group also claimed responsibility ''for the adjudication of all disputes involving the clubhouse.'' 
 In another e-mail message, the new group's board states that the ''Yonkers Paddling and Rowing Club is the steward of the historical boats and memorabilia in the boathouse.''
 Mr. Gilman said the term ''steward'' in no way implied ownership of the original club's photos, records and tarnished trophies -- merely a commitment to keep them in the public domain.
 Tempers have flared. Last month, for instance, some members of the paddling and rowing club called the police after Mr. Macknowski donated an old boat to a Canadian club. 
 The weather-beaten wood boathouse was built in the 1930's on county land. Its fate became something of a cause celebre last December, when the county decided to evict both the paddling and rowing club and the canoe club -- which Sal Carrera, director of real estate and economic development for the county, views as one and the same. 
 The City of Yonkers had long planned to move the boathouse, Mr. Carrera said, but when firm proposals did not materialize, he and other county officials toured the site, discovered safety violations (including cans of flammable liquid stored on overhead shelves) and decided to shut the place down. 
 As word of the eviction spread, the City of Yonkers and several environmental groups approached the county in defense of the Yonkers Paddling and Rowing Club. 
 Since then, county officials and the paddling club have been negotiating an amicable settlement, both sides say. County inspectors are preparing a list of matters that require attention before the boathouse reopens, Mr. Carrera said.
 He first became aware of the boathouse, he explained, while doing an inventory of the county's lease agreements in the late 1990's. He discovered that the Yonkers Canoe Club had never had a formal agreement to occupy the land. In 2000 the county issued a renewable annual license to the Yonkers Paddling and Rowing Club with the stipulation that the arrangement would be temporary, he said.
 As part of its RiverWalk initiative, the county plans to build an esplanade connecting new residential development west of the Yonkers Metro-North station with the new Habirshaw Park behind the Beczak Environmental Education Center.
 Just south of the county-owned sewage pump station, which obscures the boathouse from the street, sit two city-owned lots that will most likely be developed, said Richard Halevy, spokesman for Mayor Phil Amicone.
 For Mr. Macknowski, the safety issues and the shutdown simply illustrate his rivals' unworthiness as inheritors of his club's mantle. 
 ''For years they begged me to give them the name,'' he said. ''When I refused, they hijacked it.'' Marc Ferris
