HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
$576 Million Reserve Is Set For Cutting Pacific Bell Jobs

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The Pacific Telesis Group said today that it would set aside $576 million and take an additional charge of $89 million to cover the costs of a revamping at Pacific Bell that will eliminate 10,000 positions by the end of 1997.
The cuts at Pacific Bell, its regional telephone operating subsidiary, are in line with earlier projections by the company. The plan calls for 3,000 of the job reductions to come this year. 
 The revamping, analysts said, follows similar moves by other regional Bell companies aimed at becoming more competitive and taking advantage of technologies that have reduced work force requirements.
"All the phone companies have been letting people go to become more competitive," Daniel P. Rheingold, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said.
The $576 million reserve will cover future expenses associated with the revamping and will reduce fourth-quarter earnings by $1.58 a share, Pacific Telesis said. In the third quarter, the company had earnings of $323 million, or 77 cents a share, so the charge is expected to result in a loss for the fourth quarter.
Pacific Telesis previously announced that it would have a loss for the year as a result of the adoption of various new accounting standards.
Investors were not concerned by the one-time charges against fourth-quarter earnings, analysts said, adding that the cuts had been expected. Shares of Pacific Telesis rose 62.5 cents today, to $54.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Customers tell us we need to lower prices and move more quickly to meet their needs," Philip J. Quigley, Pacific Bell's president and chief executive, said in a statement. "With tough new competition, the continuing slow state economy and our customers telling us where we need to be, we are making dramatic and necessary changes now."
Mr. Quigley noted that the company announced in January 1990 that it would reduce its work force of 61,500 employees by 11,000 by the end of 1994. The work force "is now down about 9,500, so we're on track," he said.
The company is also reducing management jobs, deferring management salary increases and requiring managers to contribute to their health plans beginning in 1995.
Mr. Quigley said the revamping of Pacific Bell's business began after a group of managers were asked to design a telephone company. The managers came up with Infotel, a unit in Newhall, Calif., which now serves about 35,000 customers.
"Using only existing systems and transmission and switching facilities, they created the fastest, most effective and least expensive ways of serving customers because they weren't encumbered with old processes," he said. "Infotel demonstrated to us what was possible if we implemented the process changes they pioneered."
 Mr. Rheingold of Merrill Lynch said: "The new equipment doesn't require as many people to operate. They've got room for efficiency gains, and they're acting on that." He noted that GTE recently announced it would cut 514 jobs in California.
But local consumer advocates criticized the job cuts.
"There's been a whole lot of hoopla lately from Pacific Telesis and the other phone companies about the information superhighway and all the wonderful high-paying jobs it's going to bring to California," said Audrie Krause, executive director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization. "Laying off 10,000 people will just contribute further to the economic problems in California and probably result in service a little bit worse than it is now."
Pacific Telesis said the $89 million charge was a result of one-time factors, including $29 million in a refund to customers of cellular research and development costs and an additional $24 million related to the pending spinoff of the Pacific Telesis wireless companies.

HEADLINE: Ex-G.O.P. Leader Sentenced For Taking Bribe to Aid a Bill

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WATERBURY, Conn., Jan. 7

 BODY:
Richard Foley, the former chairman of the state's Republican Party, was sentenced today to 40 months in prison and fined $25,000 for taking a bribe to influence votes in the state legislature on a banking bill in 1989.
He was ordered to begin serving his sentence on Jan. 31.
Judge T. F. Gilroy Daly of Federal District Court said he would recommend that Mr. Foley be sent to a Federal prison camp at Fort Dix, N.J. 
 Mr. Foley, a former state representative, cried as he apologized to family and friends, saying: "The pain is my pain. Sadness my sadness."
Outside the courtroom, he said: "There are a lot of hurt buckaroos out there, including me."
 
Help for a Banking Bill
 In October, Mr. Foley was convicted of accepting a $25,000 bribe in return for a promise to help get a banking bill through the General Assembly. He was also found guilty of helping conceal the money as consulting fees to help two developers cheat on their taxes.
His lawyer said he would appeal.
There was no testimony that Mr. Foley did anything for the money, only that he promised to.
"This case is not just about $25,000 moving from some corrupt bankers to a corrupt politician," said Assistant United States Attorney Amy Lederer. "Essentially, he sold out the legislature."
In asking for an alternative sentence of community service, Mr. Foley's lawyer, W. Paul Flynn, said the conviction had "destroyed his objective in life forever and that perhaps for him is the ultimate punishment."
"It has ended forever Mr. Foley's political career," Mr. Flynn said.
 
5 Terms in the House
 Mr. Foley served five terms in the House of Representatives and left office last January after deciding not to seek re-election. He is now unemployed.
With his conviction, Mr. Foley joined a long list of Waterbury city officials and their associates, including former Mayor Joseph Santopietro, caught up in corrupt dealings with the former top officers of the failed Security Savings and Loan.
The banking bill saved Fleet Bank, based in Providence, R.I., from having to divest itself of a Connecticut bank, United Bank and Trust.
Fleet faced a divestiture order after merging with New York-based Norstar Bancorp Inc. State law at the time barred non-New England banks from owning a Connecticut bank.
Fleet sought the help of Richard Barbieri, then a top officer of Security Savings and Loan, because he was known to be influential in Republican circles. He had also borrowed money from Fleet and had a $12.5 million loan application pending in April 1989.
When Mr. Barbieri turned to Mr. Foley for help, the lawmaker demanded a $25,000 bribe, Mr. Barbieri testified. He said it was paid without Fleet's knowledge.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Three years ago today, the United States was a week from war with Iraq and still debating whether such a war was morally justified. At the center of that debate was the question of whether economic sanctions were the more humane way to the desired end.
A United Nations resolution authorized the use of force if Saddam Hussein had not withdrawn Iraqi forces from Kuwait by Jan. 15. Give the sanctions more time, was the cry of those opposed to military action. 
 Even today the chief argument by those who considered the Persian Gulf war unjust is that military force was not a "last resort," undertaken only after all alternatives had proved unavailing.
Throughout the 20th century, economic sanctions have been the hope of many who sought an escape from the moral impasse of warfare. "Apply this economic, peaceful, silent, deadly remedy and there will be no need for force," President Woodrow Wilson declared in his ill-fated campaign on behalf of the League of Nations after World War I.
Yet even in Wilson's day, John Foster Dulles opposed broad embargoes, spelling out his opposition in a report by the United States Committee on Economic Sanctions. Mr. Dulles, who became the Secretary of State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, said sanctions harmed the innocent. His argument haunts discussions of economic sanctions in the case of Iraq and Haiti.
"Although sanctions have surely contributed to malnutrition in Iraq," wrote Mike Moore, the editor of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, in introducing a special November issue on sanctions, "one supposes that Saddam Hussein has never involuntarily missed a meal." The magazine, a monthly, was founded by some of the scientiests who helped develop the atomic bomb and is devoted to preventing nuclear war.
Three years ago many people, including many religious leaders, conveyed a kind of moral innocence about sanctions. Their faith in economic pressure rested less on the historical record or economic and political facts than on their opposition to the alternative, military force. Even with hindsight, only a few have granted that maybe they underestimated Mr. Hussein's indifference to his people's suffering.
But most of the same observers soon realized that sanctions did exactly what they had considered most morally reprehensible about military action: wreak injury on civilians. Sanctions, it turned out, struck more directly at civilians than did smart bombs. Sanctions even seemed to strike at precisely those civilians -- infants, children, women, the elderly -- who were most vulnerable and least responsible for the regime's political or war-making strength.
Most studies of sanctions, of which there are few, focus on their effectiveness, not their morality. One recent study of 104 cases since World War II shows that sanctions succeeded about a third of the time when the goals were modest -- to obtain the release of captives, for example, or to demand respect for human rights.
The study, undertaken by the Institute for International Economics in Washington, shows that the success rate was much lower when the goal of sanctions was a major reversal of another nation's policy, or even the removal of its government. Success in the latter cases was usually linked to covert American action or local rebellions to undermine the government.
After reviewing these findings in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, two staff members of the Roman Catholic Bishops' Office on International Peace and Justice, Drew Christiansen and Gerard F. Powers, concluded, "We cannot presume that sanctions are an effective alternative to military force."
To mix and modify phrases from the psychologist William James and the military strategist Karl von Clausewitz, sanctions are not so much the moral equivalent of war as they are the continuation of war by other means. So is there need for a theory of just sanctions like the historical theory of a "just war." The country's Roman Catholic bishops tried to sketch something like that in one section of a major document on peacemaking they issued last November.
Referring to the suffering of "innocent people in Serbia, Haiti, Iraq, Cuba and elsewhere, the bishops said that sweeping economic sanctions are justified "only in response to aggression or grave and ongoing injustice" and only with "clear and reasonable conditions set for their removal." Embargoes should always "make provision for the fundamental needs of the civilian populations," the bishops said.
Echoing the language of the "just-war" theory, the bishops said that "the harm caused by sanctions should be proportionate to the good likely to be achieved." Sanctions should "avoid grave and irreversible harm" to civilians and therefore "should be targeted as much as possible against those directly responsible for the injustice."
"The consent to sanctions by substantial portions of the affected population is morally relevant," the bishops advised. In other words, be guided, at least in part, by what black South Africans or poor Haitians are themselves willing to undergo.
These criteria provide little more than a checklist of things to think about. The bishops admit their criteria are "tentative" and urged "much more study, reflection and public debate over the moral dimension of comprehensive sanctions."
None of this is very encouraging for those who dream of a new world order. They might, however, find one glimmer of hope in special issue of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. That is the impression that so far very little inventiveness and less willpower have gone into devising the kind of "selective sanctions" the bishops prefer, those directed against ruthless leaders and oppressive elites.

HEADLINE: Fred Scribner Jr., 86, Treasury Aide to Eisenhower

 BODY:
Fred C. Scribner Jr., an Under Secretary of the Treasury in the Eisenhower Administration who held positions in the Republican Party and in his home state of Maine and in Washington, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Portland, Me. He was 86 and lived in Falmouth, a town near Portland.
The cause was a heart attack, said Robert N. Barnes, a funeral director. 
 Mr. Scribner's political and legal career spanned more than six decades. After rising to national committeeman from Maine, he went to Washington in 1955 to become general counsel to the Treasury Department. He stayed in the department through Dwight D. Eisenhower's second term and was appointed Under Secretary in 1957.
 
Work on Political Matters
 In the Treasury, Mr. Scribner supervised the Internal Revenue Service and United States Coast Guard, but his responsibilities went beyond his official duties. He became involved in policy matters, working on problems like the recession, the handling of the national debt and rising Government and military costs.
Mr. Scribner was also a member of the National Security Council from 1959 to 1961. In February 1961, he criticized John F. Kennedy's foreign policy, accusing the newly elected President of playing on fears of a missile gap that would leave the United States behind the Soviet Union.
"It could conceivably lead an emboldened aggressor to touch off a world holocaust through miscalculation of our retaliatory strength," he said. "Somehow the world must win the time it needs to achieve a just and lasting peace, even though this may require half a century or more."
Mr. Scribner was born in Bath, Me., in 1908. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1930 and from Harvard Law School in 1933.
He began to practice law after Harvard and, except for his years in Washington, was a partner in Pierce, Atwood, Scribner, Allen, Smith & Lancaster in Portland until his death, his family said.
Mr. Scribner's interest in politics originated in 1936 when even Franklin D. Roosevelt was unable to take Maine away from the Republicans. In Maine, Mr. Scribner was associated with "Old Guard" Republicanism, rather than with the more liberal elements in the party.
 
A Nixon Strategist in '60
 In 1960, he was a top strategist in Richard M. Nixon's campaign against Kennedy and helped to arrange the first-ever televised Presidential debates.
Mr. Scribner's wife of 58 years, Barbara, died a few days before him. Her funeral was held Wednesday afternoon, just hours after her husband's death.
Mr. Scribner is survived by a sister, Frances, of St. Davids, Pa.; three sons, Fred C. 3d, of Cambridge, Mass., Curtis M., of Yarmouth, Me., and Charles D., of Portland, and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: New York Area Jobless Rate Higher

 BODY:
Even as the rest of the country reported the lowest jobless rate in three years, Government figures released yesterday showed that the number of unemployed in New Jersey went up by nearly 1 percent in December while the unemployment rates in New York and New York City rose slightly.
The monthly jobless rate continued to fluctuate more widely in New Jersey, rising to 7.1 percent of the work force last month, from 6.2 percent, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Unemployment figures in New York State and New York City remained almost unchanged. The state's seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 7.6 percent last month from the 7.5 percent recorded in November.
The city, meanwhile, continued to be much worse off, with 10.5 percent unemployed in December, up from 10.3 in November.
By comparison, the country's December jobless rate was 6.4 percent, the lowest since January 1991.
The Goverment reports monthly figures for Connecticut at another time
Despite increases in December, annual jobless rates for 1993 seemed to signal a slow -- and often fitful -- recovery for the New York region, which was among the first in the nation to slide into a recession.
New Jersey's unemployment rate for 1993 averaged 7.4 percent, down from 8.4 percent in the previous year. What is more, though its jobless rate swung greatly in 1993, the fourth quarter averaged 6.6 percent.
"New Jersey has been really, really volatile," said Susan Shank, a senior economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington. "It started the year at 9 percent. But there's been clearly a downward trend during 1993."
New York State showed a similar annual improvement as its jobless rate went down to 7.7 percent in 1993 from 8.5 percent in 1992. New York City reported a dip to 10.2 percent in 1993 from 10.8 percent in 1992.
For December, as the region lagged behind the rest of the country moving into economic recovery, New York was second to California with a jobless rate of 8.7 percent. Out of 11 major industrialized states, Michigan was third with 7.5, followed by New Jersey.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in Mark Trading From Its Five-Month Peak

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower yesterday, tumbling from a five-month high against the German mark as modest December employment figures sent interest rates in Wall Street's credit markets sharply lower.
The dollar also lost ground in its recent rise against the Japanese yen. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.7278 marks, from 1.7453 marks on Thursday. It also slipped to 111.90 yen from 112.60 yen.
Traders attributed the dollar's losses to a lukewarm report about the American labor market.
The report, issued by the Labor Department, showed the nation's unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent in December from the previous 6.5 percent, but it also said nonfarm payrolls grew by 183,000 in the month. Economists had predicted brisker jobs growth. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose by one and a half points in reaction to the report, sending its yield sharply lower.
 
Yen Slide a Factor
 In addition to the jobs report, the dollar was weighed down by reports this week that the United States was worried over its rise against the yen and by stubbornly high German interest rates.
"It's been a fairly bad week for the dollar in terms of news," said John Rothfield, international economist at First National Bank of Chicago.
He cited a series of statements by Treasury officials voicing concern about the dollar's rise against the yen. The market interpreted comment by Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and others to mean that the Government may act to stop the dollar from climbing too high.
A decision Thursday by the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, to leave key interest rates steady also put pressure on the dollar, Mr. Rothfield said. The market is awaiting cuts in currently high German interest rates, which attract investors to certain mark-based investments at the expense of the dollar.
The Treasury comments and the Bundesbank decision did not cause large dollar sales when they were reported. However, by the end of the week, they encouraged caution among some dealers who had bet the dollar would rise quickly.
Meanwhile, the British pound closed in New York at $1.4935, up from $1.4815 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.4669 Swiss francs, down from 1.4815; $1.3193 (Canadian), down from $1.3213 (Canadian); 5.8828 French francs, down from 5.9250, and 1,690 Italian lire, up from 1,685.

Precious Metals Are Down In Reaction to Job Figures

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Prices of inflation-sensitive precious metals fell yesterday in reaction to the smaller-than-expected pace of job creation in December, an indication that the economy is not overheating.
"I think a lot of cages were rattled by that employment report," said Bernard Savaiko, a metals analyst at Paine Webber. 
 The 183,000 new jobs created in December was anemic relative to most analysts' expectations. Prices for silver, copper and platinum -- all metals used by industry -- were down because a weaker economy is likely to mean less industrial demand.
The rebounding bond market also stole investor interest from the precious metals market, with gold for February delivery falling $2.90, to $387.20 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Mr. Savaiko said gold prices might breach a key level of support at $384 an ounce on Monday when the market reopened; another analyst agreed that a slip below $384 raised questions about gold's long-term prospects but said that "gold tends to look real bad when it's about to make a bottom."
 
Silver Down 11.2 Cents
 Also at the Comex, March silver dropped 11.2 cents, to $5.025 an ounce, and March copper sank 1.25 cents, to 78.60 cents a pound. April platinum lost $2.50, to $389 an ounce, at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The cold weather gripping the northern tier of the country pushed up prices of natural gas and heating oil, as well as orange juice prices.
While February heating oil advanced 0.52 cent, to 48.17 cents a gallon, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for February delivery sank 10 cents, to $15.32 a barrel, ending a four-day rally.
Oil prices have bounced back from five-year lows in the last two weeks, edging up $1.50 a barrel. But analysts said ample supplies and no sure signs that pumping would be curtailed might limit any further advances.
February unleaded gasoline edged up 0.17 cent, to 43.82 cents a gallon, and February natural gas rose 6.2 cents, to $2.156 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Consumers Again Increase Credit Buying

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Consumers increased their buying on credit for a sixth straight month in November, although not quite as robustly as in October, the Federal Reserve Board said today,
Consumer credit outstanding increased by a seasonally adjusted $6.88 billion in November at a 10.6 percent annual rate, compared with a rise of $7.66 billion at a 12 percent annual rate in October.
So far during the first 11 months of 1993, the only month in which consumer credit contracted was in May, when it declined by $752 million. Increases in each of the other 10 months underline the rebound in spending last year after a period of restraint after the 1990-91 recession.
In November, consumers took out another $2.98 billion of loans to buy new cars. That was down from October's increase of $3.95 billion in auto credit but still reflected healthy demand for new cars.
Credit-card buying in November increased by $2.15 billion, also down from October's increase of $3.42 billion but still a healthy rate of increase.
The steady pickup in consumer credit use is significant for the economy's expansion because two-thirds of national economic activity is fueled by consumer purchases of goods and services.
Many economists expect national output to expand at a 5 percent annual rate in the final quarter of 1993 before easing back to about a 3 percent growth rate in the first half of this year.
Other credit, which includes consumer bank loans like those for boats or trailers but not real estate mortgages, jumped by $1.76 billion in November.

HEADLINE: New Year Tune-Up for Retirement Funds

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
The new year compels many people to re-evaluate their investments, and this month may be a good time to make some adjustments.
Among the five mutual fund experts who created hypothetical retirement portfolios for The New York Times in July, most have decided to rejigger their portfolios after sitting tight for six months. 
 Their reasons are varied -- shedding laggards, taking profits, responding to research, assessing opportunities abroad and betting on an economic surge at home. While far from providing a consensus, they offer some insight to investors wondering what to do in 1994. Generally speaking, investing abroad continues to be a priority, and cyclical stocks that rise and fall with the economy look attractive. But opinion is split on small stocks.
Realigning portfolios yearly is a good idea, finance professionals say, because a strong performance in one area could quickly lead to an ill-advised concentration. Sheldon Jacobs, the editor of The No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y., saw that happen last year to his investment in emerging markets, which soared. Because of that runup, he is shedding some assets there.
 Foreign funds remain appealing, however. Mr. Jacobs recommends reinvesting part of the proceeds from the emerging markets in another foreign fund, albeit a European one, trimming his foreign exposure slightly, to about 23 percent. A second fund picker, Harold Evensky, who is an investment adviser with Evensky, Brown & Katz, in Coral Gables, Fla., is increasing his allotment for foreign equities to 20 percent from 15 percent. (He also has 5 percent in Sogen International, which invests globally, and 5 percent in foreign bonds.) Factoring in growth in recent months, the three other advisers have more than 20 percent invested in global or foreign funds as well.
 In performance, Mr. Jacobs continues to lead the five fund experts, sailing on several red-hot international funds. His portfolio has gained 18.32 percent since its inception, and surged 10.33 percent in the fourth quarter. All but one of the experts have beaten the market. Since tracking began on July 7, their portfolios have risen an average of 10.22 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index has gained 6.7 percent in the period.
 The portfolio performance, tracked quarterly by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in Summit, N.J., does not include taxes, transaction charges or sales charges. The latter charges, also called loads, would especially crimp the returns of the one portfolio that has lagged behind the S.& P. 500, returning 6.4 percent. That portfolio, designed for socially responsible investors, was compiled by Jack A. Brill, an investment adviser in San Diego, and almost all those funds have loads.
The 5 experts can choose up to 10 funds that are open to new investors, and can shift money quarterly, although the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years.
 Mr. Jacobs describes his strategy as "taking money out of the winners, on the theory that their performance would be difficult to repeat, and putting it into market sectors that haven't been so strong."
He recommends selling enough of Fidelity Emerging Markets, which returned an extraordinary 81.8 percent in 1993, and T. Rowe Price New Asia, which gained 78.8 percent, to reduce their weighting to 5 percent each.
Half the proceeds go to Invesco European. "Europe is a little behind on the economic curve and hasn't had the run-up the emerging markets have had," Mr. Jacobs said. The balance goes to Neuberger & Berman Guardian, a growth-and-income fund, an average performer in 1993.
 The possibility of a correction concerns Eric Kobren, president of Insight Management and the editor of Fidelity Insight, in Wellesley, Mass. He is dumping the Fidelity Small Cap Stock Fund from his all-Fidelity portfolio. "If the market corrects itself, small-company funds are more likely to bear the brunt of the decline than larger-cap stocks and certainly industrials, which are our focus now," he explained.
 His main goal? "Inflation-proofing the portfolio in the face of an improving economy, particularly in the industrial sector," he said.
Therefore, he is plowing the proceeds from the small stock fund into Fidelity Capital Appreciation, which should benefit from strengthening commodity prices and its deep cyclical stocks. As the economy expands this year, cyclicals are expected to continue their strong performance of 1993.
Fidelity Value, Mr. Kobren's largest holding, already focuses on economically sensitive areas like basic industries, durable goods and industrial equipment manufacturers. That fund should do well as the economy strengthens, he said, even though its year-end performance was dampened by a slide in its energy stocks.
A more fundamental strategy shift comes from Mr. Evensky, who took an opportunity to adjust all his fund allocations. Although not dissatisfied with any of his original choices, Mr. Evensky is leaning toward smaller stocks now.
He attributed this change of heart to the growing currency placed on research by two University of Chicago professors, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French. They have concluded that stocks of small companies with low ratios of book value to market value are better performers over time than stocks that are extremely volatile, traditionally believed to be the best bets.
Mr. Evensky is adding to his stake in the Meridian Fund, a small-company fund with a median market capitalization of $580 million, by reducing positions in two large-cap stock funds: Vanguard Index 500 Portfolio and Windsor II. For more international flavor, he made small investments in two emerging markets funds, the Newport Tiger Fund, which carries a 5 percent load, and Pfamco Emerging Markets Portfolio. He also increased T. Rowe Price International's allocation to 15 percent.
Reflecting another change in thinking, Mr. Evensky replaced the Vanguard Limited Term Municipal Bond Fund with the Pimco Foreign Bond Fund, which can hedge against currency risk. While academic research is inconclusive, Mr. Evensky believes that hedging currency risk has a negligible impact when overseas bonds account for only a small part of the portfolio.
 A big disappointment for Mr. Brill has been Pax World, hammered by its position in large-capitalization consumer stocks. He is substituting the Calvert Social Investment: Managed Growth Portfolio, another balanced fund, which lagged in 1993 but has earned about 11 percent annually since its 1982 inception. Calvert holds up well in down markets, he said, and has not lost money in any year.
The two funds from Working Assets have done even worse, but Mr. Brill is hanging on to them. The new manager there has been repositioning the portfolios, he said, adding stocks with earnings momentum.
For the quarter, John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, trailed the group, with a 2 percent gain, mostly because of Vanguard's energy fund, which proved to be an unneeded hedge. "These 'hedge' funds make one look like geniuses or idiots; I'll answer to the latter," he said -- so far.
Still, the portfolio built by Mr. Rekenthaler, who has made no changes in his original picks, has risen a total of 8.12 percent since its inception.

HEADLINE: BANKING;
Assumable Mortgage Is Trying a Comeback

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo

 BODY:
THE assumable fixed-rate mortgage, a relic from the halcyon days before the high inflation of the 1970's and 1980's, is being unearthed and repackaged for home buyers in the low-inflation 1990's.
Such loans -- which allow qualified buyers to take over an owner's mortgage at the same interest rate -- remain uncommon, but are being offered by about 20 lenders across the country. Among the largest is the Barclays American Mortgage Company, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., and has 13 branches. 
 David W. Beal, the president of Barclays Mortgage, said the loans were attractive when interest rates were expected to rise because they could make homes easier to resell. Young home buyers, however, have not really grasped the loans' value, he said, probably because they have only seen interest rates decline.
"Our customers so far have been people in their 40's who had homes in the early 80's and remember what it was like not to be able to sell because interest rates were 15, 16 percent," he said. "They also remember that homes with assumable fixed-rate mortgages had no trouble selling."
Though most adjustable-rate mortgages are assumable, the fixed-rate version virtually disappeared in the early 1980's, when interest rates rose sharply and low-rate loans became unprofitable for banks and investors.
With inflation now low, some lenders again see a market for assumable fixed-rate loans. "It's just getting started," said Mr. Beal, whose company added the product last month.
Lenders generally charge a quarter-point to a half-point more in interest on assumable loans than on standard fixed-rate loans. If interest rates rise above the fixed level, the owner can offer future buyers a mortgage at less than the market rate with no points. A point is a fee by the lender that is equal to 1 percent of the loan.
The loan "is like interest rate insurance," said Joseph J. Mahoney, president of the Abbot Mortgage Company of McLean, Va., which began offering the loans last month. "If interest rates go up, you have made a good play and a tax-deductible play."
Assumable fixed-rate loans are usually for 30 years. Shorter-term ones build equity faster and require large down payments when assumed.
There are several caveats for buyers considering a fixed-rate assumable or anyone who might assume one. Some of today's loans, unlike those of the past, can be assumed only once. People who assume an existing loan should expect to pay a 1 percent assumption fee, the equivalent of an origination fee. They must also meet income and credit standards set by the lender.
Some mortgage analysts doubt that fixed-rate assumables will enjoy a resurgence. They cite a test program in the Detroit area that ended after six months because of a lack of interest.
Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm in Butler, N.J., said that the higher interest rate would probably turn off many home buyers.
"Many of the buyers out there are first-time buyers," he said. "They can only afford the lowest rate they can find."
Mr. Gumbinger added that assumable fixed-rate mortgages might aid sales of homes only if the houses were not moving because of prevailing interest rates, not because of other difficulties, like inflated prices.
"If you have a condo and no one will buy it because it's a condo, no one is going to buy it -- assumable mortgage or not," he said.

HEADLINE: A New Opening in North Korea

 BODY:
Encouraging signs emerged this week that the Clinton Administration's diplomacy is having the desired effect on North Korea. The North has agreed to allow the resumption of regular international inspections of all seven of its declared nuclear sites. And it has reportedly canceled the sale of its Rodong missile to Iran. That is a relief to Israel, which would be within range of such a missile.
True, North Korea has not yet agreed to admit inspectors to two suspected but undeclared nuclear sites. But this initial agreement, if carried out, will go a long way toward easing immediate fears about the North's nuclear program. And it has set the stage for a package deal that could put more lasting curbs on proliferation on the Korean Peninsula. 
 Critics demean the importance of the new agreement, saying that North Korea has just stalled since March, when it announced it was suspending its participation in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. But the North did nothing to divert more spent nuclear fuel into bomb-making in the interim. To remove such material, it would have had to shut down its reactors. It has not done so, according to U.S. intelligence.
An inspection can verify that, and much more. Inspectors will be on the scene when the fuel rods in one of North Korea's reactors are replaced in the coming months. Their presence would deter any diversion of nuclear material for use in weapons. Inspection of the reactor's core could also help determine whether or not such a diversion took place in 1989, before international inspections were instituted. The possibility of such diversion led some intelligence analysts to conclude that the North may have enough nuclear material for as many as two bombs.
Inspections that go beyond these regular visits will be a major subject for future high-level negotiations. Special inspections of the North's two suspected nuclear waste sites and other steps may be needed, for example, to ascertain how much nuclear material, if any, was diverted in 1989.
Those negotiations will take place once North Korea finishes working out the details of regular inspections with the International Atomic Energy Agency and reopens talks with South Korea on establishing a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
In preparation for those talks, President Clinton needs to prepare a package of incentives, including diplomatic recognition, military assurances and economic ties, to coax North Korea into opening up still more, in order to assure the world that it is not making nuclear arms.
Nuclear diplomacy is making real headway. It needs a package of incentives, and patience, to give it a chance to succeed.

HEADLINE: A Loud Silence on Racism

BYLINE: By Roger Wilkins; Roger Wilkins is professor of history at George Mason University.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Khalid Abdul Muhammad of the Nation of Islam, speaking at Kean College in Union, N.J., on Nov. 29, talked of "Columbia Jew-niversity" and "Jew York City" and suggested that German Jews brought the Holocaust upon themselves. He also took aim at whites generally, the Pope, homosexuals and the blind and disabled.
No blacks on the faculty and staff condemned the contents of the speech, according to news reports. One faculty member sidestepped issues raised by the talk and lashed out at racism on the campus, to which he believed Jewish faculty members had contributed. 
 In avoiding swift and forceful condemnation of Mr. Muhammad's bilious diatribe, the black faculty members failed their students, failed their obligations as members of a civilized community and failed to uphold the best traditions of the black struggle.
While I have never been to Kean College, I have no reason to doubt allegations that black adults on the campus have encountered racial problems. Despite splendid efforts on many campuses to change behavior, populations and curriculums, racism remains alive and extremely hurtful in academia. But this is exactly why black staff and faculty members must display exemplary moral behavior. It is not just the black adults on campus who are harmed by racism; it is, primarily and most distressingly, the students -- students of all colors and backgrounds. The black adults have important lessons to teach all students, in the classrooms and outside.
Most white, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian students get their first sustained exposure to a black adult when they come into our classroom. No matter what subject we teach, our personas can be powerful countervailing lessons to the racist notions that nonblack students bring from their neighborhoods and homes.
Black students have come already hurt by a disdainful culture into an academic atmosphere of profound ambivalence. Despite the strongest efforts of the best-intentioned institutions, the atmosphere at predominantly white colleges and universities shrieks, "This is a white space that you occupy only at our sufferance!" Not too long ago, a black student in Oklahoma told me, "White people give me looks that say, 'What are you doing here?' " I asked him when that happened. "Every time I walk into a room," he replied.
One of our most important jobs as black staff and faculty is to help these young people, whose sense of themselves is precarious, learn that though it will be psychically and often economically difficult, they can become strong, effective and fulfilled citizens as so many of the most honorable African-Americans have been over the centuries.
Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Mary McLeod Bethune, W. E. B. DuBois, Fannie Lou Hamer, Martin Luther King Jr. and Thurgood Marshall were among those who created our best traditions. Their lives teach us that we blacks are much more than simply the sum of our injuries and grievances.
One of the first tasks black faculty members have in passing on those lessons is to separate, to the greatest degree possible, our teaching from the anger and pain our own institutional struggles have inflicted on us. We have to be able to manage our anger and pain and to use them constructively in order to teach our students how to do it after we are gone.
Our heroes did that. Though some of them worked during slavery and others during deepest segregation, they were not whiners or scapegoaters. Some of the most courageous and effective allies many had were Jews. They had other white allies as well -- some of them Catholic, blind, lesbian or gay. Our great leaders were not immune to pain or anger, but they were not racists.
It is not weakness to control your justifiable rage, to resist scapegoating, to deal with people as individuals and to use humane values to advance our cause. On the contrary, it is weak to be vile and stupid and anti-Semitic and homophobic and racist. Sometimes it takes strength for teachers to say such things to students when a truly wicked and destructive message has just pandered to their deepest injuries and insecurities.

HEADLINE: U.S. and France Resolve Dispute on NATO Talks

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Three days before the NATO summit meeting, the United States and France have agreed to paper over their differences over Western military involvement in Bosnia and Herzegovina in a last-ditch effort to avoid an embarrassing rift at the meeting in Brussels.
In recent days, senior French officials have insisted that the war in Bosnia be at the top of the agenda when the 16 NATO heads of state come together next week, and have publicly announced that France would call on the United States to join Europe in a more direct military intervention in Bosnia. 
 The Clinton Administration, by contrast, is distressed that the fighting in Bosnia, particularly the intensification of Serbian shelling of civilian targets in the capital of Sarajevo in recent days, could dominate the summit and overshadow the effort to redefine NATO's mission for the post-Cold War era.
 
A Danger to Credibility
 In preparatory meetings in Washington and at NATO headquarters in recent days, senior Administration officials said that a focus on Bosnia would rob the summit meeting of any credibility by highlighting the inability of the West to deal with a nearly two-year-old war in the heart of Europe that has claimed 200,000 lives and left two million people homeless.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters today that although the Bosnian war will be discussed at the meeting, its main focus will be on the American proposal to extend some NATO privileges -- although not membership -- to the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The purpose of the meeting is "to discuss the future of NATO, to discuss how NATO would reach out to the east, to the newly emerging democracies," Mr. Christopher said. He called the American proposal, known as "Partnership for Peace," the "centerpiece" of the summit.
Bosnia, Mr. Christopher added, "will come up."
But the degree of Washington's concern was in evidence on Thursday when the United States, stunned by published remarks by French Cabinet officials earlier this week, warned France not to turn the NATO meeting into a showcase for Western policy on Bosnia.
Mr. Christopher, Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, and Stephen Oxman, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, all telephoned French officials to protest French comments that appeared to criticize the United States for not helping more to relieve Serbian pressure on besieged Muslim enclaves, senior Administration and French officials said today.
"At the last moment the French tried to pre-empt the summit, and we wanted to know what they were trying to achieve," a senior State Department official said. "Did they want better language in a summit declaration? Did they want a separate declaration? Or did they want Bosnia to overshadow other issues?"
A senior French official, reached by telephone in Paris, said, "The United States feared we were going to shift the focus of the summit to Bosnia and ruin the summit and ask them in front of all the allies to send troops to Bosnia to help protect the Muslim safe areas. What we said is that we cannot avoid the real world and that we had to issue a strong statement about Bosnia, but that we had no intention of sabotaging the American proposal on NATO."
Mr. Christopher did not confirm the report of a split with France, except to say that he had spoken with Defense Minister Alain Juppe by telephone and that he expected NATO to come up with "a coordinated position."
By this afternoon, both Washington and Paris reported that for the sake of NATO unity, they had agreed on a draft text of the NATO communique on Bosnia. The text was not made public.
Mr. Juppe sent a letter on Thursday to other members of the alliance requesting that the NATO meeting make it clear that the United States firmly backs the latest European peace effort in the Balkans, a senior French Foreign Ministry official said today.
The United States has declined to do so, in part because the plan includes a pledge to the Serbs to work to suspend United Nations economic sanctions if a peace agreement is reached.
The letter also requested a renewed commitment from the United States that it would be prepared to send troops to Bosnia to police and support a peace settlement if one is reached.
The United States has agreed to send troops to help implement an eventual accord, but only if strict -- perhaps impossible -- criteria are met, including a clearly stated time when the policy would be reviewed, a clearly stated "right to terminate" the operation if it went badly and a clear expression of support from the United States Congress.
The effort by the United States to play down the importance of the war in Bosnia is part of the Administration's strategy, announced by Mr. Christopher in November, to focus on big issues such as Russian reform and Middle East peacemaking and to treat crises in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti as bothersome regional issues with little or no importance for America's national interests.
In the face of European opposition, the United States has abandoned its proposals to arm the Bosnian Muslims and turn the war into what Mr. Clinton had called "a fair fight." Mr. Clinton acknowledged in an interview with editorial writers on Tuesday that this initiative was "a dead letter."
But in the letter, Mr. Juppe urged the allies to declare at the summit meeting that NATO is prepared to intervene to back United Nations peacekeepers where necessary. French officials said that he was referring to the situations in the six Bosnian cities and towns that were supposed to become security zones protected by the United Nations under a Security Council resolution approved last June. Only two of them, Zepa and Srebrenica, have received effective protection.
 
Backing for U.N. Measures
 "The countries of the Atlantic alliance must declare themselves ready to apply U.N. resolutions, which means reinforcing ground troops and extending real protection to security zones," Mr. Juppe said today.
Mr. Juppe also wants the potential threat of NATO air strikes reiterated at the summit. The United Nations has voted to allow air strikes if United Nations peacekeepers are attacked or if a no-flights zone over Bosnia is not respected, and last August NATO vowed to prevent the "strangulation" of Sarajevo with air strikes if necessary.
France's initiative reflects growing concern over its 6,000 soldiers in Bosnia and Croatia, the largest single contingent in the 30,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force. Five French soldiers were wounded in the Sarajevo area during intense fighting Thursday.
The head of NATO said today that he expected that Mr. Clinton and other leaders would reiterate the alliance's willingness to bomb Serbian military targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina if they did not stop the siege of Sarajevo.
But in a telephone interview with American correspondents, the official, Manfred Worner, said that there had been no recent discussions between the United Nations and the alliance about actually launching air strikes.

HEADLINE: New Pressures on the University

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Clark Kerr, who presided over the University of California during a period of rapid growth a generation ago, once wisecracked that a university is "a series of individual faculty entrepreneurs held together by a common grievance over parking." The major universities, he went on to say, had grown so rapidly and penetrated so many areas of American life that they should be called "multiversities." His own institution had more employees than I.B.M. (this was in 1963), conducted its business in more than 100 separate locations and had become, among other things, the world's leading supplier of laboratory mice.
One could chortle approvingly then because there seemed no reason to limit the growth of the modern university. The money was there. The frequent flutter of Nobel Prizes certified the importance of what was being done. And the students -- overwhelmingly white, middle-class and young -- were well suited to apprentice themselves to the masters, who were generally white, middle-class and middle-aged. 
 Today, an after-dinner line like Mr. Kerr's would inspire only a rueful smile. The perception is widespread now that the American university, and perhaps higher education as a whole, has not just grown but that it is overgrown, indeed become so bloated and muddled that it has all but lost its way.
The question is no longer whether to retract, consolidate, restructure and adapt in order to bear down on the basic mission of higher education -- preparing students to take part in their civilization -- but is whether these reforms can be accomplished from within or must be imposed from without. The answer to the question will be determined in large part by the outcome of a struggle -- some call it a shootout -- now in progress around the country between administrations and faculties.
 
Tight Money Drives the Struggle
 The pressures for change begin with tight money. Last year Yale University, with its traditional revenue streams choked by the poor economy, ran a deficit of $15.5 million and still needs about $1 billion in additional money for vital repairs to its crumbling physical plant. Since 1991 the California State Legislature has cut the budget of the University of California at Berkeley by $70 million, or 18.8 percent. Over the last four years the City University of New York, known as CUNY, the nation's largest urban university, has been slashed $200 million, or 20 percent.
On top of these strictures comes the rise of the New Student who is much more often nonwhite, relatively old, frequently part time, possibly a parent and determinedly job-oriented. These students cost more to educate than their predecessors because they frequently require remedial work, special language courses and financial aid to help with soaring tuition bills.
Forty percent of the current entering students at CUNY are black or Hispanic and trace their ancestry to the Caribbean. Nationwide, 43 percent of today's students are over 25, and 300,000 of them are over 50. At Portland State University, a state-assisted urban school in Oregon, the average age is 28 and only 1 percent of the student body lives in dorms. In addition, enrollment is expected to swell enormously with no prospect of increased revenue in the years ahead. CUNY, for example, anticipates a rise in its student population from 208,000 at present to a quarter-million by the end of the century.
Finally, critics of today's institutions of higher learning charge that their tuitions have risen out of sight, that new technologies are not being utilized and that colleges and universities are often engaged in research that is of marginal importance and is being done at the expense of teaching.
College and university administrators are generally much more focused than are faculty members on these institutional problems and pressures, not only because that is their field of specialization but because, unlike tenured professors, they can lose their jobs if they don't fix what's broken.
Last fall George E. Rupp, the new president of Columbia University, spoke with alarm of his discovery that Columbia had 123 separate centers and laboratories. "There simply must be a great deal of overlap," he said, promising to consolidate certain functions of the Business School with the Economics Department, and of the School of Public Health with Arts and Sciences. Like many leaders of major research universities, President Rupp also believes that educational emphasis must be shifted away from postgraduate to undergraduate education -- a hot issue around the country.
The new president of Yale University, Richard C. Levin, takes another approach to consolidating. "You can't be good at everything," he said in an interview. "We don't have to deal with every subspecialty in every field. Instead, we can create centers of excellence." And Harvard's president, Neil Rudenstine, directly contradicting Clark Kerr's memorable remark, said recently: "We need more emphasis on the university and less on the multiversity."
While today's college and university leaders have a clear understanding of their problems and needs, they actually lack the power to effect much change. Unlike the chiefs of General Motors and I.B.M., they cannot pare down and consolidate by handing out pink slips. About 70 percent of most college and university faculties are protected by tenure. And it is this entrenched professoriate, and not the administrators, that holds the power.
Some university presidents have been either bold or foolhardy enough in recent months to act as if they were running General Motors or I.B.M., and have paid dearly for the presumption. In 1992 Benno C. Schmidt Jr., then president of Yale, announced his intention to close a huge budget gap by eliminating nearly 11 percent of the faculty of arts and sciences and by cutting programs and departments. That ignited a faculty revolt that soon led to his departure.
Last year Thomas Day, the president of San Diego State University, announced a plan to offset a severe cut in revenue from the state by closing nine academic departments and terminating more than 100 tenured professors. A faculty rebellion immediately erupted, but Mr. Day was spared a bitter, last-ditch struggle when the State Legislature authorized an increase in student fees and a buyout for senior faculty members that attracted more than 100 takers. These unsystematic departures have created dislocations, but the budget is now in balance. The lesson, president Day said, is: "It's not your university; it's the faculty's university."
 
No-Confidence Votes by Faculty
 W. Ann Reynolds, the chancellor of CUNY, proposed to eliminate about 200 baccalaureate and associate-degree programs, saying they were duplicative or had small enrollments. A university-wide faculty committee condemned her for a "pattern of duplicity," and later six campus faculties, including those of Brooklyn College and Queens College, slapped her with votes of no confidence. By vigorous backpedaling, Chancellor Reynolds appears to have mollified many of her critics, but the outcome of her efforts is still in doubt.
Gerhard Casper, president of Stanford University, explains the politics of academia this way: "Many people think of universities as hierarchical because they have a president with a fancy title, and three or four levels of professors, but they are not hierarchical. Power comes from the bottom up. The most important decisions to be made are those concerning admissions, curriculum and faculty appointments, and these are areas where the university president has almost no power. In most circumstances, I'm the man with the pail and the broom."
University presidents are not totally without clout, of course. "I have the power of the pulpit," said President Casper. And President Rupp of Columbia believes that administrative finesse helps. There will be faculty resistance to the shift of emphasis to undergraduate education if it is considered "a devaluation of research and scholarship," he said. "If it is perceived as restoration of a balance, it will be welcomed."
He may be right. But last summer, when the Illinois Board of Higher Education urged a shift of emphasis from research to teaching, faculty members throughout the state were hostile. Mitchell Vogel, president of the University Professionals of Illinois, dismissed the recommendation and snapped that the board would have been better advised to study "administrative bloat."
Linda Ray Pratt, president of the American Association of University Professors, observed that, "Naturally, faculties are not very eager to participate in losing their jobs." Ernst Benjamin, general secretary of the A.A.U.P., commented that faculty members were "indeed conservative when asked to approve a consolidation that they see as a threat to academic integrity." Mr. Benjamin said that in the 15 years between 1975 and 1990, full-time faculty increased by only 6 percent whereas administrative positions went up by 45 percent. "That's why many faculty members would like to see the administration reduced in size before academic programs are cut," he said.
Thomas Day, the San Diego State president who went through a bruising fight with his faculty last year, contends that accusations of administrative bloat are frequently irresponsible. "Some people argue," he said, "if you want to cut 25 percent of the faculty then cut 25 percent of the administration. But you can't do that. In the administration, you have one president, four vice presidents and eight deans. Do you want to cut the dean of arts and sciences? The director of student health? Or the director of security? When you stop and think about it, you realize it isn't that simple."
Other administrators suggest that faculty members are also too often unreasonably rigid when asked to take fresh approaches to benefit new students in the courses they teach. Last spring, Paul Sherwin, then dean of humanities at the City College of New York, which has a large number of Haitian-American students, proposed that a special introductory course in French be offered for Creole-speaking Haitian-Americans, which would build on their knowledge of a closely related language. "The idea was not picked up, although you would think the French faculty would see this as a way of serving students and reducing costs," said Dean Sherwin, who was recently appointed a vice president for development.
Presidents are generally reluctant to characterize faculty unwillingness to cooperate on the issue of consolidation and restructuring. But some do speak out. Frederick Starr, who has announced his intention to leave Oberlin College in Ohio in June after 11 years, said in an interview: "Faculty, staff and trustees are deeply conservative and resistant to change."
 President Casper of Stanford came close to saying as much: "Accomplishing selective excellence is immensely difficult. You try to close down a library school, for example, and there's resistance. The people who oppose you don't have to make the trade-offs. They can simply say, 'It's a good thing, so why are you trying to get rid of it?' "
Robert Zemsky, a professor of education at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education, sides with presidents on the question of administration bloat. He argues that administrations grew so much because they "have had to hire people to do things --like being student advisers and teaching undergraduates -- that the faculties were no longer interested in doing." Professor Zemsky said, too, that many researchers were hired as professional staff appointments and consequently are listed as administrative personnel.
 
No Financial Incentive for Change
 The reason faculties tend to resist change, he said, is that midcareer and senior professors lack any financial incentive to support it. "They ask themselves, why bother to teach those Philistines in the business school, or adult learners, or people not as well prepared for our courses as in the past?" Professor Zemsky said. "And, they ask, why cooperate with someone who's going to cut the size of my department by 25 percent? I'm outta here in 10 or 11 years, they say, so why should I bother?"
If the faculty community proves unwilling to accept change, said Professor Zemsky, it is sure to be imposed from without. "The without," he said, "are the brute economic realities for private institutions and further cutbacks by city, state and Federal legislatures for the public institutions."
Doubtless there is a need for a cease-fire and give-and-take on both sides. But fundamentally what it comes down to is whether the faculties that actually run higher education can and will adapt to the new realities.
The struggle need not be a fight to the finish. Despite feeling relatively powerless, Gerhard Casper of Stanford is hopeful. "So many different institutions in our society must change that universities cannot consider themselves exempt from reviewing all of their activities," he said. "Selective excellence and other necessary changes will happen because they must happen."
Robert E. Pollack, a professor of biological sciences and former dean at Columbia University, says change is possible given the necessary sensitivity to faculty prerogatives. "The colleges and universities that will do well and improve themselves at a time of contraction and retrenchment," he said, "are those where the faculty is invited to participate in hard decisions rather than being told what those decisions are."
President Starr of Oberlin also looks on the bright side. "The crisis is forcing us to focus again on the core mission of higher education," he said. "That's 100 percent healthy. This is a golden time, painful yes, but golden because serious questions are being raised."

HEADLINE: Back to School for GATT and Nafta

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
AS THE acronyms GATT and Nafta fade from the nation's front pages, they are beginning to appear in university catalogues around the country, describing new courses aimed at helping business and professional people prepare for a new era of intensive international trade. Most of the demand is from continuing-education departments whose students will be forced, in their professional roles, to work under rapidly changing conditions and with sets of dizzying new rules.
For instructors, the task at hand now is to wade through the 550 pages of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as well as the more than 3,000 pages of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and prepare courses that are useful and do not bore the often restive students to tears. 
 "We're trying to be as practical as possible for our participants who are trying to do business," said Robert W. Jerome, director of one such course being developed at the University of Maryland. "It may be more appropriate, for example, to knock on the door of the appropriate bureaucrat in Brussels rather than set up a focus group in Lyons."
Making the task even more complex is that the historic liberalization of trade continues and expands at a breathtaking pace. The European Community, having ratified the Maastricht treaty, must now institute the treaty's myriad rules on everything from potatoes to high-speed data transmission; talks on Asia-Pacific economic cooperation are proceeding briskly; America's bilateral negotiations with Japan, which cover many areas that are only lightly touched by GATT, resume this month.
 
3 Types of Courses
 At least three kinds of courses are being developed, and more permutations will arise. All three try to make cross-references to GATT, Nafta and other broad trade developments but try to focus on one geographic area. In Maryland, the emphasis is on Europe and GATT; in California, on Mexico and Nafta; and in Georgia, on China's coming entry into GATT as well as its investment opportunities.
Perhaps the most striking example of the trend is at the University of Maryland's University College. For years the university has been offering a series of non-credit and credit courses on international commerce that would take part-time students as long as seven years to complete. But in August the college expects to offer a one-year for-credit course in Germany that repackages much of the course material.
As now designed, it resembles Insead, or Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affaires, the elite French business school, which also has a one-year degree program. The difference is that the Maryland course has few of the daunting admissions standards that Insead requires. For example, the minimum grade point average is 2.75 and the minimum GMAT score is 500, lower standards that would allow students with weak academic credentials but rich practical experience to participate.
The Maryland course is known as the Master of International Management program at Schwabisch Gmund, a small town a half-hour from Stuttgart. The town contains a campus of the University of Maryland, rather than borrowed facilities from an indigenous university. There will also be field trips to Brussels, headquarters of the European Community.
A maximum of 35 early-to-mid-career executives and professionals, picked from a variety of nations and industries, would all take the same courses with the same goal -- "how to get things done," said Nicholas H. Allen, dean of the graduate school of management and technology. The course would emphasize global theory and practice. "We would, of course, teach the intricacies of GATT and the E.C.," Mr. Allen said. "But we would also say that in Germany it would be inappropriate to offer a small gift, as in Japan, but it would be entirely appropriate to celebrate with a good meal at a restaurant at the completion of negotiations."
 
A Cultural Context
 More importantly, because the course will be conducted in Germany, the geographic and financial center of Europe, the cultural context will become more evident, said Mr. Jerome, director of the Maryland program in Germany.
At the University of California at Los Angeles later this month, U.C.L.A. Extension will offer "Doing Business in Mexico." It will be taught by Duane Zobrist and Carlos Valderrama. Mr. Zobrist is a senior partner and Mr. Valderrama is a non-lawyer and research director for Latin American operations at Carlsmith, Ball, Wichman, Murray, Case and Ichiki, one of the first United States law firms to open a full branch office in Mexico. The three-month course will emphasize developing a marketing plan for a product or service to be sold in Mexico, with opportunities and pitfalls contained in the Nafta treaty.
Perhaps the most intriguing program is in Marietta, Ga., at Kennesaw State College's business training program for Chinese managers. It is an outgrowth of an exchange program eight years ago with China in which Chinese managers learned the rudiments of capitalism by field trips to nearby Atlanta and Savannah. Now, says Violet A. Towne, dean of continuing education, instructors are rethinking the program to reflect GATT and China's pending application to join the organization in a few years.
"We live in very interesting times," Ms. Towne said, recalling the ambiguous Chinese expression.

HEADLINE: Cramming for Kindergarten

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla 

 BODY:
I STARED intently at the white-and-red fowl in the picture, wanting desperately to get the answer right. "What's wrong with this picture?" the tester ordered, and that terrible angst of not having the right answer in class went through me like a knife. It's a hen. No, a turkey. What was that thing?
Then suddenly I relaxed: This isn't your test, you knucklehead, I said to myself. Matt has to answer the question. 
 "Nothing's wrong with the picture," the high-pitched 4-year-old voice answered -- another demerit on the I.Q. test. My city boy didn't have a clue: It was a turkey's head on a hen's body. Getting a teen-ager into Harvard is nothing compared with the madness of getting a child into a Manhattan kindergarten. It's not just New York, of course. A full year before their tykes will set foot in the schoolyard, parents across America enter whirlwinds of frenzy vying for space in "the best" kindergarten.
Gina Ginsberg Riggs, executive director of The Gifted Child Society in Glen Rock, N.J., says parental angst over finding the best possible school for gifted kids rears its head in virtually every region of the country from Connecticut to California. "The crazy parents you hear educators talk about aren't crazy," she says. "Educators aren't prepared with programs for these children, so they handle it by saying 'go away.' "
The handicapped kid who can't walk has needs that are obvious, Ms. Riggs explained, but the bored child who passes the hours staring out the window "has no crisis proportion," she said. Thus, far more gifted kids exist than do classroom seats t for them, she said.
The drill, no matter the city or town, is much the same. It moves from Round One, the rush to meet application deadlines before Thanksgiving and a whirlwind of school tours; to Round Two, parent interviews; to Round Three, "group" sessions in which the child interacts with others. The latter is the point at which junior inevitably repeats all the bathroom words he or she has ever heard.
Through it all, a handful of serene parents persevere with grace. But weaklings inevitably lose it, working themselves into a tizzy. They fret. They stay up nights. They grovel before administrators.
This is the confession of a groveler.
At the Hunter College Elementary School gifted program, one of four we applied for, 800 kids vie for 32 spaces, and the I.Q. cutoff point is at the 98th percentile. But even if your child can show in an I.Q. test that he or she can run a maze faster than 98 percent of his or her sandbox-playing peers, it still isn't enough. Make the cut and then your 4-year-old goes into the pressure cooker of a second testing session, custom-made for Hunter. Remember when preparation for kindergarten was a new lunchbox and a pencil case?
 
The Effect of Crime
 A sad fact of life is that city crime has many clamoring either to "out-district" their kids into the handful of area schools deemed safe by local lore, or push them into coveted enriched programs, where the Board of Education has allowed little "schools within a school." Then there is always the expensive but hard-to-get-into private school.
We took the two-pronged attack on the getting-into-kindergarten project: applications to several of the city's gifted programs, and two applications to private schools. The latter prospect, at $10,000 a year before books, transportation, class trips and baby-sitter fees to cover interminable school holidays, was rendered moot when the recession stole one of our two jobs. ("You're sending him to a New York City public school?" an astonished in-law recently quizzed my husband. "Ten thousand bucks for kindergarten," he retorted.)
Heaven forbid we should have thought about letting Matt try his hand at being one of the smarter kids in a regular public-school classroom. The crusade for the gifted program had a grip on us.
First stop in our process was the dreaded Stanford-Binet IV, a 45-minute I.Q. test. We found out late the night before that Matt was to be tested at 8 the next morning. Thus one sleepy, grumpy child asleep on his mother's lap on the subway.
Another mother was already in the waiting room quizzing her daughter on a few last-minute pointers when a groggy Matt and I arrived. No! I said to myself: These kids are supposed to study for this? Later a friend chastised me for my naivete. Didn't I realize there were cram courses for the admissions test?
Arthur Pober, who was principal of Hunter from 1987 to 1990, acknowledged that the stress can drive parents wacky. He tells of a dentist who wanted his son to get into a gifted pre-kindergarten program, and offered what Mr. Pober regarded as a bribe of unlimited free dental work.
He also mentioned the mother who showed up to meet him at Hunter to be sure she was doing what she should to prepare her son to get in. "She said she was taking him to museums and playing Mozart for him," Mr. Pober recalled. "So I asked her how old the child was, and she told me he wasn't born yet."
I didn't dare tell him about the time I cheated a bit on the application and called my sister-in-law, a teacher, to get a list of the qualities she saw in Matt that would sound best.
Some of the parental anxiety may be self-generated, but much of it is the rotten result of urban living, concluded Mr. Pober, currently director of the Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. "We see the admissions process with much more urgency because we want our kids in a safe situation," he said.
But the excessive aggression and protectiveness, he said, can be harmful. "A parent can wind up pushing a child who is a good little orange into a fruit salad of only apples and peaches," Mr. Pober warned. "It becomes a competition among parents."
And then what? For one thing, kids pick up on the mom-and-pop madness. Like the little fellow who made friends with Matt at a pizza party for 4-year-olds who'd made the cut into P.S. 9's Anderson Program, a gifted program that Matt began this fall. Excited to be meeting a new school friend, Matt nudged up next to the little boy and asked, "Are you going to P.S. 9, too?"
"Oh no," the tyke said with disdain. "I'm going to the Anderson Program." Can Harvard be far behind?

 BODY:
THEY PARK beneath the gray Toledo sky and slog toward the Chrysler Assembly Plant and the droning production line, as their fathers and grandfathers did when the factory was the Willys Overland plant. But as these workers approach the looming walls and smokestacks they are greeted by something new. It is a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, resplendent in glistening chrome. Beside the bike is a young woman, warmly suggesting something few real men could refuse: Sign up here, she says -- for a class in motorcycle mechanics.
The class is presented after work, free, in one of the company classrooms. If you don't like motorcycles, how about a real estate license or learning WordPerfect? And if the worker lacks the basic reading or math skills to master the course -- no problem. Tutors are waiting to help. "If we just offered reading and math, no one would participate," said Jerry Huber, the plant manager. The company had to de-stigmatize remedial training, making it "non-threatening." 
 Welcome to the 90's, where almost anything goes to bring the work force up to world-class standards. To stay competitive, United States industries know they must have a highly skilled force, but believe that America's education system is not adequately producing one. "The cliche is of the American whose VCR keeps flashing 12:00 because they don't know how to program it," said Margot Brown, manager of media relations for Motorola Corporation.
 
Tough Competition
 American companies say they have a difficult time competing with countries like Germany and Japan with an undereducated work force, because a higher level of education is required to communicate in the teams now used in manufacturing, as well as higher math and reading skills to understand instructions and operate equipment. Yet despite a greater proportion of gross domestic product spent on education here than by either of these rivals, Americans' test scores are only moderately higher than the industrialized nations' average in reading, and below their average in math.
In 1988, the latest year for which comparable figures are available, the United States spent 5.7 percent of G.D.P. through government expenditures (exclusive of gifts, grants, tuition and endowment) on education, compared with 4.7 percent for the Japanese and 4.2 percent for the Germans, according to Vance Grant, a specialist in education statistics for the Federal Department of Education's Office of Education Research. By the time total spending on education is calculated, including expenditures on private schools, which he said were higher in the United States than in many other places, the amount was 7.8 percent of G.D.P. in 1992-93. "In spending, we're competitive," Mr. Grant concluded. But he indicated that for what the United States spends, its results should be better.
So, some businesses are taking things into their own hands. Half the small companies and nearly three-quarters of the large ones in the United States now have some sort of skills upgrade program, according to Phyllis Eisen, an official of the National Association of Manufacturers. Industry is spending $40 billion a year educating and training employees, much of it in remedial education.
Harry Featherstone, president of the Will-Burt Company, which manufactures auto parts in Orrville, Ohio, is a leading advocate of educating employees. The company brings in professors from the University of Akron to teach "core competencies," which are basic math and reading skills, on company time. The basics last six months to a year, four to five hours a week. So far, all 250 of his employees have taken a core curriculum that includes math, geometry, blueprint reading and statistical process. Of those, 163 have taken a "mini-M.B.A." program for two more years on their own time. It is the equivalent of the first two years of college, at company expense.
 
Teaching Teamwork
 Part of what is taught is how to work together as a team, with rotating responsibility for safety, costing, production control, materials and personnel. Mr. Featherstone insists that this teamwork, an outgrowth of education, has made his company more competitive. He says he can beat other countries in efficiency and costs and has been able to take work back from Mexico and Japan. Last January, for example, the company captured a contract to manufacture sorters for printing equipment from a Mexican business, even though he pays his workers $11 per hour and the Mexican company pays $2.
Margo Brown of Motorola says that as a result of her company's education program, production per employee doubled over the last six years, while the work force went up by slightly less than 9 percent. In the same period, the number of defects fell from 6,000 per million units produced to 30, and the company is shooting for 3.4 defects per million. The improvement saved the company $3.9 billion in five years.
Motorola had wanted to teach workers new production methods in the mid-80's, but found they were unable to grasp them. "We were disappointed; they weren't getting it," Ms. Brown said. The company gave employees a reading test, and many failed. Those who did were trained in basic reading skills. Motorola officials work with school systems to teach teachers what industry needs.
To do their part in that direction, Motorola offered students communications workshops. Since the workers come from 40 different countries, the company also offered English as a Second Language classes. Ms. Brown credits the education program for the productivity increase.
There are other benefits. Mr. Featherstone's Will-Burt Company has found that a better-educated work force leads to reduced medical costs. He also credits improved education with cutting his workers' compensation bill from over $100,000 in 1985 to $662 last year.
Another solution for companies dissatisfied with the products of public schools is to start their own for the children of their employees. That's what is happening at Minco Technology Labs Inc., a resaler of value-added semiconductors in Austin, Tex. The company's president, Liz Coker, who had not gone beyond the ninth grade herself, launched her school for the children of employees last fall, with 13 children in classes from preschool through fourth grade. After three years the school is eligible to become accredited, which means the students will be tested to see if they have learned enough to transfer into other schools.
Ultimately, Minco is aiming for a school with grades K through 12. "We have to take the responsibility of educating our children ourselves," Ms. Coker said.

Women on the Edge, of Madness, of Life

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby

 BODY:
"MUSIC FROM DOWN THE Hill," at the WPA Theater, is the title of John Ford Noonan's new, unexpectedly sweet, two-character play set in Heavenly Hills, a mental hospital in upstate New York. Though it's not an easy play to like initially, it grows on you. You have to give it time. By intention I suspect, it is all attitude at first: the voice too loud and vulgar, the manner borrowed hip, like that of a middle-class, middle-aged man who wears his baseball cap back to front and dirty white Reeboks with their laces untied.
Yet beneath that disguise you can recognize a delicacy of feeling that is rare in most theater pieces today. "Music From Down the Hill," directed by Terence Lamude, is a cannily constructed melange of alienation, nostalgia and shock effects, diluted only near the end by the kind of upbeat sentiments that are the bread and butter of television. 
 The play's single set is a big, comfortable double room at Heavenly Hills, which is clearly not a snake pit. The room is clinically impersonal, but it appears to be in the class of private institution that costs a mint, or certainly more than most of today's health-care plans will allow.
When the lights come up at the start, the audience is greeted by a long, aggressively lunatic monologue spoken by Claire (Welker White), a woman in her early 20's with the face of a waif who'd like to blow up the world.
"Every time I love someone's music," Claire begins, "I end up hearing these awful stories about their empty lives." In language meant to intimidate by its crudeness, Claire goes on to recall the bloody fight she had the night before, when Marsue De Santos bad-mouthed Bruce Springsteen. She grabbed a pair of shears, stolen from her sewing class, and, beginning with the pinky, cut off the tips of the fingers on one of Marsue's hands. Claire, who has a chip on her shoulder the size of Kilimanjaro, is staking out her territory for the benefit of Margot (Alma Cuervo), her new roommate.
Margot, an older, rather pretty woman, has just arrived at Heavenly Hills accompanied by several boxes of books and a large teddy bear. Short and broad-beamed in her jeans, she sits impassively on her own bed and listens. She is a self-described perfect listener. She has total recall.
To be fully appreciated, Mr. Noonan's play should be listened to with some of Margot's acuity. He can write lines that pierce. Says Claire as she explains why she is so unpopular with the other patients, "They're only jealous 'cause I'm rich and from Greenwich and believe in something powerful."
"Music From Down the Hill" superficially recalls "A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking," the playwright's best-known work. Though the new play also is about two women who sit around talking, it embraces feminism and then goes beyond. "Music From Down the Hill" is about two people, who happen to be women, both long out of touch with what's taken to be reality, who help each other to re-establish connections. Music is their bond -- music the ineffable comforter and consciousness-raiser.
Claire's obsession is Bruce Springsteen, especially his "Born to Run." Margot's passion is Steppenwolf (and the other musicians associated with the 1969 Woodstock music festival) and with the Fillmore East, New York's rock mecca in the late 60's. As it turns out, Heavenly Hills may overlook the Woodstock field where nearly 500,000 people communed for three days of peace, love, harmony and chemically induced trips, good and bad. Whether Heavenly Hills really does overlook that sacred site remains vague. The promise of Woodstock, its flower-power spirit, haunts Claire as well as Margot, and, it's assumed, Mr. Noonan.
The play unfolds in a series of short scenes, separated by blackouts in which the audience hears ghostly reminders of the Woodstock weekend: announcements over the festival's P.A. system. "Elliot," goes one, "the hitchhikers you picked up need the pills from your car."
Though Mr. Noonan supplies Claire with a detailed biography, he skimps on Margot who, maybe because of the lack of details, becomes a mysterious, compelling character. All that is known is that she was a Latin teacher at a private school on Long Island when, in 1969, she discovered rock through one of her students. It was the revelation she had been waiting for. Steppenwolf, Cream, Jimi Hendrix and the others spoke to her without words. Their music unlocked her, so that she could express herself for the first time.
She quickly progressed from passive listener to active groupie, someone who was a mild-mannered, buttoned-up teacher five days a week and, on weekends, a manic participant in the Fillmore East scene. Her specialty: dancing as the spirit moved her. Each side of her double life increased the exhilaration of the other. In the classroom she dazzled her students. At the Fillmore she was Queen of the Boogie.
When her double life was exposed and she was fired from her teaching job, Margot became a full-time groupie, and fell apart. She landed in the bin less than two years later and has been incarcerated every day since, including, she tells Claire proudly, the 972 days when she refused to talk.
THOUGH MR. NOONAN'S language is often rough, it is also precise, evoking the inexpressible effect of the music of one's choice. The scene in which the self-absorbed Claire effectively exorcises Margot's demons is a stunner, played by Ms. Cuervo and Ms. White with a beautifully controlled intensity that gives dramatic weight to the entire play. It is here that genuine tenderness is allowed to surface over bogus attitude.
In some other areas "Music From Down the Hill" is not so satisfying. Reality creeps into this make-believe when you wonder where Margot comes from and who has been footing the bills for all her years in mental hospitals. But because she is so fully realized during the time of the play, these questions can remain moot without destroying the emotional effect or Ms. Cuervo's fine performance.
More difficult to accept are the reasons for Claire's apparently long hospitalization. She tells lies, but these are transparent. Her rage is expressed in language, not mayhem. Claire seems to be not much sicker than a lot of people walking around outside.
The text and the production otherwise work well, even Edward T. Gianfrancesco's set that, at first, seems to be merely an accurate representation of a big room, full of waste space, at a pricey mental facility. As the play proceeds, the waste space becomes a reflection of the awful emptiness of the two troubled lives within that room.
 
'The Rez Sisters'
 Until you read this, you may not know that Manitoulin Island, which is on the Ontario side of Lake Huron across from Michigan, is the largest fresh-water island in the world. Though large by fresh-water-lake standards, Manitoulin is the small, suffocating, virtually cloistered, principal locale for Tomson Highway's "Rez Sisters." The 1986 play, now at the New York Theater Workshop, is about seven indomitable, very chatty woman, who are onstage from start to finish, and about their men, who are never seen.
"The Rez Sisters" is very much into the kind of consciousness-raising that Mr. Noonan explored in "A Coupla White Chicks." In this case the women are Canadian Indians (as is Mr. Highway), residents of the fictional Wasaychigan Hill Indian Reserve. If men aren't the women's main problem, that's only because life on Manitoulin is so economically depressed that most of their husbands, fathers, sons and boyfriends are off-island trying to earn livings. The reservation sister who has a man to knock her around is, in a negative sort of way, fortunate. That's how bad things are.
"The Rez Sisters" dramatizes the lives of these women, who are proud of their Indian heritage but also caught by the promises of an alien culture. They laugh, gossip, fight, reconcile and seek something more: they play bingo. Bingo gives their lives direction and occasional cash. It's the possibility of winning a $1 million bingo jackpot that sends them off on a riotous and forlorn excursion to Toronto, the play's central event.
As directed by Linda S. Chapman and Muriel Miguel and designed by Anita Stewart, the production has a very spare look on the wide New York Theater Workshop stage. Mr. Highway's writing fills in what the scenery leaves out. He not only bluntly defines each character, but he also tells the audience what the characters are seeing at any given minute. In addition to the women, the cast includes two men: an onstage singer-musician and the actor who plays the trickster spirit called Nanabush, the only one to make a killing during the Toronto bingo blast.
Louis Mofsie, who plays Nanabush, doubles with a brief and spooky appearance as the Toronto bingo caller. Also noteworthy are the performances of Gloria Miguel, as the heartiest, most commonsensical of the reservation sisters, and Murielle Borst, as a sister who talks like a biker. Kevin Tarrant is the singer-musician.
"The Rez Sisters" is not for everyone. Mr. Highway is a colorful but unsophisticated playwright. He's less interested in dramatic subtleties than in creating a sense of life and community. "The Rez Sisters" is an ethnic piece originally written for the people it's about. It celebrates the particularity of customs, loyalties, humor, even of racial predicament. Watching it is like eavesdropping.

Boston Chefs: A Family Tree

BYLINE: By NANCY HARMON JENKINS; NANCY HARMON JENKINS is working on a book about Mediterranean food to be published by Bantam in the spring of 1994.

 BODY:
GENEALOGY counts in Boston -- in the restaurant business no less than in the old brick mansions on Beacon Hill. Among contemporary Boston chefs and restarateurs, the ancestral line begins with Jasper North End. Despite his comparative youth, Mr. White is the acknowledged dean and godfather of Boston's notable chefs. Lydia Shire of Biba was once his sous-chef at the Bostonian and at the Parker House. Ms. Shire begat Gordon Hamersley, her former sous-chef who has just opened the splendid new Hamersley's Bistro in the South End. Mr. Hamersley, in turn, engendered Jody Adams, his former assistant, now the acclaimed chef at Michela's across the Charles River in Cambridge.
Meanwhile, in another line of descent, Todd English, who started off at Michela's, has established his own bustling restaurant, Olive's, in Charlestown -- across the river but still part of Boston. And Barbara Lynch, Mr. English's former chef at the mini-bistro Figs, which he also owns, is now in charge at Rocco's downtown, while Paul O'Connell, until recently Mr. English's sous-chef, has just opened his own restaurant in Brookline. 
 If all this sounds confusing, it isn't to Bostonians, who follow the careers of their culinary stars as closely as they watch the downs and ups of the Red Sox or the Celtics. There are, of course, many other good restaurants in the Boston area, like the Legal Seafoods group, deservedly famous for the freshness and quality of its seafood offerings, and some unusual ethnic bistros -- especially Elephant Walk, one of the country's finest Cambodian restaurants.
On the whole, the restaurant scene in the New England capital seems to have regained the promising vitality of the mid-1980's that was brought to a halt by the recession. Economically and in other ways, things are beginning to look up once more. As a result, dining out in Boston is more attractive than it's been in some time.
With all those lines of descent from chef to chef, is there something called a Boston style? I think so, though it's a little hard to define. Contemporary Boston cuisine is robust, even gutsy, in character, with assertive flavors that build on solid Yankee ingredients while drawing on the city's strong Mediterranean heritage for garnishes and seasoning. At Biba you see those strands in the magnificent basket of breads that appears on the table -- Italian focaccia, Indian chapatis, millet rye and solid whole wheat, all made here -- but it's also evident in imaginative creations like a delicate strudel roll of slivered red cabbage and potato, sliced and stacked sushi style and garnished with just a touch of white truffle oil to accompany grilled scallops ($16). At Providence, you see it in the fresh Maine scallops that Mr. O'Connell grills over wood embers and serves on a fragrant sauce of dried porcini mushrooms with a risotto enlivened by meaty bits of oxtail ($17.50). And at Olive's, what I call New England-Mediterranean eclectic is evident in a ginger-rubbed leg of lamb that Mr. English sends to the table with a refreshing Middle Eastern cucumber salad accompanied by a savory Armenian flatbread called lahm ajune topped, in this version, with goat cheese and garlic ($19.50).
As befits one of the country's oldest fishing ports, Boston is also distinguished for the quality of its seafood, although the decline of the North Atlantic fishery in recent years has forced fishermen and chefs (as well as diners) to become more adventurous. This is one part of the country where you will find salt cod, that New England staple, used as fearlessly and imaginatively as it is in the Mediterranean. At Jasper's, salt-cod cakes are wrapped in a crisp potato crust and bathed in a velvety sauce of saffron and leeks ($19). At Michela's, Jody Adams roasts fresh and salt cod together and serves them on a bed of wilted bitter greens with polenta crusts on the side ($18).
So-called trash fish, like skate, cod cheeks and squid, also gain distinction in the hands of Boston chefs. At Hamersley's Bistro, skate wings, succulently gelatinous with an almost creamy texture, are served in a crunchy crust enlivened by crumbs of horseradish ($18.50), and at Aigo, Ana Sortun, the restaurant's young chef, breads skate wings with Provencale chickpea flour and serves them on a bed of melting spinach ($16.50). There's a charming sassiness, too, about the crisp cod cheeks and potatoes at Providence garnished with a rich lobster sauce ($16.95).
New England seafood really comes into its own at Jasper's. Perched on the waterfront edge of the North End, the warm and comfortable brick-walled restaurant is not a fish house, per se -- pheasant, pork chops and a double rib of beef were all featured on a recent menu, along with a main-course vegetable platter. But as Mr. White's knowledge and skill with seafood has grown over the years, so has the role it plays on the menu. Raw shellfish, all from northern waters, are sparkling fresh (a selection of oysters and littleneck clams was $12 when I was there). A down-home appetizer like fried clams ($12) becomes, in Mr. White's hands, an apotheosis of crisp succulence.
Mr. White is a staunch advocate of first-rate local ingredients, which he handles with great respect, combining them imaginatively yet allowing the purity of flavors to shine through. The seafood is all from New England or nearby waters, the pheasant breast comes from Vermont, the vegetables are locally grown and range from humble parsnip puree or baked yellow-eye beans to a gratin of artichokes and potatoes.
Lobster preparations are especially masterful here: in a creamy bisque garnished with tomalley-spread toast ($12), as a main-course grill with a drizzle of garlic oil ($35), roasted with a green mince of chervil and chives ($35), or simply turned into a rich butter to garnish a piece of grilled turbot ($26). No lobster desserts yet, but except for the sweet course, you could make a whole meal on lobster here. Main courses range in price from $16 for the vegetable platter to $35 for lobster.
Jasper's has a well-balanced wine list that includes New England fruit wines (try a sweet and lush plum wine from Nashoba Valley with dessert), hard cider from western Massachusetts and a varied selection from California, France and Italy. Of special interest is a section on the wine list called "While They Last" -- end of the bin bottles at very good prices, like a Rex Hill pinot noir from Maresh Vineyards in Oregon for $26.
At Olive's, the handsome, dark-red dining room and bar is crowded, lively, even a little confusing on a Saturday night, at least in part because the restaurant will not accept reservations for fewer than six. Be prepared to stand in line. The Mediterranean is very much in evidence here, whether in a new-fashioned Greek salad made with arugola and dressed with a cumin-lemon sauce ($6.50), or a wonderfully old-fashioned dish like squash-stuffed tortelli, pasta pockets served with a healthy drizzle of brown butter and crumbled fresh sage ($14.95 for a full portion; half-portions of pasta dishes are also available). Olive's tarts (a name Mr. English prefers to the more restrictive term pizza), baked in the restaurant's brick oven, are renowned for unusual combinations like my favorite, lentils with sheep's milk ricotta, crisp raw cucumbers and red onions ($6.95). Main courses range in price from $15.50 for an elegant spit-roasted chicken with roasted garlic and a mashed potato cake, to $25.95 for a steak grilled over wood embers served with roquefort mashed potatoes and a selection of roasted vegetables.
Just up the street from Olive's is the original Olive's, now called Figs, an even more informal pizza-and-pasta place. I shouldn't tell you much about it because my daughter is the chef there, but I will mention that Figs has consistently won the annual "best of Boston" pizza contest sponsored by a local magazine.
One of the problems with Boston dining is that so many of the city's fine restaurants are open evenings only. Fortunately there are exceptions to the rule, among them Biba, an especially nice choice for lunch because outside is a handsome view over the Public Gardens and inside, one of the handsomest restaurant interiors in the country. Designed by Adam Tihany, its dark wood floors and brass fixtures suggest a club-like atmosphere that is transformed by colorful kilims and painted ceiling designs. But food is what we're here for, and the lunch menu, while more restricted than that for dinner, is fully as eclectic. Earlier this year, we tried a thin semolina pizza with a jamlike confit of onions and thin shavings of liver ($13.50) and a wonderful combination of deep-fried Maine clams, sweet little smelts, Cape Cod bay scallops, and chips of carrots and beets, served with a puddle of spicy rouille ($15). A good selection of wines by the glass includes predictable delights like a Kendall-Jackson sauvignon blanc ($4.50) as well as more unusual offerings like Giacomo Conterno's dolcetto from Italy's Piedmont ($5.50). There is also a full list.
Another good spot downtown for lunch, Rocco's, is beginning to win new accolades with Ms. Lynch in the kitchen. Like Mr. O'Connell at Providence, she puts an emphasis on Mediterranean, especially Italian, preparations. Even local ingredients are given a touch of Southern Europe, as in the Wellfleet littleneck clams served with cheese-laced polenta and a spicy tomato sauce ($8.25). Pastas show that rare touch in this country, a restrained hand: A simple spaghetti with a bolognese ragu is almost perfect, the pasta and sauce in elegant symmetry ($8.75), and when I was there, ravioli stuffed with wild mushrooms, beautifully balanced with crisp-fried potatoes, came with a green sauce that recalled pesto but was more complex ($9). Rocco's wine list is strong in Italian entries, with a good choice from $18 and $30.
Boston chefs like these are distinguished by a strong sense of camaraderie. That may seem to have little to do with food, but the friendly rivalries and respect that develop from spending time in each other's kitchens, I believe, go a long way toward explaining the Boston style.

HEADLINE: IT'S A WONDERFUL SCIENCE

 BODY:
Economics is hardly my favorite social science, but your Sunday feature "It's a Wonderful Science" (Dec. 12) is after the wrong villain. The shorter hours "movement" was begun by workers and union leaders, at least in this country, and was already alive and well here at the start of the 19th century, if not before. In fact, most economists, together with the business community, have been against it ever since, using some of your argument. 
 Work-time reduction can work if productivity increases (and the fruits thereof go to the workers); an alternative approach would be to reduce wages, or corporate profits. (The reduction-of-wages approach was used by private firms during the Depression, which is why the Roosevelt Administration pushed the 40-hour week through Congress in 1938.)

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Updating A Home's Coverage

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
DO you have adequate insurance on your detached house? The question takes on added urgency since the Midwest, Florida, California and even the normally benign Northeast experienced either flood, fire or windstorm over the last 18 months.
The stark pictures of devastation suggest that partial coverage -- based on the notion that a home is rarely totally demolished -- may no longer be adequate, no matter how sheltered the setting might seem. 
 A further concern has been the tremendous growth of the home office. It may require an added layer of insurance or a separate business policy to cover inventory and special equipment or liability issues, such as a customer's being injured on the premises.
"You can't automatically assume that everything will be covered on your regular homeowner policy," warned John Robertson, director of underwriting for the property-casualty division of State Farm Insurance, based in Bloomington, Ill.
Relying too much on the protection of an automatic inflation rider to keep the policy up to date may also be misguided. An article in the February 1992 edition of The National Underwriter, an insurance trade journal, estimated that 67 percent of the nation's homes might lack adequate insurance.
The figure was based on a study of 20,000 replacement-cost estimates by Marshall & Swift, a company based in Bridgewater, N.J., that provides statistics to the insurance and real estate industries. The results have remained valid in subsequent surveys, said Robert Crine, a vice president of the company.
The main problem, the study noted, resulted from inadvertently passing along incorrect information to the insurance company at the outset. Years then would go by without that information's being corrected, or any improvements' being taken into account
Such improvements might have involved a new addition, an updated kitchen or bathroom, a basement fitted out as a playroom or expensive new windows. "You must inform your agent whenever you make changes," said Robert E. Mackoul, president of Mackoul & Associates of North Bellmore, L.I.
John E. Bardes, a partner with the Ralph Solomon and John Bardes Organization, an insurance agency in Boca Raton, Fla., said that another pattern of underinsurance had been found after the havoc caused by Hurricane Andrew. Too many policies, he said, mistakenly reflected market value rather than replacement cost.
Where market value was higher it did not matter. But when market value was lower, coverage was woefully inadequate. The same problem is likely to arise in the Northeast, warn agents, following the prolonged weak market that has sent values into a tailspin while construction costs have remained stable or are rising.
Underinsurance was also prevalent, said Mr. Bardis, in homes that did not meet current building-code requirements. Owners of older homes should therefore be especially alert since any reconstruction will have to meet those standards.
Compounding these errors have been the attitudes of lenders. Very often a lender will insist only upon a level of home insurance that protects the mortgage amount. The borrower may then confuse that figure with replacement-cost needs.
"The bank's figure is never a good source," warned John Hoard, president of Long Island Coverage of Happaugue, L.I.
He gave as an example a house in Huntington, L.I., that might sell for $250,000 (with land) and cost $200,000 to rebuild. By contrast, the same house in nearby Amityville, he said, may sell for only $160,000 but could still cost $200,000 to replace.
Thus anyone who has made a large down payment -- say, more than 20 percent -- and may have relied too heavily on the lender's insurance requirements could also be underinsured.
Another high-risk category is the homeowner with expensive belongings. "The older you get the higher the value of your contents in relation to the building," said Mr. Robertson of State Farm, noting that people tend to accumulate more and more as time goes by.
Basic-contents coverage is normally based on the replacement cost of the home. For example, the Huntington house insured for $200,000 would carry on average $100,000, or 50 percent, worth of contents coverage.
But are your contents worth only 50 percent of the replacement cost of your structure? For too many people, even younger ones, the answer is no. "I've seen $25,000 worth of electronic gear in one rec room," said Mr. Robertson.
Thus another review should be the percentage of contents coverage in relation to the structure. The only homeowners who may be precluded from raising that percentage are those in an assigned risk pool. These are the homes like the ones along the Long Island coast that commercial carriers no longer wish to insure.
In those instances contents coverage may have to remain at 50 percent. However, Mari Ann Cole, vice president at Long Island Coverage, said the shortfall could sometimes be made up by taking out a separate policy for particularly valuable items.
Indeed, insurance agents suggest that any homeowner who has expensive belongings such as paintings, jewelry, collectibles, antiques or musical instruments should have them separately insured.
In those instances the pieces must first be appraised. "That way we both agree in advance on the value of the item," said Mr. Robertson.
But someone in an assigned risk pool may be charged extra to separately insure these items, warned Ms. Cole, with premiums starting as high as $1,000 a year.
Anyone already carrying normal coverage in an area that has recently been deemed off limits to new accounts -- such as homes in certain coastal towns -- should not worry. They should still be able to upgrade or add to an existing policy without paying excessively for the privilege, said James Kalach, a spokesman for The Travelers Companies, an insurer that recently excluded Connecticut shore communities and Long Island from the list of areas in which it will sell insurance to new customers.
How much will all this policy upgrading cost? Not as much as expected, although premiums vary dramatically among companies and also depend on location. State Farm, whose premiums are close to an industry average, offered the following example.
Say a homeowner in Passaic County, N.J., was paying $433 a year for a $200,000 comprehensive policy with a $500 deductible. An additional $44 could raise contents coverage from $110,000 (55 percent) to $140,000 (70 percent); a further $58 would provide a "replacement cost rider" whereby the homeowner would be reimbursed for replacing any item, not just its value when lost.
On a individual basis, $50 would insure a $10,000 violin or a $10,000 painting. Coverage on computer-related equipment could raise the normal $3,000 equipment limit to $8,000 for just $13. Such add-ons may be well worth the price.

HEADLINE: A Secure Rental Oasis For East New York

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
WHEN Marvin Williams returns to his Brooklyn apartment complex he reaches not for keys, but for a plastic card that opens the driveway gates leading to his secured community.
Once inside, he rounds a traffic circle and eases his car into the garage under his apartment building, where a reserved space is waiting. One flight up, on the deck of the parking garage, is a landscaped garden and play areas for the pleasure of his family and others who live in Spring Creek Gardens. 
 Mr. Williams and his wife, Roberta, who above all cherish the security of the place they call home, do not live in some luxurious fortress where residents pay dearly for the privilege of a safe haven. Their two-bedroom home is in a low-income housing complex in East New York, a section of Brooklyn more often associated with danger and decay than with attractive, affordable housing.
The creation of Spring Creek Gardens, the community where the Williamses and more than 500 other families live, reflects the city's attempt in the 80's to find ways of providing low-income housing through benefits to developers of market-rate apartments when traditional sources of funds for low-income housing programs had all but dried up.
The East New York complex, which has risen on eight acres of landfill near Kennedy International Airport, has been something of an experiment on several levels. Rather than using traditional forms of government subsidy, the cost of construction was paid for by the sale of tax abatements and tax credits to developers of market-rate housing elsewhere in the city. As a result, when Spring Creek Gardens was completed in 1990 it was debt free, a key ingredient in keeping rents low. Two-bedroom apartments, for example, average $550 a month.
Moreover, its design went against the standard for low-income housing. Instead of high-rise towers, the 585-unit development is made up of a series of four-story, attached town-house-style buildings.
With the first of the Spring Creek Gardens units now five years old, designers, builders, residents and managers are satisfied that the experiment has been a success. Yet even those who express enthusiasm for the Spring Creek Gardens model acknowledge that the community has its problems and it has evolved in ways that its planners did not anticipate.
"LIVING here has given us a sense of safety," said Mr. Williams, in the living room of the two-bedroom apartment he shares with his wife and their 3-year-old-daughter, LaTasha, "without spending a lot on rent we have what people in other buildings pay much higher rents to have and enjoy."
Mr. Williams, a computer processor for a Manhattan billing company, and his wife moved from another part of East New York, where they were paying a third more in rent than they are now. So anxious were they to find a place in the complex that they accepted a studio there until their daughter was born.
The impetus for this development, which occupies a full block just to the south of Linden Boulevard bounded by Loring Avenue, Forbel and Amber Streets, was a 1984 change in the Section 421a tax program.
In response to criticism that the tax abatement was being applied mostly to luxury level housing, the city banned its use for developments between 14th and 96th Streets in Manhattan. In exchange, developers were given the option of using the credits to build low-income housing or selling the credits to developers who would do so.
In the case of Spring Creek Gardens, the developers, General Atlantic Realty Corporation in partnership with the Related Companies, used income from sale of tax credits to companies like Zeckendorf Properties and Sherwood Equities to cover most of the costs of buying the land and building the housing at Spring Creek.
To put up Spring Creek Gardens, the developers also made use of the a Federal low-income housing-tax credit sold to corporations and individuals to spur the development of low-income housing. Supporters of the tax abatement program that created Spring Creek Gardens say it is the best way to provide affordable housing without direct government spending and that without it the city would have no new privately built low-income housing.
But critics have complained that the taxes lost were too high a price to pay for the housing. (For every low-income unit built, a developer could buy 10-year tax abatements on five market-rate units elsewhere.) Detractors also said that by allowing developers to build the low-income housing one place and take tax breaks on market-rate developments in another, the program further encouraged racial and economic segregation.
The total cost of building both phases of Spring Creek Gardens -- the second phase was completed in 1990 -- was about $70 million. But because construction funds were not borrowed, but raised through the sale of tax credits, the complex has no mortgage. Rent paid by the tenants goes toward paying for maintenance and repairs, management fees and recreational programs for the residents.
The rent also provided a small profit for the owners, Spring Creek Associates. Phipps Houses, one of the oldest and largest nonprofit housing management organizations, is the managing agent.
ORIGINAL plans called for a third phase of development that would have brought the number of units to 750. But before construction started the city decided that any additional housing in Spring Creek should be for a mix of incomes. Development of the third phase is now on hold.
The design of the complex was a key ingredient in providing residents with the level of security they now enjoy. Theodore Liebman, a principal of Liebman/Melting Partnership, which with the firm of Birnbaum Kondylis served as the project's architects, said the goal was to avoid following the pattern of the typical low-income housing development -- the high-rise. The result is a series of attached, four-story walkup buildings with flat roofs and white and terra cotta-colored facades.
"It is a myth that the only way to achieve high density is with a high-rise design," said Mr. Liebman.
"High-rises are dehumanizing and can be dangerous. There are so many reasons why high-rises are wrong for this type of housing. Not only do you compromise on security and safety with high-rise design, what is often lost is a sense of community."
The architects maintain that at 50 units per acre, Spring Creek Gardens accommodates nearly as many units as many high-rise designs.
In Spring Creek Gardens, the entrances to apartments lead directly outside instead of to an interior corridor. Just one section of a building, housing elderly tenants, has an elevator. Other residents must climb exterior staircases.
"The exterior stairways provide two functions," said Mr. Liebman, "First they offer more security because they make most of the front doors visible. Also they allow for more interaction between residents. People more likely to stop and chat on a staircase than in an internal corridor."
Save for the driveway gate, the complex is completely enclosed by either building walls or fencing.
City zoning rules required that parking be provided for 70 percent of the units in the complex. To preserve as much open space as possible, the architects tucked the parking under the housing. Ten feet above the ground-level garage is a landscaped deck with playgrounds, benches, trees and gardens designed by Schnadelbach Associates, a landscape architectural firm.
Serena Miller, the manager of the complex, who has been with Spring Creek Gardens since it opened, said that the city required that at least 30 percent of the residents there be from East New York. As it has turned out, Ms. Miller said, about 80 percent of the residents moved from other parts of East New York. Many came from apartments where they have lived doubled up with relatives or friends.
The current income eligibility range for people to move into the complex is $17,500 to $25,000, depending on family size, according to Serena Miller, manager of the complex.
WHAT some residents have to say about their community makes it clear why there is a waiting list of 500 names.
"It can be such a beautiful place in the spring and summer," said Annette Green, who has lived in the complex since the first phase opened in 1988, "when the trees are green and the flowers are in bloom. It is kept very clean." Shawn Lewis, who lives with her mother, grandmother and 5-year old sister said that their apartment offers more room than the one-bedroom apartment where they used to live.
"It is a lot safer here too," said the 26-year-old Ms. Lewis, "My sister has a little jeep that she loves to drive. She couldn't have a toy like that if we lived on a regular street. We'd be worried that a car would run up on the sidewalk or that someone would try to take it from her. But everyone here knows each other and we look out for each other."
But Mr. Williams, who is president of the tenant organization, says that residents and the managers at Spring Creek Gardens now face the challenge of not letting the very thing that most resident most value -- the security -- turn into a spoiler.
"People want to live here because it is safe," said Mr. Williams during a walk through the complex, "We are trying to make sure that the community stays that way."
One unwelcomed side effect of the success of Spring Creek Gardens is that there are more residents than planners had anticipated.
The apartments are small since planners expected that the community would be most attractive to older single people, young couples or single parents with one or two children. But instead of an expected population of about 1,400 residents, managers believe that as many as 2,000 people live in Spring Creek Gardens and that half of them may be children.
"SOME people have added to their families after moving in," said Ms. Miller, the manager, "and in other cases people who live here have been asked by relatives to take in children because it is so safe here."
Mr. Williams is working with Ms. Miller and other residents to revive the boys' club and expand activities for young people in the complex.
"The majority of kids here are good," said Mr. Williams, "Some want to show off or make trouble. We need more parents to be involved. It is not always so easy to get people to take time away from their work and responsibilities. But it's important to keeping the community a place where we all want to live."
Although the tax-credit programs that created Spring Creek Gardens are still in place, it remains to be seen whether they will be used again to duplicate this kind of housing.
"The development of housing like Spring Creek Gardens," said Alan Wiener, a principal of General Atlantic Realty, one of the developers of the complex, "depends on the sale of tax certificates to developers. Right now there is no market for the certificates because there is virtually no development of market-rate housing in New York City."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
For East Harlem, a 135-Unit Midrise Co-op on a Park

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
RISING from a long sleep, the publicly assisted co-op is about to make its appearance once again in New York City, across the street from North General Hospital in East Harlem.
This modern version of the limited-equity co-op is a cousin to the Mitchell-Lama middle-income co-ops of the 60's and 70's, and a complement to the occasional mixed-income rentals that also use tax-exempt bonds. It could become the housing type of choice in some locations as the city seeks to encourage home ownership in multifamily housing. The backing of a major local institution as a nonprofit sponsor -- in this case, the hospital -- will be helpful. 
 The new co-op will rise on the vacant block along Madison Avenue in East Harlem from 122d to 123d Streets, opposite Marcus Garvey Park in the Milbank Frawley East urban renewal area. A six-story building will face the park and two wings of four stories, separated by a landscaped courtyard, will run down the side streets.
"I believe in this product, that's for sure," said Deborah C. Wright, who Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has named Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. In an earlier housing job she was responsible for marketing the 600 apartments of the Towers in the Park mixed-income condominium at the northwestern corner of Central Park for the New York Housing Partnership, a private organization that assists in the development of for-sale moderately priced housing.
Ms. Wright said that Borough Presidents were pushing for higher-density housing on such large development tracts as Melrose Commons in the Bronx and Arverne in Queens. Tenant-owned housing is one way to bring this about, while holding down the level of city subsidies required.
Supplementing city subsidies with private financing, she said, is desirable both for budgetary reasons and to give housing opportunities to families that have outgrown existing low-income rentals and public housing, freeing apartments for successor lower-income families.
Milbank Frawley was the name given to 40 blocks of central and eastern Harlem under the Model Cities program in 1967; it was subsequently broken into sections, with the eastern section running from 116th to 123d Streets along the park.
Redevelopment has been slow in this relatively barren stretch, but it got a major lift three years ago with the completion of the new 200-bed North General Hospital. The hospital moved two blocks south from its former home in the Hospital for Joint Diseases, since demolished.
The hospital has established a housing development corporation to be the nonprofit sponsor of a 135-unit limited-equity co-op, intended for people with incomes of roughly $25,000 to $60,000. There will be 97 two-bedroom and 37 three-bedroom apartments, with 40 percent of the apartments reserved for neighborhood residents.
Although the upper limit excludes many potential one- or two-income middle-income families, it is the income range that defines the "moderate- to middle-income" market under existing housing programs. In contrast to the Mitchell-Lama heyday, there is no government program that currently assists middle-income construction, broadly defined.
THE East Harlem development, called Maple Court, will have a rear courtyard and 7,000 square feet of medical offices and surface parking for 83 cars. Construction will start about the end of this month. Occupancy should start in about a year.
The $17.1 million development is principally financed by $11.8 million in tax exempt bonds issued by the city's Housing Development Corporation and insured by the State of New York Mortgage Agency.
The city will be paid a nominal $500 a unit, or $67,500, for the land at the time of the construction-loan closing with Chase Manhattan Bank. In addition, New York City is supplying $4.7 million in capital subsidies, or $35,000 an apartment. If there is a profit when a co-op buyer sells an apartment it is split 50-50 with the city.
The development is eligible for Section 421a tax abatements, so in the early years it will pay taxes based only on the current low assessment.
The key to the Park Court development in East Harlem was a new state law in the 80's that allowed a hospital serving a low-income neighborhood to sell tax-exempt state-guaranteed bonds to build housing. North General Hospital subsequently set up a housing development company. After a request for proposals from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Sparrow Construction Corporation of the Bronx was chosen to build the co-op, following a design by the Manhattan firm of Ehrenkrantz & Eckstudt.
"You look up and down Madison Avenue and you see too many empty lots," said Eugene L. McCabe, president of North General Hospital. "The hospital sees itself as a catalyst for rebuilding the neighborhood."
As a co-op rather than a rental, residents will have a greater personal stake in sustaining housing quality. Yet because of public assistance and the existence of an underlying mortgage paid off over time, down payments are low. The average cash purchase price for a two-bedroom apartment will be $3,600, plus an additional $1,000 that goes into a debt-service reserve fund required by the state mortgage-insurance agency. The average monthly maintenance charge for this two-bedroom unit is $827, of which 60 percent is used to service the building's debt.
The low cash requirement for the co-op means that working people without substantial savings but with adequate incomes for the monthly costs will be eligible to buy. The monthly maintenance payments will be approximately the same as for recently rehabilitated rental housing in the area, which are $850 to $1,000 for a two-bedroom and $1,000 to $1,150 for a three-bedroom.
Even in locations where new housing is salable without direct subsidies, the co-op form has its uses. The most striking example is the ambitious public-private River West development planned along the East River in the Hunters Point section of Queens, where a designated owner-developer owns or controls much of the land.
A PRIVATE consortium organized as MO Associates has been designated to build a 550-unit building in which apartments are to be sold as co-ops. It will use taxable, federally insured financing, but the co-op form will enable apartments to be offered for cash payments of only $15,000 to $20,000. Monthly tax-deductible maintenance payments will then become equivalent to what an older building might charge as rent in Manhattan. One attraction of the site will be a 12-acre waterfront esplanade running a mile and a quarter along the waterfront, to which the city has committed $30 million.
As for tax-exempt financing, in the current market even sites that might normally use conventional financing are turning to it. Builders say conventional financing for market-rate rentals is unavailable.
Thus the Brodsky Organization's 1,000-unit Manhattan West development closed last month on the financing to build 80 percent market-rate apartments and 20 percent low-income apartments on four acres west of West End Avenue between 61st and 64th Streets. The purchaser of the $140 million tax-exempt bond was the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae.
The co-op model is likely to be done in other locations, even without city subsidies, said Barry Zelikson, housing consultant to Sparrow Construction. "You need inexpensive land, efficient construction and the capacity to squeeze every line item."

REMEMBERING DOUGLASS
 Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday on Saturday was chosen as an appropriate day on which to present "Mr. Frederick Douglass," a one-man play written and performed by Fred Morsell, the noted stage and television actor. Curtain time is 8 P.M. at the Rich Forum on Atlantic Street in Stamford. 
 The piece was written about five years ago, based on Douglass' powerful speeches and on his autobiography, "Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave," which he published in 1845.
Douglass' mother, who was exceptionally intelligent, was a slave, his father was white. His youth was spent in various households, some benign, others viciously disciplinarian. He escaped from servitude in 1838 at the age of 21, changing his name from Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey to Frederick Douglass, and made his way north to Massachusetts.
There and in the British Isles he became an eloquent orator and journalist for the abolitionist movement up to and throughout the Civil War, continuing as a popular speaker afterward. During the 1870's and 80's he was appointed to various diplomatic and other government posts.
Mr. Morsell received a master's degree in theater arts from Wayne State University in Detroit. His father, Dr. John A. Morsell, was Associate Executive Director to Roy Wilkins at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from 1956 to 1974.
Tickets are priced at $15 and $25, or $7.50 for students and elderly people. For reservations, 325-4466.
 
BIG DEEDS, SMALL DOERS
 Three stories from children's literature are incorporated into the Little Theater of the Deaf production titled "Heroes Under Five Feet," to be presented on Tuesday at 10 A.M. and again at noon at the Palace Theater in Stamford.
"Keep The Lights Burning, Abbie" by Peter and Connie Roop is based on the true story of Abbie Burgess, a young girl who, during the winter storms of 1856 kept the lighthouse lamps lit and saved many ships from disaster on the Maine coast.
A historic account of a little girl who wrote to the President is the premise of "Lincoln's Famous Beard." She thought his face was too thin and suggested growing a beard to make it look fuller.
The only fictional tale is "Brother to the Wind," which draws on African cultures and their close ties to nature as positive influences on the development of a young boy named Emeke.
Five performers make up the Little Theater of the Deaf, a division of the National Theater of the Deaf in Waterford. Four of the members are deaf, one has normal hearing. The production is designed for both hearing and deaf audiences, employing sign language, body language and the spoken word.
A warm-up before the show begins introduces the audience to signing, and after the performance the audience is invited to suggest situations that the cast acts out on stage.
Tickets at $6 may be reserved by calling 358-2305 weekdays from 9:30 to 4:30.
 
THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE
 "Toil and Plenty: Images of the Agricultural Landscape in England, 1780-1890," the new exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art, covers the century in which England gradually transformed itself from an agricultural to an industrial economy.
It will open on Saturday and remain on view through March 13, featuring 40 oils, 45 watercolors and drawings, and dozens of prints, photographs and illustrated books. Some of England's greatest artists are represented, including J. M. W. Turner, John Constable, George Stubbs, Peter DeWint and Samuel Palmer.
The show was organized by Christiana Payne, an English historian who also wrote the illustrated catalogue published by Yale University Press. The works on view have been gathered from public and private collections in Britain and the United States, with financial support by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
As the pictures in the exhibition advance through the decades, they reflect a more realistic, less idyllic view of the landscape and the farm families who tended it. Agriculture was newly seen by artists as hard work rather than an Arcadian composition. Noontime meals in the fields, informal studies of haymakers and their implements, and the dignity of the lonely farmer performing chores in winter became prime subjects.
Ms. Payne will present a lecture about the exhibition on Friday at 4 P.M., and a symposium will be held on Saturday from 10:30 to 4:30. Scholars, lecturers and professors from four British universities and from the College of William and Mary in Virginia and Indiana University in Bloomington will speak on various aspects of the exhibition's contents and the periods in which the works were created.
Gallery talks by docents will take place for the duration of the show on Thursdays at 11 and Saturdays at noon, followed by a 27-minute video.
The Center, at 1080 Chapel Street, is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 5, Sunday from noon to 5. Admission to the exhibition and all related events is free. For more information, 432-2850.
 
COMBINING THE ARTS
 A series of interdisciplinary programs called "Dancing Out Loud" begins in New Haven on Friday with a concert organized by the choreographer Mary R. Barnett. She has combined her own innovative dance group, called In Good Company, with a number of artists from the Northeast, weaving them into variegated whole. The performance will take place at 8 P.M. at the Educational Center for the Arts, 55 Audubon Street.
Joining her troup will be Dan Hurlin, a New York performance artist who has created, among other things, a piece called "Quintland, The Musical," about the Dionne quintuplets. Berg, Jones and Sarvis head a modern dance company based in Portland, Maine, performing works ranging from lyrical to raucous, and Alison Farrell specializes in acoustic folk music.
Tickets cost $10 and may be obtained by calling 773-1102.

The Siren Across the River

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
FOR the last four or five years, downtown Manhattan's landlords have watched vacancy rates soar and rents spiral down. Yet across the river, along the Jersey City waterfront, space is disappearing.
Harborside Center, 10 Exchange Place and 101 Hudson Street have but a handful of spaces left. Even Newport Office Tower, the seeming white elephant in Newport Center, has less than 40 percent of its space left. 
 And to add insult to envy, most of the tenants sopping up that west-of-the-Hudson space came from -- you guessed it -- Manhattan. What gives?
Unfair competition, that's what, New York officials complain.
"Real estate taxes are fixed at maybe $2 a foot, there's no sales taxes, state funds are used to lure business from New York," said Carl Weisbrod, the outgoing president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation. "Maybe Governor Whitman will end these inappropriate subsidies, but for now we can't compete with them."
New Jersey officials hotly deny that they are deliberately raiding New York.
"I have never wooed a Manhattan company," said Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, a quasi-independent state agency.
Still, while New York officials have primarily tried to hold on to specific tenants, New Jersey officials have helped developers in ways that enable them to do the wooing.
Two buildings, 101 Hudson Street and Newport Tower, are cases in point.
In exchange for a 10 percent equity in Newport Tower, Mr. Coscia's organization provided $6.6 million to build the kind of tenant improvements that would snag the First Chicago Trust Company and USA Networks, the building's first two tenants. And the development agency floated bonds, secured with a lease signed by Lehman Brothers, to provide the nearly $50 million it may take to build the backoffice space that Lehman has leased at 101 Hudson.
"Those buildings were the area's largest blocks of empty Class A space," Mr. Coscia said. "Until they were rented we would never get a new building in Jersey City."
Actually, that cause-and-effect relationship is fairly recent. A few years ago, Manhattan's space squeeze seemed to be the only boost the New Jersey waterfront needed.
"The pressure cooker of New York's space demand boiled over in the mid-80's, and Jersey City was where the overflow boiled to," said Philip R. Sprayregen, a senior vice president of CB Commercial.
This was particularly true for buildings like 10 Exchange Place, just one PATH stop from downtown Manhattan.
"Executives could see it from their windows," said Martha Burton, a managing director at Edward S. Gordon Company, the Manhattan-based brokerage. "And once they realized how quickly they could get across the river, they were sold by the cost savings."
As Manhattan's economy deteriorated, Jersey City's economic advantages took center stage. There's no corporate occupancy tax. Rents in the best buildings are still in the $20's a square foot, and electric power, real estate taxes and operating costs are well below those in New York. And Jersey City is a state Urban Enterprise zone, where most corporate tenants pay no sales taxes.
"Once corporations focused on real estate costs, Jersey City became a really attractive option," said Michael A. Burgio, a Cushman & Wakefield senior director who is leasing agent for 10 Exchange Place Center.
But neither Newport Tower nor 101 Hudson Street was rented before the recession and accompanying corporate retrenchment stemmed the flow of new tenants anywhere. And that's what makes their current success stand out so sharply.
LCOR, 101 Hudson Street's developer, had the easier job of the two: Its building wasn't up yet and could be customized for users. That, more than anything else, snagged its anchor tenant, Merrill Lynch.
LATE in the 80's, Merrill Lynch had seemingly mutually exclusive goals: It wanted lower occupancy costs, a high-tech building and a location close to downtown Manhattan so that its back-office staff, its systems engineers and its Manhattan traders could easily interact.
"No place in the city met those specifications, and it wasn't feasible to gut out an old, asbestos-rife facility," said Mark E. Brooks, Merrill's director of real estate planning.
In stepped LCOR (called Linpro back then), with an offer to build to specifications. The result was 101 Hudson Street, a 1.2- million-square-foot, 42-story tower -- the state's tallest building. It has huge floors well-suited to back-office operations, high ceilings and raised floors that make wires and cables easily accessible, and a vast supply of power and communications wire.
"One of the principal attractions to us was that we were able to participate in designing the building," Mr. Brooks said.
Clearly, Merrill Lynch, which occupies half the building and has its own lobby entrance, designed to others' liking as well. MFS Communications, a fiber-optics provider, has taken a full floor. Lehman Brothers will move in in August. And just last month, Bierbaum-Martin, another financial-services firm, said it would take 32,000 square feet.
"This building is as good as any in Manhattan, but its being in New Jersey made the economics really compelling," said Frank Riemer, a managing director of Edward S. Gordon who represented Bierbaum-Martin.
Similarly, Joyce A. Oberdorf, a Lehman Brothers spokeswoman, estimated that "we're getting this at half the cost of comparable space in Manhattan."
Like LCOR, Melvin Simon Associates, of Indianapolis, built Newport Tower with an anchor tenant in mind. In fact, the 36-story building got its financing because The Limited, the clothing-store chain, agreed to lease half of its million square feet for executive offices. But by the time the building was completed in 1992, The Limited had consolidated its executive offices in Columbus, Ohio.
The Limited tried to sublease its space while Simon sought primary tenants for the rest of the building, all to no avail.
Newport Tower had drawbacks that 101 Hudson Street escaped. It is easily accessible by PATH from 33d Street but is about 10 minutes farther from downtown Manhattan, the New Jersey waterfront's prime tenant source. All but three of its floors are too small for back-office use, but the mall that it abuts has few restaurants or stores that would appeal to a front-office crowd.
"People can't live on hot tamale lunches every day," Mr. Sprayregen said.
Nonetheless, in August 1992 the Limited and the Georgetown Company, a Manhattan real estate investment firm, bought the building, which is now debt-free, and started pursuing high-profile tenants.
Edgar A. Lampert, Georgetown's president, said that when First Chicago moved its top executives from lower Manhattan to Newport Tower, the building was publicly stamped as suitable for executive use. And, he added, when USA Networks set up its television production facility there, it was marked as technologically up to date.
"Their operation looks like Houston Command," he said.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Solar International Shipping Agency, the LEGENT Corporation and Brown Brothers Harriman have all taken space. About 63 percent of the building is spoken for.
"Not bad for a building that was empty 17 months ago," Mr. Lampert said.
IN fact, space is tightening up all along the Jersey City waterfront. Several real estate brokers feel Colgate-Palmolive will soon develop the huge tract that once held its toothpaste factory because it will find tenants to sign preconstruction leases. And a Singapore shipping company recently bought 15 Exchange Place, a 140,000-square-foot building that it will renovate, part for its use, part for rental.
"They're willing to suffer through a sluggish market for a lot longer than a speculative developer would," said Thomas V. Bermingham, the executive director of Edward S. Gordon's New Jersey office.
Andrew J. Merin, a Cushman & Wakefield senior director, has sold 18 acres to G & S Investors for a discount shopping center and 8.5 acres to Avalon Properties for apartments. Now he is pushing 26 acres at office developers. His pitch: "If you start building office space today, by the time it's available there'll be no space left in Jersey City."

New Investment Stirs Renewal in South Norwalk

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
SOUTH NORWALK'S renewal, long subdued by the recession, is stirring again with a combination of private and government investment.
Large projects are being designed to encourage tourism in the waterfront area, the site of the $30 million Maritime Center. In addition, some foreclosed commercial buildings have attracted buyers. 
 But disposition of the former City Hall has proven a thorny problem. Built in 1912, it is on North Main Street, a block west of the Maritime Center and a block north of the boutiques, art galleries and restaurants on Washington Street.
Vacant for almost six years, the Federal-style structure needs $1 million in refurbishing, and its woeful appearance has discouraged investment in the neighborhood.
In recent years, several towns in Fairfield County have faced the problem of disposing of municipal buildings that were abandoned for larger quarters.
Norwalk's solution was to buy the old City Hall from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last month for $248,000, and seek proposals for its use.
The purchase left a profit for the city, which had sold the building to Robert Katz, a local developer, for $1.2 million more than three years ago. At the time Mr. Katz had planned to spend $17 million to convert it into an inn, but economic conditions prevented him from starting the project and the lenders foreclosed on the building.
So far, the suggestion that has generated the most interest the property has come from Ralph Bloom, a city historian. He said he wanted to turn the building into the Norwalk Museum, installing artifacts, documents, records, and industrial and cultural material collected over the last 300 years and held by the Norwalk Historical Commission.
Financing for the renovation could come from the Regional Capital Development Program, through which the General Assembly has allocated $60 million for projects that focus on tourism, manufacturing, and minority-owned small business development in the 11 regions of the state.
Applications for grants from the program had to be approved by all the towns in the region, and filed through a regional planning agency by the middle of last month. Individual communities could not bypass their neighbors and apply directly. The grants will be awarded late this month by the state's Department of Economic Development.
Among the applications in Fairfield County was one filed jointly by Norwalk and Stamford for $2 million to be divided equally to renovate their city halls. Stamford is also considering converting its City Hall to a city museum.
The architectural firm of Beinfield Wagner & Associates is helping to plan the Norwalk renovation. Bruce Beinfield and Jonathan Wagner have been involved in more than 30 design projects in the city during the last few years. Among them is the $8.6 million railroad station, which is under construction two blocks from the Washington Street-Maritime Center Historic District. It is scheduled to be completed in 1995.
Two years ago the architects opened a new office in a two-story, block-long retail building on North Main Street. They got a facade improvement grant of $75,000 from the city, signed on Clayton Fowler, a builder and real estate investor from Stamford, as an additional partner, and bought the building and a one-story warehouse behind it for $800,000.
"We decided that South Norwalk's potential as an arts and entertainment center should be pursued, and we decided to seek creative people as tenants," Mr. Beinfield said.
While the ground floor retains its retail shops, the second floor, formerly storage space, is occupied by their operation, a weaver, fabric designer, graphic designer, an arts marketing firm and an environmental organization. Rents are only $10 to $12 a square foot.
THE brick warehouse that faces Marshall Street was sold to the New England Brewing Company, a small Norwalk beer producer at 25 Commerce Street. Late next spring, the company will move into the building redesigned as a brewery and pub by Beinfield Wagner. The cost, including renovations, will be $2 million.
Added to the building were a second story, a basement and a 45-foot clock tower. Beer will be brewed in two copper kettles from Germany, visible through the front windows and from the pub, which will take up the front quarter of the building and mezzanine.
Patrons will dine on sauerbraten, Wiener schnitzel, soups, sandwiches and cheeses, "foods that traditionally go with beer," said Marcia King, who owns the brewery with her husband, Richard. Visitors will be invited to view the bottling operations and unloading of the grain. A collection of beer-brewing artifacts and memorabilia will be displayed throughout the building. The company's signature beer, Atlantic Amber, won the 1993 gold medal at the National Great American Beer Festival in Denver.
Another Beinfield Wagner project involves the vacant brick building adjoining the Maritime Center, which the architects plan to refurbish and rent in partnership with Mr. Fowler, the Stamford builder, and Gary Chamer, a fourth investment partner.
Commitments have been obtained from two restaurants, a computer-training operation and a children's museum.
"We will present the plans to the Common Council and the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency this month," Mr. Beinfield said. "Once they approve them, we will buy the building from the city and start renovations."
"OUR master plan is to form a loop around South Norwalk that visitors can follow," Mr. Wagner added. "They would walk from the Maritime Center to the children's museum, to the brewery, to the Norwalk Museum at the old City Hall, and wind up at the shops and restaurants on Washington Street."
Mr. Fowler, who owns the Atlas Construction Company, the Soundview Farms office complex and 800 rental apartments, all in Stamford, has also made some independent investments in South Norwalk. In the last year he has bought the Gateway Bank Building and an adjacent office building opposite the City Hall on North Main Street, and a former corset factory on Ann Street that had been partially converted by another developer into stylish one-bedroom residential condominiums of about 800 square feet.
"Only 25 units were finished," Mr. Fowler said. "We will complete the remaining 53 and rent them for around $900 a month, starting next month."
Other outsiders have shown an interest in the district as well. Abdi Mahamedi, a real estate operator based in White Plains, is negotiating with lenders to buy 50 Washington Street. The 185,000-square-foot, foreclosed office building was built in 1972 with 12 stories and an office penthouse. It is almost half empty, and the asking price is $4.75 million.
Through his investment group, Mr. Mahamedi also bought the Norwalk Mall and office tower, a 122,000-square-foot complex on Belden Avenue, near the center of the city. CB Commercial of Stamford was the broker and the price was $2.625 million. The complex is about 90 percent occupied.
Mr. Mahamedi said Norwalk was "the most underpriced town along the I-95 corridor of Fairfield County. Sandwiched between Westport and Darien, it is in one of the highest income areas of the country. Eventually, Norwalk will catch up."

HEADLINE: Businesses Help Educate Workers

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
JOHN COPANEC JR., 24, an employee of the Hibbert Group in Trenton, thought he had left education behind at the end of high school six years ago. Then he signed up for a refresher course in basic math that was taught at his workplace by an instructor from Mercer County Community College, and his attitude changed.
"The math course worked so well that I went on," he said. Since finishing his first course, Mr. Copanec has taken classes in public speaking, reading comprehension and writing at Hibbert, a marketing and commercial printing company. 
 He has been promoted from his entry-level receiving job to the position of account coordinator for one of the company's major clients and hopes to start work on an associate's degree in business in January. Mr. Copanec said the workplace courses had reawakened his desire to learn and increased his loyalty to his employer.
He is not alone. Companies in New Jersey and across the country have begun workplace education programs to remedy employees' educational deficiencies and prepare them to meet the demands of changing technologies. It is notable that this investment in education has come at a time when lean bottom lines and shrinking work forces have become the norm.
 
Report on Lack of Literacy
 A new report on the state's adult literacy problem makes depressing reading. "Adult Literacy in New Jersey -- Meeting the Challenge of the 20th Century" was issued in October by the seven-month-old New Jersey Council on Adult Education and Literacy. Extrapolating from data gathered from the United States Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey, the council estimated that 1.2 million to 1.4 million New Jerseyans function at the lowest literacy level.
These people, according to the report, "may not be able to locate one piece of information in a sports article, locate an intersection on a map or total a bank deposit entry." The report also notes that an estimated 43 percent of New Jerseyans who seek jobs or unemployment insurance have "literacy deficiencies."
Although industry-based education is not new, changes in the work force have made the problem it tackles bigger and more complex than it was five years ago, or even one year ago.
Many workers still need help with basic literacy skills. The number of people who require instruction in English as a second language is increasing rapidly. In a third large category of workers, the employees have basic literacy skills but need specialized courses to help them deal with advancing technology on the job.
Elaine Weinberg, director of workplace literacy at Mercer Community College, has developed education programs for many Mercer County companies. She estimates that in those companies, 15 percent of the employees need help with basic literacy skills and 65 percent need "job-specific" education. Literacy in the workplace, Ms. Weinberg said, encompasses "skills needed by employees now and in the future."
 
Reluctant to Admit Problem
 Helen Archontou, director of the Bergen County chapter of Literacy Volunteers of America, said the health care and hotel hospitality industries had the most pressing need for workplace literacy training, because large numbers of unskilled workers and recent immigrants are attracted to jobs in those areas.
Some companies offer literacy training, but many "don't like to admit there is a problem," said Emily Bledsoe, director of the Bergen County chapter of PLUS (Partners in Literacy-US).
Large and small employers are faced with the need to spend scarce capital on education today in order to have better educated workers in the future. To do the job as effectively as possible, many are seeking help from outside the business community.
That help sometimes comes from community colleges. "We have built up experience with our own credit students," said Ray Campari, director of the Business Assistance Center at Cumberland Community College in Vineland. Community college officials like Mr. Campari seek out local employers to find opportunities to set up workplace education programs.
"We knock on doors of industries to find out their needs," Mr. Campari said. Once those needs become clear, college administrators develop what Ms. Weinberg calls "need-based curriculum." Classes are held either at the workplace or at the community college.
Mr. Campari estimates that in the last year, 20 percent of the classes set up by Cumberland Community College in local companies were devoted to basic literacy skills and the rest to job-specific knowledge.
Ms. Weinberg and her colleagues at Mercer Community College were able to set up programs at several Mercer County industries by obtaining "workplace literacy grants" from the United States Department of Education. The grant money paid for the teachers, and the companies contributed by allowing workers to take courses on company time.
 
Contributions by Companies
 Ms. Weinberg and Mr. Campari agree that companies that pay for all or part of the time an employee spends in class find that many more workers are willing to sign up. "Because of the economy, many cannot do it on their own time," Ms. Weinberg said.
Industries with programs financed by workplace literacy grants and administered by Mercer Community College agreed to "institutionalize" the education programs once a grant has been spent. Ms. Weinberg said one such company was forming a consortium with other local industries to provide customized training programs. Similar consortiums may be a wave of the future, she said.
Another rapidly swelling wave in industry-based education is instruction in English as a second language, or E.S.L. Workers who benefit from this kind of instruction range from Korean executives at Samsung in Ridgewood Park to the recent immigrants who work in the food processing plants in Cumberland County.
"We can't get enough E.S.L. volunteers," Ms. Bledsoe of PLUS said.
Margery Oppenheimer, state director of the Literacy Volunteers of America, estimated that E.S.L. clients would soon account for more than 50 percent of the agency's business.
Samsung, an electronics manufacturer, will soon begin exploring the possibility of coordinating its in-house E.S.L. program with Literacy Volunteers and Bergen Community College.
Peter Altuch, general manager for human resources at the company, said Samsung currently uses a private instructor to teach English as a second language to its workers, about 25 percent of whom are Korean-born. Mr. Altuch, who is also the newly elected president of Bergen County PLUS, said Samsung's commitment to literacy went beyond E.S.L. classes for its own employees to encouraging adult literacy in the community.
"Our business can make contributions to literacy education with product donations, contributions and closed-caption television," he said. The company's Korean owners, he said, are likely to support such efforts because of the high value placed on education in Korea and because of their own interest in having an educated work force in the American communities where Samsung plants are situated.
Such corporate altruism is not rare. Mr. Altuch said Sony was recently recognized by Bergen County PLUS for its outstanding contributions to literacy. On a statewide basis, Panasonic and Schering Plough are the largest corporate sponsors of Literacy Volunteers of America.
 
Literacy Not Only Area
 In the broadest sense, industry-based education can also encompass businesses that do not need literacy programs. Two years ago, Mutual of New York (MONY), which has offices in Bergen County, paid $250 a volunteer to have its employees trained by Literacy Volunteers of America. The MONY tutors, like Phyllis Doloff, an assistant vice president, were also allowed to use MONY's offices after hours for one-on-one tutoring sessions.
Ms. Weinberg, Ms. Bledsoe and others say they believe that the future of industry-based education lies in partnerships among business, government and industry. The key to success, according to the Adult Education and Literacy Council's report, is coordination.
The council recommends, among other things, that the seven state agencies represented on the council work together to make policy. The report also suggests yearly conferences on workplace education and the establishment of a clearinghouse for information on workplace education to be accessible through the state library system.
Literacy experts agree that the problem of an undereducated work force will not be solved by trying to assign blame. "We're all responsible for illiteracy," Ms. Bledsoe said.
Ms. Oppenheimer added that technology, with its rapid changes, has outpaced the ability of institutionalized education to keep up, making industry-based programs essential. "Individuals are not getting less intelligent," Ms. Oppenheimer said, "but the demands of the workplace have increased."

HEADLINE: A New Sphere

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: SAUSALITO, Calif.

 BODY:
The sign in the courtyard said, "Welcome to the Millennium." And next to the offices of the Millennium Whole Earth Catalog -- the forthcoming sequel to the pivotal 60's generational bible -- someone was building an "experiential" multicolored tetrahedron with a metal ball suspended from it. ("Oh, no," muttered a staff photographer, "not again.")
Howard Rheingold, the editor in chief, was dressed in a kaleidoscopic fashion statement that looked as if the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert had wandered onto his clothes. Then, amid a kazoo chorus, Wavy Gravy, that legendary 60's civil disobedient, lead an invocation to bless the M-WEC, as the millennium catalogue is known. One participant described the group of 30 or so writers and editors who had assembled from all over the country for a one-day millennium powwow as "granola-crunching, endorphin-drenched techno-druids." It was the utopia business as usual at 27 Gate Five Road. 
 Twenty-five years ago, Stewart Brand, then a 30-year-old renegade best known as one of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, gazed out an airplane window into "dark nothing" and slipped into a reverie about how he could best help his friends who were starting communes "hither and yon in the sticks." High above Nebraska, he gave birth to the idea of the Whole Earth Catalog, an enterprise that two and a half million readers, a National Book Award and at least one nervous breakdown later, he would call "a mistake that worked."
He and Lois Jennings Brand, who was then his wife, loaded up a Dodge pickup with mimeographed sheets on subjects like tantra art, cybernetics and seeds, and lit out to visit his friends on the New Mexico-Colorado commune circuit.
Shortly thereafter, equipped with some light tables assembled from old doors, he and his friends wrote and designed a shaggy, witty compendium, an "access to tools," whose publication in 1968 seemed, for a time anyway, to open up the world.
Even now, after the Last Whole Earth Catalog (1971), the (Updated) Last (1975) and the Next (1981) have all come and gone, there remains a palpable sense of idealism about it all. But in 1968, the land itself was deemed the vehicle for remaking the planet. Today, it is the computer.
Where the original Whole Earthers communicated via underground newspapers and the United States mail, these days they commune via the WELL (the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link), a computer teleconference system. In place of beekeeping and goat farming, the Millennium Whole Earth Catalog, to be published this fall by Harper San Francisco, will include six pages on how to use the Internet and a section on "citizen encryption," private coded messages to prevent computer intrusions.
The countercultural ideal of democratic access to tools, of living a life independent of established political and commercial interests, is now being applied to a new sphere. "It is not just a collection of knowledge," said Mr. Rheingold, who has served as a consultant to the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment and whose work includes books on virtual reality and the virtual community. "The idea is to change the way people think."
The original Whole Earth Catalog chronicled changes in thinking in all their overwrought peacock glory. To young women in peasant blouses and young men in fringed buckskin, the catalogue was a revelation. Between its covers -- the front a dreamy photograph of Earth as seen from outer space -- an alternative to an inward-looking world, symbolized by the suburbs, unfolded. Like a Teletype for the counterculture, the catalogue encapsulated the aspirations of a generation and offered breaking news from the front.
"We are as gods," went Mr. Brand's anthem, "and might as well get good at it."
Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, an early contributor who is now a professor of performance studies at New York University, said the catalogue "came at a time when we had more time than money." "The message was you could defy the status quo in every aspect of your life, whether it was soybean cooking, organic gardening or kitchen pots," she added.
The catalogue's arrival in 1968, the year of Eldridge Cleaver's "Soul on Ice" and Carlos Castaneda's "Teachings of Don Juan," was "like opening a vein," Ken Kesey recalled. Its renegade message was reinforced by the fact that it shunned advertising and was self-published. Printed on newsprint in a jumpy thicket of graphic styles, some without capital letters, even its physical appearance was symbolic of the broader culture escaping genielike from its former bounds.
No subject was too big or small to escape its notice. Although commonly remembered as a back-to-the-land Sears catalogue or as a rural hippie bible, the early volumes were as concerned about exploring technological frontiers -- space, physics, geodesic domes and computer science -- as they were about creative glass-blowing. A certain Whole Earth Catalog dialectic emerged -- "Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth" juxtaposed with "The ABC/XYZ of Beekeeping"; "Biology and the Future of Man" versus "Your Key to Psilocybin Mushrooms."
TO Abe Peck, the chairman of the magazine program at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University and the author of "Uncovering the Sixties: The Life and Times of the Underground Press" (Pantheon, 1985), it was the epitome of thinking globally and acting locally. "Among the hippie papers it was almost like a coffeetable book," he said, "if people had had coffee tables back then."
Many of its tendrils are now rooted in the culture; others withered ignominiously on the vine. As Mr. Brand notes today, geodesic domes, promoted heavily as living spaces in early catalogues, leaked terribly; people left them behind "like hatchlings leaving their eggs." Communes didn't create an enduring alternative economy or society. Most back-to-the-landers found farming, the focus of many of the catalogues' pages, too much work. Instead, they embraced less-taxing organic gardening.
References to "free love" now seem a melancholy anachronism, and the idea of an organic molasses-blacktop driveway is probably best forgotten. But the catalogue was prescient on many subjects that are now mainstream, including computers, ecological restoration, recycling, medical self-care, alternative childbirth, stress reduction and natural foods.
The obvious question for 1994, of course, is whether the Whole Earthers can do it again, particularly since the cultural landscape is more diffuse now. Anxious to avoid a 60's rehash for aging hippies, Mr. Rheingold is striking out in new territory, "because it's the millennium," he said. The most palpably new thrust is the emphasis on "taming technology."
Mr. Rheingold, who arrived at Whole Earth four years ago and also edits The Whole Earth Review, a quarterly, sees a direct link between the counter and computer cultures. "We need to question what we're being sold," he explains, "and know how we can use these tools for positive ends."
The new catalogue will cost $30, compared with $1 in 1968. It will address young cyberculture types as well as those who abandoned social activism in the 1980's who are anxious, as one editor put it, to "get off their butts again." The catalogue will delve heavily into environmental and health issues, from safe sex to how to restore a stream.
It may lose woolly Whole Earthers like Steve Baer, who still lives in a cluster of domes in New Mexico and professes not to understand the information revolution.
The catalogue's new guise is "way less funky," said Stephanie Mills, a Michigan environmentalist and one of several writers who are now deemed old-timers: "There's much less of the dropout stance that prompted the original catalogue. That was the L. L. Bean for literate back-to-the-landers. Now it's less separate from the global karma, a little more Realpolitik."
If a day in Sausalito is any indication, the contrast between the new guard and the old should make lively reading (although it should be noted that in vintage 60's style, the group is predominantly white male). John Sumser, a recent recruit who is the executive director of the Point Foundation, the nonprofit foundation that runs all Whole Earth activities, is a former Westinghouse executive with a specialty in radar technology. He was spotted running around the parking lot in bare feet and tuxedo.
James Baldwin, a specialist in design and alternative energy who is now considered the tribal elder, worked with Buckminster Fuller for 33 years and joined the catalogue in 1968. Now 60, with wavy gray hair tucked behind his ears in a flip, he spent 13 years living in an Airstream trailer powered by photovoltaic panels and now lives in a converted chicken coop in Petaluma, Calif.
The embodiment of what a long, strange trip it's been is Stewart Brand himself, now editor emeritus. He possesses what may be the country's most eclectic resume: he is a former logger who went to Phillips Exeter Academy, has a biology degree from Stanford University, organized the 1966 Trips Festival in San Francisco (the first multimedia rock-and-roll acid test), was an adviser to Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and wrote a book on the M.I.T. Media Lab. Today, Mr. Brand lives with his wife, Patty Phelan, on the Sausalito waterfront in a renovated 1912 tugboat, the Mirene. He watches his Whole Earth offspring from afar like a lanky chicken, clucking.
The still-bohemian waterfront, he says, is "the juiciest place to have a scene like ours." Mr. Brand, who has the requisite receding hairline, now indulges in what he calls the "post-managerial" phase of his life, as a principal in the Global Business Network, a $3 million company that charts the future for major multinational corporations. He is also completing a book on architecture called "How Buildings Learn." His research library is nestled in an old shipping container near the tugboat. As befits the founder of The Whole Earth Catalog, at age 55 he remains a pithy font of knowledge (did you know that once a month in America, a dead body is found in a container?).
He is noncommittal when asked whether the world really needs another Whole Earth Catalog. "That's a fair question," he said. "I don't really know the answer. But if the Grateful Dead can have an audience, why can't the Whole Earth Catalog?"
In any event, a yearning for optimistic remedies to "the angst at the end of the tunnel," still looms large, in Sausalito anyway.
"The truth is, a lot of stuff that came into flower in the 60's -- the environmental movement, civil rights, feminism, computer-age consciousness and psychedelics -- are issues still to be dealt with," said Mr. Kesey, who still clings to some of the early catalogue's old remedies. "My theory is it won't be over till the fat lady gets high."

The Conscience of the Dismal Science

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
AMARTYA SEN cannot forget. As a boy in India, he handed out a cigarette tin's worth of rice to hollow-eyed, starving refugees during the Bengal famine of 1943.
Perhaps such memories best explain why Professor Sen, the new president of the American Economics Association, is hardly a typical economist, for all his mainstream training. In a discipline devoted mainly to explaining what is, Professor Sen has long chosen to ponder what should be. 
 The 60-year-old Harvard economist and philosopher, who is widely thought to be on the short list of candidates for a Nobel Prize, has long argued that individual rights deserve greater priority than material well-being, even for the poorest people, and that economists and governments should focus on inequality as well as economic growth.
"He is important as a sort of conscience of our profession," said Robert Solow, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who already claims a Nobel laureate in economics. "He taps something many economists feel, namely that you've put your misspent youth into learning all this stuff but you can't say, as an economist, whether something is the right thing to do."
Professor Sen is best known for his work on the causes of famine, on inequality and on the measurement of poverty. His writings have changed the way governments around the world think about these problems, said Nancy Birdsall, executive vice president of the Inter-American Development Bank. And some of his contributions to the basic theory of how societies make choices that are both fair and rational have become part of every graduate student's training in the foundations of economic theory.
The annual meeting of the American Economics Association last week bore Professor Sen's intellectual and moral stamp. His selection as president attested to the extent to which other economists have become sympathetic to discussions about inequality. There were well over a dozen sessions on the gap between rich and poor, educated and uneducated, men and women and so forth, and most of these sessions were jammed.
"Most economists have tended to neglect the importance of inequality," said Kenneth Arrow, another Nobel laureate, at Stanford University, who has known Professor Sen since the latter was a student. "There is a tradition in economics of assuming that a dollar is a dollar and if the G.D.P. goes up, that's all that matters."
"Amartya has always pushed against that," he said.
Professor Sen spent most of World War II living with his beloved grandfather, a professor and author of a best-seller on Hinduism who engaged the boy in hours of serious discussion of values and beliefs. As a teen-ager, Professor Sen considered becoming a Buddhist, but eventually turned to economics, mathematics and philosophy.
"It is impossible to grow up in India without becoming aware of the economic problem," Professor Sen said. "I wanted to do something relevant. Religion seemed remote."
PROFESSOR SEN'S first name, bestowed on him personally by Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel Prize-winning Bengali poet, means "one who deserves immortality."
What has made that name seem so fitting inside economic circles around the world, if not outside them, is primarily his work on famines. In his 1981 book, "Poverty and Famine" (Oxford University Press), Professor Sen influenced the way governments deal with hunger. He showed that famine was not just a consequence of nature but also a man-made disaster, an avoidable economic and political catastrophe. True, drought and flood often precede mass starvation. But declines in food production rarely account for it. Typically, even as thousands die, there is enough food in the country to go around or enough money to import it.
Disaster strikes, his research found, when the poorest people can no longer afford to buy food, because of sudden unemployment or a surge in food prices. In the great Bengal famine of Professor Sen's childhood, in which three million perished, India's food supplies were not unusually low. But a war-related boom in the state of Bengal increased purchases of food in cities. Food prices shot up, fueled by panic and manipulative speculation. And the colonial rulers, immune to democratic pressures, simply stood by.
Partly because of Professor Sen's findings, governments have focused less on direct distribution of food and more on replacing the lost income of the poor, through, for example, public-works projects that create jobs.
Professor Sen's work on inequality, some of it highly theoretical, has influenced many development economists and governments because he demonstrated that measures of average well-being -- gross domestic product per capita, for example -- can easily overstate or understate poverty and mislead policymakers.
One of the most dramatic insights to grow out of his research was the devastating consequence of inequality between men and women.
Demographers had long been aware that there were fewer women than men in some poor countries -- instead of more, as in most of the developed world. And economists, including Professor Sen, had documented that girls and women got less food and less medical care than boys and men. But nobody had calculated how many more women would have been alive if the ratio of men to women more closely resembled that of other continents. Professor Sen came up with the startling figure of 100 million "missing " women -- killed, as it were, by discrimination -- including 44 million in China and 37 million in India.
IN a highly ideological profession, Professor Sen is almost unique in commanding the respect of everyone from Marxists at the University of Massachusetts to Gary Becker, the conservative Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago.
If there is any criticism, it is that Professor Sen has spread himself too thin. "His weakness is that he is trying to write too much and say too many things," Professor Solow said of his friend. "He might make a deeper impression if he focused more."
Professor Sen has always responded to such criticism by decrying the narrowness of modern economics and arguing that juggling lots of balls clumsily is far superior to displaying virtuosity with one ball.
The criticism is not new. Professor Sen's thesis adviser at Trinity College in Cambridge, the formidable British economist Joan Robinson, spent several years trying to persuade her brilliant young student that he ought to give up his pursuit of that "ethics rubbish" and concentrate entirely on economic development.
Then, as now, Professor Sen showed the steelier side of his character by ignoring his mentor's advice. If anything, the work that has brought him the greatest joy is his contribution to "social choice theory" -- how democracies reconcile the choices of individuals with the actions of government.
He strongly disagrees with many economists and others who reflexively believe that individual rights are a luxury that poor countries cannot afford, that economic needs deserve precedence over such rights and that democracy is inimical to rapid growth. He argues that, in many cases, individual rights can increase economic security. He thinks, for example, that giving girls access to basic education and widening women's legal rights have helped bring down birth rates as much in one poor Indian state as in China, where violations of individual rights -- forced birth control -- are widespread.
For all his high-minded convictions, Professor Sen is remarkably down to earth. He is known, in theoretical articles, for using racy but apt jokes. Friends say he likes good food and wine and driving fast.
A Renaissance man in an age of intellectual specialization, he is frequently described as the ideal dinner guest -- widely read, witty, intensely curious about other people.
HE has been married to or had long-term relationships with four accomplished women, including a Bengali poet, an American philosopher and an Italian economist. His current wife, Emma Rothschild, 45, is an economic historian and essayist who looks like a softer, gentler Susan Sontag and is a member of the British branch of the Rothschild family. She talks about her husband's "great big laugh," his love of words and "talk" and his devotion to his many friends and his extended Indian family. The couple's houses -- they shuttle between Cambridge, England, where she teaches, and Cambridge, Mass., his base -- are usually crowded with Professor Sen's two teen-age children and their friends.
His close friend of 30 years, Meghnad Desai, an economist who is a member of the British House of Lords, mildly chides Professor Sen for excessive kindness.
A popular teacher, he has a reputation for handling even the most callow students with courtesy. "The first time I met Amartya, I was very nervous -- he was a huge deal in England -- and I was an hour early," said Ben Pollack, a Harvard fellow who was an undergraduate at the time. "It was pouring; he invited me in and he immediately, personally made me a cup of hot tea."
"I asked him the most incredibly stupid questions," added Mr. Pollack, an economic historian and mathematician, "but he never, for a moment, made me feel stupid."

THE ECONOMY
 
It's the Best of Times (Unless You're Still Out of Work)
The numbers keep showing a recovery with staying power. Last week brought strong data on construction and manufacturing, and a report that consumers did what they can't help doing in December: buy lots of stuff. To top it off, the unemployment rate for the month clicked downward again, to 6.4 percent, a three-year low. The rise in payrolls was a modest 183,000, serving to dampen fear of revived inflation. All this helped the insatiable stock market keep nudging to new records, as the Dow industrials passed 3,800 and kept on going. With a strong 1993 wrapped up, though, some people may stop looking at an economic glass that's half full, and rising, and focus instead on how empty it still is. More than half the new jobs were temporary, and 8.23 million Americans still want any job but don't have one. That's a lot of Fridays without paychecks, a lot of children without new shoes. 

Cars, and Trucks, Are Rolling
The heartening news on auto sales has been dribbling out every 10 days for some time now, but annual figures out last week made it official: people are buying cars again. More than 14 million vehicles were sold last year, an 8 percent rise from 1992 and the best year since 1989. A lot of those were trucks: America's best-selling vehicle was a Ford pickup, far ahead of the Taurus, the No. 1 car. And for all the bad news about General Motors, remember that it still sells more cars than all the Japanese put together, and it's holding its own at the top despite its long slide.
 
Gadgets Crowd Out the Ashtray
A car's dashboard is coming to resemble a well-stocked den, complete with CD player, phone, cup holder, you name it. It's a small den, though, so space is precious, and Chrysler -- in new models introduced last week -- decided that one thing was expendable: the "ash receiver" (Detroitspeak for ashtray). The sedans will be the first mass-market cars since the Model T not to have ashtrays. "It's our step to help the health of Americans," a Chrysler executive said. But Walker Merryman of the Tobacco Institute asked, "What's the name of this model, just so I don't accidentally buy one?"
 
Condoms Make It to Prime Time
If the advertising's good enough, it can sell anything. So it's a hopeful sign that Madison Avenue, with Government backing, has put its mind on promoting condom use. Ads that began last week add flair to public service, with condoms dancing across a room and hopping between passionate sheets, or with this dialogue for a panting, clothes-shedding scene: "Did you bring it?" "I forgot it." "Then forget it." The reaction? "Morally offensive," said a Texas Republican. And Act Up, the AIDS advocacy group, said, "Clinton's dancing condoms won't save lives." But it's a long way from the Reagan era, when sex lessons on the air starred a man pulling on a sock.
 
Amtrak in the Control Tower
It's an odd idea coming from Democrats, supposedly believers in the healing powers of government. But last week the Administration essentially admitted that its bureaucracy was not up to running the air traffic control system, proposing to turn it over to a Government-owned corporation modeled on Amtrak. The Transportation Department foresees a system "more responsive to technological change," with "more efficient management." It was hailed by the airlines, in dire need of efficiency as losses mount. But the applause was not universal. One House critic saw "too many opportunities for safety to be compromised." And who will help pay for it? You guessed it. There'll be a tax on plane tickets.
 
COMPANIES
 
Viacom, Paramount, QVC (Cont.)
It's looking more and more like an auction at which frenzied bidders have lost sight of their Grail. Last week, hours before a crucial deadline, Viacom even made an $8.4 billion merger deal with Blockbuster Entertainment on its way to raising its bid for Paramount. The cash portion of its bid jumped to $105 a share, far above the $92 offer from its rival, QVC. Now the clock's ticking again, as each side was given 10 more days to raise its offer.
 
34th Street Needs a Miracle
For Macy, bankruptcy is proving a lot more than a detour on the road to a new life. It owes $832 million to Prudential Insurance, and Federated Department Stores just paid $449 million for half that claim (with an option on the rest) with an eye to creating the nation's largest department store company. It was a risky, surprising move -- made on New Year's weekend, of all times -- by Allen Questrom, who led Federated itself out of bankruptcy. In the future, a handful of giants may run the department store show, and this deal could be a step toward that because Federated owns Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus. Of course, if Macy can pay off the debt, it may wriggle away. But then again, Macy is now "in play," as they say, and Dillard Department Stores may be after it too. Clearly, another capitalist mini-series is shaping up.
 
At Merck, It's All Medco
The message was clear. As one analyst put it, "The Medco people are running the show" at Merck. Sensing where things are heading, Merck recently paid $6 billion for Medco, which sells drugs to patients in managed-care plans. And last week Martin J. Wygod, head of Medco, was made No. 2 at Merck, putting him in line to succeed Dr. P. Roy Vagelos.
 
The Mythic and the Mundane
The name evokes almost mythic images: Red Adair, the legendary firefighter who put out oil-well blazes in Kuwait and everywhere else. After his outsize feats, it would probably surprise some people to learn that he's even mortal, not some comic book hero. But last week he descended from Mt. Olympus and became just another prosaic statistic. He sold the Red Adair Company, founded in 1959, and retired from daily operations. As far as we know, there wasn't even an Iraqi Lex Luthor who sent him packing.
 
MCI Wants Its Private Highway
The way things are going, some upstart will come along a decade from now and demand that MCI be broken up, as A.T.& T. was a decade ago. The whole phone-cable-video-data-you-name-it business has gotten so convoluted that anything could happen. For now, though, MCI is spreading its wings. Last week, seeking to trim the $5 billion in access fees it pays annually to local Bells, it said it would spend $2 billion to invade local markets by laying fiber-optic cable in 20 cities. Its vision: to build "driveways" onto the data highway (this imagery has clearly gotten out of hand). But something new, something old: some of its snazzy cables will pass through 19th-century underground wooden conduits, bought four years ago from Western Union.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Made in China? U.S. Says No
So, now that the world trade talks have concluded, harmony will reign, right? Hardly. Washington says China avoids existing quotas by sending clothing to, say, Honduras, where -- fresh with "Made in Honduras" labels -- it is sent on to the United States. Last week the Administration, weary of efforts to end this practice, lashed out by cutting China's export quotas by more than $1 billion. What this means, of course, is that China is now in the big leagues -- it's right up there with Japan in being a trade dartboard for the United States. Not that it savors that distinction, though. China quickly denounced the cuts as "irresponsible" and vowed retaliation. And what this means back in the United States is, perhaps, some jobs saved -- but higher prices. The same old trade-off.
 
Job-Training Advice for Russia
On the eve of his visit to Moscow this week, President Clinton said he would come down strongly on the side of continued economic reform -- and would suggest that Western aid be used to retrain workers dislodged by a shifting economy. If the Russians can learn to do that, though, maybe they'll have something to teach us. We could use it.
 
A Brief Jolt for a Bull Market
There may be debate about the eventual impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the United States, but in Mexico there's little ambiguity: The economy will be far better for it. Mexico's stock market rose steadily as the clock ticked toward Jan. 1, when the pact took effect. But a peasant uprising brought a jolt of reality to Mexico, sending the market down nearly 4 percent on Jan. 3, the year's first trading day. Some saw the drop as overdue, though, and sure enough, the market quickly resumed its climb.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Foreigners Flock Back to Johannesburg

BYLINE: By Bill Keller 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
LIKE a giant applause-o-meter of South Africa's transition, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange has been roaring the world's approval as the country approaches the end of white dominion.
Buoyed by foreign investors, the exchange's index soared 50 percent last year. In the first trading days of the new year, it leapt to a record, receded a bit and then rebounded to close Friday at 5,749.8, a new high. The foreign interest has reinforced the determined optimism of South Africa's own business elite, which has gradually subdued its fears of a Government under Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress. 
 But while the exchange and the business class are basking in the world's confidence, this is not -- not yet, at least -- the kind of investment that South Africa needs if a new Government is to deliver widespread prosperity. And the brokers on Diagonal Street, home of the exchange, warn that the market is pricey compared with its intrinsic values, and riskier than investors seem to understand.
"We're certainly the plum emerging market," said Malcolm Stewart of Kaplan & Stewart, a Johannesburg brokerage. "The politics look like they're coming right. We're coming out of a terrible depression, and out of a severe drought. We're emerging from years of sanctions. And at the same time, we've got a gold boom on our hands." However, he added, "When you play in emerging markets, you play in emerging countries, and those rides are never smooth rides."
A trickle of capital from abroad began in late 1992, turning net disinvestment in the Johannesburg exchange into net investment. It became a stream in the closing months of 1993, after Mr. Mandela formally advocated an end to all economic sanctions.
Western investors were charmed by Mr. Mandela when he visited the United States and Europe to promote investment late last year, and reassured by his promises that the Government he is expected to head would create a hospitable climate for capitalists.
Most major investors in the United States had dropped their South African holdings faster than a molten Krugerrand in the 1980's when cities and states began withholding business from companies that traded with the apartheid state. No trading firm was likely to give up the steady business of selling municipal bonds in America for the right to continue selling South African securities.
As a result, the Johannesburg exchange, which accounts for almost 1 percent of the capital invested in the world's stock markets, is virtually unrepresented in the portfolios of American investors. But investment managers have rushed to catch up, and brokers are anxious to assist.
Now brokers are studying and touting the stocks, and market funds are forming specifically to invest in South African shares.
Last month, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers became the first New York firms to begin selling South African stocks and bonds. One South African firm, Frankel Pollak Vinderine Inc., said it was opening an investment banking operation in New York to raise capital for South African corporations.
"There's been a whole re-rating of our market," added C. J. Buys, economist for the Anglo-American Corporation, the mining conglomerate whose shares have led the market rally. "For example, gold shares in Australia and the States were priced higher and paid lower dividend yields than in South Africa. South Africa had a risk rating applied to it. That has now disappeared. The rating on the gold board is now in line with other countries."
What's more, decent rains last year, after one of the most devastating droughts in the country's history, have put farms back on their feet and allowed the national bank to declare that the economy has begun slowly to grow again.
American and European investors have been concentrating on blue-chip commodities companies like Anglo-American and the steel producer Iskor, but have also been buying Government shares. Eskom, the electrical utility, which has ample power supplies and an aggressive program for electrifying black townships, has been a popular investment.
Stock analysts here are openly amazed at what foreigners are willing to pay for shares many of them consider overvalued.
Mark Wilkes, an analyst and broker at the Johannesburg firm of Hayes Cullen, said the high prices, rather than reflecting underlying worth, simply reflected the fact that demand by domestic institutions creates a chronic shortage of blue-chip scrip.
Analysts point out that foreign investors have to buy in through the financial rand, a volatile currency invented as a means of controlling the country's foreign exchange. And the political stability that underlies a secure market is by no means guaranteed.
Moreover, the Johannesburg exchange is famous for being dependent on the giant markets. If there is a crash on Wall Street, they say, the rubble will be knee-deep on Diagonal Street.
As a tonic to South Africa's economy, the market's boom is largely psychological.
"We need to distinguish between portfolio investment, which is what we are seeing now, and real fixed investment, which is what we need to sustain us," said Mr. Buys of Anglo-American. "What's happening now is not fundamental to the economy."
Maybe not, said Mr. Stewart, "but who's selling? A lot of big institutions are selling, and generating real cash to invest in new ventures. And in terms of morale, it's a huge show of confidence."

HEADLINE: McDonald's Finds There's Still Plenty of Room to Grow

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: MARENGO, Ill.

 BODY:
THERE was the kind of buzz that retailers can strive for but never guarantee when McDonald's opened for business in this small town some 60 miles west of Chicago at 6 A.M. on Dec. 20.
Customers began pulling into the new restaurant's drive-through service lane by 3 A.M. and were backed up out the driveway and around the block long before the first order was taken. Out front, packs of teen-agers chatted animatedly in the frosty pre-dawn darkness while the handful of parents among them observed that the same kids seemed to find it impossible to get out of bed on school days. By lunchtime, one customer had made three visits, and many others had come by twice. 
 "I knew people here were excited, but I didn't expect this," said Sue Singleton, the franchisee who owns and operates the new Marengo store with her husband, Chris.
Marengo's debut was modest compared with the scenes McDonald's and Wall Street are used to seeing when the company opens a giant new operation in Moscow, Beijing or some other wide-open foreign market. McDonald's now has more than 4,700 overseas stores, double its total of six years ago, and it continues to open two stores abroad for every new one it opens at home.
The scene in Marengo, however, highlights why even giants of the fast-food industry, like McDonald's, foresee plenty of domestic growth. Indeed, two decades after social commentators began predicting that the fast-food industry would soon saturate the American landscape, there is no end in sight. Time pressures, the growing number of travelers and the decreasing number of traditional families with a stay-at-home mom devoted to cooking keep bringing new customers to the chains, and increase the frequency with which regulars return.
"Off-premise consumption -- like drive-through, takeout and home delivery -- has fueled the growth since 1984," said George Rice, whose company, GDR Enterprises Inc., tracks the fast-food business from Tampa, Fla. "There's no shortage of opportunity."
McDonald's, which is thicker on the ground in this country than anyone, with about 9,300 stores, has junked its once relatively rigid views on where it can mine that opportunity. It is aggressively adding outlets and different types of stores to try to recapture the market share it lost in the late 80's. It is even experimenting with such services as home delivery.
"It's an exciting time," said Edward H. Rensi, president and chief executive of domestic operations for McDonald's, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill.
Marengo is one of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of small towns that have become candidates for their first McDonald's, thanks largely to a downsizing and redesign of the company's basic store. This has cut the average development cost to $1.2 million, from $1.6 million, and has increased the focus on drive-through customers. Other towns that got new stores in recent weeks include Corcoran, Calif., and Navasota, Tex.
THE new stores are just over half as big as the typical 1980's design of roughly 4,000 to 4,500 square feet. They have as few as 55 seats, compared with the previous minimum of 80, and they have more efficient equipment and extra windows for drive-through traffic. Skilled franchisees, who earn six-figure incomes from a single store, can make such profits from annual revenues of $1.2 million in the new stores, compared with $1.5 million in the older design.
The lower breakeven point has also opened new suburban niches in areas where other McDonald's and plenty of competitors are just a short drive away. The Singletons, who sold three Chicago McDonald's restaurants to move to Marengo with their two children, recently completed their redeployment by opening a new McDonald's almost identical to Marengo's in Algonquin, Ill., a rapidly growing suburb about 20 miles east of here that already has a McDonald's. A new Burger King is under construction across the street from their store.
Downsizing, new cost controls and better systems for putting market research at the fingertips of district managers have given McDonald's and its rivals new tools to subdivide urban markets further. For example, McDonald's opened an urban equivalent to the Marengo store on New Year's Eve in Chicago's Union Station, within three blocks of four other McDonald's restaurants.
A store opening is not always a community event as in Marengo, but the results elsewhere have been good enough to persuade McDonald's to step up its domestic expansion plans. After two years of adding fewer than 200 stores annually, McDonald's entered 1993 planning to add up to 300 restaurants to its domestic total of 8,959, but actually ended up adding about 330. Last fall, the company told pleasantly surprised analysts that it expected to add as many as 400 annually for the next couple of years at least.
"They are talking about opening new restaurants at a staggering rate," said Michael Meuller, who follows the company from San Francisco for Montgomery Securities.
Last year, McDonald's also opened about 130 satellite sites that are run by existing restaurants, including a seasonal outlet on New York's Coney Island and more than 80 outlets inside Wal-Mart discount stores. The satellites are part of a drive to develop "non-traditional" sites, a trend led by Pepsico's Taco Bell unit and which is now being widely followed by major fast-food chains. Other non-traditional sites where McDonald's recently opened include the new MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, a Mobil gasoline station in Bricktown, N.J., and the airport outside Manchester, N.H.
McDONALD's closest rivals are growing too. Burger King, the Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. subsidiary that is second among burger chains, added 346 stores in the United States in its fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30. Wendy's, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, added more than 280 domestic outlets last year to its base of 3,607, for a growth rate of almost 8 percent, more than double McDonald's. But analysts say that only the Subway sandwich chain and the Little Caesar's pizza chain are opening stores far more frequently than McDonald's pace of about one a day.
"If McDonald's continues at this rate, it will gain market share," said Ronald N. Paul, president of Technomics Inc., a Chicago-based consulting firm that tracks the fast-food industry, which had domestic sales of about $87 billion last year.
GAINING share will be no small feat. McDonald's already controls 40.4 percent of the burger business, which generally has grown more slowly than such newer segments as pizza and ethnic foods. McDonald's also must overcome the perception that its food is not as good or as varied as that of some of its direct rivals, even if it wins top marks for convenience and reliability.
McDonald's share of the overall fast-food market dropped from a peak of 18.8 percent in 1986 to 16.2 percent in 1990, even though quarterly sales continued to set new records. It edged up to 16.3 percent in 1991 as the company waded into the value-pricing wars of the 90's. Although 1993 figures are not available yet, analysts say the greater number of new stores is laying the groundwork for a further rebound, despite the fact the newer restaurants have smaller sales than the larger units the company used to build.
"It helps that the economy is turning up," Mr. Rice of GDR Enterprises said. "When everyone else cuts back their real estate department, McDonald's keeps going, and the moment things turn up, they blow out the doors."
McDonald's executives say the process stays methodical even when it speeds up. Acting as brakes are the company's lengthy training programs for franchisees, its carefully cultivated relationships with suppliers, its quality controls and its determination to hang on to the cost savings achievable from a high level of standardization in store and equipment design.
Even at the current pace, there are glitches, of course. Here, for instance, development and construction went unusually smoothly, but the Singletons and their 40 Marengo employees, from high-schoolers to 70-year-old Rose Doane, faced extra pressure on opening day because McDonald's architectural specifications had not been updated to accommodate the newest coffee machines the company recommends. The Singletons ordered two machines but discovered, too late to correct the problem before opening, that they had just one of the four-pronged electrical outlets they needed.
"The owners had the same coffee problem at the one we just finished in Demotte, Ind.," said Dave Grdinich, who supervised construction here for the Peter Schwabe Corporation, a Merrillville, Ind., contractor that specializes in building McDonald's restaurants.
Such construction and development problems can give franchisees short-term nightmares, but they are the least of McDonald's concerns as it plans its expansion.
"We could open 1,000 stores a year if that's all we wanted to concentrate on," said Mr. Rensi, the head of domestic operations.
 
 
 
EATING EACH OTHER'S LUNCH?
 UNLIKE most chains, the McDonald's Corporation grants its franchises for a specific address rather than for a territory. There is nothing in the agreements to stop the company from selling a franchise for a new store so close to an existing one that its business would be hurt.
But franchisees have the comfort of knowing that McDonald's has a greater stake than most other chains in not undercutting them. Founder Ray Kroc championed the view that franchisees should be partners. He established the requirement that franchisees work full-time on running their restaurants, he charged lower upfront franchise fees than other chains and he relied on higher royalties to generate revenue for the company.
These days, there are so many McDonald's outlets it is almost impossible to open one that does not steal some sales from others in the chain.
A new downtown store, like the one in Chicago's Union Station, is more likely to hurt nearby franchisees than is Marengo's, which is a 15-to-20-minute drive from other McDonald's outlets in the region. Union Station will draw its customers from the 35-story office tower over the station and from the 160,000 commuters who pass through daily, none of whom were more than a few minutes' walk from a McDonald's before it opened.
Still, the vast majority of Union Station's customers are likely to be people who would otherwise go to the adjacent food court or not snack downtown at all --and Faye Jasch, the franchisee, is going after them with a vengeance.
Even before officially opening, she and her husband, Frank, a Chicago policeman, negotiated for permission to set up a variety of satellite operations in the station's waiting room and at entrances to the tracks.
McDonald's negotiates compensation agreements for some owners faced with encroachment from a new store or minimizes the potential for conflict by offering them the new franchise. In general, though, it argues that extending the chain also stimulates people to eat more often at existing restaurants, offsetting encroachment concerns.

In a State of Digital Desire

BYLINE: By John Markoff

 BODY:
IF there is such a thing as being a citizen of cyberspace, the global computer network, Joichi Ito is an excellent candidate. The son of Japanese parents who worked in the United States as research scientists, he is one of the few people who can be completely at home in both cultures.
Now the president of Mac Zone Japan, a mail-order software distributor in Tokyo, Mr. Ito crosses the Pacific monthly. He is also working with Magic Box Productions in Beverly Hills, Calif., on multimedia production, and with Energy Conversion Devices Inc. in Troy, Mich., a development company working on memory storage technology. 
 Mr. Ito discovered computer networks as a teen-ager living in Detroit. Currently his Internet connection is a Sun Sparcstation I that sits in the bathroom of his Tokyo home -- the only room with sufficient spare space. He's scheming for even more bandwidth, considering leasing a 1.5-megabit-per-second satellite connection between the United States and Japan -- making for a genuinely international data highway.
Question: What was it like to grow up both in Japan and America?
Answer: I was lucky. I was born in Japan and then lived in the United States through junior high school. I went back to Japan for high school and came to the U.S. to go to college. By being forced to adjust back and forth I was forced to adapt to two cultural paradigms.
For me, the issue is to be bicultural rather than bilingual -- to understand the culture and the mindset of both countries. I feel like I'm getting better and better at it. Eventually, being able to melt into Japan when I wanted to and being able to hang out with Americans, it was ideal.
Q: Do you ever get confused?
A: I do. But when you drive on the left and then the right, if you go back and forth enough times, then when you get between two countries it becomes seamless. It's like beating jet lag. I've gotten to the point where there is no pain.
Q: What's the difference between Japanese and American computer cultures?
A: If you look at Japan, their model is master-student. Local area networks are still black boxes. Everything is still proprietary and as a result they have five different companies with five times the staff working on the same problem.
That sort of redundancy and vertical integration is what the Japanese software industry is about. In Japan you have one of the lowest rates of productivity per capita in the world. Programming power is still calculated in boring "man months." They don't have the idea of high-quality software wizards like in the U.S.
From the point of view of a global citizen, though, American insularism is very annoying. It's changing, but it's bad.
Q: What captivates you about the Internet?
A: In Japan people have an image of anyone who sits in front of a work station for long periods as a hacker, but they never criticize a Buddhist monk in prayer. It's essentially the same: a bad hacker is to a good hacker as a drunk is to a monk.
Cyberspace is my spiritual environment. That's my inner space. By the time I'm old, a majority of my inspiration will come from the Net. There is physical desire and digital desire. Physical desire is considered bad, but I think digital desire is good.
The Japanese have become obsessed with things, but the cash-based economy is not right for dealing with information. If you're dealing with entertainment, it shouldn't be cash-based. I shouldn't be paid in cash but in something else instead. I should be paid in inspiration.
Q: What do you think of computer network hooligans or cyberpunks?
A: I think that cyberpunk is a bad word, because punk is a destructive image. I think net surfing is a better image. Actually the word gets overused. I drew a lot on cyberpunk, but I realized it was more useful to do constructive things. That's the different between the 60's and the 90's. Now we can take over.

HEADLINE: Russian Entrepreneurs Aren't All Gangsters

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "What's Good for the Mafia Is Good for Russia" (Op-Ed, Dec. 26) Michael Scammell argues that the appearance of "slick wheeler-dealers" in St. Petersburg and Moscow is a harbinger of economic freedom. Perhaps, but his comparison to American robber barons of the last century is not constructive. 
 There is a rapidly growing group of honest entrepreneurs in Russia struggling to publish books, manufacture doors, sew winter clothes, make chocolates and create software. Russian bureaucracy, heavy taxation and the "mafia" present immense problems for these business people. As Professor Scammell points out, Russian intellectuals compound the problems by considering all profitmaking activities immoral.
Ironically, some stereotypes of American history are in the same (Marxist) tradition, referring to all 19th-century American capitalists as robber barons.
In Russia (and in the United States) there is a need for teachers and journalists who are able to distinguish between gangsters and honest, responsible entrepreneurs, who are, perhaps, the most optimistic Russians. Our support should include capital for these business people. Confusing them with "slick wheeler-dealers" does them a real disservice, as I am sure Professor Scammell agrees.

HEADLINE: The World;
Clinton's Attention Heartens Europe (Even the French)

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
WESTERN Europeans, at first, said of course they understood President Clinton's need to tackle domestic problems before worrying too much about foreign policy. They even thought this would bolster the 12-nation European Union's influence and independence in world affairs. They certainly never imagined that life would be quite so lonely without strong American leadership.
It is a measure of Europe's current mood of insecurity, then, that Mr. Clinton's arrival in Brussels for the NATO summit meeting tomorrow has brought a sigh of relief. Not that he has instant fixes for such intractables as the Bosnian war and instability in the former Soviet bloc. But he will be returning here three more times this year, and that alone should keep his focus on Europe. 
 His immediate job is to reassure. Western Europe needs to know that it is still Washington's main ally; Eastern Europe that its welfare and security are important to the United States; Russia that he supports its economic reform program despite the recent nationalist backlash. The question, of course, is: How much can he deliver?
The confusion of American foreign policy all through last year has tempered expectations. But in recent weeks Washington has helped NATO begin to shake off its post-cold war identity crisis. Tomorrow, the alliance will for the first time recognize that Western Europe has security interests of its own to defend. It will also offer a so-called Partnership for Peace to former Warsaw Pact countries as a step toward possible membership. And on these points, all 16 NATO members -- including ever-maverick France -- are agreed.
Eastern Europe's emerging democracies are less happy. Three years ago, all the talk was about their place in the "new architecture" of a united Europe. But they waited in vain for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to become an effective pan-European organization. The European Union, as the European Community is now known, said the likes of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were not yet ready to join. And now, while offered a partnership with NATO, they have no guarantee of eventual membership.
Unsurprisingly, they feel they are once again hostages to Moscow -- in this case, to Russia's warnings that expansion of the alliance could feed nationalistic resentment and undermine its wobbly democracy. "It seems that we should talk to President Yeltsin about our joining NATO, not to the West," Poland's President, Lech Walesa, noted acidly last week.
And, in a sense, he has a point. The West is clearly unwilling to offer the ultimate security guarantee of full membership -- an attack against one NATO member is an attack against all. No less than Washington, London, Paris and Bonn believe stability in Russia is the key to stability in Europe. This was most clear last week in the sharp -- but predictable -- scolding that Russia gave Lithuania (and the inaudible response from the West) when the Baltic republic voiced its wish to join NATO.
"We are looking for a new balance of security which cannot exist against Russia," a close aide to France's President, Francois Mitterrand, explained. "We cannot rebuild the division of Europe. If we act too quickly, it could be entirely counterproductive. So we have both to give security to Eastern Europe and not stimulate nationalistic and destabilizing groups in Russia."
And, in this, even France wants the United States to play a central role. Only two years ago, France, which in 1966 left NATO's integrated military command, was leading the drive to give Europe an independent defense capability. Today, it has moved closer to NATO and is eager for the American military presence in Europe (already down from 314,000 in 1990 to 150,000 today) to be maintained.
Like other European allies, France hopes that President Clinton's visit (which includes a summit meeting in Moscow as well as stopovers in Prague, Minsk and Geneva) will mark Washington's re-engagement in Europe.
This nostalgia for American leadership is of course a function of Western Europe's own crisis of confidence, brought on mainly by an economic recession and its failure to settle the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. "I'd say we're looking for impetus and reassurance from the United States," said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations. "Impetus because we've realized sadly that, without the United States to kick us, we don't move. Reassurance because Europe is again becoming a dangerous place. And we don't feel at ease alone with ourselves."
But how far is Washington willing to go? For many Europeans, the immediate test is Bosnia. Last spring, the Clinton Administration was rebuffed by Europe when it proposed lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia's besieged Muslim-led government and launching air strikes against Bosnian Serb artillery positions near Sarajevo. In response, it stepped back and left the problem for Europe to resolve. Having decided to pull out of Somalia in March, Washington has made it clear it has no appetite for direct military involvement in Bosnia.
On the eve of tomorrow's summit, however, France, which has 6,000 peace-keeping troops in the former Yugoslavia, called on the United States to play a bigger role in Bosnia. It asked for American air support to relieve the Muslim enclaves of Tuzla and Srebrenica and, without any real hope, suggested that American ground troops participate. And -- along with Britain, Spain and Canada, which also have peacekeepers in Bosnia -- it also raised the stakes by suggesting that it may soon have to withdraw its forces.
By implication, then, Washington is being posed a test question: Can it be truly present in the new Europe without sharing responsibilities in Bosnia? It would certainly like to try. And, as a first step, it is struggling to prevent the NATO summit from being dominated by the Balkan conflict. But will the alliance not lose credibility if it is seen busily preparing for the future while pointedly ignoring the present?
The proposed changes in NATO's military structure give the United States an out. Until now, while the Clinton Administration was arguing that Bosnia is a European problem, Western Europe could respond that, despite moves by France, Germany, Belgium and Spain to create a 50,000-strong "Eurocorps" by 1995, there was as yet no purely European military structure capable of acting on its own. Under the plan to be approved tomorrow, however, NATO could lend its resources to enable European countries to operate in crises of no immediate concern to, say, the United States or Canada. Crises such as Bosnia.
For many experts, though, the issue is less one of military strength than of political will. And that is where the vacuum of American leadership has been most felt since President Bush turned his attention to his re-election campaign in mid-1992. When the cold war ended, the initial presumption was that the trans-Atlantic relationship would be principally economic. But, as old problems have resurfaced and new problems have appeared, security against the fury of national and ethnic passions has returned as a central issue. For 45 years, Europeans were happy the Americans were protecting them. With a dose of humility, they are now admitting they're not ready to stand on their own.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Redressing the Harms Of the Nuclear Age May Not Be Cheap

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
KEITH L. PRESCOTT worked as a miner in the 1960's, digging radioactive debris out of the deep tunnels beneath the Nevada desert where the Government tested atomic bombs. Mr. Prescott has told interviewers that he was ordered to work in underground chambers so contaminated by radiation that he became nauseated and dizzy. In 1969, Mr. Prescott developed multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer known to be caused by radiation, and in 1980 he sued the Government.
For 14 years, the Government denied that it had anything to do with Mr. Prescott's illness and fiercely battled to keep him out of court. But last week, the 67-year-old Mr. Prescott took the stand in a Federal trial in Las Vegas and accused the United States of negligence. And his testimony found a sympathetic audience at the top levels of the Clinton Administration. 
 Several Administration lawyers said privately that they were appalled at the Government's behavior. "Every time we look at the Government's position, this tough approach becomes increasingly unfathomable," said one official close to the case.
There are few industries that the Government has more aggressively defended than its own cold war complex for the design, manufacture and testing of atomic weapons. Since 1956, when ranchers in Utah asserted in a lawsuit that radioactive fallout killed 4,500 sheep, the Government has steadfastly resisted assertions that the industry could have caused harm. Justice Department lawyers have accused citizens of making up complaints, lying about their injuries and attempting to enrich themselves.
But now, the words heard in the Department of Energy, the Department of Justice and the White House about radiation-related cases are "compassion," "moral behavior" and "doing what is right."
 
Growing Liability
 The implications of the Government's change of heart, both legally and economically, are far from clear. Last week, President Clinton directed aides to assemble a task force to coordinate an investigation of cold war records that could lead to proposals for compensation. The issue that attracted the President's attention was an extensive Government program during and after World War II in which Americans were exposed to radiation in human medical research. But the lawyers involved said it is likely that other cold war era claims will be considered.
What Government lawyers want to know is is how to develop compensation programs for the research subjects, which they hope will be a limited, well defined group, while keeping costs fairly predictable and contained. But they acknowledge that the cost could climb into the billions if a compensation program is expanded to others who say they suffered injuries caused by the nuclear weapons industry.
The central issue the Administration faces is how to weigh the cost of doing good against the cost, in cynicism and distrust, of doing nothing.
By Washington standards, the Administration is moving at breakneck speed. Once before, in 1979, the Carter Administration formed a task force to consider whether to compensate military veterans and residents of the desert Southwest who were exposed to radiation from atomic blasts at the Nevada Test Site. The White House group recommended compensation for both groups.
But it wasn't until 1988 that military veterans became eligible for disability benefits as a result of radiation exposure. And it was not until 1990 that President Bush signed a bill to compensate "downwinders" -- residents of certain areas of three Southwestern states -- and some workers who participated in above-ground atomic tests.
Just as they did 15 years ago, budget officials in the White House want to know how much an additional compensation program would cost. They have few available measures.
In 1988, for instance, Congress approved legislation to compensate Japanese-Americans interned during World War II. That program has cost $1.58 billion and paid benefits to 79,136 people, according to the Justice Department.
Other compensation programs, though, are less expensive. The 1990 legislation has cost $111 million and paid benefits to just over 1,500 people, so far. It is likely that all those eligible could be compensated by the program's trust fund of $200 million, or about what it costs for a mile or two of new urban highway.
The Energy Department has given additional funds to plaintiffs, including a $78 million settlement in 1989 of a suit involving uranium contamination from a plant in Fernald, Ohio.
Since 1990, thousands of workers and residents have filed eight class action lawsuits over radiation from nuclear weapons plants in Colorado, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee and Washington State. The suits are aimed at corporations that managed the plants for the Government, and because of its contractual obligations, the Energy Department has spent $47.1 million since 1991 to reimburse the companies for legal fees connected with the cases.
To be sure, said lawyers at the Energy and Justice departments, the Government has ample legal authority to hold off lawsuits and, if they go to court, the chance of winning them.
But Stewart Udall, a former Secretary of the Interior, who as a private lawyer has battled the Government on radiation-related cases since 1979, noted that the courts may be changing their attitudes about such litigation.
"One of the options the White House has is to say, 'We can win, we'll fight them on every issue,' " said Mr. Udall, who helped Mr. Prescott. "But God help us if the Clinton Administration uses that old line. The Government's paid a huge price for that approach. It's caused public distrust that runs so deep now."
The woman behind the Government's about-face is Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary. Last May, after studying her department's relations with the people who live around its weapons plants, she began a project to make amends. One element of this involved declassifying millions of records in Energy Department archives. After learning of the human radiation experiments, Mrs. O'Leary announced last month that she would investigate and make public records dealing with this problem as well.
In an interview, Mrs. O'Leary said the Government could begin to draw down the enormous reservoir of cynicism and fear left by the nuclear weapons industry.
"I know this is courting some risk, lawsuits and the like," she said. "But there is a great need to assess what happened and to own up to what happened."

Left Behind, Mexico's Indians Fight the Future

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico

 BODY:
PHILLIP McDONALD, a young Canadian tourist who had been making his way around Mexico for some weeks, was sitting in the tree-shaded square at the center of this colonial city, drinking tequila and watching the last of the New Year's fireworks with friends when he noticed a column of uniformed young men and women with rifles marching into the plaza.
"We had no idea what was going on," he recalled. "It was New Year's Eve; it didn't make sense. But they definitely had a plan." 
 If Mr. McDonald could not imagine a new army of peasant guerrillas in the country with which Canada and the United States had just initiated free trade at midnight, neither could most Mexicans. Although there had been rumors of subversive activity in the area, the Government had denied them, apparently out of concern that such revelations might hurt the chances for approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the United States. With its passage won, however, the implementation of the accord was immediately overshadowed by the first Latin American revolutionary movement of the post-cold-war age.
 
Zapata's Heirs>
 The rebels announced themselves as the Zapatista National Liberation Army, a force of mysterious antecedents and surprising proportions. Seizing this city three sizable towns and several villages in the forested hills along the Guatemalan border, the insurgents broke open a prison, kidnapped dozens of people and took over a state radio station. They then declared war on the Government and perhaps changed Mexico's future.
Before the week was out and the Mexican Army had chased the retreating rebels from all the towns they had seized, more than 100 people lay dead. As fighting continued in the hills, it was impossible to forecast how long the outnumbered guerrillas might hold out. But it was apparent that the army of mostly uneducated Tzotzil and Tzeltal Indian peasants had already dealt a sobering blow to the central, shining promise of Mexico's Harvard-trained President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
In timing their strike to Nafta's implementation, the rebels took aim at the official faith that by fixing their economic destiny to that of wealthier neighbors, all Mexicans would be raised into a modernity of more jobs, cheaper imports and a fuller democracy. "The free trade agreement is a death certificate for the Indian peoples of Mexico, which are expendable for the Government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari," said a rebel leader calling himself Commandante Marcos.
 
Caught Off-Guard>
 Who the insurgent leaders are, how they had organized a force that officials estimated at as many as 2,000 combatants, and how they caught the Government so obviously off-guard were questions that Mr. Salinas and his aides were just starting to answer days later. What Mr. Salinas knew implicitly was that Indians in the southern state of Chiapas were unlikely to see through nearly five centuries of poverty and political control to his vision of a new Mexico.
The rebels seemed to embody an attempt at revolution quite different from those of South American guerrillas of the 1970's or Central American guerrillas of the 1980's. Befitting tradition, commanders of the Zapatista army, which took its name from Emiliano Zapata, the leader of peasants who rose up against dictatorship in the 1910 Mexican Revolution, described their world view as socialist. Yet it was clear from interviews with rebels that ideology was more an afterthought than an engine of the uprising. "The struggle is for people to have a better life," a 20-year-old rebel platoon leader said simply.
After seeming initially to evade the crisis, Mr. Salinas highlighted what he called an essential difference between the impoverished guerrilla rank and file and the "professionals of violence" commanding them. Officials claimed some of the leaders were radical Catholics, some had ties to earlier Mexican and Central American rebel groups, but all had interests different from those of the peasants they led, officials claimed. "This is not an Indian uprising," Mr. Salinas said, "but the deliberate work of this violent group that leads it."
 
Left Behind>
 While poverty and mistreatment of Indians in the region date to their conquest by the Spanish in 1528, some advocates of indigenous rights say those problems have eased somewhat under Mr. Salinas. Yet throughout the region that became a war zone last week, the painted symbol of the President's vast anti-poverty program, Solidarity, stood out in town after town, a haunting leitmotif. It was not that the poor had necessarily grown poorer, said the vicar of San Cristobal's archdiocese, Father Gonzalo Ituarte; it was that roads and radio and television had made it so much easier for them to see the wealthier people of Mexico leave them behind.
That tension is repeated throughout less-developed parts of southern Mexico. Like the peasants of Chiapas, many of them driven off their lands by ranchers or the Government oil monopoly, other poor people, like subsistence corn farmers or jobless sugar workers in states like Oaxaca and Guerrero, have yet to find their places in the new North American economy. Among middle-class Mexicans, approval of the trade accord bolstered Mr. Salinas's promise that things will get better; among many of the 40 percent thought to live in poverty, the expected flood of cheaper imports has caused concern.
Chiapas also anchors a Mexican south marked by political underdevelopment. In the past, stirrings of dissent had been controlled by local bosses or put down by security forces. Over the last two decades, though, independent peasant and Indian groups have proliferated and grown more militant.
"These are not people who were tricked or taken along at the last minute," said Araceli Burguete, who worked as a political organizer in Chiapas before being shot and leaving seven years ago. "But most of these Indians who have taken up arms have been organized for years, and they have always been under attack by the Government. Now you see guerrillas. But there has never been peace in Chiapas."

HEADLINE: Banks Learning to Make Loans to Help Poor Areas

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
It was Small Business Day at the Fordham Road branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank. The bank, once run by David Rockfeller, is trying to find new customers among the shopkeepers and small-factory owners in lower-income areas.
Millie Peartree was the first person on line this bright day in December. A director of the Christ Jesus Baptist Church in the Bronx, her congregation, founded a year ago, wanted to buy a brownstone from New York City so it could stop meeting in the Pastor's house. 
 Still wearing her tan trench coat, Ms. Peartree answered questions from Carolyn E. Smith, who heads small business lending for Chase's community development unit. Ms. Peartree explainedthat the church, with only 40 members, had raised $20,000 through regular tithing, as well as candy sales, spare penny drives and other fund raising. She wanted to borrow $50,000 to buy the building and pay for renovations.
Like other large banks, Chase is trying to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1979 law meant to force banks to lend money in the areas in which they do business.
 
A Push to Create Jobs
 Until recently, banks sought to comply with this law mainly by trying to make more mortgage loans to members of minority groups. Now government and members of community groups are also pressing them to lend to businesses that can create jobs in low-income areas.
For Chase, finding the people and businesses who need the money is easy; but it is harder to find borrowers with the experience and financial strength to repay the bank.
"You have all the qualities we're looking for," Ms. Smith told Ms. Peartree, handing her a loan application and explaining that she would have to submit written financial statements from an accountant much like those a commercial borrower would prepare.
In place of money, Ms. Smith gave Ms. Peartree a Chase shopping bag with bank souvenirs -- a letter opener, a Post-It note holder and a refrigerator magnet -- all bearing the Chase logo, and offered her some cookies and sandwiches from a nearby table.
For Chase, as for the government officials and community organizers who scrutinize its inner-city lending record, lending to nonprofit groups like churches is as important a part of community development lending as financing businesses. Such organizations create jobs, and often provide important social services. And like small businesses, many nonprofit groups have traditionally found it difficult to get the loans they need, often because the banks do not understand their finances.
Yet banks like Chase are starting to learn about the particular financial characteristics of urban businesses and nonprofit groups, just as they have found new ways to approve mortgage loans to minority borrowers after the disclosure that their old ways were producing racial disparities in their lending.
It is largely a process of mutual education: The borrowers, often new to business, must learn the art of writing a business plan and presenting financial statements to appear creditworthy. And the banks must understand the dynamics of businesses that have different sorts of collateral and cash flow than those of the traditional corporate borrowers they serve.
 
No Approval Formula
 The small business loans are not the sort that banks would make if they were trying to maximize their profits. "We'll spend far more money to process the application for a $5,000 loan than we will ever make on it," said Mark A. Willis, president of Chase's development corporation.
That is because the loans cannot be approved by a formula, as most loans to consumers are, and require a lot of individual attention by bankers. "You may go through 60 applications to make one loan," Mr. Willis said. "You have to use judgment and say, 'Here is a person who will work hard to pay you back.' "
Yet despite the protests by the banks about the difficulty of small business lending in low-income areas, they concede that they do not lose much money from bad loans. And most of the loans they make are guaranteed in part by the Small Business Administration or a new loan fund set up by New York City.
To some community organizers, the problem is not so much that banks cannot make money lending to these businesses, but that they have not tried.
"The lack of access to credit for small and micro-sized businesses, particularly from larger banks, is a problem that is continuing to worsen," said Alan Fishbein, legal director with the Center for Community Change in Washington. "You used to hear lenders say they couldn't make money making mortgage loans to low income people; now all of them claim they do make money at it. If banks spent the time and effort, they could develop economies of scale, but they need laws like the C.R.A. to nudge them to do it."
 
Lending Records Vary
 Chase, in fact, has lagged somewhat in small business lending in low-income areas. In New York City's small business loan program, European American Bank has made the most loans and Chemical Bank has committed the most money, said Joy M. Taylor, senior vice president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
Chase began a series of Small Business Days in the Bronx in the fall in hopes of increasing its lending there. Of the three dozen interviews she had done at five branches in the Bronx, Ms. Smith said she was pleased to find five borrowers whom she expects will qualify for loans -- a locksmith, a fruit market, a laundromat, a dentist and a manufacturer of travel accessories.
"These loans take a lot of time and you have to ask a lot of questions," said Ms. Smith, a banking industry employee for 17 years.
By the time Ms. Peartree departed, several other people were waiting on the benches in the hallway of the branch.
The next was Pedro Baz, the co-owner of a small grocery store on Sedgwick Avenue. The cash from a weekend's worth of sales was stolen in a robbery, and he wanted a $5,000 credit line on his business checking account so he could pay his suppliers.
 
Using a Specialized Lender
 Mr. Baz already had a loan, but not from a bank. He had borrowed $100,000 from the Sea Crest Linen Supply Corporation at 24.5 percent interest, on which he paid weekly. Many stores like his receive their startup financing from a handful of specialized companies that lend money at interest rates much higher than those charged by the banks.
Historically, banks have provided forms of financing that were not as risky, like loans secured by mortgages or inventory. Sometimes they have also provided established businesses with unsecured working capital, which is what Mr. Baz needed.
"People don't realize it, but banks have not traditionally lent money for people to start a business," said Mr. Willis, of Chase. "Historically, a lot of people got their start taking a second mortgage, but the problem in New York is most people don't own a home to get a second mortgage on."
The Clinton Administration has proposed tough new rules to enforce the Community Redevelopment Act with emphasis on encouraging banks to lend to small businesses in low-income areas. And it is clear that even as regulators started to toughen enforcement of the existing rules of the act, many banks had already begun to look harder for creditworthy borrowers in areas that they had previously ignored.
 
'Missing Good Deals'
 "Bank regulators can play a big role in forcing banks to focus on small business," said Ms. Taylor, of the Economic Development Corporation. "The banks are missing good deals out there primarily because they are not out in the neighborhoods looking for them."
At the same time, Ms. Taylor cautioned that even when banks reached out, as Chase was doing this day, they were sure to disappoint many business owners. "A lot of businesses don't get the loans they say they need because they can't demonstrate to the lender they have a reasonable ability to repay the loans," she said.
In fact, Ms. Smith did not shut the door completely on Mr. Baz. "We lend to bodegas," Ms. Smith told him reassuringly, referring to small urban grocery stores. "They are an important part of the Hispanic community," She gave him a loan application and the white bag of souvenirs, but she was noncommittal on his particular circumstances.
As of earlier this week, Mr. Baz had not received word on his loan application.
 
Turned Down for Credit
 Ms. Smith met next with Eric Vaheb, the owner of an electronics store that had been across from the bank branch for 15 years. He came to complain that he had been turned down for a credit line he needed to buy more inventory for Christmas. He was enraged because he had repaid two previous loans from Chase, but because his business had been hurt by recession, the bank would not lend to him again.
He was also saddened, he told Ms. Smith, over the fall of Fordham Road, once a main shopping street, that had lost many of its big merchants.
Ms. Smith appeared impressed by his business acumen, and offered to re-evaluate his application. She also gave him several copies of the bank's brochures to give to other business owners along with the bag of Chase trinkets.
Mr. Vaheb, however, was not satisfied. "I'm very upset with the bank," he said later. "In the good years we built up a good credit rating. Now there is no reason not to give us a loan." He said last week that he had not reapplied for the loan because he had been too busy with Christmas.
Neer Deen, the owner of Rosans Auto Parts on Jerome Avenue, said he was not happy either. Chase had rejected his application to refinance the mortgage on his business, and he sat angrily holding his application form, waiting to see Ms. Smith.
She offered to reconsider his application, too, but warned him that using conventional standards, falling real estate values might make the loan hard to approve. She prompted him to try to frame his request in a way that would appeal to the special programs for low-income areas that she runs.
 
Lower Payments Sought
 "I ask you to say how debt relief would allow you to hire more people or expand your business," she said.
Shifting impatiently in a black cloth swivel chair, Mr. Deen brushed aside the suggestion. He was not interested in community development issues; all he wanted was lower loan payments.
"I don't feel like paying 12.5 percent; I want an 8 percent mortgage," said Mr. Deen, a native of Guyana who had worked for several years in Saudi Arabia to earn the money to start his store.
Mr. Deen and Ms. Smith parted with very different impressions of how well the bank was meeting its obligation.
"I bank at the Chase branch here, and they are very nice people," Mr. Deen said later. "But they are not the ones that approve the loans; it is the people upstairs, who are removed from the personalities of the small business. To them, you are just a bunch of numbers."
Despite Ms. Smith's offer to reevaluate his loan, Mr. Deen said late last month that he had decided to try another bank.

HEADLINE: U.S.-North Korean Atom Accord Expected to Yield Dubious Results

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Even if the Clinton Administration completes its long-brewing deal with North Korea to reopen seven nuclear sites to international inspection, diplomats and intelligence officials say the limitations on the first round of inspections virtually assure that nothing new will be learned about how close Pyongyang has come to making a nuclear weapon.
Experts say the inspections, heralded by the Administration as a diplomatic triumph, will probably prevent the Communist Government of Kim Il Sung from diverting more nuclear material from its reactors to its weapons project. 
 That is especially important as the North Koreans prepare to shut down their biggest reactor and change the fuel rods, an opportunity for them to gain more nuclear fuel for a bomb.
 
Months of Negotiations
 But the new inspections, won after 10 months of negotiations, simply restore the situation to where it was a year ago, when the International Atomic Energy Agency first found evidence that it was being deceived by North Korea.
The agency officials will still be barred by Pyongyang from conducting special inspections of suspected nuclear sites that North Korea has not declared part of its atomic program. The agency's demand for special inspections touched off the crisis last year.
 
Two Biggest Questions
 Not until those inspections are conducted is there much chance of answering the two biggest questions about North Korea's nuclear program: How much plutonium, the element at the core of nuclear weapons, has North Korea already produced, and are American intelligence agencies right when they say that Mr. Kim's scientists probably have already pieced together a crude nuclear weapon?
"We know nothing more than we knew last spring," a senior South Korean official lamented here the other day, referring to the period when North Korea threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and halted all inspections. "And by some measures, you might say we know less."
 
U.S. Insists It Is Not Backing Down

Administration officials insist that they are not backing down from President Clinton's pledge that "North Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb." In a briefing this week in Washington, Lynn Davis, the Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs, disputed reports suggesting that the Administration was softening its position in order to keep North Korea talking.
"Our objectives are as they've been from the start, and that is to gain the North's full cooperation," including inspections of any sites that the International Atomic Energy Agency believes will shed light on Pyongyang's past nuclear activities, she said. "In no way will we change those goals."
But in reality, diplomats here say, it will be virtually impossible to be sure that the bomb project has been halted, much less reversed.
North Koreans are known to be master tunnel builders. Several tunnels big enough to drive tanks through were secretly dug underneath the heavily armed demilitarized zone in apparent preparations for any eventual attack on South Korea, and most experts presume some part of the North Korean nuclear sites are underground as well.
"You have to take a pragmatic view," one Western diplomat involved in the issue said. "Finding a bomb in an environment like that would be a little like trying to find a subway token you dropped somewhere on the IRT."
 
Special Inspections Are on Back Burner
 For now, the Administration has put the question of special inspections on the back burner, saying its first priority is to force North Korea to resume compliance with the basic elements of the nonproliferation treaty.
But the State Department and South Korean leaders say the special inspections will be a major part of the next phase of talks. That phase is the one in which the United States and North Korea are expected to discuss a package deal involving broad access to Pyongyang's nuclear program in return for diplomatic recognition from the United States, expanded trade and possibly some foreign aid from countries including Japan and South Korea.
But even while they acknowledge that North Korea is showing more flexibility, some American and South Korean officials here are beginning to say that the next round of talks could drag on for months, giving Mr. Kim even more time to build a bomb.
And it could take years to find the truth about the nuclear project, in part because both sides, for different reasons, are so eager to avoid confrontation.
Many involved in the talks now believe that North Korea will try over the next months to stave off sanctions by the United Nations Security Council by allowing just enough access to its sites. Meanwhile, Pyongyang will try to benefit from the uncertainty surrounding its nuclear program, hoping that the fear it may have the bomb will prove as valuable as the bomb itself.
At the same time, Washington and its Pacific allies seem increasingly inclined to embrace the view that it is not worth risking a potentially devastating military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, especially when dealing with a country like North Korea whose crippled economy may soon collapse. But they insist they are willing to impose sanctions if diplomacy fails.
 
White House Faces Increased Criticism
 The Clinton Administration, however, has come under increasing criticism from sources as diverse as George Bush's former national security advisers to some in the South Korean military establishment, who say the United States is negotiating too much and demanding too little. Speaking in Tokyo today, Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned against being "satisfied with some kind of compromise."
There are two kinds of inspections at issue, each playing a very different role in the process of keeping North Korea in check. The first are the regular inspections, conducted routinely around the world at the nuclear sites of countries that have signed the nonproliferation treaty. The second are the special inspections, requiring a country to open up an area it has not declared as an atomic site.
Special inspections are new, a result of the intelligence failures in Iraq. Those inspections mostly involve keeping inventories of nuclear fuel and the waste it produces, and installing automatic cameras and seals that insure the material is not tampered with between inspections.
North Korea signed the nonproliferation treaty in 1985, but prevented regular inspections for seven years. It finally signed an agreement to permit inspections in early 1992, designating seven sites at Yongbyon, the heavily guarded nuclear complex 60 miles north of Pyongyang.
Of the seven, the two most important are a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor and a small reprocessing facility that can convert used fuel rods into plutonium. The North Koreans call it a "radiochemistry laboratory," and insist they have reprocessed only tiny quantities of plutonium as part of a civilian research project.
 
Atomic Detectives Discover a Clue
 The inspectors found that the reprocessing building was only partly complete and that the reactor was operating at a low level. But suspicions were raised on their sixth inspection, when the samples they took of nuclear waste did not match samples of nuclear fuel. It was a remarkable piece of detective work, and a tip-off that North Korea had reprocessed more than the tiny amounts of plutonium it has admitted to producing.
Around the same time the United States gave the atomic energy agency some satellite photographs of two concealed nuclear waste sites at Yongbyon. As the inspectors' questions grew more searching, Pyongyang gradually cut off their access, taking them to some sites only at night or when the power had failed and blocking them from others altogether. North Korea's leaders flatly refused a demand by the atomic energy agency for a special inspection to force the opening of the two suspected waste dumps.
"They were apparently astounded about what we could detect with such a tiny amount of samples, and what the Americans could see from the satellites," a senior agency official said last year.
When the agency kept pressing the issue, and raised the possibility of United Nations sanctions, North Korea announced it would withdraw from the nonproliferation treaty. That set off the alarms in Washington, which opened talks with Pyongyang for the first time since the Korean War. It has spent the past year trying to nudge the North Koreans back into the treaty, but so far they have only agreed to suspend their decision.
 
Does North Korea Have the Bomb?
 Meanwhile, according to most American intelligence estimates, work has been proceeding on a bomb, presumably using plutonium obtained from the reactor when it was shut down for about 100 days in 1989. The C.I.A. and most other United States intelligence agencies concluded recently, in a classified report for President Clinton, that North Korea has probably already developed one or two devices, but the State Department disagrees. Even if it exists, the bomb has not been tested, so no one would know whether it works.
Officials of the atomic energy agency say it is critical that its inspectors attend the next shutdown of the 5-megawatt reactor, already long overdue. That is largely to make sure that North Korea does not use the old fuel rods to augment its relatively meager supply of plutonium. The shutdown will be North Korea's best chance to get enough plutonium to produce two or three weapons; it helps explain why there was so much attention in recent days in Washington to the question of whether Pyongyang was ready to allow repeated inspections of its sites.
By measuring the radioactive decay in the old rods after they are removed, inspectors may also be able to determine if other fuel rods were taken out in recent years. That would be another piece of evidence of continuing diversion of fuel to a weapons program.
To avert sanctions, though, officials say North Korea will finally have to relent on special inspections, and that is expected to be a major stumbling block. The two nuclear waste sites may only be the beginning. Hans Blix, the director of the atomic energy agency, suggested in 1992 that other reprocessing sites, including a smaller "pilot plant," may have been built. American intelligence officials have other sites they believe warrant inspections.
"We have a lot of places we may want to see," one South Korean official said. "Unless we can, in three months the crisis will be back."

Chart/Diagram/Map: "Nuclear Mystery In North Korea"
REACTOR: Inspectors will change film in surveillance cameras and check seals on the reactor where uranium fuel is irradiated and partly transformed into plutonium. The imminent shutdown of the reactor to replace fuel rods will be the North Korea's best chance of obtaining plutonium.
URANIUM FUEL: Inspectors say the reprocessing plant, which turns nuclear waste into plutonium, is only partly completed inside. Nonetheless, it is one of the most crucial sites in the regular inspection regime, and close monitoring should prevent North Korea from using it to fuel additional weapons.
WASTE SITES: Waste has been stored into low camoulflaged buildings near Yongbyon. North Korea refuses to declare them a nuclear site, saying they are part of a nearby military installation. But testing the waste would probably help determine how much plutonium North Korea has in hand. Other sites are belived to be located in deep tunnels beneath the Yongbyon complex.

HEADLINE: Clinton Going to a Europe Poised 'at Turning Point'

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
As President Clinton begins the longest foreign journey of his young presidency, he is preparing to cast himself and the United States as forces of stability for an uneasy Europe and a politically divided Russia.
Far from the congratulatory idyll he may once have expected, the eight-day trip across the Continent from Brussels to Prague, Moscow, Minsk and then Geneva is shadowed by new difficulties arising from the strong showing of rightist candidates in Russian elections last month. 
 For Mr. Clinton, who last visited Moscow as an Oxford University student in the late 1960's, the trip presents an opportunity to cast himself as a true statesman who can address the deep concerns of European governments and put the United States behind the right forces at an uncertain time in history.
"All of Europe stands at a turning point with deep implications for our own security and prosperity," Vice President Al Gore said in a radio address he delivered today on behalf of Mr. Clinton, who was returning from the funeral of his mother in Arkansas and preparing to depart again around midnight for the NATO summit meeting in Brussels.
Mr. Gore described the President's trip as one "that can help make our nation and our world more secure in every way."
 
NATO Meeting of 16 Leaders
 Leaders of the 16 NATO nations are to meet in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday. Mr. Clinton heads next to Prague, where he will meet with leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia; then on to Moscow on Wednesday for meetings with President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Mr. Clinton will also visit the former Soviet republic of Belarus, which he will praise for its efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons, before continuing to Geneva next weekend for meetings with Swiss officials and the President of Syria, Hafez al-Assad.
The President has said he will seek on his trip to reinvigorate the Atlantic alliance, encourage political reform in the former East bloc, limit the dangers posed by stocks of nuclear weapons and promote economic renewal throughout Europe.
But he must also contend with complaints from Eastern Europeans angered by his refusal to grant them immediate membership in NATO and with the challenges to political and economic reform in Russia personified by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist whose faction is now the second-largest bloc in a freely elected Parliament.
 
A Tangled Agenda
 So tangled is the agenda that on the eve of Mr. Clinton's departure, Administration officials said they had not decided exactly how to finesse the political uncertainty in Moscow.
Still undecided, for instance, was whether Mr. Clinton should reach out to the agrarians and Communists who now make up about half of the new Parliament's membership.
He is also facing criticism at home from some of leading foreign policy figures of the Bush Administration, who have described his plan to offer Eastern European countries the status of "association" with NATO instead of prompt membership as a decision that history will view as a mistake.
Even Mr. Clinton acknowledged this week that he could not say with absolute confidence that he had chosen the right course. "You always have these judgment calls," he told newspaper columnists in a moment of candor, "and only history can render a verdict."
 
Meeting 23 Leaders
 His trip will include meetings with at least 23 heads of state or government, including the session in Geneva with Mr. Assad, who will be pressed for a commitment on bringing about peace in the Middle East.
It is in Brussels, Prague, Moscow and Minsk, the settings for discussions about Europe and the former Soviet empire, that Mr. Clinton will come into closest contact with the issue of resurgent nationalism that Mr. Gore described this week as "a dark cloud on the horizon of Europe."
When planning began for the President's trip in the middle of last year, the journey promised to be something of a stroll through Europe, where Mr. Clinton would be greeted by erstwhile allies, grateful Eastern Europeans and a strong partner in Mr. Yeltsin.
Aides said they hoped Mr. Clinton would perform as well as he did on his previous overseas journey, a six-day trip in July in which he attended an economic summit meeting of the leading industrialized democracies in Tokyo and stopped in South Korea to visit American troops.
But the gathering of NATO leaders in Brussels, the main occasion for Mr. Clinton's current trip, is likely to be clouded by the alliance's embarrassing failure to come up with a plan to halt the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. With the fighting there having worsened in recent days, American officials are bracing for embarrassing pressure from France for NATO to assume a greater peacemaking role.
 
Seeking Russia-Ukraine Accord
 Perhaps the best news the White House hoped to draw from the summit meeting with Mr. Yeltsin -- an announcement that Russia and Ukraine had resolved a dispute over the formidable nuclear arsenal left on Ukrainian soil -- remained only a slight possibility as Mr. Clinton departed, although The Associated Press reported tonight that progress had been made toward an agreement.
"We're very, very close, though there are some details to be ironed out," mostly between Ukraine and Russia, The A.P. quoted a senior Administration official as having said.
If a deal is struck, President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine would likely go to Moscow this week to join President Clinton and President Yeltsin in initialing the accord, the official said.
From the moment he lands in Brussels on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Clinton is expected rather to emphasize his plan for a "Partnership for Peace" as an alternative to any arrangement that would etch new lines across Europe.
The partnership, which is to be approved by NATO's 16 members during the meeting in Brussels, would offer cooperation but no security guarantees from NATO to former Warsaw Pact states, to Russia and the other former Soviet republics and to Europe's neutral countries -- Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and Finland.
It is intended to satisfy the Eastern Europeans without complicating matters in Moscow, where the rise of Mr. Zhirinovsky and other nationalists has caused Mr. Yeltsin and his fellow reformers to warn against anything that looks like Western encirclement.
 
Forging New Bonds
 A senior Administration official has described the plan as an effort by Mr. Clinton to address "a moment of extraordinary strategic importance" and forge new bonds on a continent that was divided for four decades.
A senior Defense Department official said Mr. Clinton would seek to persuade the leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia when he meets with them in Prague that the proposed "partnership" is "not a gilded outhouse" but an entryway that could lead to ultimate NATO membership.
But with some Eastern European leaders pressing for immediate guarantees of NATO membership, and a spokesman for Mr. Yeltsin denouncing an application by Lithuania to join the alliance, Mr. Clinton will have difficulty convincing both sides that the United States is responding to their concerns.
That Mr. Clinton's mission suddenly seems so delicate is a stark reflection of how complicated American foreign policy has become in a world in which alliances are less clear.
So important has Eastern Europe become to the United States that Mr. Clinton's Prague visit, which begins Tuesday night, is described by his aides as a crucial "part two" of the NATO summit. And by traveling later from Moscow to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, he will demonstrate a growing American recognition of the significance of the other former Soviet republics -- particularly those that, unlike Ukraine, have already given up their nuclear weapons.
 
Final Meeting With Assad
 Mr. Clinton's final meeting, with Mr. Assad in Geneva, is intended to complete what he began in September in presiding over the handshake at the White House between Prime Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Yasir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Mr. Assad told visiting United States envoys last month that "big things happen when big people meet." American officials hope that gesture will be an agreement by Syria to normalize its relations with Israel.
When he arrives on Wednesday in Moscow, Mr. Clinton will find a capital whose political mood has changed not only since his last visit 23 years ago, but in the weeks and months since his trip was first planned.
Looking forward to a series of meetings with Mr. Yeltsin, including a private dinner at his dacha, Mr. Clinton has made clear that his main goal during the visit will be to encourage the political and economic reforms favored by the Russian President and many aides but opposed by perhaps half of the newly elected Parliament.
Mr. Clinton plans to meet with Russian lawmakers to show support for reformers other than Mr. Yeltsin. But as he prepared to leave Washington, Administration officials said the only firm decision he had made was not to meet with Mr. Zhirinovsky.

HEADLINE: Many in Haiti Now Believe the U.S. Has Given Up on Aristide

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Whatever the intention, President Clinton's pessimistic assessment of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide this week convinced many Haitians that Washington's halting efforts to restore him as President of Haiti were drawing to a close.
Mr. Clinton's remarks, in which he seemed to be calling for a reassessment of American support for Father Aristide, were banner news in Haiti's press, the talk of radio commentators and for many in a conservative elite that rejects the exiled President, an occasion for champagne toasts. 
 Reacting to Mr. Clinton's comments, American diplomats quickly began issuing statements saying that despite Mr. Clinton's statement that Father Aristide's prospects for returning to power were now "clouded," the United States remained committed to restoring the Haitian leader to office.
 
'It's All Over'
 Nonetheless, few across the political spectrum in Haiti seem to believe that Washington still has any enthusiasm for reviving a long-stalled diplomatic strategy for achieving that goal.
"It's all over," a wealthy Haitian businessmen said with glee after what he viewed as a signal that Washington was finally dropping its insistence that a return to democracy in Haiti include the return of Father Aristide to the presidency. "It's just a question now of when they lift the sanctions."
The United Nations Security Council reimposed sanctions on fuel deleveries in October when military leadership reneged on a negotiated agreement to surrender power and make way for Father Aristide's return. Continued defiance by the military has brought threats of reinforced sanctions beginning as early as Jan. 15, with a ban on commercial air traffic and a total trade embargo reportedly under consideration by the international community.
Diplomats have declined to spell out what new punitive measures will be taken, but many Haitians including supporters of Father Aristide say they no longer believe that strong new sanctions will be applied, especially after President Clinton's remarks to journalists on Wednesday.
"I don't see the point," said a member of Father Aristide's Government, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "If they are applying sanctions just for the sake of doing something, what good does that do the Haitian people?"
For months, Haitian commentators on the left and right have criticized Washington for imposing economic sanctions only to quickly introduce major exceptions or fail to enforce them.
 
Clinton's Withdrawal of Ship
 In the most embarrassing turnaround, two weeks before Father Aristide's negotiated return, scheduled for Oct. 30, the Clinton Administration ordered the withdrawal of a ship carrying about 300 Canadian and American troops who were intended in part to cement the diplomatic settlement.
If the international community has lacked consistency, so too has Father Aristide, whose statements and decisions have brought criticism from his supporters and unusually public expressions of frustration from Washington, leading up to Mr. Clinton's comments.
Father Aristide's slide began last month with the resignation of his handpicked Prime Minister, Robert Malval, after the exiled Haitian President withdrew support for a national conference that Mr. Malval was trying to organize.
Afterward, the Clinton Administration's reservations began to surface more publicly when Father Aristide made thinly veiled threats to end his cooperation in discouraging Haitians from trying to flee to the United States and instead help focus public attention on the plight of Haitian boat people. He finally relented to strong diplomatic pressure on Friday by inviting the Haitian military to take part in a political conference of his own in Miami, but did so only grudingly.
 
New Year's Speech
 On New Year's Day, Haiti's independence day, Father Aristide broadcast a speech to his nation in which he urged the people to emulate the Haitian revolutionary leader, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, whose motto against French colonialists was: "Cut off their heads and burn down their homes." In his speech, he seemed to endorse violent resistance against the Haitian Army by saying the people should use "iron to cut iron."
Days later, in an interview with The Miami Herald, he came close to endorsing a "surgical strike" by the United States to remove the army leaders in Haiti, a call that the State Department described as "unhelpful."
"The President has not helped himself recently," said one of Father Aristide's ministers, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity. "He has ended up projecting an image of incoherence at a time when he can scarcely afford it."

HEADLINE: Prominent Blacks Stress Family, Church and School as Instruments to Fight Violence

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
A group of black politicians, sociologists, ministers, entertainers and civil rights leaders, meeting to build a strategy to fight violence, produced an agenda today that was heavy on the old-fashioned notion of reaching out to save wayward young people through family, church and school.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose National Rainbow Coalition convened the three-day meeting, called for blacks to take the "moral offensive" in fighting violence. 
 He also pushed some of his own political causes, like voter registration and pressing the Clinton Administration to put together an urban policy and take a stronger position on civil rights.
"Oftentimes, what a movement does is determine the options of a President," Mr. Jackson said. "Urban policy, for the first time in a long time, will be discussed at the White House on Monday."
Mr. Jackson said he would take the agenda to President Clinton. No meeting date had been set as of today.
Mr. Jackson called the meeting to discuss what leaders of black groups have called an alarming rise in murder, assault and other violent crime among blacks. Homicide is the leading cause of death among young black males, and the killer typically is another young black male.
 
Stressing Responsibility
 Mr. Jackson said he would hold similar meetings in other cities, giving priority to states with upcoming Senate elections.
Participants came away calling today's agenda a watershed, and said it would be received enthusiastically in inner-city communities struggling with violent crime.
"This is the first meaningful and measurable blow to deal with the problem," said Representative Kweisi Mfume, the Maryland Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. "While black people are not a monolith, on this issue we are pretty close to a consensus."
Mr. Mfume suggested attacking the problem with an all-out traditional values campaign that stresses responsibility, respect for the elderly, pride in black heritage and stronger connections between black parents and teachers.
The Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York civil rights leader, suggested that blacks press for criminal penalties for gun manufacturers whose weapons turn up on the black market. That is where most youths, often as young as 11 years old, get their guns, Mr. Sharpton said.
The meeting today also forged an alliance between high-profile leaders and grass-roots leaders who felt abandoned by them.
 
'Walls We Must Knock Down'
 "These are some of the walls we must knock down," said Minister Fontian, who works with the Black Disciples, a Chicago gang with about 35,000 members. "They need us as much as we need them. Now I can go back and give a reasonable report."
The agenda included these proposals:
*Mentoring 10 youths each at 100 churches in 100 cities.
*Antiviolence pledges between students and parents.
*Urging parents to enforce studying and attending school.
*Employment programs for young people ages 17 to 30.
*Degree programs at black colleges for prison inmates.
*Supervised after-school programs.
*Removing barriers to family life in social service programs.
Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros pointed to rules in public housing that tie rent to a family's income. In many cases, he said, husbands and fathers leave the household so their income will not be included and the rent will not go up.
Mr. Cisneros said he wanted to delete such rules from housing policy. Those barriers aside, he said, families can then help themselves.

HEADLINE: California's Tide of Illegal Aliens Ebbs

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Even as public resentment over a perceived invasion of California by illegal aliens has soared, the tide of illegal immigration here may in fact have begun to ebb.
While thousands of illegal aliens from Mexico and Central American still illegally cross the California-Mexico border every day, their numbers seem to be declining even as substantial numbers of aliens already illegally here appear to be returning home. The effect has still been a net increase in illegal immigrants in California over the last year, the experts say, but in declining numbers. 
 Many of the aliens who say they are returning home report that they are unable to find work or are fed up with crime, poor schools and urban congestion.
 
End of a Dream
 "The American dream is not true," said Jose Chavez, a 20-year-old laborer from Michoacan, Mexico, who said he was returning home after three years in Los Angeles. "It didn't happen. I have no more dreams, no way to pay the rent."
Standing on one of the hundreds of street corners where such aliens wait daily for job offers, Mr. Chavez said he had not had a day's work for more than two weeks.
The Mexican Consulate here reports that the number of Mexicans seeking permits to ship their household belongings back to Mexico from the Los Angeles area in 1993 nearly doubled to 1,330 from 735 in 1992.
As ever, with the elusive world of migration from Mexico, in which families are often made up of both legal and illegal residents, these figures can be misinterpreted. Many Mexicans use these permits to ship televisions and other consumer goods to sell at a profit or give to relatives in Mexico. The shippers do not necessarily intend to repatriate themselves. But the consulate's figures tend to corroborate other data.
 
Apprehensions Down 6%
 According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, apprehensions of illegal aliens trying to cross the California-Mexico border dropped by about 6 percent in the year ended Sept. 30 compared with the same period a year earlier, to 531,689 from 565,581. And the Census Bureau reported last month that for the first time in 20 years, California's population grew at a slower rate than the nation's as a whole.
All of this will have only a slight immediate effect in a state that absorbed half of all legal and illegal immigration into the United States in the 1980's, bringing massive social and economic change to Los Angeles and other cities. Immigration experts estimate that of California's 30 million residents, 1 million are illegal aliens, most of them Mexicans.
While initially welcomed as a source of cheap, hard-working labor when California was booming, the Mexican immigrants are now widely perceived as taking jobs away from Americans, causing street crime, graffiti and housing decay and for placing huge financial burdens on school districts, welfare agencies and other public services.
Politicians, including Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and liberals like Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, have joined a growing chorus demanding tighter border controls and other measures to discourage immigration.
 
Economy Tighter Than Border
 But it appears that California's protracted economic slump has begun to have the same effect. The slump devastated the industries in which the immigrants, both legal and not, have long worked as day laborers, like construction and landscaping.
"Street-corner labor markets have become overpopulated relative to the demand," said Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for United States-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego. He said that he believed that men like Mr. Chavez were returning home and telling others in Mexico not to come to California because there was not enough income to be earned, especially for families with children.
 
Excess of Farm Workers
 Much the same is happening in farm areas, said Don Villarejo, director of the California Institute for Rural Studies in Sacramento. "There is an oversupply of available workers," he said.
Reliable statistics on illegal immigration, given its nature, are difficult to obtain. But anecdotal evidence from interviews with more than 20 illegal aliens on the streets of Los Angeles and Orange Counties suggests they are becoming discouraged. Many men said they had sent their families home.
Jorge Lopez, another Mexican immigrant who stood at the same corner waiting for work as Mr. Chavez, said things had gone from bad to worse in the last three years. "I think I will return to Mexico," said Mr. Lopez, 20. "Everyday it's more difficult."
Mr. Lopez said he had gone five days without work and was struggling to pay bills in the hotel where he lives with three other workers. "There's just no work," he said.
Indirect indicators also point to a slower flow of illegal aliens. School enrollments this year in cities with large Mexican populations, like Santa Ana and Anaheim in Orange County, are lower than expected.
Since 1987, Mexican researchers at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a private research institute in Tijuana, have been surveying illegal aliens crossing almost the entire 2,000-mile border from California to Texas. The director, Jorge Bustamante, said that the early years of the American recession had seen no letup in northward migration but that researchers had recently noticed a small decline in the increase in illegal entries into the United States: 5 percent in 1993 and 8 percent in 1992.
Illegal immigration from Mexico, as gauged by the United States Border Patrol's apprehension of would-be immigrants, soared in the 1980's until the enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. The law gave amnesty to long-term illegal residents but sought to deter further immigration by imposing heavy penalties on employers who hire people without proper documentation.
 
Big Drop in Apprehensions
 The law achieved its purpose at first; apprehensions plummeted after it went into effect. The number of illegal aliens apprehended peaked at 1.7 million in 1986 before dropping to 891,000 in 1989. The number has been rising steadily ever since. And while apprehensions on the California border dropped in 1993, the total number rose to 1.3 million from 1.2 million the previous year.
The reasons for the decline in California are unclear, but one possibility is that immigrants have switched destinations to economically healthier states like Texas and Colorado.
If illegal immigration is indeed abating, experts cite a variety of reasons, including the recession, greater American political and government efforts to stop it, the end of civil war in El Salvador and the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has bolstered hopes of economic improvement in Mexico.
"Everybody thinks the streets are paved with gold here and they find that is not the case," said Alan C. Nelson, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now a consultant and lobbyist in Sacramento for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a national anti-immigration group.
"It's not as easy to get jobs and welfare benefits as it used to be," he added. "They read the papers, listen to radio and TV. Word gets around that things have tightened up."
 
'Gangsters, Guns and Drugs'
 Carol Pacheco, a medical clerk who lives in Long Beach, is a legal resident who came here as a child with her mother and married an American. Ms. Pacheco, now divorced, was at the Mexican Consulate a week ago to prepare to emigrate to her birthplace of Colima, Mexico, along with her 10-year-old daughter.
"I don't want to send her to school here," she said, clutching her papers. "As soon as you start junior high, it's gangsters, guns and drugs. I don't have nothing against Americans. It's just the city itself, how it's going."
Some aliens are leaving because tougher law enforcement has made it much harder to get the counterfeit green cards and other papers that used to be so available. Jose Jaramillo, a 37-year-old mechanic, is planning to repatriate to Veracruz, Mexico, after 20 years in California because he fears it will be impossible to get more work.
"I used to have a green card that I bought," he said. "But I lost it, so I'm in trouble. When I first came, it was easy to get I.D. Right now you can't get anything."
But that is not the only reason. He and his wife, Marta, have three boys, and he is reluctant to have them grow up in gang-ridden Los Angeles County. "I am trying to get my children raised in Mexico, to learn other ways," he said. "I don't want to see my boys getting involved with gang bangers."
 
Job Offers Drying Up
 Mr. Chavez, the 20-year-old Mexican, is among the several dozen day laborers who line up each morning along Sawtelle Avenue in West Los Angeles, hoping to get job offers from contractors and homeowners. In 1991, before the recession bit deeply, Mr. Chavez said he could earn $250 a week in roofing, street paving and landscaping.
But the last time he had more than a day of work in a week was in November, he said, when he earned $150 for three days of roofing. He lives in a small apartment in the rough Pico-Union district near downtown where his four roommates are lending him his share of the $450 monthly rent.
He has reached the end of the line in the United States. Mr. Chavez said he was flying back to his hometown of Morelia to try to make a living in the fields where his parents and 10 brothers have worked most of their lives.
"I have no way to pay the rent," he said. "I don't want to live in the streets or in the mission. If there are employers, there's lots of work. But when there's no work, I don't eat."
He said he had no illusions that he could earn much money in Mexico beyond enough for food. But, he added, "I miss my family."

HEADLINE: Clinton on the Continent

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Waiting at the door for Bill Clinton, Europe is as edgy and defensive as an executive who has asked the boss home to dinner.
"This is a critical moment for them and for him," said Pamela Harriman, the friend, adviser and fund-raiser whom the President sent to Paris as Ambassador. "The Europeans don't know him. Too many of them see him as a man who plays the saxophone by night and wears running shoes by day. Next week he needs to show them his brains, his scope, his leadership."
 
Sources of the Anxiety
 When Mr. Clinton arrives on Sunday afternoon for his first visit to Europe as President, he will have completed almost a year in the Oval Office. For all those months, Europeans have been watching, trying to take his measure from afar, studying his policies (or what many see as the lack thereof) and wondering why he has waited so long to come. 
 Their anxious mood is compounded of many things: an apprehension about the unknown, an unsettling generational change, a sense that history may be flowing away from them. All that was probably inevitable. So, too, in all likelihood, is the low-key resentment felt by proud countries that find their fortunes controlled, to some degree, by the world's only superpower.
Europe is beset by problems of its own, including stalled economies, a dearth of strong leaders and troubles with ambitious plans for further integration. But Mr. Clinton's actions have also played a part in creating serious strains.
He found time to visit Tokyo, then to meet with leaders of the Pacific Rim nations in Seattle but he was too busy for us, European politicians and editorial writers complain. He has called relations with Japan the most important the United States has, and has repeatedly hailed the vibrancy of the new Asian economies. Trading with them is vital to the creation of new jobs and economic vigor in the United States, the Administration says.
Suddenly, Eurocentric has become a dirty word in Washington.
"We are starting to feel isolated," a prominent German said. "It used to be Europe and America, the Atlantic nations, taking on all comers, especially the Communist bloc. Now we're afraid it's you and the Asians, the Pacific nations, who are setting the pace, with us off by ourselves."
Such apprehensions are magnified by the lack of familiar players in Washington. Not only is Mr. Clinton a fresh face on the international scene, none of the top figures in the foreign-policy team have extensive experience here.
Neither Secretary of State Warren Christopher nor Anthony Lake, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, has spent the years on the European conference circuit that many predecessors had, and for the first time in many years the State Department hierarchy lacks a prominent specialist in Western European affairs.
 
The Shadow of Bosnia
 "There always used to be someone we knew to go to for a clear reading on where you were heading," said Sir Charles Powell, who was Margaret Thatcher's main foreign policy adviser. "If not Henry, then Zbig. If not Colin Powell, then Brent Scowcroft. We may not have liked the policy, but at least we usually understood it, and we knew how strongly views were held.
"To put it mildly, that has not been the case in recent months."
An American ambassador with long experience in Europe agrees. Even making allowances for the difficulties of policy-making in the post-cold-war world, he said, even allowing for the usual slippage involved in the transition from one Administration to another, "we have not spoken with a very clear or forceful voice."
The mutual failure of Europe and the United States to come to grips with the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina still rankles here. And European officials gripe all the more loudly about what they term the feebleness of American leadership because, as a few of them concede, they are all too painfully aware of their own lack of unity and creativity on Bosnia.
Still, as Lord Owen, the European Community negotiator on Bosnia, sometimes says, "The United States is the only country that can actually decide anything these days." So Mr. Christopher's failure to push strongly for Mr. Clinton's original Bosnia plan on his ill-fated European swing early last year stands as a metaphor for what many politicians here see as a kind of spiritual disengagement from Europe and its problems.
 
The NATO Puzzle
 By contrast, Europe has more or less agreed to the President's "Partnership for Peace" -- a half-a-loaf plan to hold off a definitive decision on whether the former Soviet satellite countries should be allowed to join NATO.
The plan is widely recognized here for what it is, a fudge, "all smoke and no steel," in the words of one French official. But Washington has made a strong case for the proposition that it is the best answer possible now, and the Europeans have welcomed Washington's rigor as well as the continued commitment to NATO it implies.
Like Henry A. Kissinger and other American specialists, however, many Europeans worry that the Administration is so determined to avoid offending the Russians, who oppose NATO membership for Poland, the Czech Republic and other Eastern European nations, that it has given Moscow a virtual veto over NATO policy. The power of Strobe Talbott, the newly named Deputy Secretary of State, who has spent his entire career on Soviet affairs, reinforces those worries.
In general Europeans are less sanguine than Americans about the chances of democracy taking root in Russia. So they are more inclined to put the emphasis on strengthening the new Eastern Europe.
 
Diplomatic Fuzziness
 "In terms of European stability, I think that Poland is the most important problem," one Briton said. "But it's not easy to get an airing for that view in Washington, with Strobe and the Russia-firsters in charge."
A few here are ready right now to extend NATO membership, and with it the American nuclear umbrella, to the East. But there is a good deal of support for a more specific commitment, a declaration that if the Eastern Europeans satisfy certain requirements by a certain date, probably three to five years hence, they can expect admission then.
That is not going to happen at the NATO summit talks this week in Brussels. As much as possible will be left dangling. Unintentionally, no doubt, Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch Prime Minister, made that clear this week in a television interview in which he avoided words like pledge and timetable and filled 15 minutes with talk of "process" and "prospect" and "possibility."
As a result, some Western Europeans say the allies will miss a chance to reinforce democratic tendencies, not unlike the chance that was seized, with great success, when Spain, Portugal and Greece were admitted to the European Community after they threw off right-wing dictatorships. Clearly, despite promises of joint military maneuvers and other sweeteners, there will be widespread disappointment in Warsaw and other East European capitals.
But what will matter most is first, whether Mr. Clinton can convince his peers that he is a capable leader who takes foreign policy seriously, and second, whether he can offer a vision for revitalizing the European-American partnership even as the United States, with its resources stretched, focuses on problems at home and pursues new opportunities in Asia.

HEADLINE: Bid to Revise Education Is Fought in Connecticut

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Jan. 7

 BODY:
A movement to improve the public schools that has gained a rare consensus among Presidents, governors, business leaders and educators is coming under attack in Connecticut, as it has across the country.
The movement is driven by a simple-sounding theory most commonly called outcome-based education: that the way to improve schools is first to decide what skills or knowledge graduates should have, and then to design the schools to achieve those outcomes. 
 "Outcome-based education has been around since the 1920's," Greenwich's Superintendent of Schools, John Whritner, told a crowded forum on Thursday where he spoke in support of the philosophy behind the proposals. "It made a lot of sense: know where you want to go before heading down the road."
But to opponents, who vary from parents in upper-class suburbs like Greenwich to religious fundamentalists, outcome-based education has grown to symbolize everything they fear from public schooling, from mediocrity to mind control and meddling in family values. And here the concern is focused particularly on whether efforts to improve struggling schools in the inner cities will affect the quality of those in the suburbs.
The fight has been provoked by a sweeping set of proposals offered by a state panel to fulfill the Connecticut Legislature's mandate of promoting an "outcome-based, world-class educational system." If adopted by the Legislature, the plan would overhaul the way schools are run in the state and the way students are taught.
 
Proving Skills Were Learned
 For instance, instead of graduating by earning enough credits, students would have to prove they had acquired a specific set of skills, the skills demanded by colleges and by employers needing highly trained workers. Also, teachers would be retrained, and emphasis would be placed on helping everyone learn a lesson, rather than issuing grades that leave some students behind.
Schools would be reorganized to give teachers and administrators the freedom to decide how to attain the standards. They would also be held more accountable, and the state could take over school districts that failed to progress.
But critics in many suburbs here say the proposal would unnecessarily disturb and drag down their schools, which they believe are doing a good job, in a misguided effort to solve a separate problem: the failure of schools in cities like Hartford, which are overwhelmed by large numbers of poor children.
The only way the plan would close the gap between Greenwich and Hartford, they fear, would be by bringing Greenwich down to the city's level.
"There is a problem, but it's in the cities," said Kathleen Renton, a Greenwich P.T.A. Council vice president who objects to many of the commission's proposals. "Why do you have to apply the solution universally, where it's not needed?"
 
Surprise at Parents' Hostility
 The opposition here has mirrored the reaction in other places where outcome-based plans have been proposed. In state after state, business and education leaders, confident that they finally knew how to improve the schools, have been surprised to encounter emotional opposition from the very people they expected to support them: parents.
"What is so striking is their opposition to something that is led by all the relevant forces in the country when there's such a widespread sense that we need to do something about education in the United States?" said Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States.
The opponents, however, see the unanimity among national business, education and political leaders as proof that something more than improving the schools is afoot.
"It's not a program that improves education; it's a program that rounds out education with all sorts of social goals," said Kay Wall, a Greenwich P.T.A. member who has criticized outcome-based education in forums across Connecticut. "And it hurts a lot of children it's designed to help."
 
Panel Bans Emotional Phrase
 The emerging opposition in Connecticut has caused great concern for the state's Commission on Educational Excellence, which after 18 months of study is taking its plan for remaking Connecticut schools to public hearings next week.
In fact the commission contends that the issues that opponents have collected under the banner of outcome-based education have so little to do with the panel's work that it has struck all references to "outcome-based" from its proposals, even though its legislative mandate is to promote just that.
"In Fairfield County, we have a great deal of passion being stirred up through a terrifying vision that is being called outcome-based education," one commission member, Christopher Bruhl, told his colleagues on Tuesday at their last meeting before the hearings.
"And it is a terrifying vision," he said, "even though nothing like it is being proposed; it is the Devil. We have simply got to recognize that that name has been tarnished and lost."
 
Potentially Tough Audience
 At two forums here this week, the commission's plan had a preview before a potentially tough audience, several hundred parents, teachers and residents of Greenwich, a wealthy town that takes great pride in its schools, and is home to Mrs. Wall and other critics of the commission.
Mr. Bruhl, president of a Fairfield County business group, argued that the state's public education system must be redesigned because while many towns like Greenwich have good schools, those in poorer communities are failing their children.
Changes in the world economy are eliminating or driving down wages for unskilled factory jobs, he said, and to compete for high-paying jobs with countries like Japan and Germany, the United States must raise education levels for everyone.
The solution, he said, is to set high expectations for all students, and then to redesign schools so that teachers and administrators have the flexibility to help them succeed and are held accountable if they do not.
 
More Control for Schools
 Schools would no longer be measured by how much money they spent on students, but by what they learned. Those who learned quickly would move on quickly. Others would take longer, but a teacher's job could no longer be to present a lesson and then distribute A's to some and F's to others. "All children can learn" is the movement's motto.
To make teachers and principals accountable, each school would have more control over its budget and its curriculum, and retraining would be provided, but the state's tenure law would also be changed.
To prepare poor children to learn, Head Start programs and preschools would be expanded. To prepare everyone for the computer age, $75 million a year would be spent on upgrading schools' technology. The entire proposal would require $200 million the first year.
"Much of what we're doing is because in much of Connecticut, for 50 percent of the students, the standards we are talking about are not in evidence," said Lawrence Miller, a regional director of cooperative education. "If everyone were like Greenwich, we'd be in much better shape."
 
Conservative Groups Are Foes
 Across the country, advocates of the changes say, opposition to outcome-based plans has issued from conservative groups like the Eagle Forum and Focus on the Family. Those concerns are present in Greenwich, where sex education was the focus of a hard battle a year ago.
But critics like Mrs. Wall have also found a response in communities like Greenwich because many parents there expect their children to go on to good colleges and don't believe there is a crisis. City schools have problems, they acknowledge, but applying the same drastic solution in both Bridgeport and Greenwich would only drag all schools down to Bridgeport's level.
To them, even the idea of holding all children to high standards is unrealistic. Outcome-based education, they say, closes the achievement gap only by holding all students to the pace of the slowest learners.
Mrs. Wall and other critics say the philosophy of outcome-based education is to eliminate differences among children, and so it relies on cooperative learning among children and eliminates grades and tracking.
 
A 'Dumb-Down' Dispute
 "Some people are competitive, but many people have become less competitive, and have decided they don't want their children to be put in competitive, pecking-order situations," Mrs. Wall said. "It's not really an education question. It's how do you feel about life."
Advocates of the new proposals are frustrated when their talk of raising standards is turned around into a plan to "dumb-down" the curriculum.
"We think that even in our best school systems we need to produce better results, but somehow that's not being translated by this group," said Connecticut's education commissioner, Vincent Ferrandino.
But some advocates say the concern over such issues as eliminating grades reflects a correct perception by some parents that the proposed changes, by helping all children do well, would increase competition for theirs. Now, schools sort children into winners and losers, they said, and the goal of the proposals is to have far more winners.
 
Preserving Lots of Losers
 "Now they know their children are doing well because other kids are getting C's, D's and F's," said Marjorie Ledell, a consultant in Littleton, Colo., who advises school officials on how to present plans for changes to the public.
The ultimate problem for advocates of change, Ms. Ledell said, is that they doing a poor job of explaining complex proposals.
"There is, indeed, deep distrust of what public education has done so far," she said. "That's because our educators have done what they thought was best, and the public just passively trusted them. Now that they're getting clear-cut information from our critics, it looks like what you're getting from school systems is a lot of jargon. It looks like educators are trying to put something over on the public.


GRAPHIC: Major proposals of a commission studying public education in Connecticut.
Chart: "AT A GLANCE: Fixing the Schools"
 All students should have an equal chance to meet or surpass rigorous performance standards.
 Curriculums should provide students with the skills required for entry into the work force or higher education.
 The state should adopt a results-oriented system that sets world-class content standards and high performance standards.
 Assessments must focus on a student's ability to demonstrate and apply knowledge. A variety of assessment techniques is needed, because no one method can measure achievement.
 New standards and assessments should incorporate a multicultural perspective.
 All schools will be expected to form school councils, including the principal, teachers, parents and citizens. The councils will make budget decisions and hiring recommendations.
 The council and principal will make decisions on the curriculum and teaching methods.
 Local districts will determine the composition of school councils and have to remove principals at schools with patterns of failure.
 Every five years teachers should provide a dossier demonstrating their efforts to help their students.
 Tenure will be granted after the fourth year of teaching in a district, rather than the third.
 Teachers should be held accountable for their students meeting performance standards. (pg. 27)

HEADLINE: Financial Climate Warms for States

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Forty-five states say they are fiscally sound this year, nearly twice the number that could make such a claim a year ago, according to a survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Moreover, few states say they are likely to raise taxes or employ accounting gimmicks to balance their books this year, reflecting the slow but steady growth in the national economy as well as the ability of states to learn to live within their means. 
 The conclusions of the survey, made public on Thursday, show a reversal of a trend that began in the 1990 fiscal year, when the recession began battering state budgets and most states collected less revenue than anticipated and had to spend more money than they had budgeted. The combination led to huge tax increases and extensive reductions in service.
"It's a dramatic change in the number of states that have turned the corner," said Ronald K. Snell, the fiscal director of the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Denver-based organization that advises states. "States are adjusting to a very unexciting economy."
 
Matching the Forecasts
 The survey of legislative budget analysts, which the conference conducts annually in December, found that most states were collecting and spending tax money in accordance with budget forecasts that they made last spring.
Of the 50 states, only Alaska, Hawaii, Kentucky, New Jersey and Rhode Island reported lower-than-expected tax collections in the first half of the fiscal year.
Still, some states -- most prominent among them California, Maine and Vermont -- have yet to emerge from the recession. California has not recovered from the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-tech and defense-related jobs, and northern New England still suffers from a depression in the real estate and construction industries.
Tax revenue in 45 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia were coming in at or above anticipated levels between July and early December, the survey found. Expenditures for programs were also on target in most states, and officials in 23 states said they had resources to cover overruns in one or more programs.
 
'Solid Fiscal Condition'
 "Forty-five states are in solid fiscal condition this year, up from only 25 a year ago," Mr. Snell said.
State finances are improving so much, he added, that officials are again focusing their attention on underfinanced social programs, which dropped in priority after the recession took hold in 1989.
When asked to list their most serious problems in terms of financing, nearly half of the state officials mentioned social programs like welfare and mental health care.
Growth in consumer confidence, personal income and spending made the strongest showing in Arizona, where sales tax receipts were up 7 percent and income taxes were up 8 percent. States in the Rocky Mountains and Plains generally had the strongest growth in tax revenues. The Northeast continued to have more fiscal problems than other regions.
Alaska still finds itself in trouble because 85 percent of its tax revenue comes from the oil industry, and the average price of Alaskan oil fell to $10.95 this month from $17.50 a barrel last June, said Darrel Rexwinkle, the State Commissioner of Revenue. That slide is expected to create a $500 million shortage in the state's $3 billion general fund budget. But, Mr. Rexwinkle said, the blow will be cushioned by more than $1 billion in reserve money.
 
Bad News for New Jersey
 In December, when the survey was taken, New Jersey's tax collections were running 2 percent below revenue projections, or about $70 million, said Alan R. Kooney, the legislative budget and finance officer in the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. If the economy does not pick up, Gov.-elect Christine Todd Whitman and the Legislature will face a $250 million shortage in this year's $12 billion general fund budget. The state is already trying to cope with an anticipated shortage of more than $1 billion next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
New York, by comparison, expects revenue to continue exceeding projections and expenditures to be less than budgeted. Such a turn of events has not occurred in many years, said Paul C. Reuss, secretary of the state Legislature's Senate Finance Committee. The state anticipates a $500 million surplus on its $31 billion general fund budget this fiscal year, which ends March 31 in New York, Mr. Reuss said.
Connecticut must still rely on at least $30 million in reserve money to get through this year, even though state tax collections have been coming in slightly stronger than expected, said Robert D. Harris, the assistant director of the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis for the Legislature. "At least things are going in the right direction," he said.
California's revenue is on target, but officials there say the figures are misleading because unemployment continues to rise, foreshadowing sharp declines in income tax and business tax revenue later this year. In November, unemployment in the state was 8.6 percent. As a result, the state Commission on State Finance estimates that there will be a $1 billion shortfall in this year's $39.6 billion general fund budget and a $1.3 billion shortfall to be dealt with in the budget for next fiscal year. The commission, a part of the state Treasurer's Office, was itself recently disbanded to save money.

HEADLINE: Mayor Given Array of Ideas On Privatizing

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
A transition committee on privatization has recommended to the Giuliani administration that New York City sell WNYC, the city-owned television and radio stations, and contract out a vast array of municipal services, including garbage pickup, bus routes, street-sign maintenance, solid-waste disposal and parking-meter collections.
The committee has also suggested that the city could try to lease or sell the East River bridges in return for the right to levy tolls, although it acknowledged that the political opposition could be enormous, according to committee members and officials familiar with the report. 
 The committee, headed by Arthur Fefferman, the president of AFC Realty Capital Inc., is one of about 40 panels created by Rudolph W. Giuliani before he became Mayor to scrutinize the municipal government and make recommendations for change. The committee also recommended the sale of the Offtrack Betting Corporation, a move that the Dinkins administration had already been pursuing. The committee estimated that its recommendations could save more than $500 million a year.
 
Keeping 'an Open Mind'
 Senior aides to Mr. Giuliani said that they had not yet considered the recommendations and that they did not represent policy decisions. In fact, Mr. Giuliani, who made streamlining government a centerpiece of his campaign, suggested this week that it could be two to three months before he finished reviewing proposals for allowing private companies to bid for services now carried out by municipal employees.
"It's going to take a while for all of them to be examined, and you have got to keep an open mind about them," he said.
The report includes a menu of options for the new Mayor, including numerous proposals that have been examined and rejected in previous administrations. Mr. Fefferman expressed optimism that Mr. Giuliani would move forward with the ideas put forth by the group.
"It works if a lot of the impetus comes from the Mayor's office," he said. "Mayor Dinkins was not a strong advocate of privatization." Mr. Fefferman said his group had called for Mr. Giuliani to appoint an advisory committee on privatization "to be somewhat of an advocate and watchdog."
With the city facing a budget gap of as much as $2.3 billion next year, the report suggests such money-saving options as one-time sales of assets as well as reduced operating costs through competition between government agencies and private companies.
In the area of competitive contracting, some committee members said their most innovative idea was to take bus routes now run by private bus lines, longtime monopolies, in Queens and parts of Brooklyn and the Bronx and open them to competitive bidding both by other bus companies and by the city's Transit Authority.
 
Easing Unions' Fears
 They said the move could ease the fears of municipal unions over Mr. Giuliani's privatization efforts because it raised the possibility of providing more government jobs.
"It's very attractive and would show the Mayor's openness," said E. S. Savas, a professor of management at Baruch College who served on the committee. "It's not anti-public sector by any means. You could argue he's introducing discipline into the private sector."
The municipal unions have been leery of proposals to contract out services because of questions of job security for their members, and because some private companies can bid at lower cost because they save money through lower pay scales and benefits.
The seven private bus lines -- four of which run in Queens -- are the only private companies in the country that provide traditonal bus service on local streets, city officials say. The companies operate like the Transit Authority's buses, holding franchises on their routes and charging the same fares.
There is an incentive to save money: Since 1974 the city has been subsidizing the lines, at first almost entirely with Federal funds, but increasingly with the city's own money. The subsidies now amount to almost $100 million, half in city operating funds and half in state and Federal funds.
The subsidies have generally been arranged to cover the companies' expenses and guarantee a 3 percent profit. The city owns the companies' buses.
Under the new City Charter, the franchises are supposed to be put up for competitive bidding over the next five years, but city officials say the Transportation Department's efforts to draw up specifications have been bogged down in negotiations with the City Council.
 
Shulman Is Cautious
 Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, expressed caution about the proposal, noting that many riders in her borough depend on the lines. She said many private bus lines want to provide more lucrative express service but not local bus service. While she said she was not opposed to competitive bidding, she said the move would raise "complicated issues" and she would want to insure that the same level of service could be maintained.
Labor concerns could also be a sticking point, officials said. "You have a union issue when anybody starts bidding on anything," said Joseph Strasburg, the chief of staff to Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, also of Queens. "Unless there was some level of job security, it would probably be a very difficult fight."
In a related recommendation, the committee said that Transit Authority bus routes should be opened up to private competition, with van services allowed to bid as well as bus companies.
Committee members said they recommended the sale of WNYC, which is made up of a television station and an AM and a FM radio station, arguing that no other city owns such stations and that there is no need for them because of the variety of broadcast outlets in New York. The committee estimated that the sale of the assets and licenses could bring $45 million.
Similar proposals to sell WNYC during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's died because of public and political opposition. WNYC-FM is one of two classical-music stations left in the city, and with WNYC-AM is an outlet for National Public Radio.
 
No Decision on WNYC
 "No decision has been made so far as I know about WNYC," said Thomas B. Morgan, president of the WNYC Communications Group. "Our status remains as it has always been."
In other areas, the committee said that private companies should be solicited to collect coins from some of the city's 60,000 parking meters, that municipal parking garages should be leased to private operators and that a pilot program should be tried in one borough to privatize pothole repairs.
The committee also said the city should consider entering into contracts to use landfills outside New York. "The market for landfill space has dropped dramatically and prices are weak," Mr. Savas said. "It's a good opportunity for the city to enter into contracts with landfills outside the city at much lower cost than building and operating incinerators."

HEADLINE: Safeguards Already in Pension System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Daniel F. McGinn's call for "second opinions" for actuaries pressured into unreasonable assumptions by companies eager to reduce pension contributions ("To Guard Pensions, Shield Actuaries," Viewpoints, Dec. 26) ignores the many safeguards still in the system. Actuarial mathematics has developed financing methods that adjust for bad assumptions. The Internal Revenue Service even provides a range of interest rates for what it calls "current liability" calculations. 
 Second opinions are a false hope. If a company wants to maintain artificially low contribution rates and can afford to pay one actuary to compromise his or her principles, it can certainly pay a second, in lieu of properly financing the plan.

HEADLINE: Mr. Cuomo Asks for Another Go

 BODY:
What we are seeing in Gov. Mario Cuomo's decision to seek a fourth term is a deliberate downsizing. The unaccustomed modesty of his announcement -- almost too late for Friday's 6 o'clock news -- matched the modesty of the program he set before the Legislature in Albany earlier in the week. A man known for soaring rhetoric now speaks only of his gritty determination to see New York through a clinging recession.
Unspoken, of course, is his hope to end his political career with a broader range of achievements than he could possibly have claimed had he chosen to retire next January. 
 The rap on Mr. Cuomo is that he does not deliver. A man of intelligence and compassion, he was twice a plausible possibility for the Democratic Presidential nomination. On issues of great principle, like abortion and the death penalty, he has stood his ground. Yet what people remark upon when they speak of Mr. Cuomo's 12 years in Albany is a maddening gap between oratory and substance, between poetry and accomplishment.
Is this fair? He says no. He points to, among other things, a doubling of state aid to schools, a rise in spending on infrastructure, a timely easing of New York's oppressive income tax burden in the 1980's and the passage of the state's first government ethics law. When asked why more ambitious projects never bore real fruit -- the "Decade of the Child" comes to mind -- he points to budgetary constraints imposed by the recession and political constraints imposed by a supremely unimaginative, Republican-dominated State Senate.
Yet on many matters of consequence he has been reluctant to spend his political capital. He doomed his own environmental bond act by refusing to fight for it. He has not delivered on his pledges to reform Medicaid or the state's balkanized school system. Even in good times, he resorted to dubious fiscal gimmicks -- plundering the state pension fund, for example -- that produced a balanced budget but also helped earn his state one of the lowest credit ratings in the nation.
So here he comes again -- low key this time, with a low-risk agenda of welfare reform, tax relief for business and crime control that the Republicans cannot in good conscience oppose. But there is no underestimating the political risk of running, despite the Republicans' unerring instinct for choosing inept opponents. His approval rating is a ghastly 34 percent; unless he can make a solid case that this time he'll match performance to promise, it is not beyond imagining that a once-incandescent political career could end with an ignominious fizzle.

HEADLINE: Include Russia, Too

 BODY:
The strong showing by right-wing nationalists in Russia's recent elections has intensified Eastern Europeans' fears of a resurgent Russia and increased their desire to ally with NATO. Such an alliance would commit the U.S. to their defense. But as Bosnia showed, neither the U.S. nor its allies seem eager to assume such commitments.
Moreover, the military threat that frightens Eastern Europe is, at worst, years away. One way to keep that threat from ever becoming a reality is to begin treating both Russia and the Eastern Europeans as partners -- cultivating habits of military cooperation throughout the region. 
 For starters, NATO could help Russia's reform-minded politicians shrink and reorganize Russia's armed forces, keeping the military engaged in professional tasks and out of politics. Russia would have to begin behaving like an ally by bringing its interests into closer harmony with NATO's -- curbing weapons proliferation, for example, and participating in peacekeeping operations.
And if NATO opens its doors to new members, Russia should be in line along with Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. The prospect of NATO membership could encourage the Russian Army to become a force for peace; that alone would justify reshaping an anti-Russian alliance into an altogether different security structure.
The U.S. Army needed at least 10 years to recover from the Vietnam War. The Russian remnant of the Red Army has endured greater trauma, losing not only a war in Afghanistan but also an empire. Many of its finest officers left for another country, Ukraine. Its weapons are rusting away. And officers are returning home without housing or jobs. Little wonder that a third of the military voting in the election backed candidates who rabble-roused about restoring the empire.
Little wonder, too, that the people of Eastern Europe fret about a Russian military resurgence. But it would take years for Russia to build a fighting force anything like the Red Army, and many more years before the military-industrial complex could equip it with state-of-the-art weapons.
What should the West do in the meantime? Right now, it is mainly trying to move Russia's politics and economy in the right direction, without doing much about the military. Some urge an updated version of containment, inviting Eastern Europeans into NATO while leaving Russia in not-so-splendid isolation. Others would revive old spheres of influence, shifting Russia's toward Central Asia.
These policies would be prudent if Russia reverted to vengeful nationalism and began to revive its military. To adopt them now would only embolden the Zhirinovskys at the fringes of Russian politics. The better way is to begin treating Russia like a potential ally. That worked in Germany and Spain, where NATO membership helped tame militarism.
The Clinton Administration has already taken some astute steps in this direction. It has encouraged more military-to-military contacts. And it has joined Russia in cutting nuclear forces and taking the remainder off hair-trigger alert.
But cooperation must embrace non-nuclear forces. A U.S.-Russian study group, including John Galvin and Edward Meyer, two retired generals, Fred Ikle and Paul Wolfowitz, Pentagon officials in the Reagan years, offers useful suggestions.
The group recommends a joint military planning staff to deal with issues of common concern, like proliferation. It proposes joint peacekeeping missions. It would increase aid to relocate the Russian forces that are leaving the Baltic republics. It urges shared understandings about the operating practices of U.S. stealth aircraft and other forces that Russia sees as threatening. And it would separate the U.S. and Russian Navies, which have a nasty habit of bumping into each other.
In like manner, NATO should also encourage Eastern Europe's armed forces to cooperate with NATO, Russia and -- not least -- one another, through joint exercises and peacekeeping. And it can cultivate civilian control and other democratic practices in Eastern Europe's armies.
But in the end, Eastern Europeans won't rest easy until the Russian Army is transformed through an active partnership with its onetime enemies. It will not be easy for either side to abandon the hostile reflexes of 50 years and nurture a new, inclusive spirit of cooperation. But that needs to be done, starting at this week's summit meetings.

The Silver Lining

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
On his Inauguration Day as the new Mayor's Best Showbiz Friend, Ron Silver failed to give Rudolph Giuliani the most essential advice a professional actor can bequeath to an amateur: Never share a stage with a child or a dog.
This was not the first time Mr. Sil ver was missing in action while the Mayor floundered in artistic affairs. Earlier, the new Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, John Dyson, had stepped into a front-page embarrassment by waving a budgetary hatchet at New York City's already starving smaller arts organizations. 
 Mr. Silver, in case you missed act one, had been a controversial player in the mayoral campaign. A liberal Democrat, he bolted to the opposition, endorsing Mr. Giuliani in commercials that cast the actor as a kinder, gentler incarnation of the character Jackie Mason played so disastrously during the '89 Dinkins-Giuliani race. The mission was to achieve a reversal of his candidate's fortunes with Jewish voters.
Now that his man has won and his Streisandesque showboating moment as inaugural master of revels is over, is Mr. Silver shedding his political role? Yes, he told me late last week while dexterously distancing himself from the Dyson flap. Having helped screen candidates for the soon-to-be-filled job of Commissioner of Cultural Affairs, he intends to return to his careers as actor, director and president of the union Actors' Equity. Mr. Silver subscribes to the pragmatic Giuliani brand of arts boosterism -- "Rudy sees the arts as a serious economic player in the city" -- but he plans to schmooze his friend on this and other subjects informally rather than take on any official duties.
If the new Mayor really believed what he said about the arts in his inaugural address -- "they are important industries that will and must grow to create more jobs for us" -- he shouldn't let Mr. Silver slip away so fast. A collapse in one of those industries could happen on the new Mayor's watch, and Mr. Silver, who has credibility with both the new administration and the fractious constituencies within show business, may be the only New Yorker who can play Lee Iacocca.
The industry in trouble is, of course, the Broadway theater. Even as Mr. Giuliani was being sworn in over New Year's, Variety reported that Broadway ticket prices, which have already driven away countless theatergoers, would rise to a $75 top by fall. While holiday tourists may have thought that every marquee on the central theatrical block of 45th Street was aglow, a closer examination revealed that most of the marquees were dummies, installed temporarily for the filming of a television commercial.
Costs are sky high, scaring away investors as well as ticket buyers. New productions, except of musical revivals, are more rumor than reality. New pledges of state loans to renovate often-empty Broadway theaters are mere Band-Aids.
And yet when Mr. Giuliani talks about the arts as an economic engine for the city, the theater is essential to his vision. In the recent Port Authority report that credited the arts for a $9.2 billion contribution to the New York City economy, $900 million of that figure was attributed to the commercial theater.
The economic woes of the theater industry are not the fault of the majority of its artists, many of whom are sustained by the small institutional companies Off Broadway frightened by Mr. Dyson. The commercial theater's troubles are of its own making, through its Stone Age business practices. There's plenty of blame for everyone, from the theater owners who have preserved the rusty status quo for decades to often intransigent unions like Mr. Silver's, which even he concedes is a "19th-century mechanism trying to drag itself into the 20th century before the 21st century hits."
A crash civic effort at resuscitation is desperately needed. Mr. Silver would be perfectly cast as Broadway's savior: the canny head of a crisis task force that would knock theatrical management and labor heads together to rethink Broadway economics and insure the industry's survival. Mr. Giuliani could go down in history as the best friend the theater has found in City Hall since the last Republican Mayor, John Lindsay. And Andrew Giuliani, the town's newest performing hopeful, could rest assured there will still be a Broadway to welcome him when he is old enough to star in a revival of "The Most Happy Fella."

HEADLINE: Russian Entrepreneurs Aren't All Gangsters;
Skip the Robber Barons

 BODY:
To the Editor:
in "What's Good for the Mafia Is Good for Russia" (Op- Ed, Dec. 26), Michael Scammell compares the situation in Russia to the "robber baron days" in the United States, justifying this as a necessary stage in the emergence of a market economy. 
 There is an essential difference, however. A century ago, when capitalism was in its "wild" form all over the world, newborn American millionaires (of both good and questionable intent) could find no better place to invest their money than back in the American economy.
Now, newly rich Russians (who, I agree, get their wealth mostly by bribing government officials and selling natural resources for ultralow prices abroad) realize that it is more secure to invest their new-found capital outside unpredictable and turbulent Russia. As a result, both money and resources drain from Russia like water from a sieve.
Capitalism cannot develop from scratch in Russia, just as new life cannot emerge on earth: It would be immediately consumed by better-equipped life forms.
Russia does not need to wait 100 to 200 years to develop a civilized market. The economies of countries such as South Korea and Hong Kong indicate that it is possible to do this much faster, skipping the robber baron phase.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
When O'Neill Was Young, And City Hall Was Irish

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
THE death of Tip O'Neill on Wednesday, only seven weeks after the inauguration of the first non-Irish mayor elected in Boston since 1917, is more than a milepost in the nation's gaudy urban history that spans the Curleys and the Kennedys and the Daleys.
It is that, of course. Today, the only big cities with Irish-American mayors are Chicago and Los Angeles, and Los Angeles hardly counts, for Richard J. Riordan is a Republican. But if the Irish are not what they once were to the cities, the teeming cities themselves are not what they once were to the nation. They have less clout generally, and especially in Thomas P. O'Neill's House of Representatives. The leading Irish-American holds a big job, of course, but Speaker Thomas S. Foley represents Spokane, an airy city of 185,000. 
 The Irish are hardly gone from the political stage, especially here. Seven of the 13 City Council members are Irish, though only one of the seven school committee members is. And the Congressional delegation is heavy with them, too, from Ted Kennedy on through Joe Moakley and Joe Kennedy, who holds Mr. O'Neill's old seat in the House. There is another Kennedy on the way, the Senator's son Patrick, who is running for the House just over the border in almost Massachusetts, locally called Rhode Island.
Just as Thomas C. Mennino's election marked a start for the Italian-Americans who never made it to Boston City Hall, so too did it mark the end of a remarkable 71 consecutive years of Irish mayors, long after an Irish mayor was the norm in cities like New York and Philadelphia or Baltimore.
The change is at one level a simple function of demographics. No American city is as Irish as it once was. And their new immigrants, as Mr. Mennino's own Hyde Park neighborhood reflects, come most heavily from the Caribbean, Latin America and Asia.
But it is not just a matter of one sort of ethnic politics replacing another, as the Boston Irish wrested power from the Yankees, and as Italian-Americans pushed the Irish aside in Providence. The New Deal, welfare and pervasive civil service have removed, or at least lessened, all those boons that city machines once used to earn the allegiance of immigrants.
Mr. Mennino, like Rudy Giuliani in New York, hardly ran as an Italian-American politician representing one particular contingent of immigrants and their descendants. For that matter, Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago just moved out of the ancestral Irish neighborhood of Bridgeport, and he owes his success in his father's footsteps largely to an inclusive style.
But while Tip O'Neill was not the sort of candidate who ran against some other clan -- indeed, he was closer to no one in the House than to Silvio Conte, a Republican from Western Massachusetts who died in 1991 -- he did stand for the Irish who had had a tough time. He didn't hark back to the potato famine, as some did, but the memory of scraping through college in the Depression never left him.
Mr. O'Neill's death, after 14 years in the State Legislature, 36 years in the House and 7 years in retirement, is a marker for a change perhaps even more profound in American politics -- a change in its spirit.
It would be foolish to characterize him as typical of Irish politicians. Many of his colleagues were as likely to be haters as politicians from any other heritage. And as Jack Beatty, author of the definitive James Michael Curley biography, "The Rascal King," observed last week, "He marks an exception to the Boston rule, that Boston politics was all about revenge."
It was not just that he could be jolly, though his funny stories, often on himself, are legendary. He was also a very tough politician. He told an interviewer from the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in 1976 about a lesson from his early days in the Legislature, when "you tread on the toes of the other fellow."
"If the Republican leader's wife died and a delegation of Republicans were going to the wife's funeral, that was the day the Democrats put through their program," he recalled. And he could play hardball with Presidents of his own party, too, protecting the Boston Navy Yard by threatening to miss key votes on their bills in the Rules Committee.
But if the politics of his day could be tough, tougher in practice than most legislative politics today, there was hardly ever anything personal about it. He thought of Ronald Reagan as an amiable, deeply inattentive and ignorant leader whose politics were mean in their impact on people like those he grew up with in Cambridge. But he didn't personalize it, and got Mr. Reagan to appear at a jolly evening in Washington that raised $2 million for his alma mater, Boston College, in 1986.
He could turn away wrath. Once, when Bernard Cardinal Law was complaining that Mr. O'Neill wasn't helping the church on the abortion issue, he asked the Cardinal if his eminence knew how many bishops lived in his district. As the Cardinal calculated, the Speaker supplied the answer: three. How many schools? Again, three. How many parishes? Eight hundred and fifty. How many nuns? Six thousand.
Now, he asked the Cardinal, if the church, with all those resources couldn't persuade his very Catholic district, whose people opposed prohibitions on abortion by a 2-to-1 majority, what could a Speaker do?
One more thing. The politics of Tip's time was not only less personal, it was also less pretentious. When he used his influence to help Cambridge and Somerville and the other neighborhoods he inherited from John F. Kennedy, or to get the money for a harbor tunnel to the airport that the Yankee Governor, Bill Weld, now wants to name for the baseball hero Ted Williams, he was proud of it.
Tip's successors, harassed by public interest organizations, and other reformist mouthpieces, might think it necessary to defend such a tunnel with experts describing potential reductions in air pollution, or the importance to the economy of the whole Eastern seaboard of better access to the airport. Not the politician who never tired of explaining his watchword: "All politics is local."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLATBUSH;
Raucous Board Finds Peace

BYLINE: By Lynette Holloway 

 BODY:
Once paralyzed by protests so bitter that its meetings turned into free-for-alls requiring a heavy police presence, Community Board 14 has been conducting its business in relative peace for the past four months.
The board was the target of a three-year campaign by the African People's Political Club of Flatbush to increase the number of blacks on the largely white board and increase services in heavily minority areas. Backed by the community organizer Sonny Carson and the lawyer Colin Moore, the protesters, some of whom were involved in the volatile boycott of a Korean grocery on Church Avenue, disrupted meetings with threats and anti-Semitic remarks. 
 The conflict reached a critical point at a chaotic meeting in January 1992 when protesters pushed a table that crushed the left foot of Community Board Manager Terry Rodie, aggravating an injury she had received at a different board meeting a year earlier. That incident sparked a three-day closing of the board's offices, as its employees sought psychological counseling from counselors provided by City Hall. Former Mayor David N. Dinkins said he would try to end the bitterness.
The protesters won't say exactly why they cooled their tactics. Their move comes as the board has been experiencing change.
Representation of blacks, who make up 40 percent of the district, has increased from 3 to a dozen on the 50-member board, a result of the election in recent years of two local black councilmen who are among those who make appointments to the board. The board itself is also reaching out more to members of minority groups, rotating its monthly meetings throughout the district.
"I still see Flatbush as being just like South Africa and that the board operates under a racist and apartheid system," said Ernest N. Foster, a leader of the protesters who ran unsuccessfully for City Council last fall. "We had to find a way to make our voices heard because African people have never received anything any other way."
But, he said, maybe the group's fashion of protesting had run its course.
The board's chairman, Alvin M. Berk, who is white, accused Mr. Foster's group of never making a substantive contribution to board business.
"They've never sat down with us in a constructive manner," Mr. Berk said. "We are a multiracial, economically diverse and geographically distributed board that does not need this kind of negative attention."
Mr. Berk said that since the protests faded, members have been concentrating on ways to maintain and improve services throughout the district, which includes Flatbush and Midwood, in spite of the city's tight budget.
A heavy police presence still exists at the board's meetings. At least one board member is looking forward to the day when the police will no longer be required, saying the officers' presence is a symbol of the board's stormy past.
"I look forward to the day when we will have a few friendly cops around who are there observing the meeting on their own," said Edward Powell, one of the black members on the board. Asked about the protests, Mr. Powell said: "There is a need for constructive criticism, but there are different ways to approach it. One way is to pursue it in concert rather than in conflict."

Pizazz at Rockefeller Center, And It's Not the Rockettes
After struggling for years with the image of its retail space as a place to buy T-shirts and souvenir mugs, Rockefeller Center is adding some sizzle. The latest example is Television City, a restaurant venture by David Liederman, the founder of David's Cookies. 
 The restaurant will celebrate the world of television much as the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood combine their themes with cuisine. There will be "Flintstones" and "Gunsmoke" nights and interactive television devices on each table.
Television City, which is to replace Lindy's restaurant and the Fanny Farmer store on the southeast corner of 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas in the fall, follows a plan drawn up 10 years ago to add pizazz to the 18-building complex. Mainstay businesses like banks are being replaced by tenants like Dean & DeLuca, which moved in last year, and the upscale Wall Street Deli, which has leased space.
 
Manhattan Leads in List Of Fastest-Growing Companies
Of the 50 companies that made the Crain's New York Business list of the fastest-growing businesses in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area, about half are in Manhattan. Only two are in the other boroughs.
The list reflects the city's economy, experts say, since high-growth service businesses tend to be based in Manhattan, while manufacturing and distribution companies are outside.
"Regionally, manufacturing has been declining over the years, which is why it's nice to see these businesses on the list," said Catie Marshall, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation. "We would like to see more, obviously, but manufacturing just hasn't been growing."
In Long Island City, Queens, the Recoton Corporation, which makes consumer electronics accessories, has more than doubled its annual revenues since 1991, to $120 million in 1993. In Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Esquire Radio and Electronics has annual revenues of $102 million and an average growth rate of 31 percent.
 
Harlem Is City's Pick As Federal 'Empowerment Zone'
In one of his last acts as Mayor, David N. Dinkins selected Harlem as the city's nominee for a new Federal program to help economically distressed areas.
In six cities around the nation, the program is to create "empowerment zones" where businesses will receive a total of $3.5 billion in tax credits and other subsidies over five years. It is the Clinton Administration's answer to the enterprise zones of the 1980's.
Under empowerment zones, businesses hiring residents will receive a break on employer-paid payroll taxes, and the Government will spend more within the zones on social services. Critics say such zones don't work, partly because businesses are suspicious of moving into high-crime areas.

Teaching An Old Mall New Tricks

BYLINE: By Bruce Lambert 

 BODY:
One store at a time, the expanded and renovated Bay Terrace shopping center has been emerging from a cocoon of construction work. The old-style commercial strip on northern Bell Boulevard at 26th Avenue has been under reconstruction for 18 months and now, with the project just a few weeks behind schedule, resembles the modern, upscale suburban malls that flourish across the Nassau County line.
The 45-store complex added about 100,000 square feet of retail space, bringing its total to 289,000 square feet. The project also spruced up the site with landscaping, improved lighting, more parking (for 1,533 cars) and new brickfacing that unifies the exterior. 
 Several major new businesses opened in the last two months, in time for holiday shopping: a Barnes & Noble "superstore," a Gap, a six-screen Loews movie theater, J. Skyler clothing, Foot Locker, Alicia's Golden Dream jewelers and Cohen's Fashion Optical.
The Parade of Shoes store opens this weekend. Ben's Kosher Deli and a relocated Bayside Federal Bank office are to open in the next few days. Joy Island restaurant and Boston Chicken are coming in March. Mr. Mollen said the Limited was negotiating for space, which would leave only 5,000 square feet vacant.
The work cost the owners, Cord Meyer Development Company, more than $20 million, and the commercial tenants made additional investments. The project was done piecemeal to minimize disruption to existing businesses.
Completion is expected this month, said Scott E. Mollen, a lawyer and spokesman for Cord Meyer. The remaining phase is the demolition of an obsolete section of the old building. Cord Meyer, a local firm that dates to 1899, built the first stores on the site, once a farm, 36 years ago.
New Yorkers are often wary of commercial developments, and some of the mall's neighbors expressed concerns about the project. But Community Board 7 endorsed the plan by a vote of 41 to 2 and says it has no regrets. "The high-quality shopping and terrific selection" are drawing big crowds, said the board's manager, Regina Colletta.
"The skeptics will have a change of heart now that they see it's really a credit to the community," Ms. Colletta predicted, "a welcome addition."

Air Fare Reductions In Honor of D-Day

 BODY:
To mark the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy in 1944, British Airways and Air France are offering fare reductions for those likely to remember the historic day. Both airlines' fares are available from now until the end of 1994.
Air France offers a 30 percent reduction on round trips on all fares except those lower than regular advance purchase rates. On the D-Day offer, as an example, an unrestricted advance-purchase round-trip economy ticket in January from New York to Paris would cost $540 without airport taxes. The reduction is available to World War II veterans and up to three family members, including grandchildren. Documentation of the veteran's status is required. The fare is available from the nine United States cities that Air France serves. For information: (800) 237-2747. 
 British Airways is offering its 30 percent reduction on round trips to France through Britain -- no stopovers -- to all travelers over 60 years old and one companion of any age. The discount applies to seven-day and 14-day advance purchase tickets leaving from 17 United States cities. British Airways flies to seven cities in France from Heathrow and Gatwick in London and Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Manchester, Newcastle and Jersey. As an example, a 14-day advance purchase unrestricted economy round-trip from New York to Paris via London on a midweek day in January on this offer would come to $334.60 without airport taxes. For information: (800) 247-9297.

HEADLINE: The Drug Makers Are Listening to Prozac

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
FOR six years the antidepressant drug Prozac has been lifting the spirits of millions of Americans and thousands of Eli Lilly shareholders.
Sales of the drug reached a record $1.2 billion worldwide last year, helped by word of mouth and the best seller "Listening to Prozac," in which a psychiatrist describes the drug as making his patients more calm, confident and cheerful. And some industry executives see a far larger market as more doctors prescribe the feel-better products even for problems that are not clinical depression, to patients from college students to nursing-home residents 
 But Americans may soon be listening to a lot more than Prozac. Two newer antidepressants, one from Pfizer Inc. and one from SmithKline Beecham, P.L.C., are already challenging Prozac in the $3 billion market for antidepressants. Two weeks ago the Food and Drug Administration approved a third entry, from the American Home Products Corporation.
Analysts expect the Government to approve a Bristol-Myers Squibb drug early this year. At least three others are already being sold abroad, by Roche Holding of Switzerland, Synthelabo S.A. of France and Solvay S.A. of Belgium. The Solvay drug is also awaiting F.D.A. approval, and would be co-marketed by the Upjohn Company.
Seven more competitors are in the late stages of research, and at least 15 others are farther behind them in the pipeline.
Analysts say the late arrivals will have to fight for relatively small segments of the market, so investors do not expect much, if any, stock market reaction when they are approved in the United States. As for the companies with products already on the market, profits from antidepression drugs are especially important to Eli Lilly & Company and SmithKline Beecham. Both face difficult days with the expiration of patent protection on lucrative drugs -- the Ceclor antibiotic in the case of Lilly and the Tagamet ulcer treatment in the case of SmithKline. But at Pfizer, the antidepressant Zoloft is just one more winner in a slew of new drugs.
There are plenty of potential patients for the drugs. At least 11 million Americans have a bout of depression every year, and only about 30 percent currently get the medication that could help them, according to Government and industry estimates. Many millions more whose symptoms don't amount to clinical depression might also look to such drugs. That's a sobering thought for Americans concerned that so many people would be reliant on drugs. But it's also troubling for health-policy makers, because an explosion in demand could overwhelm any savings wrought by health plans driving a hard bargain with drug companies. On the other hand, if the drugs head off illnesses that lead to higher mental-health bills and lost productivity, the nation might come out ahead financially.
Prozac, meanwhile, seems to be holding its own. The drug has been prescribed for more than six million people in the United States since it was introduced in 1988. New prescriptions in this country increased 15.7 percent in the year ending Nov. 30. The gain followed two years of low or negative growth while Lilly fought lawsuits attacking the drug on grounds that have not been proven but that encouraged some patients to try the competition.
ALTHOUGH Lilly still faces more than 160 suits contending that Prozac was responsible for violent behavior or suicides, judges have dismissed 78, and there have been no cash settlements, said Edward A. West, a company spokesman.
Prozac, which enhances the action of serotonin, a chemical transmitter of messages between nerve cells in the brain, had the field nearly to itself for four years, until early 1992, when Pfizer introduced Zoloft, a similar drug. Zoloft's 1993 sales were $460 million worldwide.
Last March, SmithKline Beecham jumped into the market for this family of antidepressant drugs. The company introduced Paxil, which quickly racked up $225 million in sales around the world. The latest entry to be approved by the F.D.A., Effexor, from the Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary of the American Home Products Corporation, will be introduced in the spring.
Effexor works on a second brain transmitter, norepinephrine, as well as serotonin. Wyeth-Ayerst said its drug was effective for some patients who had not been helped by Prozac and the other serotonin-related drugs.
One drug in the late stages of research, milnacipran, from the Swedish company Astra A.B., resembles Effexor and makes similar claims.
Analysts expect the F.D.A. to accept the recommendation of its advisory committee and approve Bristol-Myers Squibb's Serzone (known generically as nefazodone), probably early this year. The drug enhances the action of serotonin, as Prozac does, and also makes the nerve cells more receptive. Tests have indicated fewer sleep disturbances and sexual problems than with Prozac, and suggest that Serzone can take effect within a week.
Fluvoxamine, the Solvay drug to be co-marketed with Upjohn, is also awaiting F.D.A. action and is already on sale in 36 countries. It got a favorable advisory committee recommendation for obsessive compulsive disorder last October.
The drugs that zero in on serotonin avoid some unpleasant side effects that were common in earlier classes of antidepressants, known as tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The earlier drugs are also more toxic, which makes it far easier for depressed patients to commit suicide by taking an overdose.
But the older drugs have an enormous price advantage, selling for pennies now that their patents have expired, while Prozac and the others wholesale at $1.75 per pill and up. While the older drugs, which are produced by generic drug makers, are gradually losing market share, they still hold about 35 percent of the antidepressant market. Now some companies, including Roche and Synthelabo, have reduced the side effects of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
VIREN MEHTA, an analyst at Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research, projects that the entire market for antidepressants will double, to more than $6 billion, by 1998. And the number might be even higher if more people try the drugs for uses that are not now approved.
"People take Prozac for things other than clinical depression," said Henry Blissenbach, president of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a managed-care unit of the United Healthcare Corporation, the big health maintenance organization company. "They say, 'Doctor, I just don't feel very good.' And the doctor says, 'A lot of people I've given it to feel better.' "
Some health plans require physicians to get authorization before prescribing certain expensive drugs. But Mr. Blissenbach said that solution seemed impractical with Prozac because "our phone would be ringing all day long." Diversified Pharmaceutical asks pharmacists to make sure patients have been prescribed the drug for depression or obsessive compulsive disorders, he added.
Mr. Blissenbach said that unlike, say, high cholesterol levels, which show up in laboratory tests, the diagnosis of depression is often subjective. "What do you use as criteria?" he asked. He said drug makers and managed-care companies needed to conduct studies to determine the conditions for which the drugs are cost-effective. "Maybe an individual is not clinically depressed, but he or she still feels depressed and goes to the physician 15 times a year and misses 30 days of work," he said. "If the individual takes the drug and doesn't go to the physician and doesn't miss any work, the benefit to total health care cost would be there."
BUT Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer advocacy group in Washington, warned against "popping a pill instead of helping people to cope with underlying causes of depression such as a death in the family or separation from a loved one."
"I see this as a 1990's version of Valium," he said. "These drugs are being used in an overly broad fashion just as the tranquilizers were." After years of widespread use, Valium was found to be seriously addictive.
"These things are relatively new," said Dale Kramer, a pharmacy director for the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, the nation's largest health maintenance organization. "Sometimes it takes a number of years before the real bad stuff comes to light."
Cost-containment efforts by insurers and competition in the rapidly changing pharmaceutical business have held down the prices of most drugs. Prozac's average wholesale price is $2.09 per pill (the daily dose), Zoloft's is $1.88 and Paxil's $1.75, according to a December tabulation by the Medical Economics publishing group. But health networks that buy in volume can negotiate big discounts. For example, Kaiser buys pays as little as $1.15 per pill for the new serotonin-related drugs.
Patients without access to such discounts typically pay a retail price reflecting a pharmacy markup of 40 percent or more.
Many drug makers are sponsoring cost-benefit studies to help justify their prices. A recent study for the National Mental Health Association, a group supported by the drug industry, estimates that depression costs employers of $23.8 billion annually in reduced productivity and lost workdays.
An unpublished study for Pfizer says newer drugs like Zoloft, while more expensive than tricyclics, actually can save an insurer 10 to 15 percent over the tricyclics. One reason is that patients are more likely to stop taking tricyclics because of the side effects, leading to depressive episodes that are expensive to treat.

HEADLINE: Helping Hand for Potential Booksellers

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
DID you ever have dreams of opening a bookstore? Dreamer beware -- entering the retail bookstore business requires more than enthusiasm and a love of books.
There is the financial investment: adequate capital is critical. And as in the real estate industry, success very often depends on "location, location, location." Also important is the willingness to do a fair amount of physical labor. Such things as unpacking and shelving books, waiting on customers, gift wrapping, operating the cash register are all part of the bookseller's daily routine. 
 One of the most valuable sources for those who want to enter the world of book selling is the American Booksellers Association, a 92-year-old trade organization committed to protecting the well-being of book retailers and promoting the availability of books. The association, which has 8,000 members, moved to temporary headquarters in Tarrytown from Manhattan two years ago. Members include independents, specialty, franchise, college and university stores, chains and others with a special interest in book selling.
Bernard E. Rath, executive director of the association, said: "Judging from the number of provisional members we have -- 1,200 -- which are those who are serious about becoming retail booksellers but haven't yet opened stores, there are more people today who want to open bookstores than ever before."
Despite competition for the consumer's dollar from videos, movies and from nonbook outlets like mass merchandisers and supermarkets, Mr. Rath said that a recent survey conducted by the United States Commerce Department showed that sales in bookstores across the country increased at a faster rate than total retail sales. Last year, bookstore sales reached nearly $8 billion.
"Yet while the book-selling industry as a whole is experiencing record growth and fared far better than other types of retail outlets over the past few years," Mr. Rath said, "it appears that a larger than usual number of independent bookstores are for sale or are considering closing, as a result of competing against mass merchandisers, mall chain stores and price clubs."
 
Opportunities Are Still Available
 For example, such well-established bookstores as the 15-year-old Huntington's Book Store in Hartford, Odergard's in Minneapolis and Jocundry's Books of East Lansing, Mich., closed their doors in 1993, Mr. Rath said. "Competition from nearby superstores combined with a depressed economy is the situation in which more and more independents are finding themselves today," he said. "Jocundry's, for example, which carried 50,000 to 60,000 titles in its heyday and was well known for hosting a lot of community events, was planning expansion just two years ago. But when three mega-chains opened stores nearby, the effect was disastrous."
Although some areas are saturated with bookstores, Mr. Rath added that there are many areas that are not.
"There still are communities in need of good bookstores," he said. "There are locations in malls in which favorable leases and rentals can be found today. And those people who are well prepared for opening a bookstore can still thrive selling books and make a living."
More than 50 percent of all books sold by members of the association are fiction, and while recent studies on the extent of reading in the United States have been mixed, sales of children's books have nearly doubled in the past few years. Mr. Rath said that the large baby-boom generation, better educated than any previous one, appears to be buying books for its children in record numbers and that boomers themselves will continue to read in their retirement years.
 
Some Required Reading
 The 55-member staff at the association's headquarters is available to give prospective members guidance and help them solve problems that arise in opening a bookstore. "Prospective booksellers can learn what lies ahead by attending our national convention, which is held in late May-early June," Mr. Rath said. "It is the largest English-language book event in the world."
Abacus, the association's annual financial profile of member independent bookstores, is also required reading for anyone seriously considering opening a bookstore, Mr. Rath said. In it, the operations and financial data of 200 bookstores are analyzed in order to provide benchmarks and trends for those in the industry. Equally valuable is the association's Book Buyer's Handbook, available only to members. It lists most trade publishers and their pricing structures.
The next logical step in planning to open a bookstore might be to attend a prospective bookseller's school sponsored by the association. "They are intensive three-and-a-half-day seminars taught by successful booksellers in various locations throughout the country," Mr. Rath said.
 
School in the Carriage House
 Later this year the association will move to permanent quarters in Tarrytown. In a campus-like setting near the Tarrytown Conference Center will be a mansion, a library and an administration building. A booksellers' school will be conducted for prospective bookshop owners in Westchester.
"We are planning on running the school in the carriage house on the grounds," Mr. Rath said. "It will consist of four-day sessions, which will be limited to 70 students who will be put up at the Tarrytown Conference Center, which will be conveniently connected to the school by a pathway." The cost of the four-day session, including room and board, will be $700.
Mr. Rath, who is 44, was executive secretary of the Canadian Booksellers Association in Toronto, when he was recruited 10 years ago by the American Booksellers Association.
"It was a big move leaving Toronto in more ways than one," he recalled. "For one thing, the A.B.A. is 10 times as large as the Canadian Booksellers Association. In Canada, booksellers are more restricted by the government, since they operate without the advantage of a First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of the press. That First Amendment makes this work very exhilarating." The American Booksellers Association will present 400 books to the White House Library as a gift to the Administration from the booksellers, he said.
Mr. Rath, who lives with his family in the town of Cortlandt, said that although he is still a resident alien, he plans to become an American citizen.
"For one thing, I want to be able to vote in school board elections and have a voice in things. Our children love it here, and they think of themselves as Americans."

HEADLINE: A Midterm Assessment of Mayor Zaleski

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
IN this tough and gritty riverfront city, where a disgruntled populace has elected successive administrations in and out of office with increasing frequency in recent years, Mayor Terence M. Zaleski -- a lifelong Boy Scout and an admitted zealot when it comes to Yonkers -- says he is determined to succeed where others have failed. His stated goals: to resuscitate an ailing economy and revitalize the city's shabby image.
Half-way into his first four-year term of office, Mayor Zaleski, a Democrat, has won an equal share of disapprobation and loyal support for his work as the city's first chief executive in 50 years under a strong-mayor form of government. While supporters applaud their leader's tough stand on issues like corruption in government and fiscal responsibility, detractors say the Mayor has been autocratic and unable to build a consensus with critical power blocs in the city -- among them, the City Council, the Board of Education and local labor unions. 
 On a recent gray afternoon, the spectacled, fair-haired Mayor raised the blinds in his office onto a view of the cityscape of apartments and low-cost housing projects outside the window. As he did, the 40-year-old leader of this city of 188,000 pointed to the site where his family's cold-water flat once stood.
Mayor Zaleski grew up here, the son of a sugar-refinery worker and the grandson of Polish immigrants, and he went on to win a Boy Scouts of America Silver Beaver Award for meritorious service and to be named a Columbia University Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar for superior scholastic achievement. He was a high school science teacher, a lawyer and a State Assemblyman before winning the mayoralty in 1991, garnering 36 percent of the vote in a three-way race.
Slight of frame -- he is 5 feet 7 1/2 inches tall -- the Mayor still displays a Boy Scout earnestness, especially when discussing the future of the city under his administration. One of his supporters, Stephen F. Byrns, an architect and local community activist, described Mr. Zaleski as "a man who wants to fight the good fight, a squeaky-clean kind of guy and kind of nerdy, but in a good way."
The west side of Yonkers, where the Mayor spent his boyhood among white European immigrants, is inhabited today mostly by blacks and people of Hispanic background, many of whom are trying to raise themselves out of poverty like those who came before them. But of late, this section of the city is also where much of the drug traffic, gang wars and other crimes have occurred. Recently, two multiple shootings took place a half-mile apart from each other on successive nights -- one in a neighborhood store and the other in an elevator -- leaving three dead and five wounded.
Conscious of how mention of Yonkers conjures up visions of crime and surliness -- the latter mostly associated with the city's refusal for years to comply with a Federal housing-desegregation order -- Mayor Zalesksi maintained during the interview that his city, the fourth-largest in the state, was a safe one.
"This was an aberration for Yonkers," he said of the early December shootings. "Ours is a remarkably safe city."
He cited statistics to back his arguments -- figures from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which ranked Yonkers near the bottom of the list of 100 cities for murders and property crimes in 1991. The city was 93d for the number of murders per 1,000 residents and 96th for crimes like burglaries, robberies and car thefts per 1,000 residents.
"You see, there's a misperception about Yonkers," he said.
He went on to extol the virtues of the city and list his accomplishments.
"I laid off 70 workers when I took office," he said, adding that he had cut $9 million from the budget over two years. "I run a tight ship, because we have to bring our finances in line."
Mayor Zaleski also talked about the creation six months ago of a Police Professional Standards Panel, a complaint review board that is serving as a model for other cities in Westchester and the country.
 
'A Pattern of Corruption'
 And he spoke about his role in encouraging the state's Organized Crime Task Force to continue its investigation of corruption in Yonkers. The task force's efforts so far have resulted in the indictment of Michael Calvi, a former Planning Commissioner and Republican ward leader, on Federal and state charges of taking and soliciting almost $50,000 in bribes, allegedly as a reward for steering contracts for a jail-renovation project. Mr. Calvi's trial is pending.
"There's a pattern of corruption throughout the city," Mayor Zaleski said, also mentioning the alleged embezzlement of $500,000 by at least one employee of the city's Industrial Development Agency. An indictment is expected in that case.
Although the housing-desegregation issue is not yet fully resolved, the first phase of a Federal plan is almost complete, with 200 public-housing units built and a remaining 58 scheduled for completion this year. Under the long-range Federal plan, another 800 units of affordable housing are to be built in mixed-income, privately owned housing areas.
Marilyn Melkonian, who was recently appointed housing specialist master by Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said Mayor Zaleski was "cooperating and doing his best to carry out the city's agreement."
Nevertheless, an appeal of Judge Sand's decision to use a housing specialist rather than the Mayor and City Council to carry out the plan was filed by the city late last year.
 
Critics' Complaints
 Not all of his constituents agree with the Mayor's assessment of his administration, and some leaders in the city have not welcomed efforts to cut expenditures, root out what the Mayor calls "the worst types of old bossism, overreaching labor unions and corruption" and direct Yonkers along a new path.
One of the Mayor's detractors, former Mayor Angelo R. Martinelli, who served from 1974 to 1979 and from 1982 to 1987, called Mr. Zaleski dictatorial.
"Yonkers has become almost like a police state, the way Terry is going after and trying to discredit people," said Mr. Martinelli, a Republican who ran as an independent in the 1991 mayoral race.
Another critic, John D. Spencer, Republican majority leader of the City Council, criticized the Mayor's relationship with the legislative body.
"As an executive mayor, he has treated the City Council with disdain," said Mr. Spencer, who plans to run for mayor in 1995. "Mr. Zaleski lacks people skills, and that's the No. 1 reason that executives derail."
The Councilman criticized Mr. Zaleski for not consulting with the legislative body about important city matters and for boasting about budget reductions that resulted in cutbacks in some municipal services, like snow removal and leaf collection.
Representing the unions, Anthony Pagano, president of Local 628 of the International Firefighters Association, said, "I was a fan of the Mayor -- we were the only union to support his election -- but my views have changed."
Mr. Pagano, who is also chairman of United Unions for a Better and Safer Yonkers, a coalition of 10 locals, said the Mayor "has not sat down to listen to our problems." He added: "Nine out of 10 unions don't have contracts, and we don't believe that there isn't any money. There is."
The Mayor's relationship with the Board of Education has also not been a smooth one. Mr. Zaleski, who holds a master's degree in education, said there was "not enough excitement in the classrooms."
He has also questioned why the former Superintendent of Schools, Donald M. Batista, testified last year in Federal District Court in Manhattan -- in a lawsuit to get the state to pay for the second stage of a Federally mandated school-desegregation plan -- that minority students in the Yonkers school system continued to lag behind their white classmates. The Mayor said that Dr. Batista, in requesting more money for the education budget, reported to City Hall that all was well in the schools.
But Dr. Batista said the budget issues only represented "a red flag, the thing that got us going." He added: "The real issue was power. Mr. Zaleski went over that fine line and imposed his will on the Board of Education."
Dr. Batista resigned last fall and is now director of education for the Leake and Watts Children's Home in Yonkers. "That was the essence of the rub between us," Dr. Batista said. "He may appoint members of the board, but they are by law officers of the state. The board is not just another department of City Hall."
 
'Willing to Bite the Bullet'
 In contrast, supporters say Mayor Zaleski is the first responsible politician in many years to lead Yonkers.
Gail S. Shaffer, New York's Secretary of State and chairman of the State Emergency Financial Control Board, which oversees Yonkers finances, said: "A lot of Byzantine politics go on in Yonkers, and historically it has not had leadership that was willing to bite the bullet. I do think Mr. Zaleski is an improvement -- more receptive, more professional -- although we do not agree on everything."
Ms. Shaffer disagreed with Mr. Spencer, the City Council majority leader, on his criticism of the reduction of services under Mr. Zaleski. "We need more in the way of cost efficiencies, not less," she said.
On the issue of union contracts, Ms. Shaffer said the locals' demands have been unrealistic, considering the difficult finances of the city. During a November 1992 visit to Yonkers, Ms. Shaffer said she and two staff members were "roughed up" by union members after they were informed that their contracts were rejected, and $2,000 in damage was reported to a state-owned auto during the encounter.
 
'Tougher Than Any Other City'
 "It was a very black mark on the city," Ms. Shaffer said. "It reinforced the image of Yonkers that needs to be changed, and that's one of the things that Mayor Zaleski is trying to do."
Alfred B. Del Bello, who served as Mayor here from 1970 to 1974, agreed. "Historically it has always been pure politics in Yonkers," he said. "There's something in the water there that makes it tougher than any other city."
Mr. Del Bello said the Mayor "got a slow start, because of two things." He added, "He was bogged down in his efforts to root out corruption, and it has taken time for the new strong form of government to register in everyone's mind. But now we are going into the second half of his term, and we are starting to see some results."
On one issue, the 4.5-mile-long waterfront area, most critics and supporters have praise for Mayor Zaleski's efforts to restore the area -- although some are skeptical, saying similar waterfront plans have been promised before.
"This time it's different," the Mayor said. "It's too important to mess with, and it is as much mom and apple pie for the future of this city as anything else we're trying to do."
Of his plans for the city, the Mayor added: "I could talk for 10 hours straight. Being mayor is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a kid who grew up in the streets to try and change the direction of the city for generations to come."
Brushing aside his detractors' criticisms, he said, "It's very simple. They are threatened by what I represent -- the need to reclaim this city and its reputation for its people."

HEADLINE: The Myth of Community Development

BYLINE: By Nicholas Lemann; Nicholas Lemann, a national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, is the author of "The Promised Land."

 BODY:
BURIED SO DEEPLY WITHIN PRESIDENT CLINTON'S first budget that it has barely been mentioned by the press is the biggest new Federal program for inner-city ghettos in more than a decade. The program is called Empowerment Zones, and it will cost the Government $3.5 billion over five years -- an amount that puts it in the league of Great Society programs that we now think of as having been unimaginably vast, like the War on Poverty and Model Cities.
The crime, poverty and physical and social deterioration of the inner cities is America's most obvious problem. The crisis in health care that has Washington's main attention right now manifests itself in private individual tragedies and in frightening statistics; but the crisis in the ghettos is right there in plain sight, in the middle of our main population centers. It is constantly discussed over millions of dinner tables, and also in establishment circles in New York, Washington, London and Tokyo. The 1992 Los Angeles riots, our biggest domestic disturbance in a generation, dramatically underscored how bad conditions are. It shouldn't come as a surprise -- in fact it seems natural -- that the Government might want to respond. 
 What's surprising, instead, is the precise nature of the response -- its modesty and the lack of enthusiasm and attention that have surrounded it. Vice President Al Gore has recently been made chairman of a new entity called the Community Enterprise Board, which a few months from now will pick six large, impoverished swaths of big cities (one of which, surely, will be South-Central Los Angeles) to receive special tax breaks and other Government benefits aimed at making them prosper economically. The official oratory associated with the program stresses that it is a new idea, conceived in the realization that, as one White House staff member puts it, "the approaches of both parties for three decades have failed" in the inner cities. "It moves beyond the old debate that the answer to every problem is top-down bureaucracy on the one hand or trickle-down economics on the other," said an Administration handout, with grandeur if not perfect grammar. Gore, in a speech at Harvard last month, said, "The solutions this Administration has in mind are different than those that had been proposed before."
The stated confidence is belied by the kind of launch Empowerment Zones is getting. Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty in a nationally televised, prime-time address to a joint session of Congress; President Clinton unveiled Empowerment Zones in the parking lot of a Cleveland shopping center in September. Everyone involved with the program knows that, protestations of its newness notwithstanding, something quite similar was proposed by the Bush Administration after the riots in 1992, was passed by Congress and failed to become law only because Bush decided to veto it during the Presidential campaign, when he felt vulnerable to charges of being a tax-and-spender.
Empowerment Zones get remarkably lukewarm endorsements from many of the very people who dreamed them up. Here are a few voices from around the Administration: "The evaluations don't provide an encouraging picture." "It was a given." "There are a lot of problems with it." On Capitol Hill, the committee chairmen who were responsible for Empowerment Zones, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of the Senate Finance Committee, are both known to be nonbelievers. The person probably most responsible for the passage of Empowerment Zones is Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York. What does he think? "I rejected the whole concept under Reagan. But people came to me and said, 'How can it hurt?' So I just said, 'What the hell.' But when it started looking like the urban policy for the nation, it was obviously inadequate."
The predictions being made for Empowerment Zones' ability to perform their job of revitalizing distressed areas are striking in their modesty. "It depends on your expectations," says Andrew M. Cuomo, an Assistant Secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and one of the program's architects. "If you expect to see Harlem as gentrified and mixed-income, it's not going to happen. If you look at people who moved out, it can be a success." Paul R. Dimond, the White House staff member most involved in planning Empowerment Zones, strikes a similar note: "I'm not saying it's going to succeed 100 percent. . . . If they're successful, lots of people will move out."
Someone who was able to look at this situation afresh -- a modern-day de Tocqueville -- might well ask, Why is the Government addressing a problem of this severity with a solution that its own officials don't really seem to believe in? The answer transcends the Clinton Administration. Instead, it has to do with the strange way American society outside the ghettos deals with the problems inside. For three decades, Administration after Administration has pondered the ghettos and then settled on the idea of trying to revitalize them economically -- even though there is almost no evidence that this can work. Nearly every attempt to revitalize the ghettos has been billed as a dramatic departure from the wrongheaded Government programs of the past -- even though many of the wrongheaded programs of the past tried to do exactly the same thing. The old cliche about ghetto life is that it's "a cycle of despair." Actually it's ghetto policy making that's a cycle of despair: The leadership class repeatedly turns to policies that sound appealing but are doomed to fail -- and then their failure practically guarantees that the country won't face the issue head on.
INNER-CITY REVITALIZATION IS A PHRASE SO FAMILIAR THAT IT'S part of the unexamined background noise of society. In fact, it requires some explanation. The most obvious solution to poverty is simply to provide for poor people's material needs, through cash grants, vouchers like food stamps and services like Medicaid. But for 100 years -- roughly since the publication of Jacob Riis's "How the Other Half Lives" -- American reformers have felt that the problems of poor urban slums went beyond just a lack of income. The slums were unhealthful and physically dangerous, and people there didn't seem to behave in a way that would put them on the track out of poverty. Therefore it was necessary to make some special efforts to improve conditions in the slums.
Traditionally these efforts involved what used to be called "social uplift": education, counseling, improvement of the housing stock, crime control. In recent decades, though, the idea of social uplift has become thoroughly disreputable among both the poor (who see it as patronizing) and the not-poor (who see it as expensive and ineffective). But what all parties have found they can live with is the idea that the way to cure the special ills of the slums is to generate a lot of home-grown business activity there. This would not only give poor people jobs and therefore money; it would create in them a whole new spirit of self-reliance. They would be able to build independent communities that control their own resources and destiny; from the standpoint of middle-class voters, creating a job base in the ghettos would be hardheaded and unwasteful. Hence the emergence of "economic development" or "community revitalization" -- as opposed to straight income support, or old-fashioned social services -- as a supposed panacea.
The problem is that on the whole, urban slums have never been home to many businesses except for sweatshops and minor neighborhood provisioners. The slums are usually near downtown, and the residents, when they can find work, have usually found it downtown. Also, poor neighborhoods are usually transitional: rather than being stable, self-sufficient communities on the model of a village in Vermont, they tend to be home to people who plan to move out as soon as they make a little money. The standard model of progress for poor people living in urban slums, repeated millions and millions of times over the decades, is to get a good job outside the neighborhood and then decamp for a nicer part of town.
So to try to create a lot of new economic activity in poor neighborhoods is to swim against the great sweeping tide of urban life in America. Inside the ghetto, it usually does no harm -- but it doesn't help much either. Outside the ghetto, though, it does a great deal of harm. Attempts at economic revitalization often take the place of other efforts that would do much more good (especially improving schools, housing and police protection), and they establish a public mission that can't be accomplished. Nothing does more to feed the public perception that antipoverty programs -- in fact, Government programs generally -- don't work than the poor physical appearance of the ghettos; the more the Government claims it's going to revitalize them, the harder it becomes politically to take on the problem in the future.
THE STORY OF HOW AMERICA GOT TO THIS POINT IS NOT so much about urban poverty itself as it is about perceptions of urban poverty.
Cities rose during the first half of the 20th century and have fallen during the second half. In the early years of their rise, as Americans flocked to them, respectable opinion often found cities horrifying, partly because of their squalid immigrant slums and corrupt political machines, and partly because virtue was thought to reside in the countryside. Theodore Roosevelt, the only President born on Manhattan Island, created a Commission on Country Life to revitalize a depopulating rural America. (It was unsuccessful.)
Not many years after cities ceased to be alarming, they began to appear to need saving. By the late 1940's, it was clear that the mass migration to the suburbs was depleting urban America of population and retailing base, and the arrival of a new wave of poor newcomers (this time African-Americans from the South) led to a fresh round of concern about slum conditions. In 1949, the Truman Administration created Urban Renewal, the first Federal program to make a commitment to restoring cities to some kind of past glory.
But Urban Renewal quickly became unpopular, especially among liberals. The rap on it, wholly justified, was that it bulldozed neighborhoods, especially black neighborhoods (hence its nickname, "Negro Removal") and replaced them with highways, sterile housing developments and municipal office complexes that looked wonderful when planners presented them at Chamber of Commerce meetings but, when built, only hastened the city's decline. In the late 50's and early 60's, books like Herbert J. Gans's "Urban Villagers" and Jane Jacobs's "Death and Life of the Great American Cities" enshrined the view that city neighborhoods, including poor ones, are precious, vibrant organisms with a complex life that planners don't understand.
When the next round of urban programs began, in the Kennedy Administration, they were animated by a backlash against urban renewal. A related line of thinking about slums that emerged at about the same time was hostility to the "ladies bountiful" who had been operating settlement houses and otherwise providing social services for many years. Both these oppositions, to urban renewal and to social work, led to the same conclusion -- an elevation of the role that poor people themselves should play in the improvement of the slums.
The early 1960's, then, were the starting point for the current phase of thinking about ghettos. For fully 30 years, the reigning ideas about Government policy in poor city neighborhoods have been essentially the same -- even though these ideas are still being referred to as new. They were first tried in the early 1960's, in small, foundation-financed efforts like the Gray Areas Project in New Haven and Mobilization for Youth on the Lower East Side (both underwritten by the Ford Foundation); then they were introduced into the Federal bloodstream through the work of the President's Council on Juvenile Delinquency, which was run by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy; finally, in 1964, they became the basis for the centerpiece of the War on Poverty, the Community Action program. These are the ideas:
Bottom Up, Not Top Down. The people who know the most about the needs of poor neighborhoods are the residents; therefore, poverty programs should be designed and implemented by them, not imposed from above by mayors, members of Congress, social workers, intellectuals, Federal bureaucrats or other authority figures.
Comprehensive and Coordinated. Antipoverty programs are a confusing morass, run by competing, byzantine bureaucracies. Rather than being operated "categorically" by different agencies in Washington (welfare and Medicaid are examples of "categorical" antipoverty programs because each addresses a single problem in isolation), these programs should be, on a local level, housed under one roof and reorganized so that all the problems of poor people are addressed together systematically.
Revitalize the Neighborhood. Ultimately, the theory goes, the health of a neighborhood depends on its economic base. The only real long-term answer to the problems of an inner-city ghetto is for good jobs to be available there. Anyone interested in helping poor neighborhoods must primarily focus on economic development.
It took only a few months for the War on Poverty to start being perceived as a failure. In retrospect, the poverty warriors were always swimming upstream against public opinion and politics. As long as the economy was growing rapidly and the poverty rate was decreasing, newly prosperous middle-class voters were willing to tolerate some governmental generosity. But they never pressed their representatives to finance programs they perceived as benefiting disadvantaged minorities. Also, the "bottom up" idea in the War on Poverty found its expression in a provision that directed Federal funds to community groups without the advice and consent of local elected officialdom; so mayors, senators and representatives, deprived of the pork-barrel opportunities embedded in virtually every other Federal program, were generally unfriendly to the War on Poverty.
But in a way, these political weaknesses only served to solidify the ideas about neighborhood revitalization that underlay the War on Poverty: everyone was too busy fighting enemies to re-examine its theoretical basis. Even as it became clear that the War on Poverty itself was never going to become a large, successful Federal program, succeeding antipoverty programs usually accepted the War on Poverty paradigm. Model Cities, the Johnson Administration's last major antipoverty initiative, was supposed to correct the political shortcomings of the War on Poverty by dropping the exclusion of mayors and members of Congress -- but the idea was still to revitalize poor neighborhoods. Robert Kennedy, by then Senator from New York and Johnson's archenemy, was contemptuous of Model Cities. His ambitious antipoverty program was the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, which was different from Model Cities in crucial respects. But it was also driven by the idea of economically revitalizing the ghetto.
The 1970's saw a succession of programs, like Community Development Block Grants during the Ford Administration and Urban Development Action Grants during the Carter Administration, which were sold as being different from the failed programs of the past while resting on the same assumptions: bottom-up planning, coordination of programs, neighborhood redevelopment.
During the 1980's, the dominant new antipoverty idea in Washington was creating Enterprise Zones: ghetto areas that would be given special tax breaks to encourage business. Their most prominent advocate was -- and still is -- Jack F. Kemp, who first proposed legislation to create them back in 1980, when he was a Congressman from Buffalo. The Reagan and Bush Administrations regularly called for legislation to establish Enterprise Zones, as did Kemp when he was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Bush. Kemp has a sincere and boundless faith that miracles can result from tax cuts; in his HUD days, which coincided with the collapse of Communism, he would tell visitors that the ghettos were "akin to a third-world socialist economy" and capitalism would make them blossom.
The antipoverty talk in the Bush Administration was, as usual, full of the notion of rejecting the failed programs of the past in favor of new ideas, but the new ideas had a certain familiarity: Enterprise Zones were another revitalize-the-ghetto scheme. Many of the slogans used to promote Enterprise Zones -- "empowerment," "a hand up, not a handout," "teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime" -- were, consciously or not, verbatim appropriations of language that was used to sell the War on Poverty.
Kemp was well known to be frustrated with Bush's level of commitment to the enterprise zone idea -- insufficient to get a bill passed. Then came the Los Angeles riots, and, as one Government expert puts it, "the only thing on the shelf was Enterprise Zones." Their previous failure to become Federal policy suddenly became a virtue because they appeared to be a fresh approach. The Administration and Congress quickly put together legislation that landed on President Bush's desk in October 1992, in the heat of the Presidential race. The bill also contained a few tiny technical adjustments that would increase Government revenues, like a change in the tax-accounting procedure for securities dealers. Afraid he would be accused of again breaking his "no new taxes" pledge, Bush announced he would veto the bill.
WHY HAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONSISTENTLY backed economic revitalization efforts in the ghettos? The answer to this question is not the one you'd expect-- that these efforts have been successful. Ghettos aren't very attractive locations for businesses. As Andrew Cuomo puts it, "It's misleading to say, once I.B.M. moves to the South Bronx everything's going to be rosy. One, I.B.M. isn't going to the South Bronx, because the other cost of doing business outweighs the tax incentives. Also, if I.B.M. did show up, the people in the zone aren't in a position to show up. They need training, and services like day care -- a comprehensive strategy."
In addition, the era of Government ghetto-revitalization programs has coincided with a major flow of population out of the areas that were supposedly being revived. Just during the 1970's, the peak decade of ghetto outmigration, Bedford-Stuyvesant lost one-third of its population. So did Central Harlem. The two community districts that make up the poorest part of the South Bronx lost two-thirds.
In New York City, most of these neighborhoods have stopped losing population -- primarily because of immigration, not Government revitalization efforts -- but in many other cities, the outflow has continued. A recent series of articles in The Miami Herald, for example, reported that all of Miami's traditional black neighborhoods are still heavy population losers: "In Liberty City, 27 percent of the population is gone. In the black section of Coconut Grove, 35 percent. In Overtown, where highway construction helped spur decline, 76 percent of the population is gone." The Herald also cited black-population-loss figures of 100,000 for Chicago, 124,000 for Atlanta and 224,000 for Washington.
It's no tragedy when people leave ghettos. They're just following the standard American pattern by moving to the outer city -- places like Queens -- or to the suburbs. Today, minorities are suburbanizing more rapidly than whites. A recent Urban Institute paper calculates that just during the 1980's, the black population of the suburbs in the 39 largest metropolitan areas increased by 38 percent. Jobs have followed people to the suburbs, and that makes it even more difficult to create an employment base in poor inner-city neighborhoods.
It is therefore extremely difficult to find statistical evidence that any inner-city neighborhood in the country has been economically revitalized. One often hears anecdotal revitalization success stories, but they usually involve either the building of a "festival marketplace," like South Street Seaport in New York, or the shoring up of an area that is blue-collar rather than poor and residential rather than industrial, like South Shore in Chicago, which President Clinton often mentions in speeches. An Urban Institute report produced after the Los Angeles riots said, "There are virtually no examples of success in restoring strong economic activity and job creation to an inner-city area the size of South-Central Los Angeles, as is being attempted in the wake of the riots." Rebuild L.A., the much-publicized local civic effort to revitalize South-Central, has been unable to induce businesses to locate major facilities there, which is one reason that its first director, Peter V. Ueberroth, resigned.
So then why is inner-city revitalization attractive to policy makers? One reason is that although Americans move around a lot, and poor people are especially mobile, politicians represent geographical areas and so naturally think of the welfare of people in terms of the welfare of places. Schemes to revive places are always popular with politicians, and with politicians' lobbies like the United States Conference of Mayors. The Model Cities program, to cite a famous example, was in early discussions supposed to be a demonstration project in a handful of cities. But in order to get it through Congress the Johnson Administration expanded it to 150 sites (and thus vastly diluted its chances of success) -- which gave the program an automatic base of 150 votes in the House.
Philanthropic foundations also like revitalization. The idea that foundations wield great power might sound strange to people outside of fields like education, foreign affairs and social policy, but within their orbit, what they do matters tremendously. In poverty-fighting, during periods when the Federal Government isn't rolling out large, centrally administered programs, foundations become, by default, the key players. The foundations' strong attachment to revitalization comes partly from the natural tendency to believe that the thing you can do is the essential thing to do. Foundations don't have enough money or power to take control of inner-city public education, or impose work requirements on welfare recipients or send poor people money and food. But they can foster community-development efforts, which are relatively cheap because they're so localized and which don't require the wielding of Government authority. For decades, the Ford Foundation has invested heavily in inner-city economic development, and in recent years, other big foundations have followed suit. The heads of the two most important foundations involved in antipoverty work are both alumni of ghetto revitalization efforts: Franklin A. Thomas of the Ford Foundation previously ran Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration, and Peter C. Goldmark Jr. of the Rockefeller Foundation as a young man worked for the Federal Community Action Program. Most conclaves devoted to devising solutions to the problems of ghettos are dominated by foundation people, and they usually end with ringing endorsements of economic revitalization.
Two other disparate constituencies are able to dwell comfortably under the theoretical roof of revitalization. Business groups -- a city's local Chamber of Commerce, for example -- like revitalization because it glorifies small business and presents itself as a practical alternative to the big-Government approach. Ghetto revitalization projects often have the word "corporation" in their name in order to enhance their appeal to business contributors.
At the other end of the spectrum, grass-roots inner-city community groups like revitalization because it puts them at center stage as saviors of their neighborhoods (and recipients of funds), provides administrative jobs and operates from a flattering set of assumptions about the hidden "strengths" of areas that are usually defined solely in terms of their poverty, crime rates, poor schools, dilapidated housing and other problems.
Finally, revitalization is bureaucratically appealing to White House staff members. In Administration after Administration, these people suffer the same frustrations: it's too difficult to get action at a reasonable cost, and the Cabinet departments are lumbering and intransigent. So when an Administration sets up a White House task force or working group on concentrated inner-city poverty, as has nearly every Administration of the past three decades, what usually happens is that the departments submit ideas for expensive programs to be run by them, and the White House, frustrated, looks for a cheaper and higher-impact alternative. The next step -- in the Bush Administration, no less than in the Kennedy Administration -- is that the White House becomes entranced with the idea that community development efforts should be run locally rather than by Federal bureaucrats. That is both the cheapest and the most dramatic-sounding option.
Given that the residents of many of the poorest urban neighborhoods are African-American, a final political advantage of community development is that it neatly avoids what is perhaps the most perilous of all issues for elected officials -- racial integration. Scholars, policy analysts and journalists have been moving in recent years toward the view that "hypersegregation" of the black poor causes great harm. But politicians simply can't afford to embrace this view wholeheartedly. A good example is the position of Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. When Cisneros took office, he developed a list of four fundamental "commitments" driving all HUD activities -- and then became so impassioned about integration that he added a fifth commitment, to, in his words "consistently working to deconcentrate the poorest of the poor, giving people a lift up and out" of the ghetto. At Cisneros's urging, President Clinton has decided to issue later this year a tough new executive order banning housing discrimination against people who want to leave all-minority neighborhoods. But Cisneros still loyally (though with noticeably less fervor) endorses developing the ghetto economically, which would seem to be exactly the opposite approach.
DURING THE 1992 CAMPAIGN, BILL CLINTON CAME OUT for Enterprise Zones -- in a more careful and less breezily optimistic way than Kemp, but for them nonetheless. In a long interview with the staff of The Atlantic Monthly (including me) just before the Democratic Convention, he said, "I agree with Kemp about Enterprise Zones, but . . . I think it's a very narrow view of what needs to be done to . . . recreate that sort of economy there." And a little later: "I think they will be of limited impact unless you also have . . . the national initiatives I've called for on education, health care and the economy."
Besides his personal convictions about Enterprise Zones, Clinton had good political reasons to support them. Because they are primarily based on tax cuts, they don't have to be proposed in the form of new-spending legislation, which is unpopular. Enterprise Zones have a tough-minded, economic growth-oriented "new Democrat" aura of promoting the work ethic as a solution to poverty, rather than welfare and Government programs of the "throwing money at problems" variety. They tap into a longing for the restoration of community that seems to be at large in the country right now. They generate good will inexpensively among the urban lobbying groups. After the election, Clinton put his new National Economic Council in charge of fulfilling the Enterprise Zones campaign promise, and the Council wound up, in effect, revising the Republicans' abandoned Enterprise Zones bill.
State and local experiments with Enterprise Zones (which, admittedly, don't involve tax breaks on the scale that the Federal Government can provide) haven't produced impressive results. Enterprise Zones don't directly attack essential problems like poor education and crime, which act as a "tax" on businesses that often outweighs whatever actual tax break they have reaped. By targeting only certain places, Enterprise Zones are, in the words of one report, "a means of redistributing investment and employment, not a means of achieving more of each."
The Clinton Administration has demonstrated its lack of Kemp-like total belief in economic revitalization of ghettos by placing bets on several different antipoverty strategies. By far its largest antipoverty initiative is a $21 billion increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is meant to get all working people above the poverty line. Financing for the Head Start program has also been increased. And President Clinton has talked about ambitious plans to improve education and public safety in the ghettos.
Still, because of Clinton's campaign promise, there was never any question that the Administration would propose Enterprise Zone legislation. What the planners of the Clinton bill came up with might be called Enterprise Zones for Liberals. Kemp believes the essential incentive in Enterprise Zones should be a break in the capital gains tax for investors in businesses there. In the Bush and Clinton plans, the central mechanism is a wage credit: employ a resident of the zone, and you save up to $3,000 a year in payroll taxes. Wage credits are more highly regarded by policy analysts than capital gains tax cuts because they insure that the Government's money goes directly into job creation. The Clinton bill, like the Bush bill, tried to avoid the old Model Cities problem of funds being spread too thinly by designating a handful of Empowerment Zones that get serious amounts and a lot of "enterprise communities" that get just enough to win the votes of their representatives. The War on Poverty's problem of generating political enmity by cutting politicians out of the action was solved by requiring each community to submit an application agreed to by community groups and endorsed by local government. (Kemp publicly opposed Empowerment Zones because governments have too large a role.)
Paul Dimond, the most involved White House staff member, is a lawyer who spent years trying desegregation cases and so is well aware of the desire of ghetto residents to move out. At his suggestion, the wage credit was made to apply to employers who hired residents of a zone, even if the job was outside the zone. Andrew Cuomo, the only Administration official involved in drawing up the bill who has actually worked in inner-city redevelopment, pushed to require communities to plan services like day care and job training as a condition of being chosen as an Empowerment Zone. Dimond and Cuomo have set up an elaborate plan to make it easier for Empowerment Zones to apply for additional financing and loans from Government agencies and to encourage them to line up local private and public financing as well.
Last May, an Administration delegation headed by Cisneros and Robert E. Rubin, who heads the National Economic Council, went to Capitol Hill to present the Empowerment Zones legislation to the Senate committee chairman who had jurisdiction over it, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan has been able to maintain a reputation as a champion of social reform while actually believing that Government social programs almost never work. "That's a Fabian idea," he told his visitors -- a comment that anyone who knows him well would recognize as a putdown (the Fabians having been, in the Moynihan cosmology, the opposite of the kind of practical machine politicians who get things done) but that the Administration's representatives took as praise. When the Clinton Administration included Empowerment Zones as part of its budget, the House passed it, adding an additional $1 billion to the appropriation. But Moynihan's Senate Finance Committee stripped Empowerment Zones out of the budget bill before sending the legislation to the Senate floor for a vote.
The fate of Empowerment Zones then rested with a House-Senate conference committee charged with resolving the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. It was a pure case of legislating behind closed doors: Empowerment Zones was too minor a part of the huge budget for anyone but the people in the conference to focus on. What happened was that Charles Rangel, who represents Harlem and was the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus on the conference committee, saved Empowerment Zones, with help from Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. That was interesting, because neither Bradley nor Rangel, who have long records of demonstrated concern for ghettos, especially believes in the Enterprise Zone idea. They used Empowerment Zones as an opportunity to get more Federal spending on what they do believe in, social services: drug counseling, preventive health care, job training, after-school mentoring and emergency housing.
The final legislation contained $2.5 billion in tax breaks and $1 billion in new financing for a very flexible social-services grant called Title XX. And the bill's original provision subsidizing the hiring of zone residents for jobs outside the zone -- which the Administration authors were especially proud of, because it recognized the reality that significant job-creation inside ghettos is unlikely and probably unnecessary -- was quietly dropped to save money.
Later this year, Vice President Gore's Enterprise Board will, after considering applications from all over the country, designate six urban and three rural Empowerment Zones. Of the six urban ones, it is a safe bet that one will be in South-Central Los Angeles. Another, given Rangel's role, will probably be in Harlem. Chicago, home of Dan Rostenkowski, would be a strong candidate, and so would Detroit because it has America's most severely distressed big-city ghetto. In conference, Senator Bradley inserted a requirement that of the six zones, "at least one must be in a city with a population of 500,000 or less and at least one of the zones itself must have a population of 50,000 or less and include areas located in two states." This would pave the way for applications from Newark and Camden, which sits on the New Jersey-Pennsylvania border.
Then what? The Administration's optimism about Empowerment Zones is extremely limited. Paul Dimond, who is probably the leading Empowerment Zones enthusiast, says he believes that if the zones are located near existing facilities with job-generating potential, like universities and hospitals (a Harlem zone, for example, could abut Columbia University and the Columbia-Presbyterian medical complex) and in cities that are drawing immigrants, they could substantially improve conditions. Other Administration officials predict that perhaps one of the six zones could end up a visible economic success, while the rest can only hope to be somewhat safer and less deteriorated-looking.
And this is the optimistic view. As an example of the pessimistic (though still Democratic) view, Lawrence F. O'Donnell Jr., staff director of the Senate Finance Committee and a protege and soul mate of Moynihan's, says: "My own belief is this bill will represent a net harm to Empowerment Zone communities. I wouldn't be surprised if three years from now, you have an Empowerment Zone in which no employer of significance has moved in, because employers are not so concerned with the tax picture as the safety and service and transportation picture. . . . There's going to be tremendous chicanery around this. . . . What if the guy from the South Bronx who gets a job does what every guy does, which is move? He's no longer a tax break. Do you fire him? What he's going to end up doing is lying about his address. It completely ignores one of the most obvious phenomena of this century -- people do not want to live near their work."
ALL OVER URBAN America, hundreds, even thousands of local organizations are engaged in efforts to revitalize neighborhoods. Much of this activity is extremely impressive, not least because of the dedication of the people involved. The War on Poverty set up more than 500 local community action agencies. Today, more than a decade after the last desiccated vestige of the Johnson-era Office of Economic Opportunity, a little-known agency called the Community Services Administration, was eliminated as an independent body by the Reagan Administration, hundreds of community action agencies still exist. An overlapping category, descended from Robert Kennedy's Bedford-Stuyvesant project, is Community Development Corporations, which are heavily supported by foundations and exist in poor neighborhoods in every big city.
It's unscientific and unfair to single out one of these local organizations as the best in the country -- but if the title were being handed out it would, by common assent of people in the field, probably go to the New Community Corporation in Newark. Founded a year after the 1967 Newark riots, New Community became a substantial enterprise during the 1980's, under the direction of a rumpled, unassuming Catholic priest, William J. Linder. Today it operates 2,500 housing units that are home to 6,000 people; seven day-care centers; an elementary school; a shopping center anchored by a new Pathmark supermarket; a nursing home; a job-placement center; a newspaper and a restaurant. It has 1,266 employees and an $95 million annual budget. The neighborhood where New Community operates feels organized and safe. Right next to it, a private developer has built market-rate housing, which is a vote of confidence in New Community's ability to stabilize the area.
It would be a mistake, however, to make the leap from the impressive work of New Community, or that of other Community Development Corporations, to the conclusion that ghetto economic revitalization can work -- although making that leap has become routine for journalists, foundation executives and Government officials. A strict unwritten code among Community Development Corporation people dictates that they must insist economic development is their primary mission. Linder certainly does. To the naked eye, though, economic development is hardly the most striking feature of Community Development Corporations. In the neighborhood where New Community operates, there is almost no private-sector economic activity. New Community, an imaginative and energetic harvester of grants, loans, subsidies and tax abatements from Government, foundations and business, owns outright almost everything there.
Its main activity -- and the main activity of most other Community Development Corporations -- is creating and operating housing for the poor. Because there are so many Community Development Corporations and other local efforts, and because these organizations are often run by inexperienced people, many are incompetent or even corrupt; they fizzle out, or limp along for years. The most impressive thing about the hundreds of good Community Development Corporations, though, is almost always their housing work.
Subsidized housing is the spiritual center of antipoverty work. In the dawning days of urban social reform, Jacob Riis and his allies believed that the key to solving the problems of the slums was building "model tenements." By the mid-1960's, the pandemic violence and social deterioration at big public-housing projects was the main evidence for the view (which still prevails) that Government antipoverty programs had failed. To visit successful Community Development Corporations is to see that subsidized housing for the poor can work -- in fact, there seems to be a consistent model that works from neighborhood to neighborhood. The key points in common are heavy emphasis on security (New Community has a private security force of 120 people, almost one-tenth of its payroll); keeping the size of each development manageably small; creating some economic mix of tenants; screening prospective tenants and expelling tenants who commit crimes or otherwise break the rules. Subsidized housing of this kind tends to be run by a single strong leader. For example, the deputy borough president of the Bronx, Genevieve Brooks, started out as head of a Community Development Corporation called the Mid-Bronx Desperadoes.
The implications of an existing replicable formula for running subsidized housing for the poor are immense. It raises the hope of making some significant dent in problems like homelessness and inner-city dilapidation. Success stories in housing might well make the public more willing also to support Government efforts in education, child care, health, public safety and job training that would address what everyone knows is an intolerable crisis in the ghettos.
But the people who are doing good work in poor urban neighborhoods -- who have significantly improved horrific conditions by figuring out how to deliver traditional social services well -- almost always say that they are engaged in "economic development" or "grass-roots community development," rather than trumpeting their real story. (The most comprehensive national study of Community Development Corporations does admit, slightly through gritted teeth, that housing is "the C.D.C.'s' largest single program area," and that their "record in housing is stronger than it is in the development of commercial property or business enterprises.") The idea of poor people being ministered to today has a creepy, Kiplingesque feeling to it; everyone in the field finds the idea that poor people are being "empowered" much more comfortable. In a way, the whole notion of economic revitalization functions as a kind of code: it's a formulation that isn't taken literally and one that worked wonderfully well to bring all the antipoverty players together in a period when their cause wasn't receiving much attention from the general public or the Federal Government.
NOW THINGS ARE changing. An Administration in terested in antipoverty programs is in the White House. Bill Clinton has made it obvious that he understands and is tormented by how bad things are in the ghettos. It is also his natural inclination to look to the Federal Government to do something about it. But what? Economic revitalization efforts pass every test but one, the reality test. They are popular among all the key players in antipoverty policy; they sound good; they have bipartisan appeal; they are based on tax breaks rather than on spending and so are easier to pass. The only problem is that so far they haven't worked -- which creates a larger problem.
Think for a minute about why most people believe that the Great Society was a failure. What's the evidence? It is the enduring physical and social deterioration of poor inner-city neighborhoods. The Government promised to turn these places around, and instead they got worse; ipso facto, Government can't do anything right. This is exactly the button that Marlin Fitzwater tried to push last year when he blamed the Great Society for the Los Angeles riots. It's all too easy to imagine the Republican nominee in 1996 staging a press conference in one of the Clinton Administration's Empowerment Zones, waving a hand expressively at the scenery and saying: "See? They told us that by spending billions here they were going to create a nice place." All this will be hypocritical, of course, because the Republican nominee will probably be someone who supported a quite similar Bush plan, but it will be effective.
On the other hand, programs to make daily life in the ghettos decent and to put inner-city residents on the track to something better are problematic for Washington. Voters are absolutely certain that social services cost a lot and don't work, so political support for them is hard to come by. Meanwhile, there is considerable evidence that out in the ghettos, people are finding ways to deliver social services, especially housing and day care, effectively. Everybody involved in antipoverty work knows this, which is the reason that, on the ground, community efforts focus primarily on housing, safety, education and job training -- and the reason that Washington tries regularly to sneak more financing for these social services into legislation. What the people who know won't do, at the moment, is state these goals directly. They fear that public hostility to Government social-service programs is too strong. It's a tragedy. What is gained in the short run by making a promise that sounds more appealing -- economic development -- is far outweighed by what is lost in the long run when the dream doesn't come true.

HEADLINE: Schools Superintendent Proposes Bold Program

BYLINE: By GENE NEWMAN

DATELINE: PARSIPPANY

 BODY:
THE Superintendent of this school district, the largest in Morris County, is creating an educational master plan and asking teachers and parents to join him in "a vision of progress" that will make this the best school district in the nation. A key feature of the "Parsippany 2000" program would be the establishment of an academy in each of the two high schools.
As the vision takes shape, preliminary appraisals from the educational community range from skeptical to "very hopeful." A public hearing on the program will be held on Jan. 20 at 7:30 P.M. at Parsippany High School. 
 Dr. Timothy C. Brennan became Superintendent of this district of 5,900 students with a $65 million budget in January 1993 after eight and a half years as Superintendent in Holmdel. In his 110-page plan for taking the school system into the 21st century, he says there is only one factor not present for reaching supremacy.
"We need to raise our level of expectation," he wrote. "With the competence of the staff we have, the intelligence of the kids, the support of the parents and the genuineness of the governing body; and considering our level of expenditures, there is no reason why we cannot be the best school district in the nation."
Although he had not backed down from this ambitious goal, Dr. Brennan has reportedly qualified it by saying he would accept being among the 10,000 who tie for first in the nation. He also proposed at a September school board meeting that standardized tests be revised to "compare our kids' results with the best school in the country."
"We want to be able to find our points of weakness," he added.
 
Ranking of Schools
 There are weaknesses. A State Education Department ranking of 332 public high schools in October placed Parsippany High School 111th and Parsippany Hills High School 151st. They ranked 17th and 20th respectively among 22 Morris County high schools. There has been some criticism of the accuracy of the ranking by educators around the state.
In a recent interview, Dr. Brennan described his preliminary plans for the academy. "One of the differences between an academy and a public school is the class size," he said. "We are looking for a way to bring the class size down to 10. With 10 students gathered around a table with their teacher, there's no place to hide. You have to participate."
Class size will actually be larger, he explained, but with two multimedia computer systems promised by the Pfizer Corporation, some students will be engaged in independent research using their choice of texts, photos or films.
Other aspects of the academy are required community service and participation in sports or physical conditioning programs. A dress code and a curriculum that includes social graces, concert and lecture attendance and after-school research and reading assignments will be required of high school students who choose to attend the academy rather than take the normal study program, which will continue to be offered.
The academy's stringent requirements have led to the misconception that it is for top students only, Dr. Brennan said. "Actually it's to catch the so-called average student and raise his or her expectations," he said. "What they need, what teachers and parents need, is a whole new picture to replace the old vision of being average."
He said he expected some parents to be more enthusiastic about the academy program than their children and would tell them what to say to the admissions committee. "That's O.K.," he said. "We're looking for parents willing to give their kids a push into the academy and then work with them, setting up the homework hour and driving them to extra-curricula activities."
The committee, he said, will admit any student who has enough drive and commitment to apply for admission.

 
Some Voice Skepticism
 While many in the community are withholding opinions until the administration submits specific details to the Board of Education, Ellen Decker, a board member, has voiced skepticism. "I think what Tim Brennan wants is admirable, but I don't think it's going to work," she said.
Mrs. Decker, a teacher for 20 years, teaches eighth grade in the Paterson public school system. She is on the school board's education committee and heads the search committee that selected Dr. Brennan from more than 100 applicants.
Mrs. Decker said she perceived the academy "as another avenue, not for the average kid, but for the highly motivated upper-echelon child who will do whatever the parent pushes and whatever the school suggests. In my opinion, this will segregate the kids even more."
She added that she considers the Superintendent a marvelous thinker with wonderful ideas and the "Parsippany 2000" program an exciting concept.
"I'm just a little skeptical, but I will be the first one to apologize and say I was totally wrong," she said. "I want to be convinced. It would be wonderful if I were wrong."
Mrs. Decker explained that one proposed model for the academy called for a "pilot program" approach with introduction in only the ninth grade next year and simultaneous orientation of eighth graders. "I'm more comfortable with that," she said. "It's a little soft to sell. I could buy that if the board supports it."
Leslie Silver, president of the school board, is more optimistic. Noting that the plan is not yet final, he still called it "unique and a great idea" and praised the Superintendent's vision. "Dr. Brennan happens to be a dreamer, and dreamers are good in education," he said.
Mr. Silver termed the academy "a private school within a public school" that would give students an edge in gaining admittance to better colleges.
While the board will have to study the budget impact of the program, Dr. Brennan said, "It has to be no more than we're spending now; we are currently at our legal limit for raising property taxes." An annual state spending cap of about 5 percent just covers negotiated salary increases and inflation, he said.
 
'He Wants Our Input'
 Dr. Brennan is getting high marks on communication. Speaking about informational meetings he has scheduled on the program, Marianne Schak, the president of the Parent-Teacher Association at the Intervale School, said: "He wants our input. He wants parents' input, and he wants everybody in Parsippany involved. That's great. It's better than having the Board of Education deciding alone."
Student board of director members from Parsippany Hills High School endorse the plan and the pains the Superintendent is taking to present it to the students. Shayne Humphrey and Megan Gamber, both juniors, agreed that community service would be a welcome addition to the curriculum.
"What I like about the academy best is that you're going to be with students who want to work," Ms. Gamber said.
John Capsouras, president of the 480-member Teacher Education Association, the teachers' union, who has been a teacher in the district for 23 years, said he has a good feeling about the new program.
"I'm very hopeful," he said. "Dr. Brennan is using the teachers too. We're not going to be hit with a hammer one day and told to go do this. He's checking with us first; otherwise there would be too many problems at start-up. Talking to the people who have to make the changes is a good idea."

HEADLINE: The Death of Russian Beauty

BYLINE: By Harlow Robinson; Harlow Robinson is the chairman of the Slavic department at the State University of New York, Albany. His book "The Last Impresario: The Life, Times and Legacy of Sol Hurok" will be published in March.

 BODY:

A TIME TO GATHER STONES
By Vladimir Soloukhin.
Translated by Valerie Z. Nollan.
251 pp. Evanston, Ill.:
Northwestern University Press. $29.95. 
 ANYONE who has traveled in recent years to Russia has beheld the awesome devastation wreaked on the flat, open landscape by more than 70 years of unchecked industrial and residential development. The furious technological "progress" promoted in the name of the bright collective future of Communism has left behind an ugly legacy of pollution, deforestation and depopulation.
The abandonment and destruction of thousands of churches -- which were for centuries before 1917 the spiritual, social and architectural heart of Russian villages -- has only intensified the visual desolation. To understand the impact of such a catastrophe, try to imagine what New England towns would look like if the white Congregational churches lining the village greens were suddenly shuttered, left to rot or dynamited.
Churches, historic preservation and the condition of the landscape are among the themes of "A Time to Gather Stones," by Vladimir Soloukhin, who is a prominent member of the "village prose" movement, a group of writers advocating the traditional values of Russian village life. (Some of the movement's members have also flirted with the sort of scary, xenophobic nationalism now being promoted by Vladimir Zhirinovsky.) In the five essays in this conscientiously translated book, the 69-year-old Moscow writer ruminates on what is rapidly becoming a favorite theme of writers everywhere: the disappearance of beauty from the earth. He argues that humans, whose technological advances have allowed them to reach the most unspoiled places in a matter of hours, have, by indulging in a "bacchanalia of accessibility," ruined their delicate relationship with nature.
In the concluding essay of the book, "Civilization and Landscape," a lecture originally delivered at a Nobel symposium in Sweden in 1978, Mr. Soloukhin declares with chatty common sense that "people preoccupied with only economic or political considerations may lack one simple criterion: 'How will it look?' How will it look today and, moreover, how will it look tomorrow?"
The other four essays in the book closely examine four places associated with prominent pre-revolutionary Russian writers. He uses these places as depressing case studies in how to mistreat historical and literary landmarks. The sites include Zvanka, the estate of the Baroque poet Gavril Derzhavin; Aksakovo, the childhood home of the novelist Sergei Aksakov; Shakhmatovo, the estate of the Symbolist poet Aleksandr Blok; and Optina, an ancient monastery that was founded by a reformed bandit in Kaluga Province and that later attracted such salvation-seeking luminaries as Gogol, Dostoyevsky and, perhaps most famously, Tolstoy in his final tortured days.
In each essay Mr. Soloukhin weaves his impressions of the setting with anecdotal accounts of its past and relevant literary quotations. Aspiring to the lyrical level of Turgenev's rural tales but rarely reaching it, Mr. Soloukhin is at his best when lamenting the dilapidated and neglected condition of the places he considers. Like the writing of so many Soviet writers, however, his essays are often bland and lacking in tension, a fact that his translator, Valerie Z. Nollan, cannot conceal, try as she might. Nor do her efforts always convey the stylistic flavor of the literary quotations, especially those from Old Russian sources; in her smooth English, their voices are indistinguishable from Mr. Solou khin's own voice.
Arguably the most successful essay is "Greater Shakhmatovo," an enchanting, almost fairy-tale portrait of the Arcadian existence of the stunningly handsome Aleksandr Blok and his wife, living on their prosperous estate on the eve of the Russian Revolution. Residing and working in harmony both with their forest surroundings and (apparently) with the domestic servants and local peasants, they gave back to the land as much as they took. Within a few short years of the Revolution, however, their beloved estate had burned and fallen apart, its property looted and scattered.
Mr. Soloukhin is not alone in expressing his concern over the tragic loss of Russian traditional values. Now that it's safe to do so, every self-respecting Moscow intellectual, artist and television pundit is jumping on the moral bandwagon. But Mr. Soloukhin began addressing this topic -- and especially the theme of architectural preservation -- long before it was fashionable. These five essays all predate Mikhail Gorbachev and glasnost. Four were published during the 1970's, three in the journal Moskva. The most recent, the title piece, "A Time to Gather Stones" (about Optina Monastery), appeared in Moskva in 1980, two years before the death of Leonid Brezhnev.
Because of their implicit criticism of Soviet cultural and economic policy, the essays created considerable controversy when they appeared in the Soviet Union. (The editor responsible for publishing them was even chastised.) But Mr. Solou khin was always a good Communist Party member. He thought of himself as a loyal Soviet writer, and he never crossed the line into confrontational dissidence. While he defended churches as architectural monuments, he never advocated that they be returned to their original owners or be used for worship. Indeed, some Russian and Western critics, detecting a certain moral flabbiness characteristic of well-intentioned official Soviet writers, have accused Mr. Soloukhin of inconsistency and ambiguity.
Even as he presents the results of his painstaking research into the post-revolutionary history of Shakhmatovo and other revered literary sites, even as he recalls cutting through miles of red tape and confronting countless instances of stupid bureaucratic bungling, Mr. Soloukhin refuses to condemn the Soviet system that is responsible for this massive neglect and thoughtlessness. He leaves such conclusions to the reader, limiting himself to a detached nostalgic regret. In the end, Mr. Solou khin's emotional and spiritual detachment saps the strength of his worthy message. As a product of the Soviet literary establishment, he was brave enough to nibble at the hand that fed him, but not heroic enough to bite it.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Year At Sea

BYLINE: By Garry Wills; Garry Wills, adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University and author of "Lincoln at Gettysburg," is author of a forthcoming book on leadership, "Certain Trumpets."

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
Getting elected was the best thing Bill Clinton did which is not to belittle anything else he did. The arrival of a Democrat in the White House was a seismic event, shifting our polity's tectonic plates. Democrats had been absent since 1968 -- if one excepts, as one should, Jimmy Carter's brief interlude, with all the impact of breath on a window pane, fading as soon as it was breathed.
The Republican hold on the White House was a cultural fact of odd significance. It occurred at the very time when the country was undergoing a profound social revolution. 
 Look, today, at the status of achieving women, elected black officials, open homosexuals, single mothers, unwed couples, women having legal abortions, uncensored movies and magazines. There is no one who does not have friends or family members engaged in what, a quarter of a century ago, was a rare or embarrassing social activity. Yet term after term we elected Presidents who tried to ignore or turn back this avalanche of social change.
Admittedly, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush were not elected solely to be a brake on the pace of social change. Other factors were in play -- especially the final spending paroxysm of the cold war, with a concomitant niggardliness for any but military spending.
But the fact remains that electing a Democratic President closed what was becoming a chasm between social reality and electoral leadership. Women, gay people, blacks and other minorities are now part of the society for which the White House speaks, not that society's enemies. This was bound to have an affect on court appointments and administrative procedures no matter what Democrat got elected.
But Mr. Clinton was the one who did, and he deserves credit for bringing in long-delayed changes.
What other credit rightly belongs to him? Not as much as one had reason to hope for. During his transition, he raised expectations that were largely disappointed in the immediate aftermath of his inauguration.
As President-elect, he conducted in Little Rock an economic "summit meeting" with an array of experts, and dazzled people with his command of problems and policy. Quite a contrast with Franklin D. Roosevelt's dithering response when Herbert Hoover tried to recruit his successor to interim measures for regulating money. Hoover, dismayed at the level of Roosevelt's answers, wrote in his diary that the newly elected amateur was too dumb to be President.
Roosevelt refused to cooperate on stopgap expedients because he wanted an air of crisis when he took over and a free hand uncompromised by previous half-measures. He hit the town like a whirlwind.
Mr. Clinton hit it like a soggy moon pie. His economic showing off produced a plan whose distinctive feature -- a Rooseveltian combination of cuts and expenditures, shoring up credit and creating jobs -- was abandoned at the first show of resistance to the jobs program.
Admittedly, the Depression gave Roosevelt a genuine crisis to work with. But there was a perception of crisis in the 1992 campaign that led to the cry for change, and for drastic measures, reflected in the appeal of demagogues like Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan. Mr. Clinton let that dissipate during his early months of having fun in the White House.
He allowed news stories about Sharon Stone and Cristophe, the hair stylist, to trivialize the Presidency while Ross Perot was mounting a post-campaign second campaign that urged serious action on the deficit. Mr. Clinton had trouble passing a tax on the rich because the Republicans found it laughably easy to misrepresent it as a tax on the middle class.
He was able to rescue endangered programs at the last minute, confirming a pattern discernible earlier in his life, of long dilatory periods followed by frenetic last-minute spectacles of personal diplomacy and showmanship. But this keeps him behind the curve, perpetually catching up ("the Comeback Kid"), saving this or that endangered position instead of setting the agenda.
In foreign policy, he has not even had programs to rescue with last-minute efforts. A year into office, he admits he is still "trying to think of what our bumper sticker would be about" in dealing with Russia. As for Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, his retrenchment of American commitments is defensible, I believe, but he has not mounted the defense.
Much can be traced to the initial mistake of dropping his jobs program. Without that balancing component of his plan, the spending cuts could be attacked as insufficient. Mr. Perot had weeks of artificially extended political life because of that, and Mr. Clinton looked more timorous than he was.
If a vigorous domestic rebuilding had been in process, Mr. Clinton could have made a better case for restraint abroad until our own house was set in order. Welfare reform would be more feasible if there were jobs the unemployed could be given -- roads and bridges to be repaired, public buildings to be modernized or expanded. Instead, the nation's infrastructure continues to crumble, reducing productivity, fostering public disorder and limiting employment.
Last year's call for change was sharp, but Mr. Clinton muted it at the moment when he had his best opportunity for a comprehensive programmatic initiative. Lost opportunities are what a Comeback Kid has to keep coming back from -- and Republicans are helping him. Enough of them think they can win by going back to the Reagan era of denial that we have a changed social world.
Even their stridency proclaims this change. Rush Limbaugh's gleeful vituperation is closer to the savageness of Howard Stern than to the civility of conservative doctrine. But rescue by his opponents is hardly an inspiring prospect for Mr. Clinton.
Individual programs will absorb his energies -- especially health care, his trademark issue, and welfare reform -- while foreign policy continues to be treated as a distraction. Even the fight for the two main programs would be easier if be had an overarching rationale for his actions at home and abroad. That is hard to formulate convincingly when faced with midterm elections, but life will be even harder without it. Going out somewhere beats, by far, forever coming back.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN EUROPE: Clinton, in Brussels, Offers Commitment to Europe;
On Eve of NATO Talks, President Tries to Ease Fears That His Focus Is on Asia

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 9

 BODY:
In the first hours of his first visit to Europe as President, Bill Clinton sought tonight to reassure a continent full of skeptics that the United States remains committed to the Atlantic partnership and determined to resist the siren song of isolationism.
Surrounded by rich carvings and sumptuous tapestries in Brussels' 15th-century City Hall, Mr. Clinton told an audience of more than 200 mostly young people, drawn from 30 countries, that Europe "is our most valued partner" in the economic and political spheres as well as in military affairs. 
 The best hope for world peace, he said, lies in a rebuilt North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- "not only in the compatibility of our weapons but the camaraderie of our warriors" -- at the heart of a new security system in Europe.
But he said nothing specific about when and under what conditions the United States might agree to extend NATO's nuclear umbrella beyond Western Europe, a key question in European capitals.
"I am here to demonstrate that Europe remains central to the interests of the United States," Mr. Clinton said, clearly conscious that many European leaders feel Washington is now preoccupied with Asia and Latin America.
Aides traveling with the President, whose itinerary includes stops in Prague, Geneva, Moscow and Minsk, the capital of Belarus, also said Mr. Clinton hoped to sign an agreement with Ukraine to get rid of all its nuclear arms in return for help with its debts and other political and economic benefits. The agreement could be signed either in Moscow or at an added stop in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.
 
Plea for Help in Bosnia
 A solid agreement with Ukraine, which is not yet assured, would provide Mr. Clinton with a welcome apogee to his trip. But he also faces unwelcome pressures from France and others to increase Washington's involvement in the Balkans. Despite efforts by United States diplomats to finesse the issue, President Francois Mitterrand said this weekend that he was determined to raise it during the NATO summit meeting that opens here on Monday.
According to officials here and in Washington, both France and the Netherlands asked for United States air strikes last week to support the defenders of Sarajevo during heavy shelling by Serbian artillery. European officials said Washington, which proposed air strikes last spring, refused. But United States officials said the request went through the United Nations and might have been blocked there.
A senior Administration official said NATO had recently renewed its warnings to the Serbian Government "against the strangulation of Sarajevo," and he indicated that he expected no strikes in the next few days. Such warnings in the past have produced neither results on the ground nor United States military intervention.
In his speech, Mr. Clinton issued what sounded like a sharp reminder to Western Europe that the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is first of all a European problem. He said the well-being of the continent, once threatened by Soviet armies, is now at risk from "creeping instability" caused by ethnic strife, sick economies, rampant nationalism, nuclear proliferation and the possible "rise of aggressive regimes."
 
Pain vs. Promise
 Portraying today's situation in Eastern Europe as "a race between rejuvenation and despair," Mr. Clinton warned against "the grim pretenders to tyranny's dark throne -- the militant nationalists and demagogues who fan suspicions that are ancient and parade the pain of renewal in order to obscure the promise of reform."
His main target was evidently Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the Russian nationalist whose party ran more strongly than expected in the parliamentary elections on Dec. 12. Mr. Zhirinovsky favors the kind of aggressive Russian expansionism that has cost Eastern Europeans their freedom in the past.
But the President offered a vigorous rebuttal to those here and in the United States who have argued that Poland, Hungary and other Eastern European nations should be admitted to NATO as soon as possible. Siding with Moscow, which strongly opposes such action now, Washington has proposed a compromise "Partnership for Peace," to be adopted at the two-day talks here, that stops well short of NATO membership.
 
Urges European Unity
 Mr. Clinton pressed Europe hard toward greater economic, political and military integration, saying the United States "will benefit more from a strong and equal partner than from a weak one." Demoralized by its own economic and political difficulties and by the ethnic turmoil to its east, western Europe saw its drive toward unity stall last year.
"Europe as a whole cannot be secure if the eastern half remains in turmoil," Mr. Clinton said.
At another point in his 32-minute speech, he declared: "The new security must be found in Europe's integration -- an integration of security forces, of market economies, of national democracies. The purpose of my trip to Europe is to help lead the movement and to assure you that America will be a strong partner in it."
In a brief exchange with reporters after his speech, Mr. Clinton returned to a possible nuclear agreement with Ukraine. Under such an accord, Ukraine would send more than 1,600 warheads back to Russia for dismantling. That would promote stability in a jittery region, ease tensions between Moscow and Kiev and relieve the worsening economic crisis in Ukraine.
 
Uncertainty About Ukraine
 During the dismantling, the highly enriched uranium that forms the key part of the warheads would be extracted by Russian technicians and transformed into a lower-grade material suitable for use in nuclear power plants in Ukraine. A quasi-public United States company, comparable to the Tennessee Valley Authority, would defray most of the cost, White House aides said.
From Mr. Clinton on down, the American party seemed nervous about predicting success in the talks with the Ukrainians and the Russians, partly because President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine has not proved able in the past to deliver on his promises.
But talking to reporters during a stop at a cafe, the President sounded as if he had put all the past frustration out of his mind. He spoke of "a terrific amount of progress" and said, the track record notwithstanding, that "presumably Mr. Kravchuk would not agree to anything that he didn't think he could sell."
But it is not clear whether Mr. Kravchuk has the political strength to conclude such an agreement without the approval of his Parliament, which has scuttled past agreements. And the terms of Russia's financial commitment also remain unsettled, White House aides said.
"We have made a great deal of progress," a senior Administration official involved in the talks said tonight. "But we are not quite there yet, and work continues."

SLOVAKIA ACCEPTS U.S. PLAN
 BRATISLAVA, Slovakia, Jan. 9 (Special to The New York Times) -- Slovakia, created just a year ago when Czechoslovakia split in two, today became the second country to announce formal acceptance of President Clinton's plan for a partial security partnership with the West instead of full membership in NATO.
But Slovakia, which has five million people, made it clear that it is endorsing the plan less out of fear of Russia than out of a desire to protect its integrity against separatist demands from its Hungarian minority. On Saturday, Hungary told the United States it would go along with the plan.

HEADLINE: Moynihan Urges Prosecutor To Study Clinton Land Deal

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York today became the first Democrat to publicly urge Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate President Clinton's involvement in an Arkansas real estate venture linked to a failed savings and loan.
Mr. Moynihan suggested that the only way to clear the air of questions that have been building about the President's involvement in the venture, the Whitewater Development Company, was for Mr. Clinton to "get some good lawyer working on that issue while we go ahead on other things." 
 "Just turn it over to the prosecutor and let him find out," Mr. Moynihan said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." He also suggested that Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, release all of the pertinent documents to the public to prove that they have "nothing to hide."
"Presidents can't be seen to have any hesitation about any matter that concerns their propriety," Mr. Moynihan said. "And this is an honorable man. We have a fine President. He has nothing to hide."
 
Previous Calls Rejected
 The Administration has rejected a growing chorus of Republican demands that an outside investigator be appointed to examine the case, which centers on the business practices of James B. McDougal, an Arkansas businessman and Clinton supporter who owned the savings and loan, Madison Guaranty. He was also a partner with the Clintons on Whitewater, a failed effort to create a retirement community in the Ozarks. The Justice Department is now investigating whether Madison Guaranty improperly funneled money into Whitewater or into Mr. Clinton's 1984 re-election campaign for Governor of Arkansas.
Ms. Reno has said that any investigator appointed by her would be seen as biased. But her aides said on Thursday that if Congress renews a law that would allow her to ask a court to appoint a special prosecutor she would do so.
The Clintons have said they lost $69,000 on the investment and that there is no evidence of wrongdoing on their part. Last week, their lawyer, David Kendall, turned over five boxes of Whitewater-related documents to the Justice Department, but only after negotiating a subpoena that would protect all of the files from public scrutiny.
Asked today whether the Administration was stonewalling, Mr. Moynihan said his initial reaction was: "What's going on here? Why isn't this all out in the open?"
White House officials have said the questions raised about the matter have been politically motivated and that there is little more to say. Appearing on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," Vice President Al Gore continued that line of defense today.
"There has been no specific allegation of criminal wrongdoing," Mr. Gore said. "What there has been is a series of political attacks."
Referring to a recent spate of encouraging economic news, he said, "I think there's been a little bit of political panic about the fact that everything's going so well, and so they're unleashing these attacks on him."
White House officials have been debating the merits of cutting their political losses by allowing the appointment of a special counsel, but Mr. and Mrs. Clinton have remained adamant in their opposition to such an approach.
As a result, Mr. Clinton's advisers have looked to other lines of defense. Last week, David R. Gergen, the counselor to the President, suggested that the Whitewater dispute was grounded in nothing more than political attack that was symbolic of an erosion of fair play in the nation's capital.
"We continue to believe that the special prosecutor standard has not been met," George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to the President, said today. "There has not been a specific allegation from a credible source." The White House, he said, was "fully cooperating" with the Justice Department's inquiry of Madison Guaranty.
 
Influence Unclear
 Mr. Stephanopoulos would not say whether Mr. Moynihan's comments would influence White House thinking about full disclosure or the appointment of a special prosecutor.
But the New York Democrat's statements today could undermine the White House's assertion that the calls for independent investigation have been purely partisan, and make it increasingly difficult for officials to continue to hold the line for the Clintons, who are traveling in Europe this week.
In an interview after his appearance, Mr. Moynihan said: "I was just stating my view that a situation such as this will stay there and stay there and stay there until you do the thing, which eventually you will do -- turn the papers over, name a special counsel and get on with governing. We have a President with nothing to hide."
No one was quicker to leap on Mr. Moynihan's statement than Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader.
"I know it's been a tough week for the White House 'damage control experts,' " Mr. Dole said in a statement. "But no matter how hard they try, they can't obscure this fact: much of the Whitewater controversy to date has been caused by their own blunders."
Ms. Reno has repeatedly emphasized that the career prosecutor at the Justice Department who has been assigned the Madison Guaranty investigation, Donald Mackay, is a Republican who served in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.

HEADLINE: What Clinton Won't Find in Russia: Misty-Eyed Nostalgia for Jeans and Coca-Cola

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Back in the old Soviet days, an American-Soviet summit meeting was a time for the Kremlin's propaganda machine to go into overdrive with a torrent of shows, books and articles about the United States.
No matter that most of it was tendentious stuff about the "Negro problem" or American "militarism" -- nobody listened to any of that. 
 Instead, everyone watched for the glimpses of glittering stores, dream cars, bright clothes, soaring skyscapers. Many a middle-aged Russian can still remember the first time he saw "The Magnificant Seven" or got his first pair of Levi jeans.
The summit meeting itself would be grand, every event televised, every handshake a testament to a desperately desired recognition by that dreamland across the seas.
 
Protest in a Minor Key
 But that was way back then. This time, newspapers have carried only staid reports on President Clinton's visit this week, usually focusing on the debate over which country should join NATO and in what capacity.
The only emotional event somehow linked to the visit was a demonstration by a clutch of unrepentant reactionaries who placed a wreath in memory of those killed in the assault on the Parliament building in October. The group then moved on to United States Embassy across the street to chant, "Yankees Go Home!" and speakers asserted that the assault on Parliament had been coordinated from Washington and that uniformed Americans had fired on the building from the Embassy.
 
The Old 'America' Is Gone
 That position was not one that many Russians would take seriously. Despite such oratory, and the xenophobia of the ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, there have been no serious signs that anti-American sentiment is growing. What has happened, rather, is that familiarity and hard experience have succeeded where the Communists failed: in dispersing the American myth.
"America, the hope we realized and lost, left us as irretrievably as youth," wrote Evgeny Kulakov, in a reflection in the magazine Obozrevatel. "Even if we once again put on our faded jeans, we've grown up, and our America has ceased to be -- although, of course, it never existed."
In part, of course, the relative lack of advance excitement over Mr. Clinton's arrival also reflects the fact that Russians have far more immediate concerns, including the first meeting of the new Federal Assembly on Tuesday, and the expectation of a Government shuffle by President Boris N. Yeltsin that will determine the country's economic course.
More important, America no longer packs the magic it once did.
In the first years of reforms initiated by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and in the first years of the "new Russia" of Mr. Yeltsin, there was the faith that once Russia lifted its barbed wire, elected a parliament and opened a stock exchange, an exultant West would rush in with aid and investments, quickly bringing Russians the dimly glimpsed fruits of the West.
 
Who Can Afford a Big Mac?
 The fruits did flow in: kiwis, Mars bars, Cadillacs, Cokes and Big Macs have flooded Moscow. But for most Russians, who cannot afford such goodies, they only underscore their poverty.
Western advisers also flowed in, but the neatly bound reports they produced after a few days in a luxury hotel did not do much good. Little of the promised billions in aid ever materialized, and Russians watched in growing disenchantment as first Mr. Gorbachev, then Mr. Yeltsin, returned from the West with empty hands.
At home, hasty economic reforms, loudly applauded by the West, created a brash underworld and a newly rich nomenklatura, but served largely to impoverish most Russians. Freely elected deputies proved as greedy and power-hungry as they had been when they were Communist apparatchiks.
Coupled with the economic and political disillusionment was the humiliation as Washington and the West seemed no longer to reckon with Russia in their global pursuits. Interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia struck into regions that Russians considered their spheres of interest. And applications for NATO membership by ex-satellites seemed to confirm the worst fears of Western encirclement.
 
'Twin Peaks.' Yes, 'Twin Peaks.'
 Still, the dominant reaction was not indignation or resentment, but acceptance of realities once hidden.
For one thing, once it became accessible, America lost the allure of forbidden fruit. In recent weeks, for example, Russians have been intrigued by the television serial "Twin Peaks." But if a few years ago the Russians would been shocked at such sordid goings-on in America, most now seem to watch with the same familiarity as any Americans.
For another, most Russians realize that the United States, like Russia, acts first out of self-interest.
"There is no longer a sense that Great America will save us, but there's no hatred, either," said Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a reform economist and member of the new Parliament. "What there is, finally, is a normal attitude."
That will not prevent most Russians from tuning in for the drama inherent in any summit meeting. But this time they will not be looking for instant remedies or relief, or for a whiff of a distant dreamland.

Anyone who doubts the astonishing economic effect of the nation's headlong dash toward legalized gambling should come to this quirky hodgepodge of moss-draped live oaks and white-columned mansions, ragged beach and cheap bars that has been turned into a boom area by the arrival of eight major casinos over the past two years.
But if the Mississippi Gulf Coast from Biloxi to Bay St. Louis is a revealing window onto the economic power of legalized gambling, now a $30 billion nationwide business that has tripled in a decade, its experience is also raising two questions with national implications: how many communities can expect to make money on gambling -- and at what cost? 
 To proponents of gambling, the boom along this 35-mile stretch of Gulf Coast, once defined by modest tourist attractions like pastel-colored souvenir shops, goofy miniature golf courses and mom-and-pop seafood joints, is proof of what a powerful economic engine gambling has become.
 
Saturating the Market
 "To say the least, we've hit a home run, a long home run," said Chevis Swetman, president of People's Bank in Biloxi, where at one point recently 28 construction cranes towered over the shoreline. "Right now, we feel like we're probably the hottest spot in the United States for growth. And when was the last time you heard Mississippi being No. 1 in anything?"
But with plans to triple the number of gaming establishments here and to build the world's biggest casino and nine riverboat casinos 60 miles down the coast in New Orleans, and similar proposals sprouting up from Chicago to Mobile, Ala., many economists are asking how many areas can realistically expect to cash in on gambling. As many as 90 riverboat and dockside casinos could be operating around the nation within two years.
"There's probably not a major city in the United States that's not considering gambling," said Tim Ryan, dean of the college of business administration at the University of New Orleans. "It's an incredible explosion of gambling. This market is going to be saturated. It may already be saturated."
And if the Mississippi coast shows the economic potential of gambling to produce jobs and tax revenue, it also shows the risks, both in businesses displaced and lives ruined. Already, social service agencies and courts are seeing marriages destroyed or residents sinking into debt because of problem gambling.
"It's my observation that there's a lot of wreckage coming out of this gambling business here," said Judge William L. Stewart of Chancery Court in nearby Gulfport, who said he had seen at least 20 divorces and numerous failures to pay child support as a result of gambling losses.
 
Big, and Getting Bigger
 When a casino boat called the Europa Star began trips into the gulf a few years back to offer dockside gambling, it struck more than a few people as a rather forlorn effort to be a poor man's Las Vegas. No one is laughing now.
In Harrison County, home of Biloxi and seven of the eight casinos, the value of building permits for the first eight months of 1993 surged by 825 percent over the same period in 1992, to $102 million from $11 million. Unemployment fell to 4.2 percent in 1993 from 7.1 percent in 1992. The gaming establishments here, all dockside casinos in elaborate buildings, have already created more than 11,000 jobs. The 13 casinos operating in November in Mississippi produced $80 million in revenues; 17 casinos are now open, producing a tax bonanza for the state and local governments.
In neighboring Hancock County, one project, Casino Magic in Bay St. Louis, bills itself as the largest dockside casino development in the world. Owners say the 530-acre project will eventually include a 1,500-room hotel, 5,000-seat auditorium, 60,000 square-foot convention center, a park for motor homes and a golf course. The casino itself features 68 tables for games like blackjack, roulette and poker and more than 1,100 slot machines.
Another Casino Magic hall, down U.S. 90 in Biloxi, has just doubled in size to 55,000 square feet of gambling space with 70 gambling tables and 1,148 slot machines. Open since June 5, it welcomed its one millionth customer on Dec. 21.
Some skeptics worry that competition from New Orleans and other Mississippi towns will cut into business here. But Marlin F. Torguson, president of the Casino Magic Corporation, which reported $31.8 million in profit for the first three quarters of 1993, said there was plenty of business for everyone.
"They cater to the convention business, and they'll do great in New Orleans," Mr. Torguson said. "We'll do great here. People are looking for more entertainment options, and gaming is something new that's vying for the entertainment dollar."
 
Bitter Taste of Success
 Despite success that has exceeded all expectations here, residents may be more uneasy about gambling now than when it began.
Some, like Patrick Burke, worry about what the casinos are doing to the quality of life. Mr. Burke moved back to the Gulf Coast from Los Angeles two years ago seeking a more peaceful life and now finds his beachside cottage 200 yards from an all-day traffic jam and the state's largest casino.
"I want out of here so bad, I can't stand it," he said, complaining that he has not been able to sell his little plot of land to a casino. "I firmly believe local politicians and especially the planning department don't have the education or skills to deal with what's going on. They are country boys used to playing in sewers, and what's coming here is big time."
The shrimping business, once the dominant industry on the coast, is being forced out by casinos taking over the docks, leaving no room for shrimpers's boats and closing businesses like processing plants and ice plants. And despite the influx of visitors, some other tourism-related businesses say the casinos have siphoned off their customers.
Louis Skrmetta's Ship Island Excursions is a 66-year-old family-owned business that transports tourists to an offshore barrier island. After years of steady growth, business fell 10 percent last year, Mr. Skrmetta said.
"I've never worked harder, and anticipated more and been more disappointed," he said. "Now that the casinos are here, I think a lot of people would like to vote them out."
 
Convenient and Addictive
 And, if gambling is an affordable recreation for most customers, with slot machines as cheap as 5 cents, gambling problems are soaring here. The number of Gamblers Anonymous Chapters has grown to five from none, and counselors at Recovery Resources, a private center that helps compulsive gamblers, say they are seeing an increasing number of middle-income people who have piled up debts of $25,000 to $35,000, taken second mortgages on homes and emptied savings or retirement accounts.
One 31-year-old waitress and mother of two said that she had been a casual bingo player before the gaming halls arrived, but that with big-time casinos so convenient had found herself gambling her whole paycheck and savings before she sought help.
"It got to the point I was going almost every day," she said. "It's like those machines hypnotize you. I used to dream about them at night, ching, ching, ching, the sound of the slots. I didn't vote for or against the boats, but I really think it's a bad thing now."
Still, few doubt the overall economic impact thus far has been positive. It has certainly been a windfall to struggling local governments.
Dianne Harenski, a member of the Biloxi City Council, said the city originally expected $500,000 a month in revenues from its casino tax. The figure for the most recent month was $1.2 million. That has allowed the city to end its $6.50-a-month garbage fee, buy seven police cars and two fire trucks, and plan major capital projects that had been needed for years.
Ms. Harenski said a shakeout was inevitable and doubted that every community could profit as Biloxi has. Still, she said, it is hard to argue with an industry that has transformed a "very, very depressed" area and brought in the kind of revenues and jobs no one could have imagined a few years back.
But Professor Ryan of New Orleans said the casinos' business would taper off, just like lottery revenues have, as the novelty wore off and the market became glutted. That should be a warning to cities like New Orleans, which could find dollars diverted from restaurants and other attractions for gambling.
"This industry has been tremendously oversold," he said. "We need to separate the casino industry from new manufacturing companies or new agricultural industries. Generally, the casino industry is not creating new wealth; it's only recycling wealth and putting it in different pockets."
But Professor Ryan conceded that there was still a huge pent-up demand for gambling. When even conservative Mississippi is willing to legalize 24-hour gambling with 24-hour liquor and no limits on betting, it is clear that people believe there is money to be made.
Gary Letterman of Hickory, N.C., was feeding coins into the $5 Home Run slot machine at Casino Magic in Bay St. Louis one chilly December morning, after flying in for the day from Charlotte on the charter flight the casino arranges to some 35 cities. He rolled his eyes at the notion that an earlier generation of Southerners might have frowned on the casino dream world springing up now.
"We've been doing this in back rooms for years," Mr. Letterman said. "Now we can just get on with it."

HEADLINE: 1993 Homicides Fewer but More Clustered in New York City

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY

 BODY:
From the rectory of the St. Jerome Catholic Church in the South Bronx the Rev. John Grange hears gunfire every night on the streets below. "We used to do about a funeral a month here," Father Grange said. But with shootings and other tolls of urban life, he said, "now we do a funeral a week."
But on the east side of Manhattan, in the neighborhood of United Nations diplomats and quiet streets of exclusive apartments, the gunfire might as well be in a distant city. "We all feel sorry and feel bad about all the crime and violence in the city," said Gloria Sandmeyer, who lives in Tudor City. But as for crime in her neighborhood, she said, "We don't think about it much." 
 Although police statistics show that the number of homicides in New York City declined in 1993, for the third year in a row, the improvement is occurring largely in neighborhoods like Ms. Sandmeyer's, while neighborhoods in the South Bronx, eastern Brooklyn and upper Manhattan are bearing a greater proportion of the killings.
 
Clusters of Killings
 In fact killings are so clustered that 12 of the city's 75 police precincts -- all in those areas of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan -- reported a total of 854 homicides, or 43.6 percent of the 1,960 homicides reported by precinct and borough officials citywide in 1993. Although the total number in those precincts declined slightly in recent years, their percentage grew, from 39.2 percent in 1990.
By contrast, the 12 precincts reporting the smallest number of homicides -- six or less -- are sprinkled in every borough except the Bronx. Taken together they reported a total of 37 homicides, less than half the number they registered three years ago, when the city's murder rate hit a peak.
Thirty-one precincts reported an average of one homicide a month or less last year. Three of them -- the 123d Precinct on the southern end of Staten Island, the 6th Precinct on the west side of Greenwich Village and the 20th Precinct on the west side of Central Park between 59th and 86th Streets -- each reported just one homicide. And Manhattan's 17th Precinct, east of Lexington Avenue between 30th and 59th Streets, was the only one reporting none.
 
'Movement to Safety'
 Robert McCrie, an associate professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the growing disparity reflected "a movement to safety by people who can afford to move to safer neighborhoods."
"The safer neighborhoods become safer and the other neighborhoods suffer because of the economic disparity," he said. "Our neighborhoods have become more concentrated in terms of their socio-economic culture. A century ago, rich and poor lived closer to each other."
Philip McGuire, director of the crime analysis section of the Police Department said of crime: "When it goes down it pulls back into the areas that are more economically depressed. These are areas where criminals come in to do other things, deal drugs and rob."
The tally of 1,960 homicides for 1993 is based on unofficial figures gathered by The New York Times from the city's 75 police precincts. Although the Police Department last week said there were 1,995 homicides last year, a top police official later said the number was in error and released an estimate of 1,960 to 1,970. Still, officials said the final tally, due in March, was likely to change as homicide reports are examined over the next two months.
The preliminary total shows a steady decline from the city's homicide record of 2,245 in 1990. In 1991 there were 2,154 homicides, and in 1992 the number was 1,995.
 
Community Policing Credited
 Police officials credit the overall decline in murders to its community policing program, which puts more officers on the street. Also, the number of police officers has grown. In 1990 there were 26,000 officers; and by next month the department expects to have 31,351 officers, said Chief John Timoney, the commanding officer of the New York City Police Department's Office of Management Analysis and Planning.
But community policing may have its limits, particularly in places like the East New York section of Brooklyn, with its high concentration of housing projects, said Deputy Police Chief Kenneth Gussman, commanding officer of the Brooklyn detective command. "There's a sense that community policing works better in middle class, homogeneous neighborhoods," he said. "There's a real sense of community in those areas.
"You take where I live, out in Bay Ridge, people get excited about double-parked cars. People have owned their homes there for 20 years. It's less transient than in areas with a lot of housing projects."
Mr. Timoney also blames the availability of guns for the high murder rates in certain neighborhoods. "What happens is it's almost self-fulfilling," he said. " 'I carry it so I have to use it.' It's a circle and it's spinning faster."
 
Fear, Even in Church
 And in those neighborhoods the violence is difficult to avoid, and everyone seems to have a perspective on it.
Father Grange opened his church's death registry last week and read the ages of the people he had buried last year: "29 . . . 15 . . . 23 . . . "
"If it isn't a bullet it's AIDS," he said. His church is in the 40th Precinct in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx, which reported 70 homicides last year.
Even though his church is across the street from the precinct police station, Father Grange said altar boys had told him they would not leave through the back door of the church for fear of being shot. "It creates a sense of unfairness of life," he said, "that you can become a victim without cause."
Danielle McDaniels, 23, rounded a corner in the South Bronx walking home last July and was stopped by neighbors who told her there had been a shooting on her block. A 20-year-old friend of hers had been killed instantly when someone driving by shot her in the head and abdomen, Ms McDaniels said.
"You don't know when it's going to happen," she said. "You could be coming from the store and if they want you, it could be you or your children."
A color picture of a mural painted in memory of Ms. McDaniels's friend Jessica hung recently on the wall of a church on Prospect Avenue along with 16 pictures of similar murals for other neighborhood victims of the violence. They were hung around a sign that said "Thou Shalt Not Kill" in both English and Spanish.
Heidi Neumark, the pastor of the Transfiguration Lutheran Church, said she feared that the violence in the inner city glanced off the consciousness of the general public.
She marvels at the public attention stirred by the shootings on the Long Island Rail Road. "That's a horrible tragedy, but this is a much more horrible tragedy if you talk about numbers," she said. "People have given up in a lot of cases. 'Well, it's the Bronx, what do you expect?' That's not what we should expect."
On Good Friday last year, as Pastor Neumark and other adults at the church led children on a procession down the sidewalk they came to a subway stop where men were gathered, selling drugs, Pastor Neumark said. The men saw a car approaching, filled with people they thought were there to shoot them. "They yelled for everyone to take cover," she said. "The people in the car, out of respect, or whatever, shot up in the air."
"The war they're having is not a private war," Debra Simmons, a church member said of the drug dealers. "We're all in it."
 
Atmosphere for Killing
 The steadiest rise in homicides in recent years has been in a string of neighborhoods across eastern Brooklyn where three precincts reported the most slayings last year. The 75th Precinct reported 126 homicides, up from 109 in 1990; the 77th Precinct reported 82 homicides, up from 70; and the 73d Precinct reported 74 homicides, up from 60.
Deputy Chief Gussman said the large number of public housing developments in the eastern end of Brooklyn "provides a ready clientele for drugs," an atmosphere that often leads to shootings.
James Bowens, the chairman of the community council in the 73d Precinct in Brownsville, said his neighborhood was a working-class community increasingly overshadowed by "these idiots out there shooting people with no apparent reason."
"Everybody says, 'I need a gun to protect myself from him' and the others say, 'I need a gun to protect myself from him,' " Mr. Bowens said. "It's frightening to the point that as a citizen you can't walk down the street without worrying."
 
Some Large Reductions
 Even among the most crime-ridden neighborhoods there are examples of large reductions in murders. The 34th Precinct in Washington Heights, which had 103 homicides in 1990, reported 75 homicides last year, making it the fourth leading precinct for homicides in 1993.
Police officials said the precinct had been the focus of increased police activity by narcotics agents and other officers following a July 1992 disturbance there ignited by the fatal shooting of a man by a police officer.
Mr. Timoney, of the police department's office of management analysis and planning, said he expected the areas of Brooklyn now plagued by growing numbers of murders would see increased police activity.
But he said he was concerned that over all, the public would become complacent as the city's total murder level continues to decline.
"I think we have become inured to this stuff," Mr. Timoney said. "Now we're happy if we keep it under 2,000. That's ridiculous."

HEADLINE: After Snow, Cold Alone Isn't So Bad

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
Heads and shoulders braced against the freezing wind, the Falzone family trudged through the chunks of ice and snow drifts outside Giants Stadium yesterday, the parents laden with blankets, the two boys wrapped so that little more than their cold-chapped cheeks showed.
Wicked a day as it was, there were no complaints about the cold from this bunch. It was kickoff time. Pointing a gloved finger at her heavily bundled sons who waddled toward the stadium behind their father, Angela Falzone, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., said, "It was too cold to tailgate, but they wanted to be here, so we came." 
 Not everyone had a National Football League playoff game as an excuse. But across the region, as if itching to shake cabin fever after a week of rain, snow and sleet, the hardy ventured out yesterday, moving cars onto slippery roads, walking through iced-over parks and plowing down ski slopes.
"I lost a few days this week because of all the snow," said Marianne Addicott of Fairfield, Conn., who took her usual four-mile walk despite temperatures in the low to middle 20's. "When that happens I start getting real antsy and fidgety. It's cold, but real pretty out here today. As long as I'm bundled up enough, I'm fine."
 
A Switch to Sand
 Others were outside with work to do, as cities and towns were still struggling to keep roads and sidewalks clear of ice. Though the primary roads in New York City were mostly clear by midday yesterday, many side streets, from Manhattan to Queens to Staten Island, remained covered with chunks of ice and snow.
Anne Canty, a spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitation, which is responsible for clearing the roads, said that every road had been cleared or salted at least once. But with the freezing temperatures, she said, the department had suspended salting efforts (which help melt the ice) in favor of spreading sand, which provides extra traction for car tires. More than half the department's workers -- 4,000 people -- were called in on overtime.
"Everybody we could reach, we have," she said.
Conditions today are expected to improve slightly, with temperatures reaching the upper 20's and winds abating after an overnight dip into the low teens. And the road-clearing efforts should pay off for commuters. By late yesterday, most major thoroughfares in New Jersey and Long Island were reported clear; in Connecticut, the Department of Transportation said the state highways would be clear by this morning.
 
A Return to Normal
 Homeless shelters also found themselves working in overdrive, with men and women huddling at their doors looking for a warm place to sleep.
Josh Taylor, a spokesman for the Partnership for the Homeless in New York City, said the group's 150 shelters were filled to capacity over the weekend. He said 35 people, the most ever, spent Saturday night in the group's drop-in center on West 23d Street because no room was left in its shelters. And yesterday morning, when the temperature fell to 13 degrees in Central Park, 120 people showed up for breakfast, more than twice as many as usual, he said.
But as the sun came out and the air cleared, some things slowly moved back to normal.
On Long Island, for example, though as many as 36,000 Lilco customers were without power on Friday at the height of the storm, a spokeswoman for the Long Island Lighting Company said yesterday that all service had been restored. In New Jersey, nearly all of the 130,000 customers whose electricity and gas service was interrupted had service restored by 6 A.M. yesterday.
And residents from Massapequa to Morristown took advantage of more tranquil weather to venture out of their homes for the first time in days.
 
Fun Beats the Cold
 At the Channel Home Center on Hackensack Avenue in Hackensack, N.J., snow removal items vanished from shelves just as quickly as they could be stocked, as people moved outside to shovel snow and wrench ice from their cars.
"I've got nothing left with the exception of maybe a gallon or two of windshield washer fluid, and that's probably gone by now too," said Robert Saker, the store's manager. "Snow shovels are gone, de-icer fluid, salt, scrapers -- I've even sold the last of my garden shovels left over from the summer."
In Prospect Park in Brooklyn, dogs raced across the hard-packed snow, following owners who pulled their children on sleds. Some adults and children slid and spun down little hills in plastic saucers. Earmuffed runners made their way down the park's main road.
"Fun beats out the cold any day," said Brigid McGinn, 32, of Park Slope, as she pulled the strap of a toboggan holding 3 1/2-year-old Rosie Zion-Malloy, a neighbor's daughter, over the icy slopes.
Nearby, Marti Andersen, 33, walked up a steep slope of the park with his wood tripod on his shoulders, his cameras in a large white bag. "All you have to say is: Look how beautiful it is," Mr. Andersen said, looking up at the crystalline tree branches. "For all the people who can't get to Vermont to photograph the real forest, you have this one here."
 
Ski Areas Thrive
 At local ski areas and parks, attendance was back to normal as well, officials said.
At Catamount Ski Area, located on the New York-Massachusetts border, more than 4,000 skiers were on the resort's 23 slopes. At Bear Mountain State Park near West Point, N.Y., where the temperature stayed in the teens, about 1,200 people turned up to skate, about normal for a weekend day in better weather, said Sean Mahon, a supervisor of the rink.
And on the Staten Island Ferry, Ricardo Ramos, 30, an unemployed salesman from Greenwich Village, sat on an orange bench on the deck, braving winds that sent others scurrying inside. He was on his way to Staten Island to see his mother.
"I'm wearing my wool coat; I had this made for me," he said, referring to a knee-length Hudson Bay coat with thick brown leather patches sewn onto the elbow and chest areas. "I like the air out here and I can feel the chill on my face, but I'm warm in this coat. My advice is to invest in one good huge coat."

Wagner Legacy Survives in Counsel to Giuliani

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
A LARGE ceremonial guest book was kept in the front foyer of Gracie Mansion when Robert F. Wagner Jr., then still known as Robert F. Wagner 3d, was growing up there during his father's three terms as Mayor.
"I peeked into it, and noticed that the name of Robert F. Wagner 3d appeared on almost every page," Philip Hamburger wrote in 1954 in The New Yorker. "I gathered that almost every time the Mayor's oldest son enters the Mansion, he signs his name." 
 Mr. Wagner was 10 then, not much older than Andrew Giuliani is today, and for nearly 40 years more he regularly viewed his city with the gentle grace and the acquired sagacity of a privileged visitor. Mr. Wagner's legacy is more than the name in the guest book, or even his distinguished record as City Planning Commission chairman, deputy mayor and president of the Board of Education. Mr. Wagner, a lifelong Democrat, died last November before his time, but not before outlining a vision for New York that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate whom Mr. Wagner endorsed, largely embraced and may now embody.
Eulogizing Mr. Wagner last week at Cooper Union, Mr. Giuliani recalled that as he crammed for the campaign two years ago, one of the first experts who agreed to brief him was Mr. Wagner. That tape-recorded soliloquy provided the foundation for Mr. Giuliani's platform, and a copy of the tape, obtained from the Giuliani staff, still offers clues to his philosophy in formation. The words are a reminder of how much Mr. Wagner already is missed as a moral gyroscope for the fledgling administration and as a Talleyrand to the new Mayor. This is the gist of what he said:
The city remains ascendant as it lurches toward the millennium, but at the pace of a struggling mountain climber, not a jet plane. With more people leaving the work force than entering, for the first time since World War I everybody who wants a job might have the opportunity to get one, but only if they are armed with a high school or college degree. Today the problems of poverty and maintaining upward mobility are greater than ever.
To spur the economy, often the best thing city government can do is get out of the way. Encourage development of downtowns outside Manhattan, of Broadway theater and of other cultural and economic resources. Let the Housing Authority assume all responsibility for low-income housing. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, using the Nehemiah home-ownership project as a model, should revive a 1990's version of the Mitchell-Lama program that combined tax subsidies and lowered land costs to create apartments for the middle-class and working poor.
Simplify waterfront planning and rationalize zoning codes to make development less dependent on official whims. Maintain the role of community boards.
To curb congestion and pollution and to pay for transportation improvements, regulate use of cars. One way is to impose tolls on the free East River bridges ("I would advise no candidate to say it"). Build rail links to the airports and to New Jersey. Spending more than 13 percent of the budget to repay borrowing for public works is not too much, given the demands of the water supply, waste disposal, health and school systems and shortchanged city parks.
Granting hospitals autonomy and imposing accountability may be more practical than selling them off ("I don't know that there are people who are anxious to buy municipal hospitals"). Nursing homes for the frail elderly and community-based care for AIDS sufferers would relieve hospital overcrowding.
Official policies sometimes reward dependency rather than promote early intervention by social workers and settlement houses. More schools, services and sex education are crucial for young women who are pregnant or likely to beome so ("I would stay away from the condom issue"). So are residential programs that combine education and job training for "disconnected" young men. Model Cities, which singled out neighborhoods in which social services were integrated, is a concept worth resurrecting. Docking women on welfare who have more children tends to punish the child more than the mother.
Despite the city's vast overall budget for education, spending per student in regular classrooms lags behind suburban schools. Joining with other mayors and county executives might persuade the state to assume a greater share of Medicaid and welfare costs. But the only way to correct inequities in state aid formulas may be to sue.
The combination of collective-bargaining rights and Civil Service protection hobbles good management. (Why, Mr. Giuliani asked, does a commander of a precinct where crime declines gets no reward but one in a precinct where crime increases receives more resources?). Without accountability, turning services over to private contractors does not guarantee improvement ("I happen to be somewhat skeptical of it").
Buck a bureaucracy where innovators can become enemies of the system. Give the boroughs, not necessarily the borough presidents, more say over delivery of city services. Don't create five borough boards of education ("one is bad enough").
"What troubles me," Mr. Wagner said, "as much as any of the fiscal problems is the lack of leadership. What can determine what kind of city we are in the next century will be leadership as much as a set of specific policies."
Mr. Wagner, sensing in Mr. Giuliani the potential for leadership, was just starting to place his signature on the new administration when he died. Now, with his voice surviving only on tape, the last legacy of the little boy whose immortality began modestly with the Gracie Mansion guest book is up to Mr. Giuliani to redeem.

HEADLINE: Patents

BYLINE: By Teresa Riordan

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A CONTROVERSIAL inventor, Jerome Lemelson, and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, Lester Thurow, are expected to announce today the establishment of a program that will award annually the largest cash prize ever given to an individual inventor.
The prize, the amount of which is expected to be announced today at a lunch at the "21" Club in New York, is part of a $6.5 million innovation and invention program to be directed by Mr. Thurow at M.I.T. The program is endowed by Mr. Lemelson, who holds 500 patents, more than any other living American. 
 Mr. Lemelson, 70, is a heroic figure to many individual inventors and holds patents for, among other things, a fax machine, a copy machine and a cordless telephone. Mr. Lemelson's critics have said that he is a shrewd litigant who wields patents for paper inventions to force corporations to pay him millions of dollars in licensing fees. Mr. Lemelson has countered that independent inventors can only protect their rights through litigation.
 
Method to Speed Computer Processes
 Dao-Long Chen and Robert D. Waldron, both engineers in Fort Collins, Colo., have come up with a speedy equation that they say cuts by half the time it takes a computer to approximate the square root of a number. They recently received a patent that protects their algorithm, which appears to be at least the third such square-root equation explicitly covered by a patent.
Computers, which think in mathematical equations, must often compute square roots as they perform various functions. For example, the manipulation of three-dimensional drawings on a computer screen requires a computer to perform many square-root calculations. In semiconductor chips, the square root of the current running through an individual transistor is proportional to the voltage applied to the transistor. A sophisticated chip might have more than a million transistors, meaning that more than a million different square roots must be calculated.
A computer approaches its square-root calculations much as a human does: first by making an educated guess, plugging that guess into an algebraic formula (most often a variation of an equation called the Newton-Raphson method) and then using the answer to make an even more educated guess. This process repeats itself until the square root has been approximated.
Mr. Chen and Mr. Waldron said they had come up with a simplified version of the Newton-Raphson method that cuts by half the time a computer takes to make its educated guesses in calculating a square root.
Patent 5,268,857 was assigned to the NCR Corporation of Dayton, Ohio, which said it was not developing any products based on the patent, but it might license it.
 
Harnessing Wind From Moving Cars
 Thomas Alva Wither, a computer and electronics consultant in Royal Oak, Mich., has patented a way to capture electricity from wind generated by automobiles as they drive along highways.
"I came up with the idea while I was driving down the expressway, watching weeds being blown by the cars ahead of me," Mr. Wither said.
Mr. Wither said he envisioned a column of turbines marching down the median strips of urban expressways. The turbine rotors, which when viewed from the top or bottom resemble the letter S, would be pushed counterclockwise by the wind generated by the vehicles passing along either side of the median.
The turbines would be sheltered by a median structure 8 to 10 feet high and 3 feet wide, which would help keep what Mr. Wither calls "hostile" winds from slowing the rotor. The rotor would be attached to a flywheel that would turn a motor generator. The resulting electrical energy produced by the generator would be transmitted to a utility using a conduit encased in the base portion of the median.
"The beauty of this is that it's a clean source of energy that's available on a predictable basis when the utility companies need it -- during business hours," Mr. Wither said. "Most other wind-powered systems use natural wind, which is very unpredictable and often generates electricity during nonpeak hours."
Mr. Wither said he calculated that each mile of highway could accommodate 792 turbines, and that the optimal distance from the vehicle to the turbine was five feet.
Wayne State University, in conjunction with Mr. Wither, recently conducted a study on an expressway in Detroit and found that the winds generated by vehicles averaged 15 to 25 miles an hour, according to the inventor.
"That's enough wind to make it feasible," said Mr. Wither, who acknowledged that many other questions remained. Chief among them is how many miles of the turbines would be necessary to produce a significant amount of electricity.
Mr. Wither, who is promoting the invention through his company Vehilectrical Power Systems, received patent 5,272,378.
 
Nominees Sought For Inventor Award
 Intellectual Property Owners, an association based in Washington, will accept nominations until March 4 for its 21st annual Inventor of the Year award.
"Nominees should epitomize the American traditions of technological leadership and Yankee ingenuity," the association said in a brochure calling for nominations. More information can be obtained from the organization by calling (202) 466-2396.

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Tries to Protect Tourist Season From Spill

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Jan. 10

 BODY:
While Puerto Rican officials worked today to clean up the hundreds of thousands of gallons of heavy oil leaking from a grounded barge, they were also frantically working to prevent a disaster for its tourism industry.
Through faxes and telephone calls to tour packagers and travel agents around the United States, officials sought to dispel the notion that a large proportion of the island's beaches was despoiled by the gooey, black substance still escaping from the crippled barge, the Morris J. Berman, as it sat on a coral reef just 300 yards from the San Juan beachfront. 
 After all, officials say they do not know when the cleanup will be completed, and Puerto Rico's Governor, Pedro J. Rossello had called the incident "a catastrophe" just hours after it happened, a remark that travel industry figures privately criticized as ill-considered.
Today, however, Luis Fortuno, the head of the government's Tourism Company, defended Governor Rossello's assessment as accurate at the time but said the weather and other factors since then had limited the spill's impact.
As they were declaring a qualified victory in their effort to let people know that only 3 out of 258 miles of beach here had been affected, even tourist industry officials were willing to be magnanimous toward the Governor.
"I'm sure it is a major disaster in his mind in terms of environmental impact, but I think it was overstated in terms of tourism," said Richard Abati, the manager of the Sands Hotel and Casino on the Isla Verde section of San Juan, which is five miles from the spill area but is unaffected. "The information we have is that tour packagers have had a lot of calls about the spill, and because they have information from us they are able to tell people that the impact is concentrated and limited."
Mr. Abati, president of the island's Hotel and Tourism Association, said there were only sketchy numbers on the impact of the spill on hotel occupancy.
 
First Hearing on Incident
 The details of what happened before the spill on Friday are likely to be revealed tomorrow when the Coast Guard holds its first hearing and publicly questions the crew of the barge and its tug boat, the Emily.
The chief investigator, Capt. Larry Doyle, a marine safety officer in the Coast Guard's Miami office, said the inquiry would discover whether the cause of the incident was human error, equipment failure or regulatory inadequacies. He said a final report was not expected for perhaps two or three months.
More than 3.7 million people visited Puerto Rico in 1992, tourism officials said, and the industry accounts for about 6 percent or $2.5 billion of the island's $34 billion gross national product and employs 45,000 people, directly and indirectly. The largest sector of the economy, manufacturing, accounts for 41 percent.
 
Moving to Other Hotels
 Tourism officials said that some reservations had been canceled at the five hotels whose beaches were most affected by the spill and that some frustrated vacationers had checked out early. But they said the impact on tourism overall had been minimized because many visitors had transferred to unaffected hotels.
At the largest of the hotels affected by the spill, the Caribe Hilton, only 50 percent of the 733 rooms were occupied immediately after the incident. The hotel lost 20 to 30 reservations a day and had to ferry an equal number of guests to hotels farther from the spill.
But by today, occupancy was up to 85 percent as oil skimmers, pumps and tank trucks continued to clean the hotel beachfront along a sheltered cove, where much of the oil had drifted with the currents and been corraled. Some of the hotel's rooms were occupied by workers brought in for the cleanup and investigation.
 
Ice Storms vs. Black Sand
 "Fortunately the weather up north has outperformed the oil spill as a factor for us," said Brian Gamache, vice president for marketing for three hotels along the beach. The snow, sleet and cold weather that have gripped the Northeast have brought many people to the island, Mr. Gamache said, regardless of the spill.
Mr. Fortuno of the tourism office also said none of the 25 cruise ships that dock here in an average week had canceled stops in San Juan.
In New York, Steven Lassman, a sales director for Travel Impressions, a tour packager, said he had talked to all of the travel agents who had booked January visits to the five beachfront hotels. Visitors were given the option of moving to other hotels, flying to other islands, or canceling.
"I can tell you that the early returns were surprising because you would have thought that a lot would have been saying, 'I'm out of here,' " said Mr. Lassman. "But the majority are staying put. Only about 35 percent wanted to move to other hotels, but very few are canceling or going elsewhere."
Richard Ellis, senior vice president for marketing for Liberty Go-Go Tours in New Jersey, also said there had been "no pullback in Puerto Rico bookings."
Today, the white beach at the Sands Hotel was more crowded than usual, the numbers swelled significantly by those vacationers shuttled there in government vans from the affected hotels.
 
Line Broke Twice
 In addition to announcing the start of hearings, Captain Doyle gave some details of the grounding. He said the tow line connecting the barge with the tug boat broke for the first time at about 10 P.M. on Thursday and was repaired so that the vessels could resume their trip to Antigua a day and half away. But it a few hours later it broke again, at another spot along its 1,000-foot length, and this time the currents made the line difficult to retrieve.
"It is impossible to make a permanent repair of the towing cable at sea," said Captain Doyle. "We will be looking at the captain's decision to go on after the first repair and whether it was prudent. There are instances when this is done without any problems."
Captain Doyle said that he did not know where along the line the first break occurred but that the second break in the inch-and-a-half cable came at the point where it connected with the barge.
Commander Bob Ross, the San Juan marine safety officer directing the cleanup, said choppy seas had slowed the operation to empty the remaining oil from the crippled tanker. On Sunday, he estimated that workers had transferred 350,000 gallons of the 750,000 gallons of oil aboard the grounded Berman.
But he revised his estimate today, saying that much of what had been pumped was a mixture of oil and sea water that had been carried into the vessel by surf. He said that now he could say only that 850,000 gallons of the oil-water mixture had been transferred so far and could not predict exactly when the operation would be completed and the barge salvaged.

HEADLINE: Dow Soars 44.74 and Hits 4th Straight Record Close

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
Stocks soared to yet another high yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting its fourth consecutive record close.
The Dow jumped 44.74 points to close at 3,865.51, led by stocks of cyclical companies that benefit most in an expanding economy. Already in 1994, the widely watched index of blue-chip stocks has advanced 3 percent. Trading continued to be heavy, with 319.4 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, thus exceeding 300 million shares for the fifth straight session. 
 Analysts attributed the year's early run primarily to an improving economy and continuing low interest rates. Helpful seasonal factors, such as pension fund managers' need to invest new funds at the start of the year, also fueled the rise, they said.
"People think it's the best of all possible worlds now," Michael Metz, investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, said. "The economy is growing at a sustainable pace, the bond market is strong, and inflationary pressures seem to be under control."
Reflecting the sense that inflation holds no threat, gold for February delivery fell $1.50, to $385.70 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. On the New York Stock Exchange, American Barrick fell 1/4, to 29 1/4.
Inflation jitters that traders have had recently abated on Friday, when December employment data showed that nonfarm payrolls had grown by just 183,000 jobs -- fewer than the 215,000 jobs that economists had expected. That news prompted investors to conclude that the pressure was off the Federal Reserve to tighten short-term rates, setting the stage for a healthy bond market rally on Friday.
Further cheering Wall Street's bulls yesterday was across-the-board participation of stocks large and small: The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.75 points, to 786.69; the Standard & Poor's 500 gained 5.37 points, to a record 475.27, and the Dow Jones transportation average surged 20.37 points, to a record 1,819.58.
Chrysler was up 1 5/8, to 58 3/4; General Motors gained 1 3/8, to 59 1/4, and Ford was up 2 5/8, to 67 1/4, as analysts raised earnings estimates after meeting with auto executives at the Detroit Auto Show.
Eric Miller, investment strategist at DLJ Securities, said that the market was also benefiting from a temporary advantage in the supply-and-demand cycle of stocks. "For the early part of the year, demand just tends to be strong," he explained. "And at the moment, there is a slight lessening of new supply from new issues, because of the holidays."
 
 
Worry Over Speculation
 Mr. Miller added that while he saw no imminent end to the bull market, stocks were expensive in relation to corporate earnings. And, he said, investors are engaged in "a fair amount of speculation" -- a factor that always raises concerns about stock prices. And while Mr. Miller does not anticipate a meaningful rise in interest rates, he said it was worth noting that the significant declines in rates were over.
Mr. Metz said that while American stocks were being helped by short-term factors, like a move of investable money out of overseas stocks, there was reason to rein in optimism.
"The market is dominated by trend followers and fund managers trying to deploy the inflows of the last week or so," he said. "But I think it's time to take the money off the table. The market thinks it has the best of everything, and it's not justified."
Those most optimistic about stocks are overlooking a paradox in their bullish argument, Mr. Metz said. If investors are enthusiastic over cyclical stocks because they expect a surge in corporate earnings that comes from the ability to raise prices, "then what happens to the disinflation story?" he asked.
Investors can't have it both ways, Mr. Metz argued: either companies will enjoy noteworthy earnings increases because they can get prices up, or inflation will stay in check because companies can get only modest price gains.
Peter Eliades of Stockmarket Cycles, a West Coast investment newsletter, called the gains of the last week a stock market "blow-off," adding that the current price of the 30 Dow Jones industrial stocks divided by their dividends was at a measly 2.62 percent -- a sign that stocks are too expensive.
 
 
Yield Low for Years
 Optimists are making a case that dividend payouts will "grow into" the high stock market averages, putting the dividend yield closer to the 4.3 percent it has averaged over the last 80 years. Mr. Eliades acknowledges that the dividend yield has been low for several years, and that in the current enthusiasm over stocks, "even cats and dogs will do well."
On the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Surgical gained 2, to 25 7/8, after the company said its restructuring would result in an improvement in results for the balance of 1994.
And in Nasdaq trading, Compression Labs was up 2, to 14 1/4, after signing a nonbinding agreement with Intel to develop videoconferencing products. Carl Karcher Enterprises, gained 2, to 13 5/8, after announcing that it had signed a letter of intent with Boston Chicken to develop and operate as many as 300 Boston Chicken stores. Boston Chicken gained 3 3/4, to 41.
Standout losers amid all of yesterday's winners were the companies involved in the protracted drama to purchase Paramount Communications.
In the wake of Friday's news that Viacom would merge with Blockbuster Entertainment and raise its offer for Paramount, Viacom class B stock fell 2 3/4, to 38 1/4; Blockbuster lost 5/8, to 27 5/8, and Paramount was down 1 7/8, to 77 3/8. QVC, which said yesterday that it would extend its tender offer for Paramount for two weeks, dropped 1 3/8, to 39 1/4.

HEADLINE: UKRAINE GIVES IN ON SURRENDERING ITS NUCLEAR ARMS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton announced tonight that the United States, Russia and Ukraine had reached an agreement for the destruction of Ukraine's entire nuclear arsenal, 175 long-range missiles and more than 1,800 warheads. He described the deal as "a hopeful and historic breakthrough" that would not only benefit the three signers but enhance world security.
If it takes effect -- and questions lingered tonight about important details of ratification and timing -- the agreement would mean that all three of the non-Russian republics left with nuclear weapons at the breakup of the Soviet Union would have undertaken to surrender them voluntarily. Kazakhstan and Belarus, the other two countries, agreed last year to give up their warheads.
 
Accidents Feared
 Ukraine was the most difficult case, and the negotiations on the deal continued by telephone through this morning. Their success, Administration officials hoped, would help to reduce tensions between Moscow and Kiev, shore up the tottering Ukrainian economy and stabilize a shaky region. 
 Most important, however, the agreement would get the weapons out of the hands of a country ill-equipped to handle them. The Administration had feared they might be poorly maintained, leading to disastrous accidents, or that they might be transferred to some other nation or fall into the hands of reckless people within Ukraine itself.
American officials said that over the next two decades, sales of nuclear fuel made by reprocessing the uranium in warheads from former Soviet states would produce about $12 billion for those states, including more than $1 billion for Ukraine. Only modest American seed money would be involved in the reprocessing program, they asserted.
 
 
Meeting in Kiev
 Mr. Clinton has added a brief stop in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, to his current European itinerary. In a symbolic gesture, he will meet at the airport there late on Wednesday night with President Leonid Kravchuk, who will later travel to Moscow for a signing ceremony on Friday with Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
The agreement could still fall apart; Mr. Kravchuk has failed in the past to bring the Ukrainian Cabinet and Parliament with him on the disarmament issue. This time, Mr. Clinton said, "we have no reason to doubt the ability of the President to keep the commitment that he is prepared to make." But a senior Defense Department official sounded less certain.
"It's a good deal," the Pentagon aide said. "Let's just hope the Ukrainians and their Parliament recognize their own national interest and decide to go along with it."
Ian Brzezinski, the son of Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, said by telephone from Kiev, where he is working as a parliamentary adviser, that Washington "may be underestimating the constitutional and political complexity of this issue." The Ukrainian Constitution, he added, does not make clear how far the President's powers to sign and enforce treaties extend.
An Administration specialist on Ukraine said that all the warheads would have to be out of Ukraine within seven years after the agreement is signed. The deal, she said, would not in itself be submitted for ratification by the Ukrainian Parliament. But after a new Parliament is chosen in March, she said, Mr. Kravchuk has pledged to resubmit for ratification the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and participation in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which were approved with conditions by the old Parliament last November.
The new deal would be a part of the new package, other American officials said, and some legislative leaders have voiced their approval.
 
Economic Cooperation
 As a result of the agreement, President Clinton said, the United States plans to expand its cooperation with Ukraine, "especially in the economic area." He added that Ukraine, which he termed "an important country at the center of Europe," would also benefit from the "security assurances that go with this sort of agreement" -- mainly the promise of the nations with nuclear weapons "not to use them against them, ever."
"This is a hopeful and historic breakthrough that enhances the security of all three parties and every other nation as well," he said.
During a brief news conference following a day of meetings at North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters here, Mr. Clinton said that the agreement covered 176 missiles and 1,500 warheads. But his specialists later amended those figures. There are in fact 175 missiles, they said, including older SS-19's, which may be starting to fall apart after poor maintenance, and newer SS-24's. The warheads for the SS-24's will come out first, increasing the possibility of trouble with the older models.
According to the amended figures, the total number of warheads involved is 1,240 for the long-range missiles, plus roughly 600 more for air-launched cruise missiles.
 
Some U.S. Aid
 The missiles themselves would be broken up in Ukraine. About $175 million in American aid would be supplied for this process, through the so-called Nunn-Lugar program for the safe disposition of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. Most of the cost would be borne by the Ukrainians, who would get some of it back through scrap sales.
The warheads would be shipped intact to Russia -- a procedure the United States insisted upon because Ukrainian technicians would be more likely to make mistakes in dismantling them and might also learn secrets of the weapons-builder's art that Washington would not like them to know.
In Russia, the highly-enriched nuclear fuel would be removed. There or in the United States, or both, that fuel would be blended with other materials in a kind of nuclear cocktail to create less highly-enriched fuel of the type used in nuclear power plants. Processed into rods for such plants, the less-enriched fuel would then be sold by the United States Enrichment Corporation, which maintains a market for nuclear rods throughout the world.
 
Formula for Proceeds
 Proceeds from such sales, which would take place over a period of about 20 years, would flow back to Russia, which would then share them under a complicated formula that has still not been entirely worked out with the three non-Russian states giving up the warheads. In the case of Ukraine, at least, some of the payment would take the form of fuel rods for its own reactors, with the rest coming in hard currency badly needed for its hard-pressed economy.
"For the Ukrainians, the money was always the thing," said an American close to the negotiations. "They're broke, and these warheads were their best, their only chance to get hard currency quickly."
The leading American negotiators, who persuaded the Russians and the Ukrainians to complete the final steps in talks that they had begun months ago, were Strobe Talbott, soon to be the State Department's number two leader as deputy secretary; Lynn Davis, Under Secretary for International Security Affairs, and Rose Gottemoeller, who handles such matters on the National Security Council staff.

HEADLINE: THE NATO SUMMIT;
4 Countries In Audition For NATO

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Jan. 10

 BODY:
When President Clinton arrives here Tuesday to explain the partial membership in NATO that Washington is offering Eastern European nations, he will find four leaders who are essentially eager for the regional security.
But each leader -- from Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic -- has different concerns. 
 The Czech hosts are showing the most support. But they are also displaying a streak of independence, saying they want to negotiate their own entry separately from the other three.
Today, for example, the Czech Republic became the first Eastern European country to pledge financial support when it offered to accept a 1 percent deficit in the budget this year to bring its armed forces up to NATO standards. The total projected Government spending is $12.7 billion.
If all the extra spending is by the Defense Ministry, as seems likely, the Czech defense budget will rise about 12 percent this year, to $1 billion.
 
The Czech View
 In a radio address Sunday night, President Vaclav Havel said: "Czech policy emphasizes that we are independent countries -- each has to act for itself. We cannot be continually thrown into some common bag of post-Communist countries."
With the lowest unemployment in the region and a political climate that is unlikely to elect former Communists, the Czechs say that if they separate themselves from the rest of the East European crowd, they have a clear shot at early entry to NATO.
"It won't take long, and the Czech Republic will be a member of NATO," Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said today after meeting with the United States representative to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
Prime Minister Vaclev Klaus, in a statement over the weekend, was quite open about his nation's westward thrust: "The Czech Republic is a little bit farther West than Poland. We have not lived through so many divisions as Poland. For Poles this is more sensitive than for Austria. In this matter, I'd rank us closer to Austria than Poland."
 
The Polish View
The Poles, who have voiced loud reservations about Washington's plan, formally blessed it today at a Cabinet meeting.
But they point out that the Czech Republic does not have a border with the former Soviet Union and thus are less agitated about the possible resurgence of Russian nationalism.
President Lech Walesa, who has lashed out at the Clinton plan as "blackmail," issued a more restrained statement today, calling the plan "too little but in the right direction."
But over the weekend, Mr. Walesa condemned the West for listening too intently to the Russian objections of a Western alliance at the border of the old Soviet Union.
"At the moment there is no sign of partnership," Mr. Walesa said, referring to Partnership for Peace, Washington's label for its plan. "There is Russia, which threatens; there is the organized West, which is afraid, and there are those of us in the middle who say: there's nothing to be afraid of, one should only try to increase the potential of Western Europe, both physically and technically."
"We understand the reasons why the West, and particularly the United States, is so concerned about Russia's reaction," Mr. Walesa. But he added, "We are also concerned about Russia's reaction."
 
The Slovak View
 The Slovak Prime Minister, Vladimir Meciar, is coming with still another view.
His Government, dominated by nationalists who have taken a tough stance against the large Hungarian minority in Slovakia, engaged in considerable debate before endorsing the idea of NATO membership, and an alliance with Ukraine was considered as an alternative.
In the eyes of many NATO members, Slovakia, because of its faltering attempts at economic and political reforms, has only a small chance of meeting the criteria for membership.
When the Slovak Cabinet announced its acceptance of the Washington plan over the weekend, it made clear that its concern was not Russian neo-imperialism but the separatist demands from the Hungarian minority.
 
The Hungarian View
 The Government of Hungary, to be represented by President Arpad Goncz, has been less critical of the Washington plan than the Poles but also less warm than the Czechs.
Last November, Secretary of State Warren Christopher chose Hungary as the first country to explain the offer of partial membership in NATO because of Hungary's strategic location bordering Serbia.
Today the Hungarian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Janos Harman, said the Government was concerned about the division of opinions among the four countries, which call themselves the Visegrad Group, for the Hungarian town where they formed an association in February 1991.
"We cannot disguise that problems did arise with the group," Mr. Harman said. "There are bilateral differences of views between countries, and some Visegrad countries do not attribute the same importance to cooperation."

HEADLINE: Economist Is Said to Be Favorite for Fed Position

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Three of President Clinton's top economic policy aides are advising him to nominate George L. Perry, a Brookings Institution economist, to the seven-member Federal Reserve Board, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Perry, who has recommended caution in raising interest rates, would replace Wayne D. Angell, one of the board's most outspoken advocates of raising rates in response to early signs of inflation. Mr. Angell's term expires at the end of this month. 
 Before he could join the Fed, Mr. Perry would have to win President Clinton's approval in an interview, pass a background investigation and be confirmed by the Senate. If he survives these tests, Mr. Perry will become the lone Democratic appointee on a board filled with members appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
In recent writings, Mr. Perry has called for some restraint in raising interest rates when doing so might hurt short-term economic growth.
Opinions varied widely today on whether Mr. Perry's joining the Fed would actually affect interest rates and the overall economy. Representative Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat on the House Banking Committee, said Mr. Perry's reputation as a gifted economist would give him influence on the board beyond his single vote.
But Wall Street economists predicted that a substitution of Mr. Perry for Mr. Angell would have little effect on monetary policy because Mr. Perry's views are broadly consistent with the existing majority on the Fed.
"Just his appointment alone is not enough to shift the balance significantly on the Federal Reserve Board," said David M. Jones, a longtime Fed watcher at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York.
Mr. Jones said, however, that Mr. Perry could become much more influential next year if President Clinton elevated him to the position of vice chairman. David W. Mullins Jr. is the current vice chairman, but his term in that position will expire on July 24, 1995. His term on the board will expire on Jan. 31, 1996.
It has been widely expected that Mr. Clinton will elevate his own appointee rather than renew Mr. Mullins's tenure. If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Perry's term would last 14 years.
David C. Munro, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a New York consulting company, said that while Mr. Perry's arrival might not affect policy much, it would affect the tone of public debate. "It makes quite a difference in the atmospherics in the sense that Wayne Angell went out and spoke a lot," Mr. Munro said.
He estimated that given the many political and legal hurdles ahead of Mr. Perry there was less than a 50 percent chance of his actually ending up on the board.
Mr. Jones and Mr. Munro said the credit markets had not been affected by reports of a possible Perry nomination, which was first reported today by The Wall Street Journal.
A consensus in favor of Mr. Perry was reached last week by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen; Robert E. Rubin, the head of the National Economic Council, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, said Administration officials who insisted on anonymity. The three have been in charge of finding a candidate, the officials said.
President Clinton has been known to reject his aides' recommendations after actually meeting a candidate. Administration officials said that while they had no reason to believe this would happen with Mr. Perry, it was possible that the eventual nominee would be someone else.

HEADLINE: Retailers' Drive to Consolidate

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
If Federated Department Stores succeeds in merging with R. H. Macy & Company, it would become the largest department store company in America -- but it would probably not hold the top spot for long.
Just as the number of major warehouse club operators has shrunk to two from five, some predict that by the end of the decade, the country will be populated with only three big department store operators and a smattering of niche players. 
 The department store industry has been slowly consolidating for the last three decades, as small two- and three-store businesses merged or were purchased, leaving a handful of national and regional companies. Now, Federated's grab for Macy is expected to accelerate the process.
 
Stakes Raised
 "It raises the stakes because it would increase Federated's ability to compete, which will send others out looking for ways to counter that," said Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo, an investment banking boutique that has many retail clients. "And about the only way to counter is by buying something else."
The department store industry has been struggling for the last decade to compete with more efficient retailers like discounters and mail-order catalogues. Growing their business allows them to spread costs for such things as advertising, senior management and distribution over a broader base.
Allocating costs over a much bigger universe of stores improves efficiency so much that Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant, said he believed a merger of Federated and Macy would be "the first step in a consolidation process that will by the end of the decade leave us with two or three big operators."
Indeed, the factors pushing Federated and Macy together are almost guaranteed to weigh equally on other department store chains.
These are among the factors:
*Department stores face far more varied and vigorous competition today than just a decade ago.
*The consumer is in the driver's seat, demanding high quality and service at low prices.
*What used to seem like an ever-expanding marketplace, generous to all retailers, has become a battlefield where sales gains come only at the expense of competitors.
*No one is clamoring to finance and build new, lavish 200,000-square-foot department stores, when there are already too many.
"The department store concept is in its maturest state, so how to get growth has become their biggest problem," said Therese Byrne, publisher of Retail Maxim, a newsletter that covers retail real estate. "About the only way left is to buy it."
To be sure, some department store companies still have building plans. The May Department Stores Company, which would be unseated as the nation's largest department store operator should Federated win Macy, plans to build 100 more stores over the next five years. And Federated itself expects to put up 40 new stores, some to replace old ones.
With as much as 15 percent too much space for department store retailing, by some estimates, buying stores is cheaper than building them. "There's very little regional mall development anywhere, and where there is, it is for other retail concepts," Ms. Byrne said. "To get space, you almost have to buy it."
Real estate developers that used to plan malls around department store anchors are now wooing Wal-Mart, Target and Toys "R" Us.
Despite their building plans, Federated and May, as well as Dillard Department Stores, have made it clear that acquisition is their best vehicle for growth. Dillard has assembled a $5 billion empire by picking off local and regional chains, valuable mainly for their real estate. May has achieved its $11 billion weight by swallowing bigger competitors.
 
Story of the Whale
 "It's the old story of the whale," said Peter J. Solomon, an investment banker whose father once ran the Abraham & Straus chain. "The little fish gets eaten by the big fish, which gets eaten by the bigger fish and so on until they're all swallowed by the whale."
Thomas Gould, chairman and chief executive of Younkers, a department store company that operates 53 stores in the Midwest, is not afraid of being swallowed by a bigger operator. "The Dillard's of the world are searching for places they can put down a cookie cutter and stamp out 150,000- to 200,000-square-foot stores, which limits them to major metropolitan areas," he said. "Markets we're in are just not worth their while."
Yet Mr. Gould agrees that consolidation is the trend, pointing to Younkers's own acquisitions of the Brandeis stores in 1987 and the Prange chain in 1992. "I'd guess that there are approximately 500 department store chains out there today, but by the end of the decade, there will be less than 200," he said.
 
Established in 1929
 Federated, Dillard and May are the three biggest "whales." Federated was the first company created by cobbling together family-owned department store chains. It was established in 1929, when Abraham & Straus and F&R Lazarus & Company and its subsidiary, Shillito's, banded together to form a holding company.
After adding Rich's in 1976, Federated stopped expanding through acquisition until it was purchased in 1988 by Robert Campeau, the Canadian real estate developer. He merged Federated with the Allied Stores Corporation, which he also owned. With a debt-laden balance sheet, the company landed in bankruptcy.
Now, two years after emerging from bankruptcy, it has kicked off a scramble for Macy, a bankrupt company with stores largely in coveted markets like the New York metropolitan region and Southern California. Dillard and May, which is rumored to be buying a privately held chain in the Northeast called Steiger's, are reportedly also interested in parts of Macy. With $6 billion in sales, it would be the largest "fish" any department store retailer has tried to swallow.
Macy -- or even a part of it -- would give any of those three companies instant revenue growth, which is hard to come by when a 3 or 4 percent sales jump at stores open at least a year is considered admirable.
Of May's $11 billion in sales, almost $6 billion was added by the purchase of competitors since 1986. Dillard, by adding 10 stores here and 20 stores there, has lifted its sales at least $1.5 billion over the last decade.
"There's not a lot of sales growth in the department store sector, and there are just so many economies of scale you can achieve with existing stores to squeeze more to the bottom line," Mr. Solomon said.
 
Cost Cutting Necessary
 But that and cost cutting are where much of the earnings growth in the department store business, particularly Federated's, has come from. May has consolidated numerous regional chains and even its buying offices to reduce expenses. Dillard, which is known as the low-cost operator, slices out layers of middle management when it makes an acquisition. Federated buys about 75 percent of the merchandise it sells in its nine store chains as a single entity and uses a centralized computer system to manage its inventories, accounting and back office functions.
Even Macy, which is operating under bankruptcy protection, has dramatically improved its cash flow by cutting costs. Its sales, however, have declined slightly, and analysts say its revenues must grow if it hopes to emerge as a viable business.
In retailing today, having the lowest prices can make the difference between a poor showing and a good one. When they were the dominant retailing format, department stores could price their wares for a comfortable 40 percent gross profit margin. Those days are long gone.
With slim profits, they need to increase operating efficiencies, spreading the costs of one computer system over more stores or using the muscle of multistore orders to gain a better price from their suppliers.
"Over the years the margins have allowed them to have the luxury of services and functions that today's operating environment just won't permit," said Marie Beninati, director of retail market strategy at Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail and apparel consulting firm. "The consumer is demanding value, and department stores have to learn to pass it on in the same way that Wal-Mart does."
It costs Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retail company, only 15 percent of its revenues to operate 2,400 stores and warehouse clubs, which enables it to offer its customers lower prices and still make a profit.
And department stores must compete not only with discounters like Wal-Mart, but also catalogue companies like L.L. Bean, specialty stores like the Gap and, increasingly, electronic retailers like QVC.
According to Kurt Salmon Associates, department store companies' slice of the retail pie shrank from 17 percent in 1980 to 11 percent last year. "Now we're just a small part of the business," said Allen I. Questrom, Federated's chairman. "In order to thrive, we've got to compete on their terms."

HEADLINE: THE NATO SUMMIT;
In NATO Talks, Bosnia Sets Off A Sharp Debate

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The NATO summit meeting opened today with continuing tensions over Bosnia -- mostly between France and the United States -- that competed for attention with the signing of a document opening the alliance's doors to the countries of Eastern Europe.
President Francois Mitterrand called on the allies to reinforce United Nations peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslav republics. French commanders, who lead the largest United Nations contingent in Bosnia and Herzegovina, have also chafed at the reluctance of the allies to use air power to stop the shelling of Sarajevo. 
 When he spoke to the closed-door meeting, President Clinton did not refer directly to France, but he seemed exasperated with a call for more action by countries that had opposed such moves, White House officials said later.
 
To Repeat Their Threat
 By tonight, the 16 leaders agreed that in a communique on Tuesday, they would reiterate their five-month-old threat to begin air strikes against Serbia "to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
In what they intended as the centerpiece of the meeting, the leaders of North Atlantic Treaty Organization issued a formal invitation today to their former Warsaw Pact adversaries to join a so-called Partnership for Peace, which is intended to forge closer military ties between Western and Eastern Europe without guaranteeing eastern countries full membership in NATO.
In addition to that well-scripted success, the Administration's ability to secure a deal with Russia and Ukraine calling for the surrender of the Ukrainian nuclear arsenal allowed Mr. Clinton to boast tonight of "two giant steps toward greater security for the United States, for Europe and the world."
But with France and some others pressing NATO to assume a more active role in Bosnia, the most forceful words of the gathering came as Mr. Clinton arose this morning to warn his colleagues that the alliance risked losing its credibility if cannot make good on its threats to use force in Bosnia.
"If we are going to reassert this warning, it cannot be seen as mere rhetoric," the President said of the threat of air strikes. "Those who attack Sarajevo must understand that we are serious." His comments were relayed to the news media by White House officials.
 
Stances Have Been Swapped
 Mr. Clinton, who is finding that roles have reversed since last summer, when Paris helped to block a Washington proposal for military intervention in Bosnia, was said by Administration officials to have sharpened the tone of his remarks after Mr. Mitterrand urged reinforcements.
Mr. Mitterrand's call reflected both his desire to show political leadership in Europe and his need to convince the public at home. One recent poll showed that most French favor military intervention on behalf of Bosnia's Muslims.
There was no sign tonight of any decision that could lead to immediate military action. But with Sarajevo staggering under heavy Serbian shelling and the allies still divided over a suitable response, the 16 leaders discussed the issue at length among themselves tonight at a private dinner in the historic Chateau Val Duchesse.
At news conferences earlier in the evening, President Clinton and his senior advisers tried to shift attention from disagreements over Bosnia to NATO's overture to the east.
 
A Partial Role in NATO
 The proposed arrangement falls well short of the full membership and security guarantees that Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have sought. But Mr. Clinton and his colleagues, who had opposed immediate expansion of the alliance on the ground that it would inflame resentment in Russia, were adamant in defending the proposal.
The plan offers military cooperation and possible membership to all of the former Soviet bloc countries and neutral countries in Europe.
"I do not view it as some sort of half-hearted compromise," said Mr. Clinton, who later described the plan as one that would be more important to the future of Europe "than whatever is or is not done with the tragedy of Bosnia at this late date."
 
'We Care,' NATO Says
 Manfred Worner, NATO's secretary general, said this morning: "Our message to the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe has been equally consistent: We shall not leave you alone. We care about your security, which is of direct and material concern to us."
Apart from the offer to Eastern Europe, the alliance also formally endorsed a plan that will allow European countries for the first time to form joint military task forces under NATO's auspices, a step welcomed by Mr. Mitterrand and by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.
But the Bosnia issue lingered, and Administration officials said tonight that the 16 leaders, in addition to reaffirming their readiness to carry out air strikes, agreed to commend the European Union for its efforts to mediate peace in the Balkans.
The United States refused to go along with a European request for a more explicit endorsement of that effort because Washington remains leery of a European Union proposal to lift economic sanctions against Serbia in exchange for progress toward a political settlement.
What remained unclear and apparently unresolved was whether the allies were anywhere near deciding that the attacks on Sarajevo had become so serious that the long-threatened air strikes should begin.
After his dinner tonight, Mr. Clinton said that he and other leaders had discussed "some other options," and that they would resume those discussions on Tuesday.
German officials said France and other countries with troops in the Balkans were hardening their positions, and were pressing for either reinforcements or withdrawal of their contingents.
NATO's first warning about air strikes came on Aug. 9, but in the months since, it has led neither to military action by the alliance nor to a halt in Serbian attacks.
Any decision to go ahead with air strikes would require the approval of the North Atlantic Council, which is the political arm of NATO, and the United Nations Security Council. United States officials acknowledged tonight that there was mounting sentiment among some allies, including France and the Netherlands, to go forward with the attacks.
United States officials here have suggested that the fact the Bosnian Army has begun a major military operation against Croatian forces in central Bosnia should make the United States even more wary about coming to Bosnia's aid. A senior Administration official who briefed reporters here on Sunday said the situation in Sarajevo was "still not as grave" as when NATO first issued its warning last August.

Prices of Treasury Issues Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury issues were mixed yesterday, as investors failed to follow through on last week's rally, which had been stimulated by a December jobs report that showed economic growth was easing.
The 30-year bond was down 10/32 , to 1004/32 , sending the yield up to 6.24 percent, from 6.22 percent on Friday. 
 Treasuries slumped in early trading, but managed to regain some of those losses. Traders said the early weakness came on active selling in the long end of the market and was attributed to an overseas seller of bonds, rumored to be Japan, although no one was sure through what underwriter the bonds might have been sold. However, many said it looked as though Japan was selling bonds, especially because of the way the market rebounded. Bond traders say Japanese investors may be setting up for the new United States Treasury bond in the February quarterly refunding.
 
Searching the Yield Curve
 It was a day when buyers were searching along the yield curve to get the most return for their money. Analysts believe that there is an enormous amount of money on the sidelines poised for investment, with buyers seemingly favoring the intermediate maturities. The five-year issues are the most popular among investors because their yield spread is close to that of the seven-year note but without the longer commitment. A five-year note yesterday was trading at a price to yield 5.02 percent while a seven-year note was at a price to yield 5.17 percent.
Economic data continue to show there is a reduced risk of the Federal Reserve's raising short-term rates because the economy's growth is moderate. Friday's jobs report that showed December nonfarm payrolls rising by 183,000, instead of the 215,000 that had been forecast, expelled much worry about any immediate tightening.
The market is likely to ride out the next couple of days without any major swings as it awaits scheduled inflation data, the Producer Price Index tomorrow, and the Consumer Price Index on Thursday. Retail sales are also due Thursday.
 
Reviewing Numbers
 Matthew F. Alexy, a Government trading specialist with CS First Boston, said market participants were still reviewing last week's numbers, trying to determine the prospects for the rest of the week.
"While the market is not likely to see the frenzy that we saw on Thursday and Friday in conjunction with the jobs data," Mr. Alexy said, "we could see a more steady kind of movement leading into this week's data."
He said that since the idea of the Fed's raising interest rates in a preemptive strike on inflation had faded, the market's focus should now be on how the Fed is perceiving the economy. Instead of investors wondering when in the first three months the Fed will tighten short-term rates, Mr. Alexy said, they now would be betting on whether the tightening will come in the first or second half of the year.
 
Corporate Debt
 The largest issuer of corporate debt yesterday was the Eastman Chemical Company, with $1 billion of securities equally divided between 10-year notes and 30-year debentures through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Ten-year notes due in 2004 were given a 6 3/8 percent coupon and priced at 99.897 to yield 6.389 percent, or about 74 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The 30-year debentures were given a 7 1/4 percent coupon and priced at 98.974 to yield 7.335 percent, or 97 basis points more than a comparable Treasury issue. Eastman Chemical, which spun off from Eastman Kodak on Jan. 1, said the debt being offered was noncallable before maturity and was rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Municipal Offerings
 In the municipal sector, the Department of Transportation of the State of Kansas negotiated the sale yesterday of $125 million of tax-exempt highway revenue bonds through underwriters led by Smith Barney Shearson.
The revenue bonds were initially priced to yield from 3.90 percent for an issue due in 1999 to 4.45 percent in 2003, 4.95 percent in 2008, and 5.20 percent in 2012 and 2013.
At yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills, analysts said investor interest was strong at the average rate of 3.02 percent and 3.18 percent, respectively.
Following are the results of the Tresury bill auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Both issues are dated Jan. 13, 1994. The three-month bills mature on April 14, 1994, and the six-month billsmature on July 14, 1994.

Dollar Gains on Broad Front Despite Tepid Job Figures

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar firmed against most leading currencies yesterday as traders looked beyond Friday's weak employment report. In late New York trading it was quoted at 1.7343 German marks, up from 1.7278 late Friday. It also rose to 112.27 Japanese yen from 111.90.
Gold prices slipped. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery fell $1.50, to $385.70 an ounce. 
 The dollar fell Friday after the Labor Department reported a moderate rise in payrolls in December. But dealers said weak economic fundamentals in other countries suggested the dollar was still the best buy.
Data released yesterday showed western Germany's economy shrank by 1.9 percent in 1993. Eastern Germany's new capitalist economy jumped 6.3 percent last year, but the German economy as a whole contracted 1.3 percent.
"I don't think people are willing to junk" the dollar yet, said Jim Phoenix, foreign exchange dealer at theCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
But few dealers were willing to buy dollars aggressively until there was new information on the pace of growth. Some suggested that the dollar would remain confined to its recent range until economic data for January became available.
"The obvious trend for the dollar is higher, but short term it could be range-bound," said Ian Foster, treasury manager at Bank of New York in London.
The dollar also firmed against the yen, despite a surging Japanese stock market and talk that Tokyo would soon disclose a stimulus package. While an attempt by Japan to spur its economy and encourage imports could dampen speculation that the White House will call for a firmer yen to narrow the bilateral trade gap, most analysts believe a growth plan is in the end supportive of the yen.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4930, down from $1.4935 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.4725 Swiss francs, up from 1.4669; $1.3170, Canadian dollars, down from $1.3193; 5.9085 French francs, up from 5.8828, and 1,710 Italian lire, up from 1,690.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Rally Ends After Doubts Arise on Early OPEC Talks

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
A modest two-week rally in crude oil ended yesterday as the market laid aside hopes for cuts in petroleum production. Prices fell sharply despite the bitter cold weather in the Northeast.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for February delivery dropped 65 cents, to $14.67 a barrel. February unleaded gasoline futures shed 2.12 cents, to 41.70 cents a gallon, and heating oil fell 1.41 cents, to 46.76 cents a gallon.
The prices fell after a respected publication played down the chance of an early meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
 The publication, the Middle East Economic Survey, said it was highly unlikely that OPEC would push up its scheduled March meeting before the Islamic fasting month of Ramadam starts Feb. 11.
Oil prices had rebounded from five-year lows on faint hopes that OPEC would act to cut the flow of petroleum. Harsh winter weather contributed to the price recovery, since it was expected to drive up demand for heating oil.
 
'Market's Optimism Premature'
"Other than the weather, the fundamentals haven't changed," said Shannon Burchett of Chase Manhattan Bank. "The market's optimism that there would be an early meeting may have been premature."
Prior to the price collapse, the crude-oil market was poised to challenge a gap on charts that began at $15.65. But when that level went untouched by the active February contract, many investors bailed out of long positions.
Recent gains in gasoline prices have made the domestic market more attractive to imports from Europe. As a result, more supplies are expected at a time when American refinery output is more than 5 percent above a year ago.
On other commodity markets, orange juice futures soared amid concerns that a cold front would strike Florida next weekend. January orange juice gained 2.55 cents, to 111.95 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange,
Cold weather reached Florida over the weekend, but temperatures only got down to the mid-40's in the lower half of the state, not cold enough to damage the orange crop. Fruit damage occurs when temperatures dip below 28 degrees for at least four hours, while sustained temperatures in the low 20's and upper teens can kill the trees.

HEADLINE: An Inflation Index Is Said to Overstate the Case

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics believe that its Consumer Price Index overstates annual inflation by up to six-tenths of a percentage point, a finding with implications for policy makers and the public.
The index showing December results is scheduled to be issued on Thursday. For the latest 12 months, the rise in the index was reported at 2.7 percent, but the researchers say it actually rose by only 2.1 percent, meaning that inflation, for a variety of reasons, is being overstated by about one-fourth. The same phenomenon is showing up, they say, in many other developed countries. 
 The discrepancy comes about not only because of the complexities of calculating inflation, but also because of the way people respond to rising prices, by shopping at discount stores or eating chicken instead of steak.
 
Big Political Issue
 It suggests that people whose incomes are tied to the index, like Social Security recipients, may have done better maintaining their standard of living, one of the major political issues of the 1990's. "People may not be doing as badly as they thought, said Paul A. Armknecht, assistant commissioner for consumer prices and price indexes.
But while the discrepancy between reported inflation and what might be called actual inflation seems to be larger than previously suspected, researchers here and elsewhere have realized for a decade or more that official gauges are prone to overstatement.
The Federal Reserve and other central banks, for example, are said to take this fact into account in formulating monetary policy. Even as they do so, however, they may be conveying a misleading impression of how much inflation they regard as tolerable.
And though analysts have identified the factors causing overstatement, a host of technical and conceptual obstacles face bureau statisticians as they approach the next overhaul of the Consumer Price Index, which typically occurs every 10 years and was last conducted in 1987. But the work is sufficiently advanced that the bureau included five technical articles on the subject in the December issue of the Monthly Labor Review, to be distributed shortly.
"We'd reached the point where we had something we wanted to share," said Deborah P. Klein, an associate commissioner.
The bureau plans experimental alternative versions of the index for 1995. The issue is separate from the Government's planned introduction next month of an updated version of basic labor-market statistics that currently appear to understate the unemployment rate by about four-tenths of a point.
Methodologically, the overstatement of inflation, to which Social Security and other Government and private-sector payments are linked, involves two central issues.
The most obvious is the fact, periodically flaring into public debate, that the Consumer Price Index is a statistical artifact in that it is designed to measure a "basket" of goods and services that changes only infrequently and thus does not capture changes in what people actually buy.
If the price of steak, for example, should rise sharply and consumers decide to buy chicken instead, the index, everything else being equal, would rise but the consumer's cost of living would not.
"We work on the assumption that no substitution is made," Mr. Armknecht said.
Although the Government has surveyed consumer spending patterns annually since 1979, the index is currently based on what people bought in the 1982-84 period. Since then, Americans have reduced the share of their budgets spent on alcoholic beverages, for example, while raising the proportion going for medical care and tuition.
Price is often the reason for such shifts, but other common reasons are changed tastes or cultural attitudes, the lack of availability of a product, technological improvements or demographic changes in the population.
Mr. Armknecht said the substitution effect accounted for about two-tenths of a point, or one-third of the overstatement.
Most of the rest is attributed to a highly technical estimating process -- even the appendix to the bureau's equation-laden explanation contains footnotes -- currently used for the Consumer Price Index. Its formula, involving an arithmetic mean and named for a 19th-century French statistician named Etienne Laspeyres, tends to overstate price changes by giving more importance to increases than to declines. The effect is strongest when combined with consumer substitution of less expensive goods for more expensive ones.
If a quantity of lettuce, for instance, rose to $5 from $4, this would be a 25 percent increase. If the price then retreated to $4, the decline would be 20 percent. Employing a geometric mean, however, would treat these changes symmetrically and avoid the upward bias, which is most pronounced when applied to items with gyrating prices, like fresh fruits and vegetables, which are often substituted.
Using the geometric formulation, the price relatives -- 1.25 for the rise and 0.8 for the fall -- are multiplied together and then averaged by taking their square root.
Another potential source of overstatement is in adjusting for changes in the quality of a product or service, such as when auto makers make previously optional equipment standard. To the extent that improvements, because of imperfect techniques for adjusting the Consumer Price Index, are counted as price changes, the index will overstate true inflation.
While this process can also cause an understatement of inflation, the bureau notes that the chief contention is that it is improvements that are "predominantly missed" in the compilation of the index. Changes in quality also include such generally hard-to-value amenities as convenient store hours, delivery service and various options for paying.
Similarly, bureau researchers acknowledge that failure to add new products promptly to the index exaggerates reported inflation. Typically, high-technology and some other products command very high prices when first reaching the market as supplies are limited and producers are seeking to recover high investment and start-up costs.
The longer it takes for the Government to include the new product in the index, the less likely the inflation gauge is to pick up the almost inevitable, often rapid, price drop.
Even if these technical problems can be resolved, however, and the Government is shown to be able to save billions of dollars a year through lower outlays for entitlements, strong opponents seek to preserve the current Consumer Price Index mechanism.
One would be organized labor, whose leaders insist that being forced to give up steak, regardless of feelings about its replacement, reduces one's standard of living.
"If they substitute hamburger, it's not that they have a preference for hamburger," observed Rudy Oswald, director of economic research for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "You want to have a measure of the harm."

Embracing What Works
The elements that seemed to be keeping fashion afloat through the last few years -- supermodels, basics, life-style marketing -- are now being cast as this era's villains. 
 But don't tell Fabrizio Ferri, who seems to be embracing the formula with a vigorous bearhug.
Industria, his photography studio in Milan, Italy, and New York, is the crossroads for the international fashion community, a community that also feels at home in the Industria label clothing collection.
In two months, everybody else will be able to shop alongside those professionals at the new Industria store, at 755 Washington Street (between Jane and West 12th streets), where Mr. Ferri is moving his studio. "We're starting work in a week, and we'll be there in two months," Mr. Ferri said. "That's what I hope." Until now the line has been available to friends and colleagues through the studio, and in a few upscale stores.
In that new store, customers will also find two new Industria collections: Lavoro, which in Italian means work, and Industria Knits. Lavoro will be a lower-priced, utilitarian clothing line, and the knit collection offers 35 sweater styles. "There is always room for a better Gap," Mr. Ferri said of the knit collection, whose hang tag carries a picture of Isabella Rossellini.
Industria will be offering denim jeans for the first time, made in New York "because for me, a jean has to be done in America," Mr. Ferri said.
Mr. Ferri has become a fashion expert by osmosis , surrounded as a photographer by the working class of the fashion industry, whose uniforms, despite their field, can be as regimented as those of postal workers.
"One of the problems of the fashion business is that it follows the creativity of designers," Mr. Ferri said. "Things get more beautiful, and more expensive, all the time. The research of the designer brings the collections further from the needs of people. But Industria starts with a different approach, to meet needs."
All three collections will be presented together during the showings of men's-wear collections this week in Milan, and in February during the women's shows.
For his expansion, Mr. Ferri has bought, with a partner whom he said he cannot yet name, a 30,000-square-foot factory in Modena, Italy. Industria's collections will all be produced there. "Our growth has been so good, we'll be able to produce the whole thing ourselves," Mr. Ferri said.
 
45 and Comfortable
 CK, Calvin Klein's second line, now has a design director all its own, Ann Ogden, who cut her teeth at Basco before starting her label a year ago. At 45, Ms. Ogden said that CK "is for people like me: for women who like to be casual and comfortable, but smart."
Ms. Ogden's appointment is the sort of life preserver many designers in this troubled economy can only dream about. She was first contacted by Barbara Warner, the corporate president of Calvin Klein's women's division. "What was great was when Barbara and Calvin looked at my line, we all decided there was no conflict of interest, so I can continue to do it," Ms. Ogden said.
She started working on CK in December, she said, but the first collection she'll design in full will be Holiday, shown in June. She said her CK would be more men's-wear-oriented and would have more color. But it will still be young. "I'm the oldest young designer in the world," Ms. Ogden said. "I'm just a baby boomer, and all of us aren't getting any younger, but at the same time, we don't want to dress like our mothers, do we?"
 
Pastrylike Clothes
 Even surrounded in Charivari last week by the seven dressmaking dummies she had outfitted in yellowed muslin, Pia Myrvold did not really want to say she was a designer. She and her partner, Randy Naylor, think of themselves as multidisciplined, dabbling in performance art, installations and video. And for a while, Ms. Myrvold, born in Stavanger, Norway, treated her fashion shows as theater, and her theater as fashion shows. Which may be why the clothes Ms. Myrvold is selling at Charivari look as if they'd been sculptured from frayed artists' canvases.
She and Mr. Naylor used textiles to create an installation last summer at the Parc de la Villette in Paris, commissioned by Bernard Tschumi, the dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, who is a deconstructivist architect. The pieces look like huge sails, for bright ships in the Caribbean.
Many of Ms. Myrvold's jackets and skirts look like pale pastry, with muslin sewn in layers like mille-feuille.
Barbara Weiser, president of Charivari, said of Ms. Myrvold's work, which sells for $200 to $700 at the store: "What fascinates me is the treatment of the fabrics, all the pieces that have been sewn together. It is not about ripping fabric apart; it is about building the fabric. It is very elegant."
 
When Art and Fashion Meet
 Sylvia Heisel's simple slip dresses have been worn by Bridget Fonda, Madonna and Mariah Carey, mostly because of what they aren't: ostentatious clothes that make a statement. Yet, those same dresses are being used by artists to do just that. First, Kenneth Goldsmith, a conceptual artist, silk-screened a print for an ivory dress, which ended up in an exhibition called "American Art Today: Clothing as Metaphor." Then Matthew Barney, who was a winner at this year's Venice Biennale, wore one of her dresses for a drag performance-art videotape. Now, Ms. Heisel will be curator and host for the New Jersey Network's "State of the Arts," a weekly program examining a different arts field each week; she will film one segment, on fashion. In it Ms. Heisel will present fashion as art, using work like Todd Oldham's Mona Lisa beaded miniskirt from last fall.
Ms. Heisel's role as arbiter of art-meeting-fashion isn't accidental. She was an art history major at Barnard College, before she dropped out. Now, her salon-inspired clothes, with Italian ice colors and glamorous 50's forms, are sold at stores like Linda Dresner, Ultimo and Barneys New York.
She is taping "State of the Arts" on Jan. 20. She said she would be combining aspects of craft, couture, pop culture and the contemporary fine- arts movement.

HEADLINE: In an Era of Change, Polish Film Industry Struggles to Stay Vital

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
At a recent conference in France on the future of European film, the Polish director Krzysztof Zanussi took a pessimistic line. Freedom, he said worriedly, had proven a very mixed blessing for the Polish film industry: protective barriers had been lowered and Hollywood had conquered all. "Before, we were dominated by the Russians," he said. "Now, it's the Americans."
With an inflation rate of 35 percent and steady devaluation of the zloty, with a worldwide recession and uncertain experience in developing private enterprises, the Polish film industry might indeed seem in trouble. Its best-known directors -- Mr. Zanussi, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Agnieska Holland and Andrzej Wajda -- either lie low or work abroad. In 1993, the 10 most popular films in Poland were American. 
 Yet movies keep getting made here, more each year, and people keep paying money to see them. The Communist victory at the Polish polls this fall is unlikely to change that. New Polish films may not all be the earnest moral explorations or stirring dissident manifestoes of yesteryear. But they appeal on a visceral level to an audience grown cynical from the machinations of their politicians or prurient from their new-found freedoms.
Two especially popular Polish films of the last two years, not classy enough for the major Western film festivals or accessible enough for Western distribution, can speak for the state of Polish film today. And their producers offer varying yet complementary strategies to confront the Hollywood behemoth.
"Pigs" (the producers' equivalent of the original "Dogs," a Polish epithet for the police) is a story of corrupt, brutal, cynical former Communist secret policemen confronting the new realities of contemporary Poland. It won the Golden Duck (Poland's improbably named version of the Oscar) for best director (Wladyslaw Pasikowski) and best actor (Boguslaw Linda) in 1992.
"The Kidnapping of Agata," based on a true story, is a 1993 film about a Polish politician who accuses his daughter's boyfriend of kidnapping, after the two young lovers run off together. The film offers delightful performances, modest but overt sexiness, a trenchant look at the abuse of power and a light touch that fails to prepare one for the brutal ending. At a recent Warsaw screening, a mostly teen-age audience loved it.
"Pigs" was produced by Zebra Film Productions, founded in 1989 and still technically owned by the state, and hence technically a nonprofit holdover from the former Communist system. Two of its three chief executives, Jacek Bromski and Jacek Moczydlowski (the third is on leave teaching in New York), speak with a residue of dissident idealism of the need to foster young directors and to make serious films that resist the commercial ethos.
"Agata" is a production of Heritage Films, an enthusiastically capitalist venture of Lew Rywin, who attended a Brooklyn high school before he was deported from the United States as an illegal alien and who served as Steven Spielberg's Polish line producer for "Schindler's List."
Mr. Rywin has set up his office as a sort of homage to cigar-chomping Hollywood studio bosses of yore. Despite his decade at the Communist state television network, he talks like a cinematic Adam Smith. Yet he, too, has been involved in high-art projects, notably Mr. Kieslowski's 10-part series of hourlong films called "Decalogue," made for Polish television, and Mr. Wajda's last three films.
Perhaps because of his experience in the United States, his fluent English and, now, his Spielberg cachet, Mr. Rywin professes confidence that he can work with Hollywood.
"I cannot complain," he said. "My portfolio is full. If a train is coming your way, you can either be crushed by it or you can jump on it."
Mr. Zanussi was hardly so buoyant, and neither was Mr. Moczydlowski. Like so many former dissidents, he and his partner feel at sea with their new freedoms, lamenting the loss of the intensity and excitement of their dissident years.
"Under Communism, film was the freest way to express ideas," Mr. Moczydlowski said. "Of course there was censorship. We had to figure out a way to say what people wanted to hear without saying it specifically. It was a game of wits. Now that anything can be said in the open, there's nobody to fight against. We don't know what stories people want us to tell them."
Part of the problem is a perceived gulf between the Polish audience and the rest of the world, at least when the subject is contemporary Poland.
"You have to simplify things to be understood by foreigners," Mr. Moczydlowski said, and indeed both "Pigs" and "Agata" are full of sly references to Polish life that most outsiders would miss. "You have to compromise for the rest of Europe but not be too naive for our own market," he added.
 
$250,000 Grants
 Whether the production is public or private, nearly all movies in Poland are seeded with a grant of approximately $250,000 from the Ministry of Culture and then require additional outside investment. The trouble is, the Polish audience by itself is not enough to reward investors. Capital and audiences must be sought outside Poland, which dilutes the native film product.
"There is no way I can hope to return my investment if I address myself solely to the Polish market," Mr. Rywin said. That has led to most film producers expanding to television or to serving as local coordinators for spectacles bankrolled from abroad.
"Poland is taking advantage of the Yugoslav situation," Mr. Rywin said. "Before, most American producers would go there to do period pieces. Now, they go to Poland or Russia."
The number of films produced in Poland has actually risen steadily, according to the Ministry of Culture's State Cinematography Committee, from 22 in 1990 to 25 in 1991 to 28 in 1992 (the 1993 figure is not yet in). But Polish film attendance has plummeted, meaning that a No. 1 box-office hit, even if it is an American film, sells fewer tickets than before. From 38 million in 1990, overall annual attendance dropped to 18 million in 1991 and 11 million in 1992. The ministry estimates that 1993 will show a rebound to 15 million.
The problem is partly the recession and inflation, with ticket prices leaping from 20 cents in 1990 to $2 now. And partly, Mr. Rywin argues, it has to do with the limited number and poor condition of Polish theaters. He says he is working to interest the French U.G.C. chain in investing in new Polish theaters.
There is also more or less rampant piracy, although Mr. Rywin places less weight on that than do the Zebra executives. According to them, Poland has the highest per-capita number of videocassette players in Europe, the majority of available cassettes are illicit and their use has severely depressed film attendance. On Jan. 7, the Polish Parliament finally passed a new copyright law intended to protect intellectual property and curb the pirating of films.
 
'Room for Everybody'
 For Mr. Rywin, who shares with the Zebra team a professed lack of concern about the resurgent Polish Communists, the only way to survive is to adjust. "We must remain open to the products of the West," he said. "I'm not afraid of American products. There's room for everybody."
Mr. Moczydlowski hopes to buttress state support for Polish film makers and protection against Hollywood, and says the Polish system is already based on the French model. Consistently among the Polish box-office leaders, Zebra is still only marginally profitable. Mr. Moczydlowski said there was no point in privatizing the company since its mission, to make quality films (however brutal and bloody "Pigs" may be) and to encourage young talent, was not inherently profitable. "We would be the first to privatize if it made sense," he said.
Like so many Eastern European intellectuals, he longs for a system of values in which profitability is not paramount.
"For us, culture was a substitute for everything else," he said. "When I was a teen-ager, we could go to the cinema and see everything by Fellini or Bergman. We didn't have anything else to do. We had no money, and cinema was cheap. A director could go to a car factory and show his film and have a very interesting discussion.
"Now, we are losing this. Go to Belgium and ask a doctor who is Bergman and he won't know. It's a consumption society in the West, and now here, too. Young people just go to the cinema to have fun."

The Man From Japan
By Clive James
173 pages. Random House. $20.
Michael Crichton, the author of the sensationalistic potboiler "Rising Sun," is hardly alone in his interest in Japan. In fact, as Japan has assumed an increasingly high-profile role in the world of trade and economics, the Land of the Rising Sun has become a ferocious magnet for Western novelists. Brad Leithauser ("Equal Distance"), Jay McInerney ("Ransom") and John Burnham Schwartz ("Bicycle Days") have all portrayed young Americans coming of age in Japan, while T. Coraghessan Boyle ("East Is East") and Meg Pei ("Salaryman") have chronicled the adventures of young Japanese men abroad in the United States. In each case, Eastern and Western customs, values and sensibilities are contrasted and compared; in each case, a hero's search for identity is played out in an alien land. 
 Similar dynamics are at work in Clive James's sprightly new novel, "The Man From Japan," a comic Bildungsroman that features an aspiring Japanese poet who is set adrift amid the temptations and pitfalls of contemporary London.
As the first volume of his autobiography, "Unreliable Memoirs," so adeptly demonstrated, Mr. James -- who is well-known in England as a critic, novelist, poet and host of a popular television interview show -- has a delightful gift for the antic anecdote and the witty apercu. His prose skims lightly over the surface of life, spinning its mundane embarrassments into comedy, its banal absurdities into brightly spangled stories.
In "Unreliable Memoirs," Mr. James used those gifts to recount his own youthful confusion, growing up in the wasteland of the Australian suburbs. In "The Man From Japan," he uses them to recount the sentimental education of one Akira Suzuki, an aspiring Japanese writer who finds himself working in a London bookshop.
For all his artistic aspirations, Suzuki seems, at first glance, like the very model of the stereotypical Japanese businessman: like Jun Shimada in Ms. Pei's "Salaryman," he's polite, careful and hard-working. He saves practically every dollar he makes, and keeps his London flat meticulously tidy. He works out every day to maintain control of his body, and attends one cultural event a week to improve his mind. To him, London is a lewd, crude metropolis, a city of bad manners and worse decorum: the sort of place Englishmen tend to associate with the United States.
"In Japanese the levels of politeness were so precisely codified that one could convey an insult merely by eliding the end of a verb," writes Mr. James. "But the point was that both speaker and listener knew exactly what was going on. All speech was conversation: it was communal or it was nothing. In English you could talk to yourself in the presence of other people, as if their feelings not only did not matter but did not even exist. Suzuki found this aspect of his voluntary exile the hardest to get used to. Merely listening to people talking in the tube, he took a linguistic battering that frequently left him punch-drunk. In the street, asking someone the way to somewhere, he would receive a reply which left him no honorable alternative except to challenge his interlocutor to a duel."
As it happens, Suzuki's efforts to educate himself about the West take an unexpected leap into hyperspace when he makes the acquaintance of a punked-out girl who calls herself Jane Austen. Jane seems to suffer from assorted emotional disturbances that cause her to lurch about wildly while uttering obscenities, and she exacerbates this condition by imbibing vast quantities of alcohol and drugs. Her favorite pastime is threatening to commit suicide.
For some reason, Suzuki is instantly smitten. He is soon hanging out in front of Jane's apartment, in hopes of making a date, and it's not long before he has given her all of his money.
Jane isn't the only woman in Suzuki's life. Indeed, their romance seems to have turned this mild-mannered gentleman into a veritable sex object. Suddenly, he is being pursued by his lonely landlady and a beauteous stockbroker, who's the mistress of one of the world's richest men. Needless to say, it's only a matter of time before these assorted affairs dangerously collide, resulting in headlines proclaiming Suzuki the "Japanese Rambo."
Mr. James orchestrates these silly, implausible adventures with careless ease. Many of his jokes rely shamelessly on Suzuki's difficulties with English -- everyone he meets, from a guy named Lionel to a Mrs. Thelwell to Lilian Pflimmlin, seems to have a name filled with unpronounceable L's -- and the author's satiric comparisons of English and Japanese culture are similarly cliched. The Japanese see themselves as cogs in a large machine; the English embrace individuality and eccentricity. The Japanese like food that's spare, precise and delicately arranged; the English prefer meals heavy with grease and fat. And so on.
Fortunately for the reader, such tired observations are served up with brio and affection. In any case, they aren't really central to Suzuki's story: a story, in the end, that has less to do with the clash of cultures than with the efforts of a lonely, uptight man to embrace the confusions and risks of "a richer, wider world." All in all, a charming trifle of a book.

N.C.A.A. Vote On Athlete Aid Irks Coaches

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Jan. 10

 BODY:
An impassioned effort by basketball coaches to restore a 14th scholarship to Division I men's teams, an effort that escalated into a symbolic appeal to provide greater opportunities for minority-group athletes, was decisively defeated at the National Collegiate Athletic Association convention today.
"Nobody won in this," said Judith Albino, president of the University of Colorado and the incoming chair of the agenda-setting Presidents Commission, who took a conciliatory approach and hoped the issue could be discussed again next year as part of a more complete package of financial changes. But after an emotional debate ended with a vote of 191-119 against the increase of one scholarship per team, disappointed members of the National Association of Basketball Coaches and the Black Coaches Association were left to decide their response to a difficult defeat. 
 More than 61 percent of the voting representatives of colleges and universities sided with members of the Presidents Commission. The commission had firmly maintained that the addition of a scholarship would risk breaking the momentum of the reform movement, signal a highly visible reversal of its cost-cutting initiatives and invite similar appeals from coaches of other sports.
Less than a day after the association's new executive director, Cedric Dempsey, emphasized that refinement of past legislation should not be interpreted as a retreat, voters upheld their past decision. And coaches, having failed to influence the political process after weeks of public and private lobbying efforts, were left with the feeling that the politics of inclusion had been defeated by the politics of economic and ethical reform.
A person familiar with the coaches' discussion, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said coaches were discussing reactions that included the potential for an unspecified "job action" by coaches and even players.
The debate and result overshadowed the overwhelming acceptance of a proposal to review the stricter standards for freshman athletes that are scheduled to take effect in August 1995. Inspired by a disclosure that a research group advising N.C.A.A. committees had ties to a psychiatrist with controversial and possibly racist views on social engineering, 97 percent of the voters approved a resolution that could eventually lead to changes or a delay in the new requirements.

 
 
Thompson No Longer Talking

 
 Those possibilities provided little consolation to members of the two coaches organizations. Until the moment the resolution was introduced, Presidents Commission members had encouraged advocates of the scholarship addition to withdraw the proposal and work to include it on next year's agenda as part of a larger financial package.
Rudy Washington, the president of the Black Coaches Association, was not available to discuss the vote because his Drake University team played a game tonight. George Raveling, the Southern California coach, said through a spokesman that it was too soon to discuss the issue. John Thompson, the Georgetown coach, withdrew from the public verbal conflict in a surprising and potentially telling response. "I have no intention of talking about this issue anymore," Thompson said through a university spokesman.
Although the exclusion of minority-group athletes became a central issue in the discussion, the effort to restore a scholarship involved a variety of issues, including the struggle for a competitive advantage. The strongest support came from Division I-A schools, the highest level, where depth of talent can often provide the slim difference between teams. Of the 116 voting division I-A members, 46 percent approved the resolution.
 
School Differs With Own Coach
 The complexity of the issues could be found in contradictions such as the one at Holy Cross College, which voted against the proposal while its coach, George Blaney, was among the resolution's most visible supporters here. Blaney, the president of the N.A.B.C., characterized the outcome of the vote as having more to do with face-saving than anything else.
But the plight of economically disadvantaged high school prospects was at the center of the discussion that led to the vote. "Those 330 scholarships are so critically important to our community, in the sense that the message is going to go out to thousands of young black men who are in the underbelly of our society," said Dennis Coleman, general counsel of the Black Coaches Association. " . . . There is going to be some Reggie Lewis somewhere. Or some young kid in south Boston somewhere that his only access is going to be through this scholarship."
Charles E. Young, chancellor at U.C.L.A. and a Presidents Commission member, had supported a resolution last year that restored women's basketball scholarships to 15. But he urged delegates to vote against an increase for the men today.
"It is important that we maintain the kind of direction, the kind of pressure, that has been applied over the last several years to bring about the kinds of changes that have been made," Young said. "I think it is very clear that if this proposal is passed, we will see a move backward in a direction in which we do not want to go."
Brother Thomas J. Scanlan, the Manhattan College president and another member of the Presidents Commission, contested the notion that a vote against the resolution was a vote against opportunities. "I take exception to some of the connections being made between a 14th scholarship in men's basketball and the larger issue of higher education and access for minority and generally disadvantaged students," he said. "I think that that is not a good connection to make.
"All of our institutions," Scanlan said, "are committed to greater access to all of the young people of America. And all of our institutions are spending annually some $3 billion in institutionally funded financial aid to provide access to disadvantaged students. Most, if not all of our institutions have outreach programs for disadvantaged students. So to talk about supporting Proposition 42 as the way for youth of America to get access to higher education, I think lacks perspective. . . . People have put too much emphasis on their sport and have not looked at the overall effect and the overall commitment of higher education."

NBC Wakes Up the Echoes for Five More Years

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Notre Dame football will remain in NBC's ecstatic embrace through 2000.
Although NBC's five-year, $38 million deal with Notre Dame doesn't expire until the end of the 1995 season, the two sides yesterday announced their intention to remain married for five more years. In addition, NBC agreed to air four Notre Dame basketball games yearly starting with the 1994-95 season. 
 NBC will pay nominally more than $38 million for the five years of the current deal to provide for the costs of producing the basketball games.
"It's been an idyllic relationship," said Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports. "If you're happy, you want to extend."
The new agreement is less controversial than the first one, which found Notre Dame bolting the College Football Association's television deal with ABC, causing the value of the C.F.A.'s deal to be reduced from $200 million to $175 million.
That decision enraged much of the college football community, which accused Notre Dame of greed and duplicity. Those feelings were engendered in part by the reality that Notre Dame's national popularity makes it the only school capable of having a separate network deal.
NBC's Notre Dame telecasts peaked this season, with a six-game rating of 6.7, up from the 4.8 recorded in 1991 and 1992. Included in the 1993 average was a 16.0 rating for the Florida State game and a 7.7 for the Boston College game.
Ebersol and Dick Rosenthal, Notre Dame's athletic director, talked regularly about an extension and agreed on it in mid-December. Ebersol denied that the announcement was timed to coincide with the first day of the National Collegiate Athletic Association convention.
"Today was just my first day back in the office since Dec. 17," he said.
Ebersol and Rosenthal also denied that they rushed the extension to forestall other parties, like Fox and CBS, from bidding for Notre Dame games.
 
NBC Out of Nagano Bidding
 Ebersol said NBC would not bid for the rights to the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan, to be negotiated next Wednesday in Manhattan. NBC won the rights to the 1996 Summer Olympics for $456 million last July.
"I get a sense the economics will be very big with Fox entering the fray," Ebersol said of the Nagano bidding. "It's too much to step off into that netherland."
Dick Pound, the chief negotiator for the International Olympic Committee, said: "Not many people were persuaded that NBC had a consuming interest in this. I don't think the players are affected by this."
 
Will They Leave Kerrigan Alone?
 In the aftermath of the attack on Nancy Kerrigan last Thursday, which knocked her out of last weekend's United States Figure Skating Championships, one hopes the news media will leave the shy woman with the fragile psyche alone. Already uncomfortable in the spotlight, she otherwise could well become the focus of a torrent of publicity in the remaining month before the Olympics just when she needs to spend time in rehabilitation with an eye toward being at full strength.
"She's a very withdrawn person," said Jimmy Roberts, who interviewed her during the women's program Saturday night on ABC. "She hasn't quite figured out how to handle fame."
His interview with Kerrigan was shot from a camera on the ice, though he and Kerrigan were in a luxury suite in Joe Louis Arena, high above the ice. "I kept trying to turn her to the camera" to get a better angle, Roberts said. "I gently touched her arm, but it was rigid."
ABC will interview her this week for a figure-skating program Saturday. "It's a very sensitive situation," said Joel Feld, who co-produced the ABC telecasts. "I don't want to be intrusive. But she's a major star and her status will dominate the sports news for the next few weeks. We will be responsible. We're not going to do a kamikaze and try to get shots of her leaving her doctor's office."
Here's hoping the usual tabloid-TV suspects -- "Inside Edition," "Hard Copy," and others -- will show some decency and let Kerrigan recover in peace.
ABC's telecast covered the Kerrigan story well. Doug Wilson grabbed the viewer with his directing decisions and Dick Button was his usual candid self, never gushing over the ordinary and keeping the excellent in perspective.
Julie Moran, doubling as the play-by-play announcer and the new host of "Wide World of Sports," seemed uncomfortable and had a tendency to speak when quiet was needed or when Button and Peggy Fleming's analysis would have sufficed. And when she read off a Teleprompter, you clearly knew it.
Saturday's program generated a 17.0 preliminary overnight Nielsen rating, the highest such rating for a non-Olympic figure-skating event.
During the telecast, Button returned regularly to the theme of maturity. "Two of the skaters were 16 and one was 13," he said in a telephone interview. "That's not a negative. I won my first national senior title at 16. It's difficult to be a great athlete, be technically and dramatically mature, and have a personal style when you're 18. Boitano was 24 before he knew what it was all about. I didn't know what it was all about until I'd won two Olympics, seven U.S. titles and seven world titles."
At age 24, Button said, "Nancy Kerrigan is just learning what it's all about."

HEADLINE: A Smaller, Better World

 BODY:
Ask many Americans about their ancestors and you'll be told that their great-grandfather was one of seven and their great-grandmother the fifth of nine. They themselves, however, will most likely be parents of two or three at most. Why? Because, like the residents of other industrialized countries, they know that smaller families mean bigger futures -- and are able to act on that knowledge.
Fortunately for them, and for an increasingly impoverished planet, much of the third world has arrived at the same conclusion. As the demand for contraceptives rises, so the birth rate in countries like Thailand, Morocco and Bangladesh is dropping. 
 Government commitment to population control is one reason; foreign aid in the form of family planning programs is another; and the gradual realization of Marshall McLuhan's "global village" a third. The last is almost certainly what accounts for a much sharper drop in fertility rates in developing countries than the decline in Europe several generations back, when a newly educated populace saw that too many children added up to too many economic liabilities.
Conventional wisdom says that lower birth rates come only after living standards have risen. In this case, as Bangladesh illustrates, that thinking is now passe.
Bangladesh is among the least likely countries to experience a spontaneous drop in fertility rates. Living standards and the literacy rate are low, and so is the status of females. But fertility rates in Bangladesh have declined by 21 percent between 1970 and 1991, and contraceptive use among married women of reproductive age has risen from 3 percent to 40 percent.
Bangladesh has one of the world's largest and most successful marketing programs for contraceptives. Working closely with the Government, the U.S. provided most of the contraceptive supply and, through the Agency for International Development, the expertise to produce a delivery system that is virtually door-to-door.
What has happened in Bangladesh, and could happen in all developing countries, is of advantage not only to the world's poorest people but to everyone living on a planet that may have to support at least double our current number by 2150. By that measure, what America and other industrialized countries give to family-planning programs shouldn't really be called "foreign aid." It is world aid.

HEADLINE: Peace Corps Aid in Sub-Saharan Africa

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Africa, Out in the Cold" (editorial, Jan. 2) overlooks the contributions the Peace Corps has made to development in African countries below the Sahara. You thus overlook the contributions of 32 years and 54,000 American Peace Corps volunteers who have served in this region. 
 While you describe an increasingly difficult political and economic climate, Peace Corps has not let this "become a pretext for doing little or nothing." Over the last 10 years, the number of volunteers in these countries has increased from 2,231 to 2,418, while the number of countries served has been gone from 26 to 32. The demand for Peace Corps volunteers has continuously exceeded the supply allowed by its budget.
Certainly, the composition of requests has shifted in response to the changes in international development over the decades. The first 51 Peace Corps volunteers, a group of secondary-school teachers, arrived in Ghana in August 1961.
By the early 1970's, Ghanaian English teachers had moved into the classrooms, and Peace Corps volunteers began assignments in teacher training.
Today's sub-Saharan Africa programs of the Peace Corps include reforestation in Mali, urban sanitation in the Ivory Coast and AIDS education and prevention in Malawi.
The Peace Corps has not retreated from its commitment to empowering ordinary Africans. Participatory development efforts engineered by grass-roots organizations hold the promise of political, economic and human rights for sub-Saharan Africa.
But, for every remarkable gain, we may expect an unconscionable defeat. A "clamoring" at the local level in Gabon will often be drowned out by the wails of a Somalia.
Meanwhile, in the United States, 54,000 former volunteers are ambassadors for Africa -- many of them in positions to influence foreign policy and investment -- and bring Africa in from the cold.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall After Blasts In Mexico

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 10

 BODY:
In its first trading session since several powerful bombs shook Mexico City and signaled a possible expansion of the violence in the southern part of the country, the Mexican stock exchange recorded its biggest one-day loss in six years today, dropping 166 points, or 6.32 percent.
The exchange, the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, ended the day at 2,459.11. 
 The loss came on a day of heavy trading, with 135 million shares changing hands. There were 100 losers and only 5 gainers, with 12 issues ending without change.
The losses raised concerns, first heard last week, that the violence in the southern state of Chiapas would damage Mexico's carefully cultivated image of an open economy entering the industrialized world. Armed rebels have declared war on the Government and say they are fighting for the rights of poor Maya Indians.
 
Social Spending Increases
 The Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has signaled that its long-term reponse to the uprising will be to increase social spending in Chiapas. That also has some analysts worrying.
In their latest report on Mexico, analysts at Citicorp said that increased Government spending would make it probable that Mexico would have a budget deficit this year, the first in several years. They also project that the newly autonomous central bank of Mexico may exceed its goal of holding inflation to 5 percent in 1994, allowing the rate to rise as high as 7 percent while loosening monetary policy in an attempt to stimulate the economy.
 
A Jittery Market

The Bolsa has been jittery since armed rebels attacked several cities in the state of Chiapas in the early hours of Jan. 1, the day the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect. But losses early last week were somewhat balanced by gains later in the week.
Then Friday afternoon, the exchange itself appeared to have been caught up in the wave of violence. Workers were evacuated and riot police with bomb-sniffing dogs entered. Workers said they were told over a public address system that a bomb had been found inside. Exchange officials have denied that, saying it was just a scheduled fire drill.
Over the weekend, a bomb scare at Mexico City's international airport forced tightened security measures and four bombs exploded in and around Mexico City. A powerful car bomb exploded in a shopping center garage in the southern part of the city and an explosion went off at the base of a suburban electric tower.
Jonathan Beatson-Hird, director of Latin American equities at Baring Securities in New York, said today's heavy loss in the Bolsa was not surprising "given concern at the speed of terrorist actions" around the capital.
 
Called a Positive Sign
 But he said that the Government's willingness to negotiate with the rebels -- Mr. Salinas extended an invitation last week -- was a positive sign, in spite of fierce counterfighting by the Mexican Army in Chiapas.
Lawrence D. Krohn, chief economic for Latin America at Lehman Brothers, said the violence, while serious, had not changed the fundamentals of the Mexican market.
The violence in Chiapas is seen as a blow to Mexico's chances to have the country's bonds upgraded to investment grade this year. Guillermo Estebanez, a Mexico analyst for Moody's Investors Service, said his firm would keep Mexico at a Ba-2 rating.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 12, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday, about a steep drop in prices at the Mexican stock exchange, referred incorrectly to a record set on Monday by a larger percentage decline. That drop -- 166 points in the exchange's index, amounting to 6.32 percent -- was the biggest percentage loss in more than four years, not six.

HEADLINE: A Draft State Dept. Report Finds China's Rights Record Is Still Poor

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
A draft of a State Department report on human rights has concluded that China did not make significant progress in curbing widespread abuses last year, senior Administration officials said today. President Clinton has said such progress is necessary for China to win extension of preferential trade status next summer.
The officials said the report's findings underscore the repeated warnings by Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher that unless the Chinese move forward urgently on human rights, Beijing will lose the right to export goods to the United States under the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other countries. 
 By one analysis, the loss of this most-favored-nation status would raise the average customs duty on goods imported from China to 40 percent, from 8 percent.
Several senior Administration officials said the draft of the annual report had found that although China must be credited with improvements in some areas in 1993, there were also serious setbacks in its human rights performance, including arbitrary arrests and torture and ill-treatment of political and religious dissidents.
The report, which is undergoing final review before it is sent to Congress in three weeks, also says Beijing continues to use repression to control its people, primarily through the state security forces.
 
Struggle Over Trade Policy
 The disclosures about the report come in the face of an emerging policy struggle within the Administration over the wisdom of making the renewal of China's trade status totally dependent on its performance on human rights.
In an interview last month, the United States Ambassador to China, Stapleton Roy, said that Beijing had made "dramatic" progress in improving the lives of its citizens and that this record should be taken into account. But senior State Department officials insisted today that Mr. Roy was not reflecting official policy.
While the draft report is overwhelmingly negative, it does praise China for what one senior official described as "our intensive human rights dialogue with China" and signs of "positive developments," including the release of some prominent political prisoners and China's announcement that it is willing to consider allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit political prisoners.
According to a report in November by the human rights group Asia Watch, however, the releases of several prominent political prisoners "were overshadowed by more than 200 arrests or trials that took place during the year of people who had engaged in peaceful political or religious activities."
"There was no indication that the economic reform offensive was leading to any political liberalization," Asia Watch said.
 
Critical of Bush
 During the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton criticized President George Bush for "coddling" the Chinese Government after its bloody repression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations for democracy in 1989, and Mr. Clinton's policy has been somewhat tougher than that of the Bush Administration, which resisted all attempts by a Democratic Congress to attach conditions to the renewal of China's trade benefits.
But the economic pressures for greater trade with China, the fastest-growing economy in the world, are enormous. A number of the Administration's top economic advisers, led by Robert E. Rubin, chairman of the National Economic Council, and W. Bowman Cutter, deputy Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, have argued that punishing the Chinese hurts the United States more than it hurts China.
Reflecting those conflicting factors, President Clinton moved last fall to a policy of what Administration officials call its "engagement strategy," meant to encourage Beijing into better behavior on a wide range of issues, including human rights, the spread of weapons and drug trafficking.
 
Top-Level Meeting Expected
 Until now President Clinton, Mr. Christopher and some senior State Department officials have argued forcefully that China must be held to the letter and the spirit of an Executive Order last year that required "overall significant progress" in specific human rights areas if China's preferential trade status is to be extended. The order does not link the trade status to an improvement in China's trade and arms-export policies.
China's human rights performance is expected to be the centerpiece of an expected meeting between Mr. Christopher and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at the end of January. The meeting has not been formally scheduled, but a senior official said it may occur in Paris, Geneva or New York.
If the meeting occurs, Mr. Christopher will stress, as he has in the past, that China must show a pattern of good behavior in the coming months and cannot rush in with a few concessions on the eve of the deadline for renewal of its trade privileges.
Despite a series of Cabinet-level meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing since September, Mr. Christopher has not visited China as Secretary of State. A number of his senior advisers have urged him to make his first visit when he travels to Australia in March.
But he has said privately that he would not do so unless there was substantial progress on meeting the human rights criteria.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen will also raise the issue of more cooperation on human rights when he arrives in Beijing on Jan. 19 for high-level trade talks with Chinese leaders.
"We want the Chinese to understand that they have not made enough progress, that the longer they wait to do certain things the harder certain attitudes will be against them in this country," said one senior State Department official.
 
Points for Prosperity
 The debate over the China policy has begun to heat up as some senior officials have suggested both publicly and in private that economic prosperity in China is an important factor in evaluating its human rights record.
"We can't continue to have an on-off switch with China because of M.F.N.," said one senior Administration official, referring to the most-favored-nation trade status.
Some senior Administration officials are concerned that the Chinese may misinterpret Mr. Bentsen's visit, which is aimed at improving the economic relationship and will deal only peripherally with human rights.
In a speech last week, Mr. Bentsen signaled the tone he will strike: that improving United States access to China's market will be at the top of his agenda, and that "one of the ways to improve human rights is to encourage market reform and trade."

HEADLINE: The Bankruptcy Business Hits Hard Times

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
The legions of lawyers, accountants and investment bankers who have made good livings in the last few years working out the bad-debt cases of the 80's are about to face their worst fears: the bankruptcy business is going bust.
Last year, for the first time since 1989, fewer companies entered bankruptcy than left, helping slow the volume of billion-dollar cases to a trickle. 
 That helps explain why the country's roughly 20,000 bankruptcy specialists are clinging fast to the clients they have left -- and are turning the last mega-dollar cases like R. H. Macy & Company into all-you-can-eat buffets.
"If you take a look around, there really aren't too many other major busted 1980's deals sitting there in bankruptcy," said Robert Miller, a lawyer at Berlack, Israels & Liberman who represents Macy's bondholders. "This seems to be the last one."
The bankruptcy fees in the Macy case, while not the largest ever, are a stunning illustration of the meal-ticket mentality. Already 11 professional firms, representing Macy, the creditors and bondholders, have wrung more than $37.9 million in fees from the two-year-old case and the clock has another year or two to run.
"The debtor is a cash cow, and the court is the milking stool," said Peter A. Chapman, the editor of R. H. Macy & Company Bankruptcy News, a newsletter based in Princeton, N.J., that tracks the professional fees down to the penny.
Weil, Gotshal & Manges, Macy's chief law firm, alone has billed $13.5 million, more than a third of the total fees. Macy has its own staff of 10 lawyers, but at Weil, Gotshal, 126 people call Macy their client: 31 partners, 50 associates and 45 other employees. And at least 24 of those lawyers each billed more than $10,000 for the three-month period that ended on Oct. 31.
In one such period the firm charged $50,000 just for the time it says it spent preparing its bill, according to bankruptcy filings. Weil, Gotshal says any criticism of that figure is unfair since much of that amount reflects time it spends as the company's lawyer notifying other parties of the status of their requests for fees.
For five years now, one big company after another has sought refuge under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, clogging the courts and making those filings as routine as a Hollywood hangover. Consumers learned not to care when a beloved airline or retailer took the cure -- although competitors often complained that bankrupt rivals could lower prices ruthlessly by taking advantage of the temporary moratoriums on their debt.
As the mega-bankruptcies swelled, so did the number of people feeding off their carcasses. Nearly 20,000 Americans now make their living from bankruptcy-related work, according to Joel W. Lustig, the publisher of the National Directory of Corporate Distress Specialists. That headcount includes 12,500 lawyers, 2,000 turnaround managers, 700 accountants and 650 investment bankers, and does not begin to cover the thousands of people ranging from auctioneers to collection agents who operate on the fringes or spend only part of their time tending troubled businesses or their creditors.
 
Attracting Investors
 The securities of bankrupt companies have also cast off their stigma, attracting droves of investors. Drawn by the rich annual returns of bottom-fishing, funds representing at least $13 billion in assets are trawling for opportunities among corporate America's downtrodden. These so-called vulture investors range from household names like T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Investments to lesser-known outfits like Morgens Waterfall, a bankruptcy boutique.
But as the economy improves and companies renegotiate their debts, the bankruptcy banquet is coming to a close. Indeed, last year, 93 companies left bankruptcy while only 83 companies entered, according to Edward I. Altman, a New York University finance professor who studies distressed companies.
What's more, fewer of those filing are of spectacular size. Large companies with lots of layers of debt and equity are generally where the biggest killings are made since each faction wants its own representatives, traders have more ways to take positions and bidding wars tend to erupt.
But last year, only two barely billion-dollar companies -- the USG Corporation and Envirodyne -- filed for bankruptcy, according to the Bankruptcy Datasource in Boston. That is down sharply from the peak in 1991, when 18 behemoths sought refuge, including Maxwell Communication, Pan Am and Best Products.
With fewer filings, the price of entry for investors is climbing, meaning they might be in for a jolt. As recently as August 1992, Professor Altman could put his finger on some $200 billion in public and private debt that was either in default or in distress, an adventurer's bazaar where debts sell for an average of 52 cents on the dollar, if at all.
 
Dwindling Opportunities
 Since then, he reckons, the supply of troubled debt has shrunk to $135 billion, as Trans World Airlines and other fallen titans have reached consensuses with their former creditors and crawled out from under their former debts. The contraction has forced prices closer to 60 cents on the dollar, and is causing institutional money managers to begin pondering their next gig.
Theirs are not the only jobs on the line. "A lot of people have ridden the crest," said William Jarblum, a partner at the Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon law firm, which represents the trustee to a class of Macy's bondholders. "People will either have to rechristen themselves or they'll make a lot less money."
Mr. Jarblum, for one, expects to return to the old-fashioned corporate financings he once did, and has his eye on troubled California real estate that may yet need his assistance. Mr. Miller, a noted bondholders' lawyer, has a possible career as a jazz musician to fall back on and looks forward to a comfortable future as the very sort of corporate lawyer he once took pleasure in tormenting. When troubled companies like Buckhead America, a hotel company, swapped their old debts for new, his clients often ended up in charge and named him to the reorganized companies' boards.
Others will find it harder to retrench. "If it's the last supper, they'll be hungry for just a while, but food will be on the table again," Professor Altman insisted, looking upon the $68 billion of junk bonds issued last year, a record, as an incubator for tomorrow's disasters.
 
Submitting the Bills
 Until then, some advisers in the Macy case are gorging themselves. The Blackstone Group, Macy's financial advisers, for instance, has only four people assigned to the case. Nonetheless, during one quarter, the firm billed $6,912 under the heading of "local transportation" and another $4,889 for meals, including one skimpily documented $419 lunch. Those totals nearly equal what Weil, Gotshal's 126-person crew runs up for such expenses in most quarters.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton K. Lifland has paid some lip service to reining in fees, but has approved nearly every request. One exception concerned Peter J. Solomon, an investment banker who has been advising Macy's suppliers and union. The judge eventually allowed him to raise his fees from $400 to $500 an hour. He also raised the rate of the underling who calculates the bill for Mr. Solomon's firm from $200 to $250 an hour. The judge had disallowed the price increases the first time they were submitted.
The other exception concerned BDO Seidman, the accounting firm that represents the suppliers that Macy's stiffed. BDO wanted Macy's to pay the $20,000 it says it spent on software it bought from a vendor partly owned by the wife of one its partners. That expenditure was disallowed by the judge.
To avoid jeopardizing an assignment that has generated $9.4 million in fees, Deloitte & Touche, Macy's accounting firm, voluntarily reduced the charge to tote up its bill each quarter to $40,000 or $50,000. The 800 or so hours it generally spends on the task would ordinarily cost a client more than $100,000.
As everyone running up the tab at Macy is quick to point out, this bankruptcy is not the costliest. The all-time lallapaloozas were more complex cases like LTV ($237 million over seven years) and Federated Department Stores ($132 million over two).
"Doesn't Leonard Rosen bill $600 an hour?" Harvey Miller, a $500-an-hour lawyer at Weil, Gotshal who is Macy's chief bankruptcy lawyer asked about a well-known competitor at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
And Macy professes to be satisfied that it has received good value for its money. "I'm comfortable the fees here are not anywhere out of line for the size and nature of this bankruptcy," said Herbert Hellman, Macy's general counsel, volunteering that Federated, which is now a Macy creditor, paid more.
Nonetheless, such feeding frenzies have a way of sweeping up just about everybody in their path -- including management. Macy's, for instance, apparently could not attract Roger N. Farah, the top merchant at Federated Department Stores, without throwing a car and driver into his $11 million five-year package.
Not to be one-upped by his new hire, Myron E. Ullman, Macy's chief executive, fought to have his employment contract improved. When pressed by a creditor for an explanation, a person who was there said that Mr. Ullman became indignant and pointed to a family photo on his wall saying, "I have five children to feed."
He got his raise.

HEADLINE: Army Officers' Trials to Test Democracy in Peru

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Hurrying before the light of dawn exposed their work at a Peruvian Army firing range, a group of hooded gunmen lined up nine students and a professor kidnapped hours earlier from dormitories at a teachers college here. In the final minutes of that night 18 months ago, all 10 were shot in the head.
Returning two days later to study the site in daylight, the gunmen found a foot protruding from the desert sand and hastened to cover up traces of the killing, according to participants quoted in press accounts here. 
 Similarly, the killings on July 18, 1992, of the 10 people from La Cantuta University will not go away. Ten army officers and soldiers have been charged with kidnapping and killing the professor and students in the belief that they were responsible for car bombings carried out by the Shining Path guerrilla movement.
The army, however, opposes trying the accused men in open civilian court, and there is doubt that any found guilty would be punished harshly.
 
A Test Case for Democracy
 Today the killings stand as a test case of new civilian institutions that replaced the courts and Congress closed by President Alberto K. Fujimori in April 1992. The United States has warned that $100 million in economic aid will not be disbursed unless those who carried out the La Cantuta killings and other major abuses of human rights are punished.
"La Cantuta is shaping up to be the test case that will make or break aid to Peru," said Juan E. Mendez, executive director of Americas Watch, the New York-based human rights organization.
The American concern about human rights abuses in Peru is to be conveyed later this month, when Alexander F. Watson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, and several United States congressmen are due to come here in the highest level American visit since President Fujimori seized expanded powers.
Most American aid was frozen after Mr. Fujimori's action, but recently Peru has campaigned to win the money back, arguing that the human rights situation is improving. Last year, for example, forced disappearances dropped to about 75, down from an average of 300 a year over the previous decade.
Despite the improvements, a satisfactory resolution of the Cantuta case is regarded in Washington as an essential precondition for aid. The army here thinks differently. Last April, Peru's Army Commander in Chief, Gen. Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, thought he could silence an investigation by the Peruvian Congress by sending tanks rumbling menacingly through streets of this capital.
But in fits and starts, investigations lurched on, fed by crusading magazine journalists, relatives of the students, opposition members of Congress, pressure from the United States, and a dissident faction within the army, Peru's most powerful political institution.
 
Officers Under Barracks Arrest
 Today, in a major civilian challenge to army privilege, two generals and six officers are under barracks arrest and are facing trials for the La Cantuta killings. Two others who have been charged have not been detained.
During the last 12 years of army warfare against the Shining Path, 3,033 guerrilla suspects were detained and secretly killed by security forces, human rights groups charge. In the same period, the army conducted two courts-martials for unjustified killings.
Although the suspects in the Cantuta case reportedly believed that they were kidnapping members of a Shining Path bomb squad, guerrilla activities by those killed has never been conclusively proved.
"The soldiers think they are the masters of the world, that they can do whatever they want with poor people," said Rayda Condor Saes, whose oldest son, Armando Armaro Condor, was one of the students killed. "When I went to the barracks they laughed in my face and said that my son had probably run off with some woman. Until his keys were found, I always thought that I would find him alive."
After months of army denials and Government stonewalling, a turning point in the case came last summer when investigators sifting through human remains at a common grave found a set of keys. The keys opened locks at Armando Amaro's school locker and at his mother's house here.
That grave, and another at the army firing range, were discovered after members of a dissident army faction called Sleeping Lion sent hand-drawn maps pinpointing two burial sites to Ricardo Uceda Perez, editor of the Lima newsweekly Si.
The Government never responded to American offers of free forensic analysis. Instead, officials shipped remains to Britain for identification through genetic mapping. Now the Government contends it does not have the money to pay for the necessary tests.
 
'Anatomy of a Cover-Up'
 "From the moment these 10 people vanished, the Government has done its best to keep the truth from public view," Americas Watch wrote in a report in September, "Anatomy of a Cover-Up, the Disappearances at La Cantuta."
According to the report, witnesses, including the third-ranking general in the Peruvian Army, have been harassed, threatened and forced into exile. Several have been arrested. General Hermoza has refused to allow any of his subordinates to testify in civilian court or before congressional investigators. The Attorney General's office dragged its feet, leaving most investigative work to journalists. Police officials have branded investigative journalists as terrorist dupes.
But with the keys, the maps, and clothing identifications by relatives, a civilian prosecutor, Victor Cubas Villanueva, decided that he had enough evidence and on Dec. 16 he formally charged 10 officers and soldiers with kidnapping and murder.
The tenacity of some Peruvians in pursuing the case is explained in part by the easing of a war psychosis that only a few months ago gripped Lima, home to one third of Peru's 22 million people.
"Under the stress of the bombs, the population demanded that terrorism be wiped out at any price," Fernando Rospigliosi wrote recently in Caretas magazine, recalling the panic atmosphere caused by a Shining Path bombing campaign in the summer of 1992. "To kidnap and murder 10 university people from a study center where it was known that there was Shining Path activity only made a handful of people nervous."
 
Fewer People Killed
 But with much of the leadership of Shining Path in jail, its ability to wreak havoc has diminished. Last year saw a drop of nearly 50 percent in the number of people killed in political violence and in the economic damages caused by the insurgency. With tensions easing, Peruvians seem increasingly to favor curbing the army's dirty war tactics.
With newsmagazines publishing photographs of the ringleaders of an army death squad suspected of carrying out the Cantuta killings, the Government has been forced to dismantle the 30-man unit, which was formed three years ago to combat Shining Path activity in Lima.
Named the Colina Group after an army war hero, the group is suspected of carrying out a string of other killings around Lima over the last two years, including the killing of 15 people attending a chicken barbecue in downtown Lima and the disappearance of a left-wing radio journalist, Pedro Yauri Bustamente. The 15 were suspected of attending a Shining Path fund-raiser but apparently were all innocent.
In a final attempt at damage control, the military is reportedly pressing Peru's Supreme Court to rule later this month that the Cantuta case should be tried in a military court instead of a civilian court.
Unlike courts-martial in the United States, most military trials in Latin America are closed to outsiders. In Peru, military court proceedings are closed to all civilian observers -- journalists, diplomats, human rights workers and relatives of the victims.
 
Concern Expressed in U.S.
 "It's a test of how autonomous civilian power really is in Peru," said Enrique Bernales Ballesteros, a former congressman who runs a political research institute here. "If La Cantuta goes to a civilian court, it will be a public trial. Military judges are not autonomous. The sentences could be decided in the army high command."
The Supreme Court decision will be watched closely in the United States, where Congress has held up American economic aid to Peru, largely because of human rights abuses.
In a letter in November to President Fujimori, leaders of the House of Representative's Human Rights Caucus raised the Cantuta case and concluded, "We remain concerned about the lack of progress in prosecuting military and police officials implicated in human rights violations."

In the latest upheaval for the riot-recovery effort here, Rebuild L. A., the group's chief operating officer said today that he would announce his resignation on Wednesday as part of a revamping of the organization.
The official, Bernard W. Kinsey, a former Xerox Corporation executive who also served as Rebuild L. A.'s co-chairman, was appointed in June 1992 to strengthen the group's management. He was also picked in response to calls for more diverse racial representation in the organization's leadership. Mr. Kinsey, who is 49, is black. The organization is seeking to create jobs and economic opportunities in riot-torn neighborhoods here. 
 But Rebuild L. A. has come under heavy criticism from community and political leaders. They say the group has not worked closely enough with the neighborhoods and has failed to attract enough corporate support to offer full-time, well-paying jobs. The furor led to the resignation in May of the group's first chairman, Peter V. Ueberroth, the former commissioner of Major League Baseball and the president in 1984 of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee. Mr. Ueberroth said at the time that he had quit because of harangues by local political leaders.
 
'A Labor of Love'
 In a telephone interview today, Mr. Kinsey said Rebuild L. A. "had been a labor of love, despite all the problems," but that he would step aside to return to his business-development consulting firm, KBK Enterprises Inc.
"I joined Rebuild L. A. because I really believed in the vision that private industry could do a lot more to make things better in the inner city," Mr. Kinsey said. "If there is one thing we learned at Rebuild L. A., it's that without equity dollars to do real estate deals, economic development projects do not work."
Mr. Kinsey had been second to Mr. Ueberroth as Rebuild L. A.'s chief spokesman and handled much of the organization's day-to-day operations. Mayor Tom Bradley's appointment of Mr. Ueberroth was quickly criticized by minority groups and local political leaders, who viewed Mr. Ueberroth, a white Republican from Orange County, as an unlikely deliverer of the inner city. The complaints led to the appointment of Mr. Kinsey and later of three other co-chairmen, a white man, a Hispanic man and an Asian woman.
 
New Leadership Structure
 Under a reorganization announced in November, Rebuild L. A., a public-private consortium, will no longer be headed by four co-chairmen. Instead, at the request of the new Mayor, Richard J. Riordan, who asked whether the organization was unwieldy, the group will be managed by a single unpaid volunteer who has yet to be named.
Asked if Rebuild L. A. had been successful so far, Mr. Kinsey said the organization had been the most effective post-riot effort in the nation's history. He cited several accomplishments: $585 million in commitments from corporations; promises to build 32 new supermarkets, 24 automobile-parts stores and 8 drugstores in inner-city Los Angeles; the creation of 12,000 jobs; the establishment of a $20 million loan fund for minority businesses, and the rebuilding of 61 percent of the structures destroyed in the riots of 1992.
Much of the $585 million pledged by corporations, however, is in the form of donated equipment and buildings, job-training programs and increases in contracts reserved for minority suppliers.
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who sits on the Rebuild L. A. board and who has also criticized the organization, said Mr. Kinsey's leadership had been a failure.
"In all candor, it's very difficult to give Mr. Kinsey high marks," Mr. Ridley-Thomas said. "I view his being there as more of a liability than an asset."
 
'He's Been a Great Blessing'
 But not everyone agreed with Mr. Ridley-Thomas. Several community leaders and educators praised Mr. Kinsey for introducing them to business people who they said had been of great help. Dr. Anyim Palmer, founder of the Marcus Garvey School, a well-regarded private school in the South-Central area, said that Mr. Kinsey had helped the school obtain a new van to transport its students and a discount on concrete to construct a new building. "He's been a great blessing to the school," Dr. Palmer said. "The tragedy is that he will no longer be with Rebuild L. A."
Anthony Downs, a senior fellow who specializes in urban development issues at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington, said that inner-city revitalization efforts like Rebuild L. A. were rarely successful because corporations had few incentives to place jobs and plants in the inner city.
Mr. Downs said inner-city areas suffered from four major problems that made them undesirable for business: crime and violence, the large number of children being reared in poverty, poor-quality schools and an inability to integrate residents into the mainstream work force.
"You can't expect a few businessmen and a few residents to cope with those monumental problems on their own," Mr. Downs said. "The job of an organization like Rebuild L. A. is probably impossible without some greater change in society."

HEADLINE: THE NATO SUMMIT;
Bosnia's Legacy

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 11

 BODY:
In the end, the summit meeting President Clinton called to assure the future of NATO could not escape the alliance's past failures, and those of the United States as its leading power, in Bosnia.
The dominant topic in the last 24 hours was not the President's "partnership for peace" to build a new relationship between NATO and formerly Communist countries to its east, but growing frustration throughout the alliance over NATO's inability to deter or stop Serbian aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 The re-emergence of long-suppressed ethnic hatreds and nationalistic pride was precisely the theme Mr. Clinton used in forcefully reasserting the American interest in the stability and security of Europe. European leaders, demoralized by their own failure to deal with the war in Bosnia and by the worst economic recession in decades, welcomed Mr. Clinton's support.
 
Regaining Sense of Purpose
 But whether his overture to the east can prevent turmoil between Russia and Eastern Europe may well depend on whether the alliance can recover the sense of purpose it lost when, with the cold war ended, it failed to prevent war in Croatia and Bosnia.
Before flying to Prague this afternoon, Mr. Clinton said his aim was ultimately "a security based not on Europe's divisions, but on the potential of its integration." But he also heard European leaders tell him repeatedly that this enterprise would depend on American support -- and, in security issues, on American leadership.
The Clinton Administration tried last spring to get the European allies to agree to let the United States carry out air strikes against the Serbian forces responsible for most of the violence in Bosnia and to let the besieged Muslim-led Bosnian Government have access to arms. But Secretary of State Warren Christopher did not carry the day with the Europeans. Some of them said that he might have persuaded them to go along if he had been less tentative.
 
Threat of Air Strikes
 Last August, with Sarajevo still under siege, the allies did agree to threaten the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes if they did not stop their "strangulation" of the city. Since then the garroting has continued, as if in open contempt of NATO's threats, and France and Britain have grown weary of seeing their soldiers killed and wounded in the United Nations forces in Bosnia.
On Monday, Mr. Clinton found himself in the position of arguing with the French and the British -- the European countries that have the most soldiers in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia -- that NATO should not make yet another bombing threat unless it was actually prepared to carry it out this time.
The allies did repeat the threat regarding Sarajevo today, and also specifically mentioned two of the five other towns designated "safe areas" by the Security Council last August: Srebrenica, where Serbian forces have prevented the relief of a Canadian peacekeeping contingent, and Tuzla, where the Serbs have been blocking the reopening of the airport for civilian relief supplies.
 
A Request for Plans
 But the latest threat could also turn out to be an empty one. All the allies did was ask the United Nations military commanders in Bosnia to draw up urgent plans, implying that air support would be there if needed. Under the procedures it established last summer, NATO will not drop a single bomb unless the United Nations commanders on the scene ask it to, and then only if Secretary-General Boutros-Boutros Ghali concurs.
"What happens now depends upon the behavior of the combatants, principally the Bosnian Serbs, and what the military commanders come back and recommend," Mr. Clinton said.
But if the request for air strikes does come from the United Nations, what happens then will depend more importantly on whether NATO's 16 members are really prepared to follow through.
 
Fear of Russian Nationalism
 The possibility of aggression by nationalist forces in Russia that might be tempted to reassert Russian imperial sway over Eastern Europe is the reason why NATO made its overture to the east, and why the new democracies in that region are accepting it.
But for many ordinary Europeans, what NATO does in Bosnia will do more to determine its relevance in the future than a partnership plan the details of which have to be worked out with each participating country, case by case, over the next few years.
German officials here said that the violence in Bosnia was increasing, that it was getting harder to blame most of it on the Bosnian Serbs. United Nations officials said that a particularly vicious Serbian barrage last week was a retaliation for a Bosnian Government attack.
Given the danger and ambiguities, the German officials said that the NATO countries providing troops for the peacekeeping forces were moving close to the point where they would either have to use air power to back them up and make them effective, or else give up on peacekeeping and pull them out.
"I think on today's facts there are clearly some differences among the allies," Mr. Clinton said today, speaking of Bosnia. "We'll see if our resolve is there. My resolve is there, I can tell you."
The NATO secretary-general, Manfred Worner, has said that the alliance could not be blamed for the failure in Bosnia because it had not yet been called upon to use force to stop the war.
"The instrument is there," Mr. Worner said. "The main thing still is the political will and the determination of our member nations to use it."

HEADLINE: Survival at Ground Zero: For the Hard-Core Homeless, Life at 15 Degrees

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

 BODY:
The vast sheet of ice under the Brooklyn Bridge was smooth and still Monday night on the streets of lower Manhattan. A rat had been trapped and frozen in the amber of the glacier, and the only sign of life was the distant rumble of traffic far above.
Suddenly, men began to materialize from the shadows, walking and sliding across the ice toward a van that had just pulled up. They came from the dark chambers and crannies built into the bridge's great foundation, and they came from the benches and hollows along the street the city has named the Avenue of the Finest. They lined up in an orderly file, and as the back door of the van was flung open, they breathed deep the scent of the hot chili that would be their evening's warmest moment. 
 "I'm not homeless," said Mike, waiting in line. "That's my home over there." He was a skinny man in his 40's, encased in layers of cloth and a few of paper, and he pointed toward an open door that led to one of the pitch-black storerooms under the bridge. "This is takeout. I order it every night."
He laughed as he slid away, carrying his 12-ounce plastic cup of chili, his orange, his half-pint of milk, his fresh roll and his spoon.
The meal was a gift from the Coalition for the Homeless, which operates the van that was making its first stop on a dim and relentless nightly circuit of Manhattan encampments where hundreds of people make their winter home. The coalition's deliveries of hot food are a vital element in the men's arsenal of tools to cope with the cold, but each man in line seemed to have a different strategy for getting through a 15-degree night.
Some, using only a few blankets, insisted their bodies were impervious to any temperature above zero. Others practiced the layering system, with the only limitation being the difficulty in finding enough clothing. Some made use of new high-tech sleeping bags donated by a Wall Street firm and distributed by the coalition. Others pirated their heat from nearby electrical wires of lampposts, or took it from steam pipes or exhaust fans.
 
A Secret Spot
 "I've got five blankets and two boxes, but mostly I've got the Municipal Building, because I know a warm spot there no one else knows," said S.J., a cook who accepted his chili at the van's second stop, in the parking lot in front of Family Court on Lafayette Street. "The first few weeks I thought I couldn't take it. I thought it was over. But then you know you can deal with it."
The van dispenses only food and, occasionally, clothes, not advice or criticism or public policy. After several frigid weeks, most of those who are still on the street have considered and rejected the idea of public shelter, and there is no point in preaching to the hard core. Some, like the man under the South Street viaduct, by the East River, whose box reads "Don't leave food," practice the extremes of self-sufficiency. Most, however, appreciate a hot handout, as demonstrated by the lines that form at each of the van's eight scheduled stops and occasional unplanned deliveries to the hungry who flag it down.
At City Hall Park, 25 men waited for dinner, a modest number compared with the 100 or so who gather there during the summer, but still the largest crowd of the night. Most men were veterans of the stop, but one looked out of place in a wispy coat and a particularly frightened expression.
 
His First Night
 "It's my first night out here," said Carl Baptiste, an unemployed man who said he left his Brooklyn apartment earlier in the day after a disagreement with his girlfriend. "I was over at the World Trade Center and the others told me to come over here for food. But I don't really know where to go."
Mr. Baptiste was planning to sleep in a subway station, but had been warned by others in line that some stations were dangerous while others were subject to police sweeps. He seemed to know nothing of the city's shelter system, which can provide for 6,300 people a night.
So when he got to the front of the line, he took his chili and then asked Michael Polenberg, director of the coalition's food program, where he should go. Mr. Polenberg gave him a quarter and a slip of paper with the coalition's telephone number, and urged Mr. Baptiste to call for a list of public and private shelters. Mr. Baptiste promised that he would.
"The others, they know how to live in the cold," Mr. Baptiste said. "I don't know how to do it. But I'm glad they are here because then I'm not alone. If I can't find a place, these guys will show me what to do."
 
Spare Gloves or HatsSensing the Mood
 One of the other men in line told him to ask Ron Taylor, the jovial driver of the van, if there might be any spare gloves or hats. Mr. Taylor rummaged around inside the van and found a pair of canvas work gloves and a knit watch cap. Another man came up to Mr. Taylor pointing to his thin pair of pants, which were about to fall off.
"What are you, about a size 44?" asked Mr. Taylor. "Check this out." He produced a pair of cotton engineer's overalls, donated in bulk by the Transit Museum in Brooklyn. The man thanked him and headed off for a darkened doorway, where he put them on over the pants he was wearing.
Living from place to place often means developing a carefully calibrated sense of the mood of public authority, often hour by hour. The people who live in and around the Staten Island Ferry terminal, the van's next stop, can sometimes sense it moments before the police come through to roust them, a regular occurrence since 1991, when homeless residents were blamed for the fire that damaged part of the terminal.
A man named Doug, who had been living there for two months, said officials were sometimes more generous on extremely cold nights, but not always. Several times a week, he said, he and his friends are ordered to ride the ferryboat all night, or are simply forced out onto Whitehall Street. Sonny, another regular terminal resident, said he actually prefers the disorder of a city shelter, but lately has not been able to get a bed because of overcrowding. So he takes his chances under the bright lights of the terminal.
"I've got my sleeping bag here, but they won't let you use it in the terminal, so I'd rather have a bed," said Sonny, a 30-year-old Guyanese. "But if they kick me out of the terminal I can use it outside, except that I'm worried about my feet. I've got five coats but my shoes are no good and I may have to go to Bellevue if I can't find any better shoes."
There were no extra shoes aboard the van. Sonny said he had a bad feeling about the terminal this night, so he stuffed the orange in his pocket and took his chili to his hiding place, behind the building.
 
The Coldest Place
 Everyone in the van agreed that the coldest men in New York that night were the ones who live under the South Street Viaduct, which carries the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive over the Fulton Fish Market and provides little protection from the blistering winds off the river. They are also the surliest of the van's clients, occasionally cursing the volunteers or simply refusing to emerge from the chaos of boxes, planks and tattered canvas that is their housing project.
At several of the South Street encampments, Mr. Taylor got out of the van and yell, "Coalition!" but no one stirred to take the offered food. One man, acting as a representative for the others, finally stepped out of the darkness, bearing a milk crate.
Mr. Taylor said there was no question that the man would distribute the food fairly. Such matters of protocol are simply understood on the street.
"What's your count tonight?" Mr. Taylor asked.
"Eight," replied the man.
The volunteers filled the crate with eight of each item, and the man silently withdrew with the crate into his rooms. A long trail of chili steam followed him and seemed to hover in the air, and then disappeared over the river.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Westinghouse to Lay Off 3,400, Cut Dividend

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
In his first major action as chairman of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Michael H. Jordan cut the dividend in half yesterday and announced a pretax charge of $750 million to cover the costs of laying off 3,400 employees, selling operations and settling legal disputes.
Mr. Jordan, who was named chief executive in July, has disclosed little since then except to announce in September that earnings would fall considerably short of the investment community's expectations. Paul Lego, the previous chairman, was forced out a year ago as a result of disastrous losses in the now-disbanded financial services subsidiary. 
 Following yesterday's announcement, the stock fell 12.5 cents to close at $14 on the New York Stock Exchange. On Monday, the price of Westinghouse shares had risen 50 cents each, apparently on rumors the company would take a large charge and dismiss more people.
In presenting his plan yesterday at a meeting of securities analysts in Manhattan, Mr. Jordan said his intent was to take all the necessary steps and charges at once. "Our plan," he said, "was to seek out all potential exposures and put them behind us."
Analysts noted that with the grab bag of financial and accounting actions past it, the company could be prepared to increase earnings without any lurking surprises.
While the cost-cutting measures were not so deep as some big investors might have liked, some analysts praised Mr. Jordan for rolling all the measures into a single package.
"I was glad to see him take a broad, Draconian sweep," said Kemp Fuller Jr., an analyst with RAS Securities. "I think the Lego plan of having the company cleaned up by the end of 1995 will take place, but in a different way."
NatWest Securities also praised the sweep of Mr. Jordan's announcement. "He's cleaning all the cobwebs out," Nicholas P. Heymann, a NatWest analyst, said.
In addition to cutting the annual dividend to 20 cents a share from 40 cents, and taking the special charge, the company said it would seek to improve its debt-to-equity ratio during the first half of this year by issuing $500 million in preferred stock that must eventually be converted to common stock. Moreover, at the annual meeting on April 27, the company will seek authorization for additional common shares. Both issues would dilute the value of the current stock.
Westinghouse also announced these measures yesterday:
*An after-tax charge of $255 million to adjust for more conservative assumptions on pension plan assets as a result of lower interest rates.
*A contribution of $200 million in common stock to the pension fund.
*An after-tax charge of $56 million for benefits paid to laid-off employees.
*An after-tax charge of $95 million for the sale of the Westinghouse Communities real estate development subsidiary, which is to be completed this year instead of in 1995, as previously announced.
*A decision not to sell its Knoll furniture-making subsidiary, which had been marked for sale by Mr. Lego.
"We are taking these actions to improve our operating performance, accelerate the divestiture of noncore businesses, rebuild our equity base, and improve financial flexibility," Mr. Jordan said in a statement.
 
Layoffs to Cost $350 Million
 The $750 million pretax charge has three components. Revamping related to the layoff of 3,400 of the company's 105,000 employees over the next two years will cost $350 million.
An additional $215 million will account for the sale or closing of what the company describes as "certain noncore businesses," which it declined to identify.
Environmental cleanup and the settlement of other unidentified legal disputes will be covered by the remaining $185 million. The company manufactured electrical capacitors from 1958 until 1989 near Bloomington, Ind., and six landfills in the area are contaminated with chemicals known as PCB's that are used in capacitors.
Mr. Jordan said the company's debt, most of it related to bad investments in financial services, was reduced by $3.2 billion during 1993 to a total of $5.2 billion. He said debt would be pared by an additional $1.1 billion when the previously announced sale of Westinghouse's electrical distribution and control business to the Eaton Corporation was completed. That is expected within months.

HEADLINE: Union Local Agrees to Court Monitor to Bar Any Association With Mobsters

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Jan. 11

 BODY:
Roughly 35 years after Federal investigators first accused Local 813 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters of being controlled by organized crime, the union has agreed to have a court-appointed officer monitor its employees and members to insure that they do not associate with mobsters.
The move is part of a larger drive to end organized crime's influence over the private garbage-hauling industry in the New York metropolitan area, particularly Long Island, an effort that has gained momentum over the last decade with the criminal indictments, convictions and civil actions against a host of key players. 
 Local 813, which represents roughly 2,400 sanitation workers, has long been seen as a linchpin of the mob's domination of the industry, with authorities regularly describing it as a tool of the Gambino family. Today, as Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn announced the consent judgment they had negotiated with Local 813, they said it could end the allegations that the mob used the union to pressure private carters and keep them from bucking the garbage cartel established by organized crime on Long Island.
Joseph D. McCann, a Federal prosecutor, said: "Organized crime has had a very valuable tool in Local 813 for decades, and it is not something they're going to easily relinquish. The existence of an investigative officer will insure that they won't continue to exert control."
Mr. McCann and Jody Kasten, both assistant United States Attorneys in the Eastern District of New York, negotiated the agreement with the Teamsters.
 
16 Inquiries in 4 Decades
 The plans for the officer, who has yet to be appointed, is the latest development in the Government's long effort to rid the private hauling industry of corruption. Over the last four decades, there have been 16 investigations into the problem, and on several occasions, people who were cooperating with law-enforcment officials and were challenging the system were killed.
Authorities said the mob's control of the industry on Long Island is shared by two organized crime families that split the racketeering profits. The Lucchese family, they said, controlled the association that represented the carters and divided up the commercial and residential territories that local government did not serve. The Gambino family controlled the union through its secretary-treasurer, Bernard Adelstein, and law enforcement officials said that in some instances when a hauler tried to underbid or take over another's, they found themselves threatened with a strike.
Because of the mob's domination of the industry, law-enforcement officials explained, haulers were able to charge higher rates. A 1987 study by Peter Reuter of the Rand Corporation, prepared for the Justice Department and the State Organized Crime Task Force, estimated that the collusion had raised prices by about 50 percent for commercial customers and about 15 percent for residential customers on Long Island.
The union, which has members in New York City and Westchester County as well as Long Island, came under public scrutiny as early as 1958 during hearings by Senator John L. McClellan's Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Managenment Field. As a result of the committee's findings, Mr. Adelstein was indicted and convicted of extortion, though the conviction was later overturned.
 
Pact Hailed by Both Sides
 In the last few years, Local 813 has come under increased pressure from the Government and has adopted a series of reforms. After a civil racketeering suit against the teamsters in 1988 and the election of a new president of the international, the teamsters set out to clean house. In 1992 Mr. Adelstein was barred from the union for his association with organized crime figures. The next year the international suspended most of the local's executive board members, and appointed a trustee to oversee the local.
The consent judgment announced today is the settlement of another racketeering suit, which listed Local 813 as a defendant. In this suit, filed in 1989 by Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York, the local was one of more than 100 defendants accused of racketeering in the garbage hauling industry on Long Island. The suit continues against the remaining parties.
Although the Government has taken over unions in the past, today's agreement was hailed by both sides as a novel solution.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Times to Seek Cost Savings Including Some Cuts in Jobs

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
After six years of sharp declines in advertising, The New York Times reported yesterday that it had a "tiny -- but nonetheless real"-- advertising gain of 1 percent for 1993, compared with 1992.
But in a memorandum to the staff, the newspaper's publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., said that while The Times's financial picture "has stabilized, we still find ourselves facing serious difficulties" that will force the newspaper to seek cost savings, including a reduction in its white-collar work force. 
 The New York Times Company yesterday announced a special pretax charge of $30 million (approximately 19 cents a share) for the fourth quarter of 1993 "for severance and related costs resulting from anticipated white-collar staff reductions." It had earlier projected 1993 earnings of $59 million to $67 million, or 70 cents to 80 cents a share.
Mr. Sulzberger said that the newspaper had lost more than a third of its advertising volume since the 1987 stock market crash and that despite signs of an improvement in the economy, "there is little to suggest that much of this lost linage will return."
Because of increased competition for fewer advertiser dollars, Mr. Sulzberger said, the newspaper "must respond to diminished revenue by rethinking the way we operate" and reducing costs without affecting the quality of the newspaper.
He said the newspaper would seek savings, including reductions in the number of white-collar employees and managers. He said that the newspaper would try to achieve the reductions through voluntary measures, but that he could not rule out the possibility that some employees "will have to leave with severance packages."
Nancy Nielsen, the spokeswoman for The Times, said the newspaper would evaluate all categories of white-collar employees, including those in the newspaper's newsroom, as it determines where reductions would be made.
 
Union Involved
 The newspaper's contract with the New York Newspaper Guild, the union that represents white-collar and some other employees, expired on March 31. Negotiations are continuing.
The Times has contracts through the year 2000 with its production unions. Mr. Sulzberger's memorandum noted that the newspaper had reduced its staff by about 10 percent over the last six years, with most of the reductions coming from the craft employees. Mr. Sulzberger said it was "reasonable to assume" that the newspaper would need a similar reduction over the next few years from white-collar employees.
The Times made its announcement after the stock market closed yesterday. Earlier, the Times Company's class A shares ended trading at $29.125, up 37.5 cents, on the American Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Errors Are Found in Report on Welfare Costs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Federal investigators who said last week that the cost of running the nation's welfare programs was rising twice as fast as the number of recipients did not adjust the numbers for inflation, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services says.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a private organization, analyzed the report by the department's Inspector General's Office and said it found that after accounting for inflation, the costs of the welfare bureaucracy have kept pace with the increasing number of welfare recipients. 
 The spokeswoman, Melissa Skolfield, said on Monday that the center's findings were correct and that the Federal investigators had failed to adjust for inflation.
She said that the Inspector General's report, obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information Act and reported on Jan. 3, was a working draft and that its purpose was to "point out the complexities in the system and recommend areas of further study."
 
'Serious Error' Cited
 Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy organization that focuses on issues affecting the poor, said the draft report "makes a serious error," and added, "When inflation is factored in, there is no unexplained rise in administrative costs."
According to the draft report, the Federal Government is spending $6 billion to $8 billion a year to help the states in programs involving food stamps, Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
The investigators said the administrative costs of those programs had risen 43 percent from 1987 to 1991, while the number of people on the rolls increased an average of 18 percent.
But Mr. Greenstein said that if inflation was taken into account, the increase in administrative costs was just 19 percent. The center said adjusting for inflation was necessary because state and local welfare programs had seen increases in the costs of employee salaries, health benefits, postage and office supplies.
 
Reports Called Valuable
 Ms. Skolfield, the Health and Human Services spokeswoman, said the Clinton Administration was still committed to reducing the complexity of the welfare bureaucracy, and called the Inspector General's reports valuable.
A task force named by President Clinton to overhaul the nation's welfare system is also considering ways to simplify the system to reduce costs and fraud. The President has called for a two-year limit on welfare benefits, improvements in child-support collections and more education and training for low-income mothers.
Today a bipartisan group that represents state human service departments and local welfare agencies made public its blueprint for overhauling the welfare system. Many of its recommendations parallel the findings of Mr. Clinton's task force.
The group, the American Public Welfare Association, said its proposed restructuring would cost more in the short term but would save money in the long run.
A. Sidney Johnson 3d, executive director of the association, said at a news conference this morning that the cost of expanding education, training, jobs and child care for parents on welfare would exceed $15 billion over five years. But the association's report does not suggest ways to pay for its proposed changes.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
A Time Editor Is Said to Get New York Magazine Offer

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Kurt Andersen, an editor at large at Time magazine and a founding editor of Spy magazine, has been offered the job of editor of New York magazine, people at its parent company, K-III Magazines, said yesterday.
An announcement is expected by the end of the week. 
 Michael Kinsley, the co-host of the Cable News Network's "Crossfire" and a senior editor of The New Republic, had been offered the job two weeks ago. On Monday, however, he told officials at K-III that he was no longer a candidate for the job. He said that his contract with CNN posed complications but that the real reason he was turning down the job was that he did not want to live in New York.
"I found it was hard to work up any enthusiasm for living in New York and I decided that I wouldn't be the best editor of New York magazine if I couldn't live there with real enthusiasm," Mr. Kinsley said yesterday.
 
Job Vacant Since October
 The job, which is considered one of the plums of the magazine industry, has been vacant since Edward Kosner left in October to become editor in chief of Esquire magazine. Peter Herbst, who was Mr. Kosner's second in command, has been acting editor since then and was one of the candidates on the final list.
Mr. Andersen, who is 39, was appointed editor at large at Time last year. He writes a weekly column on American culture, entertainment, the media and the arts. He also created the magazine's new front section, Chronicles, which is a collection of short news reports and commentary. He is also the magazine's architecture and design critic.
Mr. Andersen was co-founder and co-editor in chief of Spy with Graydon Carter, who is now editor in chief of Vanity Fair.
New York was a survivor among city magazines after the recession forced local advertisers throughout the country to cut back on advertising pages. Last year, New York's advertising pages increased by 4 percent from 1992 levels. Its circulation for the first six months of 1993 was 434,000, virtually the same as in 1992. Newsstand sales, however, were down 9 percent.
K-III Magazines, which is controlled by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, acquired New York from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in 1991.

HEADLINE: First-Time Givers Help the Neediest Cases Fund Grow

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Each day, they witnessed the growing poverty on New York's streets, portrayed in newspaper articles and on television. In small, piecemeal ways, they tried to ease the suffering by giving to panhandlers or pitching in at soup kitchens. But with so many in need, deciding who to help overwhelmed them.
So for the first time, they turned to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. By giving to the Neediest Cases, they said, they knew their money would be used to lift thousands of people out of poverty and help make sure they do not fall back. 
 They are first-time contributors like Joyce H. Selter of Glen Ridge, N.J., who gave $100. "I do this because I've been very touched and moved by your account of neediest cases," Ms. Selter wrote. Similarly, Charles Lemonides of Manhattan said he has read accounts of poverty in The New York Times for more than 15 years, but this year he gave his first contribution to the fund, $75, because he believes the recession has driven many more people into poverty. "I hope it becomes a tradition," Mr. Lemonides wrote.
Others, like Monis M. Ring of Fort Lee, N.J., who worked as a high school mathematics teacher in New York City for 28 years, gave for the first time despite hardship of their own.
"I am recently retired, with a life-threatening illness and before I leave the area, which will be shortly, I want to make a contribution to this fund," Mr. Ring wrote in a letter with his $20 contribution. "All the cases are so needy, I wouldn't know where to begin."
 
Policy on Expenses Cited
 Several who contributed for the first time said they chose the fund, which is in the midst of its 82d annual appeal, because all donations go directly to seven social-service agencies. The Times pays the campaign's overhead to make this possible.
"I read about your services to needy people and I was convinced that this small amount of money will help a little and not go for salaries, etc.," wrote Nina Vallone, of Rochester, N.Y., who donated $25. "Many of us have become very discouraged with agencies which give very little for the purposes they solicit for. I wish I could do more."
The employees in the marketing division of DC Comics in Manhattan, celebrating an increase in business, decided to give to the Neediest Cases Fund this year's because they felt more acutely the disparity between their success and others' suffering.
"Superman returned to life, in his comic book and in the marketplace," wrote Martha Thomases, a spokeswoman for the company, in a letter with the employees' checks for $386.09. "Bruce Wayne's spine was broken, but his indomitable spirit and determination showed millions of readers that heroism is more than a perfectly trained body. We're very lucky to see profitable results from our hard work."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Edge Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were slightly higher yesterday, but within a narrow range ahead of scheduled reports of key inflation indicators, beginning with today's Producer Price Index.
Traders attributed the steady pricing in part to an article yesterday in The New York Times that suggested a key United States inflation indicator was overstated. The article reported that researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics considered the Consumer Price index overstated by as much as six-tenths of 1 percent. 
 While some traders said the revision was "old news," it is useful to the market because it reinforces a growing belief that the Federal Reserve will not tighten credit anytime soon. "Even if the markets were aware of this," one trader said, "they are more apt to react to it when they see it in the media."
 
C.P.I. Report Due
 December's Consumer Price Index is due out tomorrow at 8:30 A.M. Eastern time, and economists surveyed by Reuters expect it will rise two-tenths of 1 percent over all and three-tenths of 1 percent at the core, which excludes the volatile food and energy components.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue Inc., an information service for institutional investors, said: "Essentially what has been happening is that the economy has been losing some of its momentum as we came out of December into this year. That's fine, since that was forecast and expected by economists to happen. But for some of us, the drop in the momentum is happening a little earlier than expected."
He noted that the bond market had responded favorably, and for a while it looked as if rates would move up. But they have since come back down to the levels of much of last year's fourth quarter.
 
Long Bond Yield Unchanged
 By late in the day the Treasury's 30-year bond was trading at a price of 1003/16 to yield 6.24 percent, unchanged from the previous session. Shorter-maturity bill rates were down slightly, as a three-month issue dropped 4 basis points, to 2.96 percent, and a six-month bill dropped 3 basis points, to 3.13 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Mr. Frank expected the market would be comfortable with today's producer price numbers, since lower energy prices give an early indication of the numbers. "The real danger, but one with a low probability, is that the market will be surprised by unfavorable data indicating higher inflation than expected," he said.
If the market decides the inflation number is favorable, as expected, interest rates should not change much. Only disaster would cause it to sell off. "This is the same bond market which was very concerned about inflation about two weeks ago," Mr. Frank said.
Forecasts for the consumer price data are for a gain of about one-tenth of 1 percent, down from two-tenths of 1 percent in November, which the market would love, Mr. Frank noted. "There is some concern that the food component will increase," he said, adding that lower energy prices were likely to offset it.
 
Economic Calendar Light
 Yesterday's economic calendar was light, with only the Johnson Redbook weekly survey of sales at leading retailers. But the timing of the retailing report, which indicated stronger-than-expected activity, made it a little more important as an early indicator of the first quarter, since many market participants are now wondering how much economic strength would cause the Fed to respond.
Elsewhere, Japanese investors were again the subject of market speculation. Market watchers believe the Japanese have been selling American bonds to take advange of currency profits generated by the dollar's rise against the yen.
Yesterday the National Association of Manufacturers said its outlook for sustained economic growth could be tempered by "several downside risks, which could result in a slower growth path." At its annual outlook briefing, the group forecast 1994 gross domestic product would climb 3 percent.
But it said a rise in the dollar's strength versus foreign currencies could jeopardize growth. Widespread expectations for an appreciating dollar could spur speculative buying and cause a rapid jump. "If this takes place, the trade sector will improve more slowly than projected," the N.A.M. said.
The report also noted the potential for domestic monetary policy to be tightened too rapidly or too aggressively.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Modest Gains On Weakness in Germany

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar firmed against most leading currencies yesterday, after weak economic data from Germany encouraged traders to move out of mark-based assets.
But the gains were moderate, and many currency dealers were happy to stay on the sidelines until Washington releases price and sales reports today and tomorrow. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.7410 German marks, from 1.7343 on Monday.
 
Gold Higher in New York
 Gold rose on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, gaining $3, to $388.70 an ounce.
The German Federal Statistics Office said that western Germany's economy in 1993 showed the sharpest decline since World War II, with gross national product down 2.3 percent. Although growth stabilized in the fourth quarter, some economists are predicting another decline in the first quarter of 1994.
"Today's figures do not exclude the possibility of a double-dip recession," Nick Parsons of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London said yesterday.
The British pound, which has been rising against the mark because Britain's economic prospects are robust compared with Germany's, also surged against the mark, eclipsing its 1993 peak of 2.5950 marks.
The Japanese yen posted gains against the mark as well, limiting the dollar's headway against Japan's currency. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 112.47 yen, up from 112.27 on Monday.
While the dollar attracted investors all yesterday, dealers said few were willing to buy aggressively before the this week's American data were released.
Dealers were hoping that today's report on December producer prices and tomorrow's data on last month's consumer prices would offer clues on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and that tomorrow's retail sales numbers for December would disclose the strength of the consumer-led recovery.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4895, down from $1.4930 late on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's quotes, included: 1.4775 Swiss francs, up from 1.4725; 1.3222 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3170.

HEADLINE: From One Island, a Savory Blend of Three Cultures

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
PUERTO RICAN food is not just cuchifritos, those fried bits of pork that are sold at luncheonettes. Although the pig is king in Puerto Rican cooking, there are hundreds of dishes in this hybrid cuisine, which is partly Spanish (pork and rice), African (plantains) and Taino Indian (beans and guava).
It is spicy and savory, sometimes sweet and seldom bland. It is also intact and in flux throughout New York City, where chefs like Michael Rodriguez, 38, a caterer in Queens who graduated from the Culinary Institute of America, are reducing the amount of salt in traditional dishes and using olive oil instead of lard. 
 These chefs have an eager audience. "From 1983 to 1990, only Spanish-speaking people bought Puerto Rican cookbooks," said Nach Waxman, owner of Kitchen Arts and Letters, a Manhattan bookstore specializing in cookbooks. "In the last two years, for the first time, there are non-Puerto Ricans buying Puerto Rican cookbooks."
In November, "Puerto Rican Cuisine in America: Nuyorican and Bodega Recipes" by Oswald Rivera (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1993) was published. E. P. Dutton plans to release "A Taste of Puerto Rico" by Yvonne Ortiz next year.
According to the 1990 census, there are 897,000 Puerto Ricans in New York City, making them the largest ethnic group -- four times larger, for instance, than the number of Chinese. They are scattered throughout the boroughs, with the largest concentration, 350,000, in the Bronx.
Puerto Rican restaurants are simple places, with a counter, stools, a half-dozen tables and chairs. Napkins are paper, coffee is strong and service is friendly.
"Puerto Ricans have never been a restaurant people," said Dr. Sidney W. Mintz, a professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who has studied Puerto Rican culture. "Partly it's economic. People ate at home because they couldn't afford to eat out."
Even in New York City, Puerto Rican restaurants with tablecloths, a barometer of fanciness, are few.
"People see it as home cooking, so it remains in the neighborhoods, as mom and pop types of restaurants," said Ms. Ortiz, who is also the food service manager at Su Casa, a nonprofit drug rehabilitation program on the Lower East Side.
Typical mom and pop places are La Taza de Oro on Eighth Avenue in the Chelsea section in Manhattan, Pepe's on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village or El Bohio in the South Bronx. But many Puerto Ricans also hire caterers for family gatherings at home.
Three dishes, essential to the culture, reflect its hybrid roots. Rice and beans, an amalgam of the Indian and Spanish cultures, is the everyday dish. Roast whole pig is the celebratory dish, eaten at Christmas and at baptisms. And pasteles are meat wrapped in plantain leaves. They were invented by African women in Puerto Rico, and they look like tamales, but aren't. Within the leaves are spicy chicken or pork and a yellow silky paste often made from grated plantains.
"The pastel in the plantain leaf is the cathedral of Puerto Rican cooking," said Soledad Romero, a lecturer in the Romance language department at Queens College of the City University of New York, in Flushing. "The cultural miscegenation is in that dish." The plantain is African, the achiote (the yellow coloring) is Indian and the pork is Spanish.
Chicken is the most frequently eaten animal but not the most coveted.
"A pig is the best possible animal for a poor man to raise on a patch of land the size of a handkerchief," Dr. Mintz said.
For savory dishes, Puerto Ricans saute onion, garlic, cilantro, bell pepper and tomatoes in olive oil to make sofrito, the base of all stewed dishes. For roasted meats, they make an adobo -- a paste of salt, black peppercorns, onion and garlic -- and rub it into slits in the flesh.
There is also achiote, the poor man's version of saffron, which is made by cooking annatto seeds in oil until the oil turns orange-red.
"The Indians used achiote to color their bodies and to give color to food," Ms. Romero said. Achiote, which has a faint musky, smoky flavor, is what makes white rice yellow.
At La Taza de Oro, Alejandro Vargas, 67, and his wife, Elizabeth, 59, live a floor above the restaurant, which is open six days a week from 6 A.M. to 11 P.M. Although the Vargases offer 22 savory dishes, from codfish salad to tripe soup, the rice and beans sell best, at $3.25 an order.
Rice and beans may slide together as one dish, but they are served separately. Customers drizzle hot sauce over them as they choose, and some add fried golden yellow plantains or pig's knuckles.
The pork addict goes to a lechonera, a restaurant where the pig -- el lechon -- is roasted whole. At El Bohio in the Bronx, the exterior, like that of La Taza de Oro, is plain. But the pig is not.
A forceful bite crunches through the golden, slightly salty blistered skin and into the succulent meat flavored by the adobo. Achiote gives the skin its rich hue.
On a Saturday night in winter, the tiny restaurant is packed. Everyone is eating pork. With it, customers usually order plantains. Unpeeled, a green plantain looks inedible. A ripe plantain looks spoiled, with black spots obliterating the yellow skin.
But plantains are as versatile as they are homely. Ripe ones, when fried, are sweet and chewy. Green ones, when sliced and fried, are called tostones and have the same compelling quality as french fries. The slices, soaked in salted water, are fried once, drained, slapped flat with the palm of the hand and refried until crisp and golden.
When a green plantain is grated with pumpkin, potatoes and manioc, it becomes masa, or paste, for a pastel. Making a pastel, Ms. Romero said, "is folklore." Women make pastels and sell them, for around $1.50 apiece, from their homes as part of an underground economy.
Some cooks emerge from the underground to become caterers, which is a way to maintain their culinary roots. Fledgling caterers learn the trade pork chop by pork chop.
For instance, at El Barrio Popular Education, a nonprofit community organization at 218 East 106th Street, there are classes in catering, literacy and computers. For the last two years, Monday through Thursday, 13 women have been cooking under the supervision of Catalina Parra, a counselor, and selling their food to the other 70 students and staff members.
On a recent Thursday, Virginia Diaz was frying tostones and slapping them flat between sheets of aluminum foil. Aida Ayala made two savory rice dishes -- one with pink beans, the other with pigeon peas. And the roast pork? "I cooked it too long," Altagracia Vargas said.
"Each woman will make around $20 a day," said Klaudia Rivera, the executive director of the organization. If $100 is earned, $10 is reinvested in equipment, another $10 in ingredients and the remainder is divided among the four cooks who worked that day. Ms. Vargas and Ms. Diaz, who are on welfare, said they could imagine cooking their way to financial independence some day, just like Frances Lopez.
When Ms. Lopez was divorced in 1980, she had three children, ages 10 to 14. "Catering was the only way to be with them," Ms. Lopez said. "I refused to be a parent on the poverty level."
She asked her aunt, Marcelina Anaya, to teach her how to cook, and asked her children to help her make alcapurrias. To create them, Ms. Lopez grated manioc, made a masa and filled it with ground spiced beef. Her children shaped the mixture into three-inch footballs, which were then fried.
Ms. Lopez's company, Fiesta Caribe in the Bronx, is now 12 years old. She prepares dishes like rice with chicken -- similar to a paella without the shellfish -- and quivering flan for clients like Banco Popular, which pay about $9 a person for such a meal.
When Jose Olmo was growing up in San Juan, P.R., the first dish he learned to make was cazuela, a pudding made from sweet potato, pumpkin and taro. Seasoned with ginger, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, sugar and coconut, it is baked and served warm and melts in the mouth.
By day, Mr. Olmo teaches English at the Wildcat Service Corporation, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that trains unemployed people to re-enter the work force. At night, he caters from his Manhattan apartment, charging $20 a person for a dinner of cream of taro soup, beef smothered in onions, rice and beans and cazuela.
No matter how sophisticated Puerto Ricans' palates may be, they don't like to be separated from rice and beans. In 1986, after Michael Rodriguez graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., he worked at the Caribe Hilton International Hotel in San Juan and then the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan. In 1990, he started working on his own. One of his specialties is piononos, golden circles of fried plantain wrapped around spicy chopped beef and drizzled with beaten egg. He charges about $15 for a meal of pasteles, piononos, rice and beans and a salad.
Recently, after cooking pasteles and piononos, he said he had to be off, for a visit to La Taza de Oro.
And why?
"For rice and beans," he said.

HEADLINE: OFF THE MENU

BYLINE: By Florence Fabricant

 BODY:

The Party's Over, for Now
The party has ended on West 44th Street, at least for the time being, as the owners have shut the doors of Mamma Leone's, the huge, rollicking restaurant that has been a New York institution for decades.
"The cost of operating the restaurant in that location had become prohibitive," said Nick Valenti, the chief executive of Restaurant Associates, which owns Mamma Leone's. The restaurant, which first opened in 1906 in the 14th Street area, has been on 44th Street in the Milford Plaza Hotel since 1988. Mr. Valenti said the company negotiated unsuccessfully with Milstein Properties, the owner of the Milford Plaza Hotel, to try to get a better deal. "We are looking at new locations in New York, Orlando and Las Vegas," Mr. Valenti said. 
 The restaurant, a mecca for tourists, had been grossing about $8 million a year. But Mr. Valenti said it had been affected by the economy.
Its leaf-bedecked grottos and plaster statues of nymphs and satyrs would hardly raise an eyebrow in Orlando or Las Vegas. "We are considering one of those cities regardless of what happens in New York," Mr. Valenti said. "I don't like to see New York lose any of its institutions, but right now I'm also thinking about how nice and warm it is in those places."
 
Oops! Not Kosher

Something is not quite kosher about the 1994 Zagat Survey of New York City Restaurants. Trastevere 83, to be exact. The restaurant, listed as kosher in the guidebook, does not serve kosher food, as a number of people who follow the guidebook, shall we say, religiously, have found out. About 300,000 books were printed with the mistake indicating the restaurant has "reliably good kosher-Italian food" and listing it as kosher in the index.
So we all make mistakes. How did this one slip through? "Some of the 300 or so surveyors who mentioned it said it was kosher," explained Tim Zagat, the president of the company. "I always thought it was kosher myself so I didn't question it. Then we started getting complaints."
It was not the worst mistake, Mr. Zagat said, explaining: "That was a few years ago when we gave the address of the Four Seasons restaurant as East 49th Street, not 52nd Street. We got an angry letter from a woman saying her 85-year-old grandmother was coming to a party at the Four Seasons one night in the pouring rain and got out of the cab at the 49th Street address we gave. 'It's a miracle she's still alive,' the woman said."
 
Caviar to Go
 Caviarteria, the delicacy shop at 29 East 60th Street, is moving to 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, the former location of Reginette, and opening a retail shop and tasting cafe. The cafe, due to open in April, will feature caviar, smoked fish and foie gras, as well as champagne. Bruce Sobol, one of the owners, said they plan to serve these foods for the same prices that are charged at the retail counter.
 
Park Avenue Cafe Chain?

Will Park Avenue Cafe become a name to be reckoned with in cities that don't even have a Park Avenue? The New York Restaurant Group, which owns the Park Avenue Cafe here, where David Burke is chef, hopes to clone the restaurant in 20 cities. It is currently negotiating with a hotel chain that it wouldn't identify. "We've been looking to do something like this for years," said Alan Stillman, a partner in the company. "We hope to have a signed deal by the end of the month."
If the deal does go through, it will be one more sign that hotels have decided that leasing their restaurant space to outsiders is preferable to running the operations themselves. These days, a fancy restaurant that loses money is not something the companies that own hotels are eager to subsidize.
 
New Tastes at Le Cirque
 This week and next, some regional Italian dishes are being added to the lunch menu at Le Cirque, 58 East 65th Street. Franca Franceschini, the chef of the restaurant Romano in the Tuscan seaside resort Viareggio, will be preparing fresh linquine, baby calamari, spiny lobster and slices of miniature zucchini in the lightest olive oil and seafood broth. Next week, Bruna Santini and her son Antonio, from Dal Pescatore in Canneto Sull'Oglio, near Mantua, will prepare a dish from Lombardy. The dishes are available on the regular $29 prix-fixe luncheon.

HEADLINE: Begging and Giving

 BODY:
Begging. Most people, especially in New York, are conflicted about begging. Panhandlers can be annoying, menacing or pitiable. They remind the rest of us of matters we'd rather ignore, from poverty and deprivation to mental illness and drug addiction. What to do when approached by beggars -- give them some loose change to help them, or withhold money to discourage them? And what of the desire of the rest of us to go about our lives free of hassle and guilt?
Transit Authority officials have asked that question and they have offered up an answer: a crackdown. Don't give to beggars, they're telling straphangers; arrest panhandlers caught begging repeatedly, they're telling transit police. 
 As most New Yorkers are about begging, we are conflicted about this latest T.A. policy. Subway panhandling is indeed an intrusion. Subway riders are temporary captives. There's nowhere for them to escape until they get to their stop -- other than into the next car. They have a right to breathing space and peace. So yes, the Transit Authority police should discourage begging on the subways, even to the point of arrest.
But should government be telling people not to exercise compassion at a time when poverty is at its most visible since the Depression? The increase in panhandling in New York and elsewhere is partly a reflection of the country's economic condition. Some beggars are, as a college student put it in an interview with The Times, "begging because they need to." They are down on their luck, out of work, poor. Of course, some are alcoholics or drug addicts, or the mentally ill. But they, too, can be needy. Surely our municipal soul is not so pinched that we cannot spare a dime for those less fortunate than we, even those who made the miserable, and frigid, beds in which they lie.
To its credit, the Transit Authority says it will refer the beggars to social service agencies that can help them. But is it also government's job to say don't help with loose change if you feel so moved? That may make sense in the subways, where it is against the law to panhandle and one is trying to drive the panhandlers away. But the tone of the official response suggests a hardening of attitudes that could harm helpless members of society throughout the city, not just in the subways.
As the T.A. -- and the new Giuliani administration -- embrace tougher measures, officials from the Mayor on down have to avoid demonizing the disadvantaged and mistaking discipline for long-term solutions. Getting tough with panhandlers on the subways really amounts to stirring a damaged and resourceless population. They won't go away. They will go above ground, more visible reminders that the city's deeper afflictions need curing.
Panhandlers, especially those in enclosed spaces like subways, and many of the squeegee-wielders on street intersections can indeed be threatening, even dangerous. The public has a right to its peace of mind. But people also have a right to show compassion. So yes, T.A. police, discourage the panhandlers. But New Yorkers have every right to exercise their charitable instincts.
It is cold out there.

HEADLINE: Disarming Diplomacy in Ukraine

 BODY:
In a victory for its nuclear diplomacy, the Clinton Administration has persuaded Ukraine's leader to get rid of the nuclear arsenal he inherited from the Soviet Union. In agreeing to the deal, President Leonid Kravchuk recognized that Ukraine's nuclear legacy may be worth more converted into fuel than as arms. The chief concern now is that nationalists in the Ukrainian Parliament will find a way to block the pact.
If instituted, the agreement would remove a threat from Ukrainian missiles still programmed to hit American targets, reduce the risk that the warheads will fall into reckless hands and keep tensions in the former Soviet Union from escalating to nuclear war. 
 The U.S. put together an offer Ukrainians shouldn't refuse. In return for disarming, Ukraine will receive U.S. help in dismantling the arms, making its Chernobyl-type reactors safer and cleaning up its environment. The nuclear material extracted from its warheads will be turned into fuel for its power plants.
In an effort to satisfy the demands of Ukrainian nationalists, Russia will cancel a portion of Ukraine's debt as reimbursement for warheads already handed over for dismantling. It will refrain from economic coercion. And Russia, along with the U.S. and Britain, will guarantee Ukraine's borders.
The deal requires Ukraine to dismantle its entire nuclear arsenal -- 1,240 nuclear warheads mounted on its SS-19 and SS-24 missiles and 564 more on cruise missiles carried on long-range bombers. The warheads are a wasting asset. Even though they sit on Ukrainian soil, they remain under Russian operational control. For Ukrainians to pick their electronic locks and gain control over them would take time. To re-target them by reprogramming their on-board computers would take still more time. Meanwhile, the warheads are decaying and the missile fuel is becoming dangerously unstable, making the arms a menace to their possessors, not just their foes.
Nevertheless some nationalists see Ukraine's nuclear arms as a symbol of its newborn nationhood. Others want to wave the warheads at Russians who are not yet reconciled to an independent Ukraine.
But the arms are a distraction from the real threat to Ukraine's independence: the gross mismanagement of its economy and the social unrest it is kindling.
Instead of instituting economic reforms, Kiev is financing factories that produce nothing worthwhile. Ukraine's currency, which once traded on a par with Russia's ruble, now has no buying power abroad, and hyperinflation has begun to rip Ukraine apart.
Ethnic Russians in western Ukraine who voted for independence in the belief that life would be better than in Russia now have their doubts. And political disarray could pave the way for nationalists to win parliamentary elections in March.
Under these circumstances, the Clinton Administration was wise not to wait for Kiev to live up to its pledge to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Parliament would have to ratify. Instead, Washington persuaded Kiev to deactivate the warheads on missiles aimed at the U.S., the sooner the better. And the U.S. will pay Russia to ship nuclear fuel to Ukraine in advance of extracting more from Ukraine's warheads.
The Administration deserves credit for brokering this deal. And Ukraine's leaders are right to reject nuclear symbolism for economic substance.

HEADLINE: Mozambique Working Hard to Build Its Future

 BODY:
To the Editors:
I just came back from six months as a development aid volunteer in Mozambique, rebuilding two abandoned schools with local residents. Mozambique is said to be the poorest country in the world, a former Portuguese colony that gained independence just 18 years ago. It has suffered a decade of civil war, financed by South Africa, China and others. 
 Virtually no infrastructure is left. A devastating drought coincided with the last two years of war. Internal strife in South Africa and the cold war's windup ended foreign involvement in the war in Mozambique, leaving the two sides ready to settle for peace. Last year the United Nations went in to try and monitor a peace accord. That put Mozambique on a list with Cambodia, Angola, Liberia, Somalia and Bosnia.
Instead of finding desperation in Mozambique, I found peace and potential. My Mozambican co-workers are rebuilding houses and schools and moving back to the countryside, a war zone for so long. The rains came back last year after the drought. Mozambique is extremely fertile, and drought is not common.
Mozambique's war was not ethnic warfare like Bosnia's. Despite the number of ethnic groups in the country, there is less hostility between north and south in Mozambique than in the United States. Mozambique's return to stability will allow landlocked neighbors like Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi access once again to Mozambique's ports, which will stimulate the region's economic growth. Most important, the peace accord has held more than a year.
The United Nations still has a lot to do before next October's elections. But I think Mozambique is going to make it. Mozambicans have chosen peace and are working hard to build a decent future.

HEADLINE: Consumer, Beware of Banking 'Reform'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Unfinished Bank Reform" (editorial, Dec. 29): Banking "reform" to date has not saved taxpayers any money, it has only placed a straitjacket of unnecessary regulation around banks, making it difficult for them to lend, serve their communities and fuel the economy. 
 Congress did not pour money into a nearly empty deposit insurance fund. You are confusing the banking industry with savings and loan associations -- the two are very different. Banks and the Bank Insurance Fund have not cost the taxpayers a nickel. The banking industry supports the insurance fund entirely and has nearly recapitalized it singlehandedly.
You state that further reform to permit interstate branching is needed, but that small banks have blocked it, fearing competition. The benefits interstate branching will bring to small business and consumers are illusory. Allowing large banks to monopolize local banking will reduce service to local customers. One large bank told a Congressional panel this year that it found making loans of less than $500,000 cost-prohibitive. Very few of the truly small businesses that sustain our communities look for loans of this size, amd their organizations oppose interstate branching.
Consumers are unlikely to get higher interest rates on deposits. You point to California's example. But a 1991 study showed that in California, a highly concentrated market where four banks controlled more than 60 percent of the deposits in 1991, interest paid on transactions accounts was significantly lower -- and interest charged on loans significantly higher -- than the national average and average rates paid in out-of-state urban areas. That's not good for consumers, and most consumer organizations strongly oppose interstate branching.
We also seriously doubt that "small bankers have the same easy access to international outlets for their money" as large banks. A $100 million community bank in a small town does not have this access, or want it. Its mission is to help its community thrive by lending to local citizens and businesses.

Humbled Spanish Banker Responds

BYLINE: By ANA WESTLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The ousted chairman of Spain's third-largest bank, Mario Conde, defended his management today and argued that intervention by the nation's central bank late last month had been unnecessary.
On Dec. 28, the central bank took over Banco Espanol de Credito, or Banesto, as it is commonly known here, and replaced Mr. Conde and the board of directors. 
 Today, Mr. Conde broke his silence since his ouster and acknowledged at a news conference that Banesto "had problems," but he argued that they had been greatly overestimated by the central bank and could have been resolved this year if his own rescue plan, which he said had the backing of J. P. Morgan & Company, had been given a chance.
Mr. Conde insisted that Banesto's liquidity, solvency and stability in no way warranted the decision by the central bank, the Bank of Spain, to seize it. He also took issue with the central bank's accounting criteria.
 
Mild Legal Step
 Unusually subdued, Mr. Conde disputed every figure that the central bank had used as a justification for its takeover but ruled out a legal confrontation, filing only an affidavit rejecting the Bank of Spain report. Mr. Conde said he was discarding other legal options to protect the image of Spain's financial institutions.
For more than two hours in a Madrid hotel lounge, he defended his management of Banesto.
J. P. Morgan had picked Banesto as its first high-risk, high-return investment for its Corsair Fund, which had an 8.17 percent equity stake in the troubled Spanish bank. A Morgan vice chairman, Roberto Mendoza, was a Banesto board member.
Mr. Conde said he had Morgan's support days before the central bank takeover. A Morgan spokesman in New York was quoted by the Spanish news agency EFE as saying the bank would not sign Mr. Conde's appeal.
 
Figures Roundly Disputed
 When the central bank took over Banesto two weeks ago, it asserted that the entire Spanish financial system was threatened. The central bank governor, Luis Angel Rojo, told Parliament that Banesto had a deficit of about 500 billion pesetas, which is equivalent to $3.46 billion.
Mr. Conde, however, said this had been overestimated by 400 billion pesetas. But the bank's new managers fear that the shortage could be higher than the central bank's figure.
The Bank of Spain had rejected Mr. Conde's restructuring plan as insufficient and unrealistic, and described his accounting methods with words like "inventions" or "tricky."
The usually flamboyant Mr. Conde, 45, had come to represent the get-rich-quick schemes of the late 1980's and was an idol to many young Spaniards. Today, humbled, he admitted that he had made "some mistakes" but attributed Banesto's problems to the broad Spanish recession.
Speaking for shareholders -- and for his own 5 percent stake in the bank -- he argued that a capital reduction had been unnecessary.
 
Efforts by New Managers
 According to a top member of the bank's new management team, the new chairman, Alfredo Saenz, is negotiating a salvage plan that will try to protect investors' equity from the common "accordion operation," in which capital is slashed or wiped out.
Mr. Conde said he had not decided whether to appear at the next shareholders meeting, which will be asked to approve the rescue plan. His appearance stirred apparent relief in Spanish financial circles. The Madrid stock index soared above its September 1989 record of 328 to a high of 333.
"The impression we have is that he is not looking for combat," Emilio Ontiveros, a financial analyst said, "although he tried to save face."
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, in Brussels for a meeting of NATO leaders, said new audits would clarify the situation. Finance Minister Pedro Solbes insisted that the "correct interpretation is that of the central bank."

HEADLINE: Clinton Looks Homeward

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Behind all foreign policy there lurks, or ought to lurk, careful political calculation. What the folks at home will not support, the traveling potentate cannot afford to promise.
So it has been with President Clinton this week, on his maiden voyage to Europe as the leader of the Atlantic alliance. Having seen how quickly American opinion turned sour when the body of an American serviceman was dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, to be duly photographed, he is reluctant to make small commitments -- witness the turning back of an American troopship bound for Haiti -- let alone big dangerous ones.
 
No Bold Moves
 Mr. Clinton therefore made no bold move on Bosnia. He issued no ultimatum to the combatants -- do this or we will do that. Instead he and the allies temporized. 
 They threatened yet again, as they did to no great effect last August, to use air strikes at Sarajevo, but only under certain conditions and not very soon at that. They added Tuzla and Srebrenica to the list of possible targets, but only pending yet another study of feasibility and suitability.
Mr. Clinton resisted, likewise, pressures from the East Europeans for full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, obliging them to accept instead the Partnership for Peace, a little-brother status that they did not much like.
 
Russia Has Higher Priority
 One reason is the sensitivity of the Russians. For the moment, at least, Mr. Clinton has given a much higher priority to avoiding offense to the frail forces of reform in Moscow than to strengthening ties to the once-oppressed peoples of the former satellite states that once occupied such a special place in Washington's heart. That reflects the influence of Strobe Talbott, the expert on Russia who has come to dominate this Administration's strategic thinking on Europe.
But another reason is what membership in NATO means. It is, at bottom, a military alliance, and its members agree to come to the aid of each other if attacked. Expansion would mean the United States was prepared to commit troops to defend Poland or the Czech Republic (and possibly more recent membership applicants, like Lithuania or Romania) if they were attacked.
Britain's empty guarantees to Poland on the eve of World War II may have been on the mind of Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, when he asked the pivotal question last month: "Are the United States Congress, the House of Commons, the French Assembly, the German Bundestag solemnly ready to guarantee with the lives of their citizens the frontiers of, say, Slovakia? If not, or not yet, then it would be a deceit to pretend otherwise."
President Clinton does not think so, at least not now, and the mood of the country and the Senate would seem to bear him out. He was elected by a country eager to focus on its own problems, not those of the rest of the world, and he has done little to urge it to look abroad, except in terms of economic self-interest.
Even if the will were there, the means are not. The 100,000 American troops Mr. Clinton promised this week to leave in Europe, no matter what, would certainly not suffice to halt any serious manifestation of Russian expansionism. Dollars are scarce and getting scarcer for the Pentagon.
"The most effective thing for us," an American official said, "is to try to protect Eastern Europe by encouraging anti-imperialist, democratic tendencies in Russia. The problem is that the United States, or any other outside power, has only very limited influence over events in Russia."
But this is a President who likes to have things both ways. So having denied them what they sought, he met in Prague with four Eastern European leaders, led by Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and Lech Walesa of Poland, and came close -- much closer than some of his Western European partners would like -- to telling them, "Just be patient, and you'll get what you want."
 
Waiting on NATO
 On Tuesday Jiri Dienstbier, the former Czech Foreign Minister, said in an interview in Rude Pravo, a leftist daily in Prague, "We must not permit the partnership to remain a sedative or a waiting room in which to await how things turn out in Russia."
As if in direct reply, Mr. Clinton said after his round of meetings today: "While the partnership is not NATO membership, neither is it a permanent holding room. The question is no longer whether NATO will take on new members, but when and how."
But when will the right moment come?
If the American people are not ready to defend Eastern Europe with their sons' and daughters' lives now, when will they be? Surely not until Mr. Clinton or some other President makes a much stronger case than he has so far that the vital interests of the United States are at stake in the independence if these small states.
If Russia is not to be provoked at any cost, then membership for the Czechs and the others will have to be delayed until Russia has become so stable that even if angered, it would pose no threat to its neighbors. Russian history does not encourage the hope that will happen any day soon.
 
Contemplating a Darker Past
 As Mr. Clinton conceded, "There is always the chance that the darker past might be re-created."
In a way, it already has been, in Bosnia. The failure of the alliance to prevent or even to halt the genocidal war there, in another East European country to which NATO guarantees do not apply, cannot be encouraging to Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic as they contemplate what would happen if they found themselves trapped once more in their tragic geography between East and West.
After a notably confident performance, Mr. Clinton won plaudits from his Western European colleagues this week, and his own staff seemed feverishly eager to portray him as reasserting American leadership abroad. Along with the usual spin-masters like David Gergen, Secretary of State Warren Christopher joined in the buildup effort, telling reporters he could almost feel America taking charge once again in the Brussels meeting rooms.
But for all that, there is still no definitive answer to the basic question as to when, where and at what cost the United States will commit its military forces. The Administration has not given its answer, and neither has the public. Until they have spoken, Europe will remain unsettled.

HEADLINE: Warning on Clinton Health Proposal From Idea's Originator

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
A Stanford University economist who invented the concept of managed competition in the health care industry said today that President Clinton's health plan would not work and should be completely rewritten.
"I conclude that the Clinton plan puts the Federal budget at enormous risk and will result in huge tax increases," said the economist, Alain C. Enthoven. He addressed a conference of the American Insurance Association at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan and later elaborated on his comments in a telephone interview. 
 Mr. Enthoven, a professor of management at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford, said workers might have to pay new taxes to cover the costs of Mr. Clinton's proposal.
Professor Enthoven seeks to combine market forces with a limited amount of Government regulation, to stimulate doctors and hospitals to compete on the basis of price and quality. This idea inspired many proposals Mr. Clinton advanced in his 1992 campaign for President.
 
Flaw in 'Controls
 But Professor Enthoven said a critical flaw of the plan was its effort to restrict prices. At the conference, he said Mr. Clinton's plan would set "extremely unrealistic" goals for health care cost increases.
Richard Kronick, a Clinton Administration adviser on health policy, disputed Mr. Enthoven's views in an interview with the Reuters news agency.
He said that the proposed ceilings on insurance premiums were not price controls and that the Clinton plan was intended to increase competition in the health care industry.
Limits on health insurance premiums "are different from what most people think of as price controls," Mr. Kronick said.
Professor Enthoven said he preferred a more modest proposal offered by Representatives Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, and Fred Grandy, Republican of Iowa.

HEADLINE: Mexico Orders Cease-Fire and Offers Rebels Amnesty

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Responding to growing political pressure to end the violence in southern Mexico and negotiate peace with a new rebel group, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today declared a cease-fire, ordered the Mexican Army not to pursue fleeing guerrillas and offered amnesty to rebels who stop fighting.
Under the new orders, the army will return fire only if fired upon, or if civilians are threatened by the rebels, Mr. Salinas said. 
 The unilateral cease-fire is the latest of several steps Mr. Salinas has taken in the last few days to soften the Government's military response to the peasant rebellion. The Mexican military's strafing of civilians and bombing of rebel holdouts have been denounced by many Mexicans and by human rights organizations.
Since Monday, Mr. Salinas has moved toward a negotiated settlement to Mexico's first significant uprising in 20 years. But opposition party leaders still questioned whether Mr. Salinas was trying to gain peace or save face.
"We just hope that they fulfill it," said Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leader of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, referring to the Government's pledge to negotiate.
Manuel Camacho Soliz, the man appointed by Mr. Salinas on Monday to find peace, arrived in Chiapas, the southern state where the fighting took place, and headed to Ocosingo, one of several cities that had been taken by rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army when they began their rebellion on Jan. 1. The city has since been retaken by the army.
Mr. Camacho said at a news conference that he had not yet had any direct contact with the rebels but was sure they had heard of the Government's willingness to stop fighting and talk.
In an effort to win the confidence of local Indians, and presumably the rebels with whom he would negotiate, Mr. Camacho appeared in Ocosingo with Bishop Samuel Ruiz, a Roman Catholic Church leader who has been a strong defender of Indian rights in Chiapas for more than 30 years.
 
Rebellion Coincides With Nafta
 The Chiapas rebellion, which started the same day the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, has been seen as an embarrassing renunciation of Mr. Salinas's economic development programs over the last five years. Mr. Salinas is under pressure from members of his own Institutional Revolutionary Party, as well as international observers, to end the violence quickly.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who opposed the free trade agreement, said that because of the events in Chiapas he intended to hold hearings before the end of the six-month period in which the pact will be reviewed and a vote taken on whether to adopt it permanently.
"We're going to make clear to the Salinas Administration what kind of political reforms are expected and required before that happens," he said.
Only sporadic shooting has been reported in Chiapas in the past few days. Journalists reported hearing explosions in the valleys around the town of Guadalupe Tepeyac on Tuesday afternoon, but most observers have been kept from the battle zone by army roadblocks.
The Mexico City daily La Jornada reported today that the rebels staged another attack on Tuesday on the army barracks in Rancho Nuevo, about six miles from San Cristobal de las Casas, and that a group of journalists trying to get to Guadalupe Tepeyac were shot at by an army helicopter.
 
Officials Say Firing Stopped
 Government officials said that as of this morning, all shooting and bombing had stopped. But journalists in the area said they heard some rocket or artillery fire along the road to Guadalupe-Tepeyac hours after the cease-fire.
So far there has been no response from the rebels to Mr. Salinas's declaration, but on Monday they said in a note that was published in El Tiempo, a newspaper in San Cristobal, that they would be willing to negotiate with the Government if the army stopped bombing, withdrew its soldiers and recognized the guerrilla movement.
Army officials reported this morning that with the exception of Guadalupe Tepeyac, all the towns taken by the rebels have been recaptured and that 12,000 to 15,000 Government troops had secured the region.
The army said that its push toward Guadalupe Tepeyac, just north of the Guatemalan border, had been prolonged because the principal roads leading there had been heavily damaged. Rebels reportedly have dug deep ditches across the mountain roads and blocked them with downed trees.
Journalists in the area reported seeing a convoy of some 40 trucks and 15 armored vehicles advancing slowly yesterday toward the small community of a few hundred residents.
On Monday Mr. Salinas, acknowledging in a televised speech that parts of his Government were not working as they should have, made several changes in his cabinet. He named named Mr. Camacho, who had been Foreign Minister, as commissioner of peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. Mr. Camacho is known as a skilled negotiator and had been a top candidate to run for president in next August's presidential elections.
While Mr. Salinas has said from the beginning of the crisis that his Government is willing to negotiate, his original offer of reconciliation was more restrictive than later ones. Last week the Government offered to talk to the rebels only after they had surrendered their arms, released hostages and identify their leaders. Now there are no conditions.
Mexico was startled in the first few hours of the new year as armed insurgents marched into several cities in Chiapas, declaring war on the Government and vowing to fight for a long list of demands including Indian rights and honest elections.
At first the Mexican Army did not respond. But after the rebels attacked a military camp, the army counterattacked. The fighting spread for several days until a large number of the rebels had disappeared into the deep jungle.
Over the weekend, violence apparently related to the uprising spread to Mexico City and other parts of the country where car bombs exploded and attempts were made to blow up electrical towers.

HEADLINE: Koppell Wants Lilco to Cut, Not Freeze, Rates

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Jan. 12

 BODY:
The State Attorney General, G. Oliver Koppell, said today that the Long Island Lighting Company should cut its rates, rather than freeze them for two years, as the company has proposed.
Appearing at a news conference here with three State Assemblymen from Long Island, Mr. Koppell called on the State Public Service Commission to conduct "a full investigative hearing" on Lilco's rate proposals, which include a rate freeze in 1995 and 1996, followed by a 4 percent increase in 1997. 
 Mr. Koppell said he was concerned that Lilco and the commission might be trying to work out a private agreement on the company's rate requests. While he provided no details on how Lilco might reduce rates, he pointed to declining fuel costs as one indication that the company could do more to save consumers money.
"What we want to avoid here is facing a fait accompli -- Lilco and the P.S.C. making a deal," said Mr. Koppell, a former State Assemblyman who became Attorney General earlier this month. "We feel that it's time to review their rates, and hope to convince the P.S.C. the rates should be lowered."
Lilco officials denied that there had been any private negotiations on the proposal. Spokesmen for both the company and the commission said that plans for hearings on Lilco's rate requests were already in the works.
Suzanne Halpin, a spokeswoman for Lilco, defended the company's plans, arguing that the freeze would save electric customers $250 million.
 
A Two-Year Hold on Rates
 Last month Lilco announced that it would seek the freeze on rates, an action that surprised many Long Islanders, who had been expecting the company to continue to raise rates for the next several years as a result of costs associated with its agreement with the state to close the Shoreham nuclear power plant.
In explaining the two-year hold on rates, company officials said a number of favorable economic conditions, including lower interest rates and oil costs and the ability to buy more cheap power from outside Long Island, had made the freeze possible.
Two state agencies, the Consumer Protection Board and the Long Island Power Authority, which have long challenged Lilco's rate proposals, have filed an alternative plan for Lilco rates with the commission. That proposal also called for a two-year freeze, followed by a rate cut of one-half of 1 percent in 1997.
Richard Kessel, executive director of the consumer board and the chairman of the power authority, said Lilco's plan is not a true rate freeze.
He said that carry-over charges for fuel and other costs from previous years would allow Lilco to raise rates.
But Ms. Halpin said Mr. Kessel was trying to "muddy the waters" by suggesting that adjustments in fuel costs -- which are always made outside the rates set by the commission -- invalidate the rate freeze. "The commitment to freeze base electric rates is firm," she said.

HEADLINE: Caspian Sea Oil Search To Honor Bird and Beast

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
It is where 90 percent of the world's sturgeon breed. More than 300 species of birds migrate and nest there. A flourishing population of seals lives there.
It is the part of the North Caspian Sea controlled by Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic, and it is where there are an estimated 36 billion barrels of oil, more than was discovered in Prudhoe Bay off Alaska. 
 Despite a great temptation to prove that the oil is down there, exploratory drilling has been banned since the area was declared a nature preserve in the 1970's.
That is about to change. A group of Western oil companies is eager to begin exploration, and the Kazakh Government has made agreements that could allow drilling to begin within three years if questions about the effects of exploration and drilling on the environment can be answered.
Sviatoslav A. Medvedev, Kazakhstan's Minister of Ecology and Bioresources, who has been touring oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico for the last few weeks, said at a press briefing today in Washington that exploration would eventually be allowed because the revenue from the oil and natural gas there was vital to restructure and improve the country's faltering economy.
"We need to develop our economy to produce the oil and gas for the stable development of our country," Mr. Medvedev said through an interpreter.
Yet he is also determined that the consortium of seven oil companies explore for the oil safely. It is an area where about 600,000 seals make their home, as do half a million birds, including one of the largest concentrations of flamingos in the world. And the sturgeon that produce the country's caviar, a vital industry, spawn there.
 
Field Inspection
 So he and his staff went to see for themselves how this could be done, touring the offshore oil and gas fields and platforms of the Mobil Corporation in Mobile Bay in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Medvedev said yesterday that he was encouraged by what he saw there.
This week he also met with officials of the Clinton Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department to line up money, advice and expertise. The Administration, he said, promised to raise about $25 million through agencies like the World Bank.
He said the money would allow his department, which was created five years ago, to carry out scientific studies of the sea, help train staff members and put together laws and regulations to oversee the exploration.
He said the oil companies -- Mobil, AGIP S.p.A. of Italy, British Gas P.L.C., a partnership of Statoil of Norway and British Petroleum, Shell Exploration and Production B.V. of the Netherlands, and Total of France -- would spend the next two years taking seismic readings and that exploratory drilling would probably not begin for three years.
"This gives us a breathing space," he said. "We will be ready by then."
 
Earlier Wells Now Under Water
 The area already faces a major problem from 1,400 oil wells that had been drilled onshore about 30 years ago that are now covered by water because of an unexplained rise in the level of the Caspian Sea.
So far, he said, there have been no major oil leaks. Still, he said he intends to seek help from Western oil companies to find a way to cap the wells.
J. C. Hildrew, manager of environmental services for Mobil, said drilling in the North Caspian Sea would be a challenge because ice forms in the winter, toxic hydrogen sulfide gas is expected to be encountered in the drilling, and the sea is self-contained. In case of a spill, the oil would not be dispersed by water currents, as it would be in the ocean.
Mobil, he said, was supporting a gradual approach, adding, "We're not the kind of company that jumps in impetuously."
Kristin Suokko, a senior research specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, said any drilling in the region would have to be done very carefully.
"It is a very vital area," she said, and drilling will be "tricky."

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Bigger Security Council Will Make U.N. More Effective

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Opening consultations here on its decision to support Germany and Japan as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the Clinton Administration said today that it believed a larger Council would have greater moral authority in the world and make the United Nations more effective.
The American Representative to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, broke off her tour of Eastern Europe and the Balkans to explain to Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and other officials that while the United States wanted permanent seats for Germany and Japan it thought that this would be difficult to achieve without giving some form of permanent membership to populous developing countries as well. 
 Enlarging the Security Council was one of the most hotly debated issues last year at the General Assembly, which set up a working group to report back on the issue later this year.
 
Complaints by Many

Developing countries and many smaller industrial nations complained that the Council's present composition -- with the five World War II victors, Britain, France, the United States, Russia and China, enjoying permanent membership and a veto on decisions -- is anachronistic and no longer corresponds to present-day realities.
But there was little agreement on how to alter its membership with some countries wanting to abolish permanent seats and vetoes altogether while others wanted to add them.
In his election campaign, President Clinton said he thought Germany and Japan should be given permanent Security Council seats in recognition of their economic strength and the contribution they make to the United Nations budget, which is bigger than those of Britain, France and China.
 
Standing by View
 Subsequently, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Representative Albright have said the Administration stands by that view.
While the admission of Germany and Japan as permanent members will dilute America's influence and that of the four other permanent members, bringing on new countries will increase the Council's prestige as well as the likelihood that the United Nations gets the resources it needs for its work.
Conversely, the Clinton Administration believes that failing to enlarge the Council means its legitimacy will gradually be eroded as the rest of the world grows stronger and feels that its interests are no longer represented.
 
No View on Veto
 At the moment, the United States has no view on such questions as whether Germany and Japan should or should not be given the same veto on decisions that the present five members enjoy.
The United States will also not insist that Germany and Japan revise their constitutions to allow their military to participate in distant peacekeeping operations. "Germany can help with logistical and medical support which won't affect its constitutional restrictions," Ms. Albright told a news conference here today. And the Administration does not think agreement on enlargement is likely until 1995.
As a practical matter, the senior official said, "it is hard to see Germany and Japan joining" without some additional representation being given to the developing world at the same time.

HEADLINE: A Potential New Loss for Westchester

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Jan. 12

 BODY:
If I.B.M. vacates its headquarters complex in nearby Armonk, the move would further wound the Westchester County economy, already hurt by the loss of thousands of jobs and a growing office vacancy rate.
But it also would be another blow to Westchester's 30-year image as a suburban mecca for corporate America, the headquarters not only of the International Business Machines Corporation but of brand-name companies including Pepsico, General Foods, Reader's Digest, and Texaco. 
 In the most recent data available, the Rostenberg-Doern Company, a real estate firm that conducts surveys of the Westchester office market, said last July that the county's vacancy rate was 27.1 percent, up almost five percentage points from the previous six months. The report attributed much of the increase to I.B.M.'s decision to vacate hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space in White Plains, Purchase and Tarrytown. An exodus of I.B.M. from Armonk would open up another 400,000 square feet of space.
 
40,000 Jobs Lost
 More important, the county has had a loss of 40,000 jobs, many of them white-collar, since the 1987 stock market crash. The decline has taken the bloom off what seemed like a never-ending cycle of growth.
Starting in the 1950's, the arrival of large corporations transformed the sleepy downtown of the county seat, White Plains, into a warren of gleaming office towers. White Plains, just off Interstate 287 and five miles from I-95, became the quintessential "edge city," demonstrating how arterial highways could disperse business out of large cities like New York. But now, fewer workers emerge from the downtown buildings for lunch or errands, giving the complex of towers an empty feeling.
After I.B.M. moved into its Armonk headquarters in 1963, the village became one of Westchester's most prosperous communities. The arrival of I.B.M. brought new country clubs, fashionable restaurants and boutiques to the surrounding area. With an I.B.M. exodus, the future of some of these amenities would be in doubt.

HEADLINE: Economic Collapse Leaves Ukraine With Little to Trade but Its Weapons

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Jan. 12

 BODY:
As the second largest of the former Soviet republics, a country endowed with natural resources and a well-educated work force, Ukraine was once viewed by Western economists as having an excellent shot at becoming a prosperous market economy.
But two years after gaining independence, the earlier hopeful assessments have turned sour as Ukraine sinks deeper into economic crisis. 
 Its energy production has collapsed, its inflation is 70 to 100 percent a month, its currency reserves are perilously low and many large factories are idle or operating at less than 30 percent capacity.
It is the virtual bankruptcy of Ukraine, a country the size of France with a population of 52 million, that aides to President Clinton apparently felt could persuade the Ukrainian President, Leonid Kravchuk, to give up the nuclear weapons he inherited from Russia. More than anything else, Ukraine needs a quick infusion of economic assistance and the only thing it had to bargain with was its nuclear arsenal.
 
Difficult Prospect for Pact
 Mr. Clinton arrived in Kiev today, saying again that he felt confident that Ukraine would carry out the accord announced on Monday in Brussels eliminating its nuclear arsenal over the next seven years, even though members of Ukraine's Parliament say ratification of the deal will be difficult.
Under the accord, many details of which remain to be worked out, Ukraine would gain billions of dollars in proceeds from uranium sales and from American assistance for dismantling the world's third largest nuclear arsenal.
Mr. Clinton's visit here, the first by an American President to independent Ukraine, was seen by many as dramatizing the country's economic collapse.
While less attention has been paid to Ukraine than Russia by the West, its shattered economy almost makes Russia's look like an International Monetary Fund model.
 
Little Privatization
 Mr. Kravchuk, who used to head the Communist Party's ideology department, has clung to the old ways, shunning the sale of state-run enterprises to private owners even on the modest scale carried out in Moscow.
Russia's monthly inflation rate fell to 12 percent in December. Ukraine's was close to 100 percent. While Russians enjoy warm apartments, many Ukrainian cities are suffering from brownouts this winter and electricity is strictly rationed in many places. Although it was the bread basket of the former Soviet Union, Ukraine now imports grain.
Even though the Government ordered a 50 percent cut in industrial energy use to save what was left for domestic consumption, heating in apartment buildings in cities outside the capital, Kiev, is tightly rationed.
Amid this chaos, daily existence for Ukrainians is a grind of making ends meet, coping with a system in which poorly paid doctors seek bribes, indigent factory workers steal the products they help make for barter, and oil workers siphon off precious fuel to sell at the roadside.
 
Few Customers in Shops
 Earlier this month, on the day before the Orthodox Christmas, there were few customers in the major shops.
"Business is horrible," said Sergei Reznik, grimacing as he stood at his butcher's counter in the central market yesterday with slabs of meat hanging at his back but no takers on Christmas Eve. A few potential customers ventured forward, asked the price and then turned away.
The chaos in the economy is particularly worrisome, reform-minded Ukrainians and Western officials say, because of the size of the country and its possession of nuclear weapons. Fanning the nuclear issue is the fierce nationalism of Ukraine's Parliament, where many members see the weapons as vital to Ukrainian security.
 
Fear of Russian Power
 The economic and nuclear issues are intricately tied up with Ukraine's relations with Russia. Russia, as much as the United States, would like the nuclear warheads dismantled since some Ukrainian legislators talk of using the missiles as a deterrent against Russia.
Ukraine's economy was facing difficulties well before independence. About 30 percent of the gross domestic product came from the military industry, the country was dependent on Russian energy and one of its most reliable exports, coal, was becoming less desirable on world markets. Almost the entire industrial base was dependent on raw materials or components from other parts of the Soviet Union.
Since Ukraine severed its political ties with Moscow, its weaknesses have grown. Ukraine cannot afford to pay for the imports it needs from former Soviet republics. Exports of the products it does have to offer -- coal and steel -- have been strangled by the heavy Communist-style state regulations that include complicated licensing and foreign currency controls.
Ukraine's onetime steady strength, its agricultural sector, has also weakened. Once the provider of 25 percent of the Soviet Union's wheat harvest, Ukraine now imports grain..
The serious energy crunch is largely due to Ukraine's inability to afford the new, world-market-level prices that Moscow, its chief supplier, is demanding for its oil. And Ukraine's inability to pay is largely caused by its collapse of exports and currency reserves.
 
Russia Supplies Energy
 Ukraine imports half its energy needs from Russia. And the 50 percent that it produces domestically is unreliable -- coal that is affected by miners' strikes and atomic power stations that rely on Russian nuclear material.
"You have to realize you are in a country where there is not a normal economy," said Yuri I. Ehanurov, a Deputy Minister of Economics and a critic of his Government's policies. "By issuing many regulations and decrees, the Government thinks it is creating order in the economy but it is forcing more and more of the economy into the gray area."
Other critics say that too many Ukrainian leaders profit from its poor economic situation. For example, many members of Parliament are also directors of the country's large state factories and thus unwilling to sell them off to the private sector.
 
Credits From Central Bank
 The state enterprises, ranging from decrepit steel mills to failing coal mines, have been gobbling up huge credits from the Central Bank in order to avoid laying anyone off. The uncontrolled credits are said by economists to be a major cause of inflation.
"This is not just mismanagement," said a Western diplomat. "This is destruction of an economy in order to get rich. There is a mentality here on the part of the political class that we are due this privileged life and will just take it."
President Kravchuk has admitted some mistakes but his New Year's Eve address was upbeat.
"The outgoing year witnessed many blunders and errors, but Ukraine is not on the brink of an abyss," he said. "National income and production declines were not as great as the previous year. The most important thing is to maintain peace and calm in our common front and feel confident in our future."
But the World Bank, disputing Mr. Kravchuk's optimistic conclusion on production, instead estimated that the gross national product declined 25 percent in 1993, following an 18 percent decline in 1992.
The Parliament continued to ignore appeals to cut back on credits. In its last session on December 24, it urged the National Bank to appeal a ban placed earlier in the month on credits to unprofitable industries.
 
Corruption Among Officials
 A certain amount of corruption among members of Parliament is an accepted way of life, in large part because of their dual role as executives in the state enterprises. Last month, the acting Prime Minister, Efrem Ziviligsky, pleaded to a gathering of barons of the state industries to help the country out and stop demanding loans from the central bank.
"Come on, I know you all have $1,000 in your pockets," he joked.
As an example of the Government's destructive economic policies, Mr. Ehanurov cited a recent decree that requires businesses that earn dollars to exchange half the dollar earnings into the Ukrainian currency at an artificially low rate set by the Government.
The Government said the move was needed to capture revenues to pay for Russian oil. But Mr. Ehanurov said the decree simply encouraged Ukrainians who earn foreign currency to park it illegally in accounts abroad. He estimated that $12 billion in such accounts existed outside the country.
As for the lagging agriculture sector, farmers on the outskirts of Kiev are relatively well off because of the nearby city market, but they are beginning to feel the effects of the shrinking purchasing power of the city residents.
 
Greenhouses Dismantled
 The Sovki state farm, for example, dismantled its greenhouse complex last month because it could not afford the heating bills to grow the tomatoes and cucumbers it sold to Kiev. Smashed glass and broken heating pipes littered the bare earth. Fifty of the 400 employees on the farm were sent home on unpaid leave, many of them young people who went back to the more remote countryside to live with their families.
How Ukraine can get out of its economic mess is unclear.
Some Ukrainians pin their hopes on the scheduled election of a new Parliament in March. But even the optimists concede that result will probably be a Parliament similarly inclined to block economic change, because the election laws give state enterprises a head start over the neophyte political parties in nominating candidates.
Western experts say they see the pattern of Russia repeating itself here, with candidates opposed to austerity steps doing well.

HEADLINE: U.S. Slightly Eases Conditions for Aid to Moscow

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told Russian leaders today that the United States is prepared to help speed up delivery of Western aid, but only after credible signs that Russia is restructuring its budget to phase out money-losing industries, to lower inflation and to better assist the unemployed.
The mantra for President Clinton's visit, Treasury officials say, is: more Russian reform in return for more Western money more quickly. 
 That approach is in marked contrast with the initial Administration reaction to the Dec. 12 elections in Russia, when both Vice President Al Gore and the Russian-affairs coordinator, Strobe Talbott, suggested easing Western conditions for reform to defuse opposition to President Boris N. Yeltsin. That view was strongly opposed by the Treasury Department and seems to have been firmly quashed.
Mr. Bentsen, who arrived in Moscow for economic talks ahead of President Clinton, told reporters afterward that the Russians had made progress in taming inflation and spawning many new private businesses. Inflation is running about 15 percent a month, about one-tenth the rate of a year ago.
But the next few days and weeks, he said, would be critical in determining whether President Yeltsin and the newly elected Parliament can carry out the sustainable structural changes necessary to receive more aid.
Mr. Yeltsin is still putting together his new Government, and Parliament is just getting organized. It is not clear yet whether advocates of reform will be assigned leading roles in the new cabinet and, even more important, whether the Parliament will be ready to authorize a sweeping budget reorganization.
The basic position articulated by Mr. Bentsen, relayed by a senior Treasury official and echoed at a news conference in Paris today by Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is this: the West is ready to supply aid that has been promised and not yet delivered if Moscow offers "viable plans and clear and credible statements of intent" to realign its budget.
 
$23 Billion to Come
 What is new is that Washington will not insist on a waiting period to test implementation before money is delivered. Of the $28 billion in assistance promised to Russia last year by the Group of 7 industrial nations, only about $5 billion has been delivered.
That means, Mr. Bentsen said, that Moscow has to reduce inflation further. The only way to do that is to stop printing money to cover the budget deficit. And the only way to do that is to halt the broad subsidies to huge state industries like coal mining, tank factories and state farms; these subsidies account for much of the deficit.
After cutting the deficit in this way, Washigton wants Moscow to use the rest of the savings to help retrain and relocate workers who would lose their jobs and to pay pensions and unemployment insurance to cushion the political fallout.
Treasury officials say that just cushioning the workers without ending subsidies will only produce more inflation, and just cutting subsidies without cushioning the unemployed will only produce more Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's, the nationalist leader whose allies made a strong showing in the elections.
Reaching Washington's goals, however, will require a wholesale revamping of this year's budget, which has not even been drafted.
"I think they are making some progress, but they have much more to do in so far as the social net and the reallocation of resources," Mr. Bentsen said. "The hard budget choice is going to be taking away some of the subsidies from these major industries. That is an enormous budgetary change and it will take a great deal of courage."
But if Russia can do that, he said, Washington's job would be "to see that the amount of money follows the progress that is being made in support of reform."

HEADLINE: Casinos Putting Tribes at Odds

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARICOPA, Ariz.

 BODY:
In a tiny museum on the Ak-Chin Indian reservation here, near displays of prehistoric pottery and stone tools, is a vision of the future -- a drawing of a glittering $28 million casino that will soon be built and managed for the tribe by the Harrah's division of Promus Companies Inc.
"When I saw the drawings it was like going to downtown Vegas or Reno and walking down the strip," said Martin Antone Sr., the tribe's chairman. "I could smell the money." 
 But that scent is proving elusive for the Gila River Indian Community, which hoped to build a $55 million casino and resort 15 miles away from here near the same desert road. The plan was dropped amid allegations of insider dealings by the tribe's governor -- claims that he vehemently denied. Now, in a bid to compete for this area's gambling bounty with the Ak-Chin, Gila (pronounced HE la) River officials plan to operate a temporary gambling hall in a vacant industrial building to help raise the money to build a casino.
More than 150 Indian tribes, or about one-half of those in the continental United States, have jumped into the gambling business on reservations or are poised to do so. But many tribes are discovering an unexpected source of competition -- each other. There is also a growing tension over who will reap the bulk of profits from Indian gaming: the tribes themselves or publicly traded gaming companies and others that are increasingly circling reservations eager to cash in on the bonanza.
"Everyone understands that competition is here," Mr. Antone said. "All the tribes are looking at each other, and they know they are in a footrace."
Some tribes have already seen large profits evaporate after opening casino doors. Recently, the Lower-Sioux tribe signed a consulting agreement with Harrah's Casino to develop new marketing strategies for its casino near Morton, Minn. The problem: an expansion of another tribe's casino closer to Minneapolis, a major source of customers.
"Two years ago, you could put up a few slot machines, and people would stand in line, but now the bar has been raised substantially," said Thomas Carr, the senior vice president of the Indian gaming division of Promus Companies, Memphis.
 
Federal Act Paved Way
 Although a few Indian tribes ran high-stakes bingo halls in the late 1970's, it was the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 that opened the doors to Las Vegas-style casinos. Since then, at least 74 tribes in 18 states have signed agreements known as compacts to open reservation casinos, according to the National Indian Gaming Commission. Dozens more are likely to do so.
While Indian casinos generate only 5 percent of the gaming industry's total profit in the United States, or $900 million annually, that money is significant to hard-pressed tribes. The Gila River Community, which is 30 miles south of Phoenix, has an unemployment rate of 38 percent. And because of the economic benefits, other poor tribes like the Navajo, the nation's largest Indian group, have overturned laws barring casinos despite fears about gambling's social problems.
"Many of our people were concerned that those on welfare would run over to a casino with their government checks to win the big payout and end up going hungry," Duane Beyal, a Navajo spokesman, said.
To be sure, many tribes, like the Mashantucket Pequot, which operates Foxwoods' casino in Leynard, Conn., have reaped a bonanza from gambling. Even before a recent expansion of the casino, bettors were putting down as much as $3 million on a busy weekend day. Some groups have dispened profits directly to tribal members or plowed them into services like housing and education.
 
Gaming Companies Involved
 Even the giant gaming companies that light up Atlantic City and Las Vegas, once opposed to Indian gaming, now see opportunities. Many have signed or sought agreements with dozens of tribes over the past year. They have flown Indian leaders to Las Vegas, extended loans of as much as $75 million to build casino complexes on reservations and offered links with powerful industry names like Harrah's, Caesars World and Showboat Casino.
Yet some Indian groups have rejected alliances with gaming companies, viewing them as carpetbaggers.
"We don't need a lot of high-flouting millionaires that come in here and rip you off," said Theodore Smith Sr., the chairman of the Yavapai-Apache tribe in Camp Verde, Ariz.
For example, the Wisconsin Winnebago tribe fell into near-bankruptcy during the 20 months that its casinos were managed by a corrupt businessman who pleaded guilty in June to Federal charges of bribing tribal officials to retain a lucrative contract and is now in prison.
 
Opportunity or Exploitation?
 "Gambling offers Indian nations the best promise for a good life since before Columbus came," said William Thompson, a professor of public administration at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. "Yet it could easily turn into just another opportunity for exploitation by outsiders."
Some Indian leaders, in fact, have joined forces with publicly traded companies in hope of protecting themselves against fraud while winning financially, too. Earlier this year, for instance, the St. Regis Mohawk, whose reservation is in Horgansburg, N.Y., about 200 miles from Montreal, Toronto and Quebec City, found themselves courted by a number of management companies including President Riverboat Casino Inc. and Showboat Casinos, John S. Loran, a tribal chief, said.
In a bidding war for the site, President Riverboat agreed to pay $1 million for the right to build a $13 million casino and to a seven-year contract under which its take would be only 30 percent of the profits for five years and 20 percent during the remaining two years, Mr. Loran said.
Under Federal rules that regulate contracts between management companies and Indian tribes, a company that invests substantially in a reservation casino can receive up to 40 percent of its profits for seven years.
"We like to think that we are pretty good businessmen up here in Mohawk country," Mr. Loran said.
 
Latecomers in Arizona
 The Ak-Chin and Gila River are both latecomers. In the Phoenix area, the Fort McDowell tribe operates a large casino. At least 10 of Arizona's 21 tribes have signed gambling compacts with state officials to permit reservation gaming, and more tribes are preparing to do so.
With little time to spare, Mr. Antone said the Ak-Chin, a small tribe of 500 who have eked out a living growing cotton, decided to join forces with Harrah's, the only large casino company that expressed interest. Neither Mr. Antone nor Harrah's officials would disclose the terms of the deal, which is subject to approval by Federal regulators, a process that could take months. Then, Mr. Antone said he hoped Harrah's could build the casino in only six months.
While corporate executives had proposed calling the Moorish-style structure "The Oasis of the Desert," Mr. Antone said he preferred "Harrah's of Ak-Chin."
"I think the name alone will bring people in," he said.
But just down the road, the Gila River, a tribe of 11,000, has found itself in the uncomfortable role of playing catch-up after dropping a plan for Mirage Resorts Inc. to build a far larger casino with hotel rooms, a golf course and bowling alleys.
 
Gila River Conflict
 The decision followed a heated conflict between Thomas R. White, the tribe's former governor and former manager of economic development, Ammar Halloum, whom Mr. White dismissed last January. Mr. Halloum accused Mr. White of pushing the Mirage plan because he would personally benefit from it. He also claimed in a recent interview that Mr. White had offered him $30,000 to back the Mirage plan, which he thought was unfavorable to the tribe, because the casino's costs would be recouped from the tribe's profits.
Both Mirage officials and Mr. White vehemently deny any wrongdoing. And Mr. White said he dismissed Mr. Halloum for problems unrelated to the Mirage plan. He also said that Mr. Halloum had independently sought deals with management companies and had offered to make kickbacks to Mr. White if he were made the casino's purchasing manager.
"He said he would make me comfortable for the rest of my life," Mr. White said. Mr. Halloum, who sued Mr. White and the tribe in November contending he was wrongfully dismissed, denied the allegation.
Whatever occurred, the Gila River's tribal council decided this summer to forgo the Mirage plan, which the company projected would generate an annual payroll of $39 million and net revenues of $85.5 million before depreciation and interest cost related to construction.
"People got scared that Mirage would just swallow us up," Mary V. Thomas, the tribe's governor, said.
 
Avoiding Outside Investors
 Instead, the tribe will open an interim gambling hall in a vacant building in a reservation industrial park and get training in running it from Little Six Inc., a consulting company owned by the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Community, which runs the highly successful Mystic Lake Casino in Prior Lake, Minn.
Ms. Thomas said she hoped that construction of Gila River's permanent $30 million casino would be completed by December. Some gaming consultants believe that the tribe, if successful, will be far better off than groups like the Ak-Chin that split their earnings with outsiders.
Both Ak-Chin and Gila River leaders said they expected their competition to be friendly and hope there will be enough customers to go around. But as she pondered her neighbors, Ms. Thomas remained worried that her tribe's dissension had cost it valuable time.
"We are losing money every day," she said.

HEADLINE: Winter Pulls Up a Chair and Stays;
Yesterday's Snow Adds to the Burden on Municipal Budgets

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY

 BODY:
Months from now, when hearts are light with spring and this awful, icy mess of winter is just a vague memory, the imprint of the weather of 1994 will still be visible on the bottom line.
Governments across the region, charged with making life livable despite the elements, are reporting that the two storms of January are putting a strain on their snow-removal budgets. 
 New York City has already spent more than the $10 million it budgeted for the current year, and yesterday it began hiring hundreds of temporary workers to shovel out storm drains at street corners so that the ice and snow does not lead to flooding.
"In these tough budgetary times it's always a problem, but these are the dictates of nature." said Anne Canty, assistant commissioner of the City Department of Sanitation.
More snow fell yesterday and forecasters said the region could see additional flurries tomorrow. Just to keep things interesting, an arctic front from Canada is headed toward the northwest Great Lakes region and is expected to reach the New York area on Friday night, promising a weekend of temperatures in the single digits.
With yesterday's snowfall, a total of 12 inches of snow has been recorded in Central Park this winter, about 4 inches more than average for this time, said Lee Grenci, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. Last year at this time, less than an inch of snow had fallen, though by the end of the season, 24.6 inches had fallen, including 10 inches during the blizzard in March. The average annual snowfall for New York City is 25 inches, he said.
Beyond the financial effects on hard-pressed local governments, yesterday's snow meant another round of disruptions for commuters and other travelers.
La Guardia Airport was closed for about three and a half hours yesterday afternoon, delaying or canceling more than 100 flights, said John Kempfe, a Port Authority spokesman. The airport reopened at 6 P.M.
The Westchester Airport closed shortly after 4 P.M. and reopened at 9, according to the airport manager, Joel Russell.
"It was pretty intense at one point in the day," Mr. Kempfe said, referring to the four inches of snow at the airport. "They were getting one inch an hour and that was too much for them to keep up with."
 
Minor Delays for Commuters
 Most commuters heading home on buses from the Port Authority Bus Terminal experienced only minor delays, though officials said some buses to northwestern New Jersey encountered longer holdups because accumulations there were greater.
The weather caused other interruptions. Mail was not delivered to houses at which sidewalks were too icy, said Thomas E. Gaynor, a spokesman for the Postal Service in New York City. He said between 5 and 10 percent of homes did not receive mail for that reason. "We know what the motto is, and we're out there making every attempt to deliver the mail, but safety is a priority and if it's unsafe we tell the carriers to use their judgment," he said.
On Long Island, Jay Rawley, a physician's assistant in the emergency room at Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Peekskill, said there have been more broken bones, sprains and bruises as a result of "a ton of car accidents and falling-type injuries from people walking on ice."
For all the beauty of the flakes and the annoyance caused by the conditions, the most lasting effect of the weather is likely to be financial.
 
Nassau's Expensive Month
 Nassau County spent one-third of its $650,000 snow-removal budget during the first 12 days of the year, said a county spokesman, Dave Vieser. The county overspent its snow budget last year and is likely to again this year, he said. "Snow removal is an absolutely essential service for the safety of residents and no matter what the situation is with the budget, we will continue to clear the roads," Mr. Vieser said.
In Connecticut, Louis Malerba, the assistant director of maintenance for the Connecticut Department of Transportation, said half of the state's $17 million snow-removal budget for the year is already spent. "It's costing us more than we expected," Mr. Malerba said.
"We had a rough week last week," he said.
The New Jersey Department of Transportation has spent $6.2 million of the $10 million it expected to spend on snow-removal this year keeping state roads clear. Rick Remington, a spokesman, said the department does not set a budget figure for snow-removal costs. "You really can't budget snow, because each winter is so different from the next winter," Mr. Remington said. "It's really like predicting the weather."
Predicting the snow budget can be even more difficult.
In New York City, for example, the budget is set by taking an average of the snow-removal expenditures for the last five years. But that calculation excludes the year in which the budget is being prepared, because that budget year is not over when the next year's budget is being set.
Therefore, this year's $10.1 million snow-removal budget is based on the amount spent in fiscal years 1988 through 1992, all years that were unusually mild with light snowfall.
"All those mild winters when we didn't spend our entire budgets are coming home to roost," said Ms. Canty of the Sanitation Department.
Last year, with $11 million budgeted for snow removal, the city ended up spending $23 million, mostly as a result of the March blizzard. So far this year, the city has already spent $11 million, about $1 million more than budgeted.
The current round of snow and ice has brought out all the Department of Sanitation has to offer: 173,000 tons of salt at $36.03 a ton, 350 salt and sand spreaders and more than 1,000 trucks with plows.
Since last Friday, the city has spent $1.5 million in overtime keeping sanitation crews working virtually around the clock to remove the snow and ice and to try to catch up on garbage collection, which was delayed by snow removal.
Yesterday, the city hired 560 day laborers to clear storm drains, fire hydrants and bus stops.
James Robbins, 27, who was working yesterday on Lenox Avenue in Harlem, said he had been unemployed for two years. He said he was happy to have the work. "I was looking for a job anyway," he said. "I wish we could do it for longer."
Beyond governments, the costs of the snow to businesses in lost time and lost customers is difficult to calculate.
"There is a real cost, but it isn't one we ever end up counting," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "You end up operating, but with a little strain. It becomes part of the cost of doing business in the winter."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Reflecting a dive in the oil market, prices at the producer level edged down one-tenth of a percent in December while inflation for all of 1993 came close to the vanishing point, Government figures showed today.
The bond market rallied strongly on the report, pushing long-term interest rates down to 6.18 percent, the lowest in five weeks, as many credit market analysts concluded that the economy was growing at a slower-than-expected pace. [Page D16.] 
 Still, many economists concluded upon close scrutiny of the inflation report that it was as unnerving in some of its detail as it was reassuring on the surface.
 
Some Find Inflation
 "There was a certain glow," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York. "But when you penetrate the oil slick, what you find is that there is some inflation."
Not counting a 3.5 percent drop in the price of energy last month -- gasoline prices alone were down 10.4 percent -- prices received by producers for finished goods climbed five-tenths of a percent for the second straight month. Energy accounts for just under 14 percent of the Producer Price Index.
Analysts also pointed to sizable jumps in the prices of various goods at earlier stages of production, including copper and other metals sensitive to a pickup in demand, and a 2.4 percent surge in raw materials other than food and energy.
"Price pressures are starting to appear in a variety of clusters," said Robert F. Dieli, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "These can be the forerunners of inflation."
But even as they suggested the report was not as good as it first appeared, analysts said the Federal Reserve remained unlikely to raise interest rates soon as a pre-emptive strike against revived inflation, a step it is thought to favor.
"This kind of report would forestall Fed tightening," said Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. He and others believe that although the economy turned in a strong fourth quarter, the Fed lacks the pretext for tightening in the face of favorable inflation headlines and repeated contentions by the Clinton Administration and Congressional Democrats that there is no need for higher interest rates.
The finished-goods index has now advanced in only one of the latest eight months, a two-tenths of a percent rise in September.
Today's report also showed that the so-called core inflation rate -- excluding food and energy -- rose just four-tenths of a percent for the full year, the smallest increase since it was first formally calculated in 1974. The core, which rose two-tenths of a percent last month, has now also declined for two consecutive quarters, an unprecedented development.
 
Food Prices Climb
 Partly offsetting the drop in energy prices last month was an acceleration in the price of food, which surged 1.1 percent after an eight-tenths of a percent jump in November.
Much of this reflected a 40 percent leap for fresh vegetables that including a more than tripling in the price of spinach and increases of more than 50 percent for tomatoes and sweet corn. Fresh fruit also rose faster than in November but beef and veal, processed fruits and vegetables and bakery products turned down, while milled products rose less than 6 percent after increases of more than 20 percent in October and November.
Makers of passenger cars, with new-found pricing power, enjoyed a six-tenths of a percent gain last month while a 1.7 percent increase was little consolation for tobacco producers who saw prices for the full year shrink by 22.4 percent.
Goods at the intermediate level of production, like a bolt of cloth or sack of flour, eased two-tenths of a percent last month but rose by that amount when food and energy are excluded.
Analysts fretted particularly about a 1.1 percent burst, the biggest since February, in the price of durable materials, like metals, used in manufacturing. After declining in November, prices turned up for hot rolled steel bars, sheet and strip; copper cathode, aluminum mill shapes and primary aluminum.
On the other hand, chemicals and other nondurables used in manufacturing fell five-tenths of a percent last month, weaker than November's three-tenths of a percent drop.
Crude, or raw material, prices dropped 2.2 percent over all last month but this was heavily affected by energy, down 8.9 percent for the month and 13.7 percent for the year.
Raw materials other than food and energy -- about one-fifth of the index -- jumped 2.4 percent after rising 1.7 percent in November and nine-tenths of a percent in October.

Vons Opens Store in City Torn by Riots

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COMPTON, Calif., Jan. 12

 BODY:
Making good on a promise to invest in riot-torn neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area, the Vons Companies, the largest supermarket operator in Southern California, opened the first of 12 new low-income area stores today in this city known for violent crime and "gangsta" rappers.
The Compton Vons -- which has a First Interstate Bank branch, pharmacy, dry cleaners, delicatessen and bakery -- is the first full-service supermarket to open in an area 20 miles south of Los Angeles that was ravaged by riots in 1992. During the riots, the Compton Renaissance Plaza shopping center, where the new Vons is situated, had to be protected by dozens of police officers as angry mobs attempted to loot and burn it. 
 Since the riots, hundreds of companies, including Vons, have pledged their support to help revitalize inner-city areas through job training programs, donations of equipment and personnel, and construction of new businesses.
Vons, based in Arcadia, Calif., plans to spend more than $100 million to build 12 stores in low-income areas of Los Angeles. The company is expanding into the inner city at a time when its sales are slipping, hurt by an economic downturn and stiff price-cutting by competitors and wholesale grocery clubs.
Gary Giblen, an analyst for Paine Webber, said, "The inner-city strategy makes sense because Vons is going into underserved markets. It will work because people in poor areas like nice stores just like everyone else."
 
A Third-Quarter Loss
 Vons operates 350 stores under the Vons, Pavillions, Tianguis, Williams Bros. and Expo names, most of them in the suburbs. It reported a loss of $20.9 million in the third quarter ended Oct. 10. The results included a restructuring charge of $56.9 million. Sales were down in the quarter, to $1.5 billion, from $1.6 billion in the comparable period a year ago.
In November, Vons announced a cost-cutting plan, including laying off 250 workers and closing 11 unprofitable stores. The company also said it would eliminate executives' company cars and freeze administrative salaries.
But company officials said the inner city had great potential because it was grossly underserved. As many as 1.2 million people in South Central Los Angeles do not have access to a supermarket, Vons said.
"Inner-city residents don't want just another rundown Boys Market," Mr. Giblen of Paine Webber said, referring to a rival supermarket. "They want a first-class store."
Analysts said the foray by Vons into the inner city was fraught with risks, mainly the potential for crime and vandalism that could drive away customers. Still, the analysts said Vons had a good chance of succeeding because there was less competition.
Julie Reynolds, a spokeswoman for Vons, said the company had reduced the risks of operating in a high-crime area like Compton by hiring workers from the community and making sure the store had enough security.

Fixing air traffic control with a new corporate management.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT'S 5 P.M. on Thursday, and you are sardined into a sleek jet capable of whisking you from Miami to New York in time for "Seinfeld." But with air controllers lacking up-to-date equipment already straining to keep track of the hundreds of planes aloft, it will be another hour before take-off. And you aren't the only frustrated traveler this night or many others. And your frustration represents big bucks to the airlines: between 1988 and 1992, the number of hours flown daily by the average airliner actually fell by one-fifth.
Is this any way to run an air traffic control system? Not if the White House has anything to say about it. Acting surprisingly swiftly on a recommendation from the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry (who names these things?), the Clinton Administration proposed last week to create a Government-owned corporation to manage the system. 
 The proposal has been cautiously seconded by almost everyone except those who stand to lose authority in the shuffle. Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution, is merely more outspoken than most when he describes the F.A.A.'s record as "the best-kept secret of mismanagement in Government." Still, getting from here to there will be not be a breeze.
The Administration is committed to presenting a plan for corporatizing the F.A.A.'s air traffic control responsibilities by April. While no details have been offered, the best guess now is that the corporation would be financed entirely with user fees and run by an independent board with only limited oversight by Congress. But no one is contemplating a self-policing air safety system: The F.A.A., notes Daniel Kasper, a consultant at Harbridge House in Boston who was a member of the airline commission, would almost certainly retain power to enforce standards for planes, pilots and controllers.
What would be gained? Robert Poole, the head of the libertarian Reason Foundation in Los Angeles, argues that at minimum, the system would be freed from the constraints on capital spending, imposed by Washington as part of its continuing effort to cut the muscle rather than the fat from the Federal budget. In many years, he notes, the F.A.A. spending authority has been far less than the sum collected in ticket taxes.
Corporatization would also loosen the Civil Service straightjacket that now makes it almost impossible to keep the right people in the right jobs. The idea would be to match supply and demand, paying air controllers at a high-pressure post like O'Hare whatever it takes to recruit the best.
Not least, corporatization would break the grip of procurement rules that prevent timely purchases of new technology: current air traffic modernization plans are three to five years behind schedule, and counting. "The F.A.A. has more vacuum tubes than any other Federal agency," jokes Alfred Kahn, the former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board.
What could go awry? Clark Onstad, the F.A.A.'s chief counsel in the Carter Administration, worries that a casually managed divorce between the agency and air traffic control would do more harm than good. In particular, he is concerned that the corporation and agency would fail to coordinate critical decisions in training and technology. Worse, perhaps, he fears that Congress would retain sufficient power to micro-manage the corporation without being accountable for the system's failings. "The issue is control," he says.
This may be putting the cart before the horse. The first task is lining up sufficient support -- or at least dividing the opposition sufficiently -- to get a favorable judgment on corporatization from Capitol Hill. The airlines are apparently solidly behind the proposal, as are good government types: academics, policy wonks and former regulators who do most of the thinking about aviation policy. But the Administration will have to devise a strategy for placating other interests.
One potential obstacle is the powerful general aviation lobby, nonairline users of the system, in particular, owners of small aircraft. They would not easily make way for new managers who see their primary job as serving airlines and airline passengers.
Mr. Kasper suggests that single-engine aircraft owners could be pacified with the formal promise they would be asked to pay for air traffic control only when they use it -- and then only for the extra cost of accommodating them. This could be rationalized as good economics as well as good politics, he argues, since small planes are a minor burden on traffic control. By the same token, Mr. Kasper wonders whether the F.A.A. bureaucracy and its allies in Congress could not be bought off with more secure financing for the agency's remaining duties.
Corporatization won't turn lead to gold. Indeed, Mr. Kahn wonders whether in the best of worlds "it might be worth going all the way to privatization," transforming the system into Federal Express rather than the Post Office. In this world, however, Mr. Kahn and others concede, corporatization may be the only way to dig the air traffic control system out of its rut.

Inflation Report Buoys Long Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
With another sign that inflation remains under control, investors rushed to buy the Treasury's 30-year bond yesterday. Prices of the long end of the market outperformed the shorter maturities.
The release of wholesale price data for December, the first of this month's inflation reports, were particularly well received by the long end of the market, where the price of the 30-year bond increased much more than short-term and intermediate-term securities. The Labor Department's Producer Price Index fell one-tenth of a percent over all and rose two-tenths of a percent in the core inflation rate, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components. Analysts said the numbers were what many market participants had expected.
 
Pressure Off Fed
 The numbers helped to further reduce investor fears that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates anytime soon since the economy is growing but at a pace that is slower than the market had expected. 
 The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.18 percent, its lowest level since Dec. 9, when it was 6.15 percent. By late in the day, the long bond was trading at a price of 1011/32 , up 26/32 .
But while the producer price numbers were in line with general expectations, the report was actually a mixed bag of news.
It also reinforced the message sent last week through a modest rise in December nonfarm payrolls, that the economy appears to be growing at a steady pace.
The energy component, which came down more than anticipated, 3.5 percent, led the improvement in prices. But it does leave the market wondering how much longer energy can carry the ball.
"There were people who accumulated cash and speculators who were growing increasingly negative on the bond market," said John P. Costas, managing director of government trading and sales at CS First Boston. "But on Friday the psychology was short-circuited with a moderate December jobs number."
"Given the information we've gotten so far," he continued, "we feel the market has probably overreacted to these numbers because of the pent-up demand for Treasuries, which is reaching levels hard to sustain without further evidence of a weakening economy."
Today's economic numbers include the second leg of this month's inflation news -- the Consumer Price Index. The consensus of economists calls for an increase of two-tenths of a percent.
While the producer price data and lower commodity prices no doubt contributed to yesterday's rally, analysts at MMS International say these reasons cannot be seen as the primary factors behind the market's strength.
"The P.P.I. has been well contained for months," the firm said. "In fact, the market's resiliency shows there is strong conviction that noninflationary economic growth can continue."
 
Municipal Bonds Gain
 Activity in the municipal market was described by Michael S. Appelbaum, a first vice president and municipal bond specialist at Merrill Lynch, as lagging behind the government market, but with strong investor demand because of lower inflation. "However, the real focus of the muni market is in supply, which will be less with fewer refundings this year than last," Mr. Appelbaum said. "Higher taxes this year over last make the outlook for municipals very attractive."
Municipal issues were up about 1/4 point in price in firm trading.

Report on Producer Prices Sends the Dollar Tumbling

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar weakened against most leading currencies yesterday after a Government report suggested that inflation was too low to encourage the Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
Sharp declines in energy prices helped push American producer prices down one-tenth of a percent in December. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, prices rose just two-tenths of a percent. 
 The benign price data dampened lingering speculation that the Federal Reserve soon would raise interest rates to keep the economy from heating up too quickly. Lower interest rates in the United States tend to make dollar-denominated assets less attractive.
"Now everybody's figuring the Fed will hold off at least until the end of the first quarter," said Paul Alley, foreign exchange dealer at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan in New York.
Prices of Treasury securities surged after the report on producer prices was released, depressing interest rates and encouraging dollar sales.
In late New York trading, the dollar slipped to 112.25 Japanese yen, from 112.47 on Tuesday. It also fell to 1.7335 German marks from 1.7410.
Gold, an inflation hedge, also fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, lost $1.80 to settle at $386.90 an ounce.
Many currency dealers said, however, that they still thought the dollar was on an upward trend because of expectations that American economic growth would outpace that of other countries, particularly Germany. And even if American interest rates fail to rise, German rates are almost certain to fall more, they said.
Persistent reports that European central banks were selling dollars for marks helped keep the dollar in check, dealers said. While most believed the banks were buying marks to shore up reserves and not to depress the dollar, they said the end effect was the same. Once these sales dry up, the dollar could resume its upward trend, they said.
A surprisingly large fall in the British unemployment rate in December encouraged purchases of the British pound, which already had been rising steadily against the battered mark. The pound closed in New York at $1.5040, much higher than late Tuesday's $1.4895.

HEADLINE: U.S. Can Help Stop the Land-Mine Slaughter;
Deadly Legacy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The banning of antipersonnel mines throughout the world is a worthy long-run goal. 
 In the Western Hemisphere, years of armed struggle in Central America have left this deadly legacy, not only in countries where war was waged, but also in neighboring ones. The Organization of American States is engaged in extensive mine removal in Nicaragua, where demining platoons trained by us are working to clear 112,000 mines over two years. The project will be expanded to Honduras this year and then to Costa Rica, at the request of their governments.
The Organization of American States General Assembly established a special fund in 1992 to channel contributions for technical assistance in Central American mine removal projects. The United States has made important financial contributions and has helped with equipment and training. Support for this humanitarian effort has come in financial contributions and medical supplies from France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Spain and Sweden, all holding permanent observer status in the organization.
More than 100 Nicaraguan soldiers, trained, supervised and supported by military personnel from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, the United States and Uruguay, are using the latest methods to remove unmarked mines from some of Nicaraguan's most fertile lands, which have gone untilled for years in fear of these deadly remnants of the civil war that ended in 1990.
The Organization of American States, with the technical support of the Inter-American Defense Board, is coordinating this activity, which is vital to the peace, stability and economic recovery of the region as a whole.

HEADLINE: Ukrainian Agrees to Dismantle A-Arms

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Jan. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton extended his hand here tonight to a Ukrainian President he had shunned, and Leonid Kravchuk returned the gesture with his first public endorsement of a three-way accord requiring Ukraine to surrender its nuclear weapons.
A joint appearance by the Presidents after an airport meeting tonight appeared to put to rest the last doubts about whether the agreement would indeed be signed on Friday in Moscow, as Russia and the United States announced with considerable hullabaloo at the beginning of the week. 
 But there remain enormous doubts whether President Kravchuk can win sufficient support for the accord from the new Ukrainian parliament, to be elected in March, and from his own cabinet.
 
The Fuzziness That Remains
 Administration officials insist the agreement was never in peril, despite assertions by Ukrainian officials on Tuesday that details remained incomplete. But it took a special stopover by President Clinton on his journey from Prague to Moscow to win President Kravchuk's commitment.
At a joint news conference in the hangar-like Borispol Airport terminal after the two men had talked for 100 minutes, Mr. Kravchuk never quite said that he would sign the agreement. Nor did he pledge unequivocally to rid Ukraine of its entire arsenal of 1,800 warheads.
But he spoke of "the wish of the three states" that the agreement be carried out and said, "Ukraine will be a state which will not stand in the way of disarmament."
Barring any last-minute breakdown, the deal will now be formally approved when the two leaders join President Boris N. Yeltsin on Friday.
[President Clinton arrived in Moscow early Thursday for two days of meetings with Mr. Yeltsin. He was greeted in a light snow at the airport by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin before heading to his hotel.]
 
Support for 'Partnership'
 Earlier today in Prague, Mr. Clinton won a warm if not wholehearted embrace from four Eastern European heads of state for his plan to forge a loose partnership between their countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. President Lech Walesa of Poland, who had been a stern critic of the arrangement, not only relented but asked Mr. Clinton to visit Poland this summer. Mr. Clinton accepted.
While some reiterated their aspirations for more formal association, the leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia all indicated that they would enlist in the plan, which Washington calls a Partnership for Peace. Mr. Clinton said he was convinced the region would take its place "at the heart of a new Europe, an integrated Europe, prosperous, secure and free."
Tonight, in Kiev, Mr. Clinton reaffirmed that Ukraine would also be eligible to join the partnership. He also said his meeting with Mr. Kravchuk would open "a new era in our relations," and invited him to visit Washington in March.
 
Gist of the Agreement
 As outlined by United States officials, the arms accord calls for Ukraine to get rid of its 176 long-range missiles and all the nuclear warheads, most of which are aimed at the United States, within seven years. The arms are a hold-over from the days when much of the Soviet strategic force was stationed in Ukraine.
Under the accord, Ukraine would ship the warheads to Russia, where the uranium would be extracted and sold for nuclear reactors around the world.
The proceeds, estimated at $12 billion over 20 years, would be returned to Russia, which would share them with Ukraine and two other former Soviet republics, Belarus and Kazakhstan, that have also given up their nuclear weapons. Ukraine would receive an estimated $1 billion, in the form of fuel rods for its nuclear-energy program.
As part of the deal, the United States has promised Ukraine $176 million in aid to dismantle the weapons and $155 million in financial aid, which could be doubled this year if Kiev commits itself to economic reform.
 
A Little Help From His Friend
 Until tonight, Mr. Kravchuk had not spoken about the accord in public, and some of Ukraine's main newspapers made no mention of it even today.
In adding a Ukrainian visit to Mr. Clinton's itinerary, Administration officials said, they had recognized that Mr. Kravchuk needed the show of support that only Mr. Clinton could deliver. Mr. Clinton sought to give that support by saying repeatedly that the United States stood ready to increase substantially its economic support and encourage other Western countries to do so.
But when asked what security commitments the United States would offer to Ukraine in return for its surrender of nuclear weapons, he did little more than repeat the blanket assurances provided to all countries that sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Agreement.
 
The Early Word
 President Clinton's decision to announce the deal on Monday had somewhat complicated Mr. Kravchuk's task of winning support at home.
Administration officials said they had hoped to give President Kravchuk until today before all three leaders made the accord public, a delay intended to allow the Ukrainian leader time to overcome reservations within his Government. But they said Mr. Clinton's hand had been forced by a Russian declaration earlier on Monday.
"What Kravchuk needed was Clinton's presence to reaffirm Ukraine's status as a full partner in this deal," an Administration official said. But other officials acknowledged that Mr. Clinton's announcement of a follow-up visit to Washington and his mention of the prospect of increased financial aid were intended as sweeteners.
 
'Sometimes Small Is Beautiful'
 In Prague, President Clinton was told by President Vaclav Havel that the Czech Republic, for one, would continue to seek full membership in NATO as security against the threat of a revanchist Russia.
But none of the four East European leaders expressed open dissatisfaction with the more modest offer by Washington, and President Walesa, who has been one of the most forceful critics of the partial association, said today, "Sometimes small is beautiful."
More than 50 years after the great powers' meeting in Yalta in 1943, a meeting that has come to symbolize the division of Europe, President Havel said he hoped the talks in Prague would one day be seen as an emblem of Europe's coming together in alliance.
 
Inching Toward Alliance
 While President Clinton did not single out any candidates or provide a timetable on when others might join the alliance, he was more explicit than NATO has been in describing the "partnership" as a way station.
"While the partnership is not NATO membership, neither is it a permanent holding room," Mr. Clinton said after he and the four leaders emerged from their luncheon in the United States Ambassador's residence. "It changes the entire NATO dialogue, so that now the question is no longer whether NATO will take on new members, but when and how."
The leaders who met with Mr. Clinton today included Mr. Havel, Mr. Walesa and the Presidents of Hungary and Slovakia, Arpad Goncz and Michal Kovac. Only Mr. Clinton, Mr. Havel and Mr. Walesa spoke at the afternoon news conference.
But each of the four has said his country would join the partnership, and Mr. Clinton said none had pressed him directly for stronger immediate security guarantees.
 
Visit to a Cemetery
 Before their talks, Mr. Clinton paid a somber visit to memorials to Prague's nearly extinct Jewish communities, including the Pinkas Synagogue. There, the names of the 77,297 Jews from the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia who were killed in the Holocaust are again being inscribed on the wall after being erased by Czechoslovak Government when it broke relations with Israel after the 1967 War.
Wearing a gray yarmulke, the President was also guided through the Old Jewish Cemetery, where 90,000 bodies are buried under headstones erected between 1389 and 1787 and in graves that in places lie 12 deep.
Surrounded by bare-limbed trees, Mr. Clinton said little during his half-hour stay, but Richard Schifter, a National Security Council official whose parents were killed in the Holocaust, said the President had been moved by the scene.

HEADLINE: Whitman Rejects Plan to Land Sixers

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Governor-elect Christine Todd Whitman today offered early proof of her promise to be frugal with the taxpayers' money by rejecting a plan to move the faltering Philadelphia 76ers professional basketball franchise to the Camden waterfront.
The costs of building a new 530,000-square-foot arena, as calculated by the project's sponsor, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, were too imprecise and unsettled, Mrs. Whitman said. The project's backers also shifted their ground on important questions of land ownership and the share of development costs to be paid by Camden County, she said. Ultimately, Mrs. Whitman said, taxpayers could end up responsible for $100 million in underperforming construction bonds and state income guarantees to the Sixers. 
 "I have a certain standard, and whether it is a little more risk-averse than others remains to be seen," Mrs. Whitman said at the announcement of her decision at her transition offices here today. "But I have certain levels of satisfaction with the data that I require, and they just weren't met."
She said she would apply similarly stringent financial tests to another major sports franchise that is making feelers about moving to New Jersey: the New York Yankees.
"I understand that risks have to be taken, and I am perfectly prepared to take risks," she said to the prospect of luring the Yankees from the Bronx. "I'm just not going to take fliers with my eyes closed."
 
Florio Reacts With DismayXxx
 Gov. Jim Florio, who leaves office on Tuesday, helped put together the proposed Sixers deal as a boon to the South Jersey cradle of his political career, and he reacted to Mrs. Whitman's decision with dismay, calling it "a mistake." The deal requires action by the Legislature, whose Republican majority leaders would not act without the agreement of their new Governor and fellow Republican.
Harold Katz, who owns the team, faces a Feb. 1 lease expiration at the 76ers' present arena, the Spectrum in Philadelphia. He has been dickering with Philadelphia to build a new arena for years, and critics of the move to Camden have accused him of having used Camden's hunger for new development amid the ruins of a faded industrial past as a lever against Philadelphia's reluctance to build a site for his team.
"Naturally I do not agree with this decision and believe strongly that it is not in the best interests of the State of New Jersey, the City of Camden, or Camden County," Mr. Katz said in a statement released a few hours after Mrs. Whitman's announcement.
And Camden's Mayor, Arnold W. Webster, who lamented the collapse of the plan today, has said he would continue to seek a way to settle the basketball team in his city.
Mrs. Whitman did not rule out changing her mind on a Camden arena if a better plan, with less risk to taxpayer dollars, is developed. Mr. Katz made it plain that he would persist with the plan, which was first raised during the administration of Thomas H. Kean in the 1980's.
Mr. Katz argued that if the plan had the approval of both Gov. Florio and former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who started talks on a 76ers' move to this state, it should be good enough for Mrs. Whitman, and he accused her of refusing to negotiate seriously and give him a chance to respond to her concerns.
 
Estimate of Guarantee
 Mrs. Whitman has said ever since the prospect of a new Camden arena became her responsibility last month that she would not approve the state's guaranteeing construction bonds for a new arena, through the Sports and Exposition Authority, unless she were satisfied that the building would generate enough money to cover its operating costs and debt amortization.
The details of the proposed arena and its surrounding improvements have not been made public, but published reports, along with consultants hired by the ownership of the Spectrum, who oppose the deal, say that the state and Camden County would have to guarantee a total of $144 million in land acquisition, improvement and construction bonds, as well as guarantee a minimum $7 million annual income to the 76ers.
Throughout Mrs. Whitman's deliberations on the arena project, Mr. Katz and Mr. Florio have portrayed it as an investment that would pay for itself, if only in added tourism and related expenses in South Jersey.
But Robert Bodde, a professor of economics at Lake Forest University and an expert in the economics of sports franchises, said that sports teams do not usually cover the costs of their publicly financed stadiums, and that what spending they do draw is usually taken from some other area of the economy.
"There is almost no instance where stadiums pay for themselves," he said. "The rationale that cities use to build them anyway is the economic spillover that occurs -- people staying in hotels, eating in restaurants and buying gas and so on. They treat sports spending is if it were all new spending coming in, and it's not. Sports spending often substitutes for spending that people would quite probably engage in anyway, if that sports team were not in town."
 
Accountant and Rock Star
 Mrs. Whitman displayed the eclectic learning pattern that has been a hallmark of her transition to reach her decision. She turned to Arthur Anderson & Company, the accounting firm, for income projections, and to a backstage chat with her friend and supporter Jon Bon Jovi, the New Jersey rock star, for testimony that a new Camden arena would compete with the group's Philadelphia venues.
Mrs. Whitman also complained that the terms of the plan shifted several times during her review, giving the impression that the project's backers were themselves unsettled.
For example, she said she was told on Dec. 19 that of $40 million in land and improvement costs, $15 million would come from the Delaware River Port Authority and the Sports Authority. But those sources of funds recently vanished and, Mrs. Whitman said, nearly all the cost would be borne by Camden County.
In addition, outside experts consulted by Mrs. Whitman disputed the $85 million construction cost presented by the Sports Authority, saying the cost would be closer to $90 million.
"To the extent the cost of construction exceeds the projection, taxpayer dollars are at risk," she said in a prepared part of today's conference.
Dr. Bodde, the sports economist, said today that while voters often rejected referendums on bonds to build stadiums -- as New Jerseyans did over a baseball stadium proposal in 1987 -- it was unusual for an elected official to stand in the way of raiding another state for a team.
"Getting a new team is is something that elected officials generally are excited about," he said. "A lot of them have bought into the idea that you aren't major league until you have major league sports. Cities with teams are assumed to be cities on the rise instead of cities on decline."

HEADLINE: Police in Oregon Make Arrests In Assault on Olympic Skater

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 13

 BODY:
Tonya Harding's bodyguard and another man were arrested tonight by the Multnomah County Sheriff's Department in connection with the attack on the figure skater Nancy Kerrigan.
Shawn Eric Eckardt, 26, a 350-pound bodyguard with a past criminal history, and Derrick B. Smith, a 29-year-old unemployed resident of Phoenix, were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit assault, a felony. They were held on $20,000 bail each. 
 More arrests were expected, but officials said there were no immediate plans to arrest or charge Miss Harding, a longtime skating rival of Miss Kerrigan.
 
Kerrigan Granted Spot on Team
 Miss Kerrigan was clubbed on the knee after a practice session at the United States Figure Skating Championships in Detroit and was unable to compete but was granted a place on the United States team for the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, next month. In Miss Kerrigan's absence, Miss Harding won the championship and with it a spot on the team.
The United States Olympic Committee said that if Miss Harding was not implicated in the alleged conspiracy she would be given every opportunity to compete.
Earlier today, the police in Detroit said the weapon used in the attack, a telescoping metal baton, had been found in a trash can behind the arena.
No one answered the door at Miss Harding's home in Portland today. But The Oregonian newspaper quoted her former husband, Jeff Gillooly, as acknowledging that he was under investigation, but he denied involvement in the attack. Mr. Gillooly was divorced from Miss Harding last August, but they remain close after three years of a stormy marriage. Court records here show that Miss Harding and Mr. Gillooly were evicted from their residence in October for failing to pay their rent.
Conspiracy charges are often preferred by prosecutors for two reasons: They can be easier to prove, and the rules of evidence, particularly about hearsay, are different for conspiracy cases and favor the Government over the defendant.
In conspiracy cases, prosecutors must merely prove that the defendant agreed with others to participate in an illegal act. The Government need not prove anything beyond the agreement, such as that the defendant actually bought a crowbar or drove a getaway car.
 
'Darling of Prosecutors'
 Because the Government has an easier case when such charges are brought, conspiracy is commonly known among lawyers as the "darling of prosecutors."
It may also be the case that conspiracy is being used as a charge so that Portland has jurisdiction to hear the case instead of Detroit, where Miss Kerrigan was struck.
In Detroit, Deputy Police Chief Benny Napoleon said an out-of-state woman had called last Saturday and insisted on speaking with him. "She indicated to me that she heard a conversation regarding the planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan" several months ago, Mr. Napoleon said. "She put it off as somebody talking. Once the assault occurred, she became frightened. She wanted to make sure the people responsible were apprehended."
 
Information About Eckardt
 Mr. Napoleon said the woman identified about four people, and he passed the names along to the F.B.I.
"I am not going to indicate who she implicated to me," Mr. Napoleon said. He said Miss Harding was not implicated in his conversation with the woman.
The police and Federal agents here have been sorting through a story told them by Mr. Eckardt and several people close to him. He said that he runs a bodyguard business, that he recently became Miss Harding's bodyguard and that he lives with his parents.
Although the motive for the assault, according to police sources, was to assure that Miss Kerrigan was taken out of competition, Mr. Napoleon said in Detroit, "To my knowledge, there has been nothing to implicate Miss Harding in this case."
In 1991, Miss Harding won the United States figure skating championship and Miss Kerrigan finished third. This year, Miss Kerrigan was the favorite but couldn't skate after the attack last week.
 
Never Fit the Mold
 In the fairy tale world of women's figure skating, where long hours in cold arenas are fueled by dreams of lucrative endorsement contracts and a chance to become "America's sweetheart," the unfolding story here has been greeted by disbelief, even by those were told earlier this week, first hand, of what happened.
Miss Harding has never fit the mold of the typical skater; she is an asthmatic who smokes cigarettes, a hunter who killed her first deer at age 13, a woman whose mother was so poor she collected bottles to finance her daughter's skating costumes. She drove a pickup truck and boasted that she knew how to overhaul a transmission.
The story unraveled on Monday when one of the people close to Miss Harding starting to tell others about what he knew; they, in turn, went to the F.B.I. -- giving police their most concrete leads.
One of those who first went to the F.B.I. was Gary Crowe, a Portland private investigator who taught a paralegal class at Pioneer Pacific College in nearby Wilsonville. Mr. Eckardt, a longtime resident of Portland, was one of the students, as was Eugene Saunders, a 24-year-old Portland minister. Mr. Crowe said Mr. Saunders had heard a tape recording that detailed a plan to attack Miss Kerrigan.
 
No Comment About Tape
 After Mr. Saunders contacted Mr. Crowe, they went to the F.B.I. Federal agents would not discuss what they had talked about with the Portland men, nor would they comment on whether a tape exists.
Mr. Crowe described Mr. Saunders as "a devout Christian, a born-again, an absolute straight-arrow, someone who will go to his grave without telling a lie." He said Mr. Eckardt went to Mr. Saunders because he was afraid and wanted someone else to know that there was a tape.
It is unclear how long Mr. Eckardt has been a bodyguard. He said he ran a service called Worldwide Bodyguard Services in Portland. But he never told classmates that he had a client until late last year, when he bragged of working for Miss Harding.
Coaches say they never saw Mr. Eckardt at the rink near Portland where Miss Harding trained. Mr. Eckardt starting working with Miss Harding after a death threat was made against her recently in Portland. The police never found the source of the threat.
Even as she was making her mark in the records books of American figure skating, Miss Harding was encountering problems with the police and in court. Her marriage was full of violence and near-breakups, according to law enforcement records, and she herself was investigated by the police for assault.
 
Two Divorce Petitions
 Twice, she had filed for divorce, first in 1991 -- 15 months after she married Mr. Gillooly at the age of 19. "He wrenched my arm and wrist and pulled my hair and shoved me," she wrote in a 1991 petition seeking the restraining order. "I recently found out that he bought a shotgun and I am scared for my safety."
Shortly afterward, they made up. But early in 1992, the police were called to fight near the town of Clackamas, near Portland, where they reported finding Miss Harding with a baseball bat in her hand, threatening another woman. The police reports say Miss Harding pulled her pickup truck behind another motorist, who was stopped at a red light, and then became angered. She honked her horn, got out and then punched the woman, knocking her glasses off, the police said. Miss Harding later apologized and no charges were brought.
Last October, the police seized a handgun from Miss Harding after a report that a shot had been fired near the apartment she shared with her former husband. Again, no charges were filed, and Miss Harding said the gun had gone off accidentally.
But a few weeks later, she and Gillooly were forcefully evicted from their apartment. According to Clackamas County court doucments, the couple had failed to pay their rent. They did not contest the order and were evicted, records show.
This last episode came less than six weeks from the United States Figure Skating Championships, at time when Miss Harding and Gillooly had told friends they were financially desperate.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN EUROPE;
CLINTON, IN RUSSIA, IS FIRM IN SUPPORT OF YELTSIN'S AIMS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton came to this wintry capital today and embraced President Boris N. Yeltsin almost without qualification, despite the surprisingly strong nationalist, anti-Yeltsin revolt evident in the parliamentary elections on Dec. 12.
On his first visit to Russia as President, Mr. Clinton and his top aides conceded that many people here had suffered acute economic privation in the transition from Communism to a free market. They spoke of the need for a redesigned net of social services to ease the pain. But they nonetheless pressed for a sustained or, in some areas, increased pace of reform. 
 In backing the ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and other foes of the Government, one of the main American participants in today's talks said, Russian voters had not been protesting the pace of reform, as widely suggested. Rather, he said, "what we had was a vote against difficult economic conditions," and the way to ease them is more reform, not less.
 
All Parties Represented
 Tonight, at a reception at Spaso House, the residence of the United States Ambassador, Mr. Clinton hedged his bets a bit, greeting members of all the parliamentary parties, including Gennadi Zuganov, a Communist member of the lower house, and Maxim Travkin, a 25-year-old banker who is a more suave, less vociferous colleague of Mr. Zhirinovsky.
According to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Mr. Zhirinovsky himself was not asked "because his actions and his language and his statements do not make him fit to be in a meeting or invited by the President of the United States."
Mr. Clinton told the legislators and a wide variety of officials, scholars, artists and business people, "Each of you who have participated in this new democratic process have my respect, my admiration and my pledge of equal partnership."
 
Shifting the Aim
 On Friday, Administration officials said, Russia and the United States will officially announce that they have agreed to stop aiming their missiles at cities and military targets in each other's countries and in allied countries. Instead, the officials said, some will be aimed at uninhabited ocean areas.
While the agreement is largely symbolic, because the missiles could be reaimed in a few minutes, Thomas R. Pickering, the United States Ambassador, said, "it also has real value in confidence-building."
Also on Friday, the Russian and American leaders are to be joined by President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine for the signing of an agreement leading to the destruction of Ukraine's entire nuclear arsenal.
Today, Mr. Clinton met three times with Mr. Yeltsin -- at two sessions in the Kremlin this morning, with the emphasis firmly on economic policies, and tonight over dinner at a snow-dusted Government dacha outside town, where security issues were discussed. He left not the slightest doubt that the silver-haired reformer remained the Administration's main man in Russia.
"I believe that we have a clear opportunity to work together to build a new framework of security for Europe," Mr. Clinton told reporters, "based on free political systems, free economic systems and nations that respect one another. And President Yeltsin has been doing that here and deserves the support of the United States."
From the Kremlin, the President embarked on a tour of Moscow shops, dropping in on a baker, then a combined butcher and fishmonger near Red Square. He fumbled in his pocket for rubles to buy a loaf of dark bread, told inquiring Muscovites that Hillary Rodham Clinton would arrive Friday and offered assurances that things would soon get better for ordinary Russians.
"All these folks working hard need to know that in the end they will be rewarded," he said.
 
Prayers at Cathedral
 Then, wearing a gray fur hat to ward off the 17-degree cold, he went on to Kazan Cathedral, destroyed in the Stalin era and recently rebuilt. Its bells chimed as he arrived, and he prayed for his mother, Virginia Kelley, whose funeral Mr. Clinton attended in Arkansas just before leaving for Europe.
Finally, he visited the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Aleksy II, the Partiarch of Moscow and All Russia, who is ill with bronchitis, at the Central Clinical Hospital in a parklike district of downtown Moscow.
The dacha where the dinner was held, called Novoye Ogaryovo, a half-hour southeast of Moscow, was the site of the meeting where Mikhail S. Gorbachev made a last, futile effort to hold the Soviet Union together.
An American who was there tonight said the two leaders had shared in "a candid, freewheeling exchange" in which Mr. Clinton spoke sympathetically of the "difficulties and complexities" that face reformers in the Parliament. A string quartet played as the guests arrived, but as the hour grew late Mr. Clinton, described on a Moscow radio station this morning as "the saxophone President," took up his instrument and jammed with the quartet's pianist.
 
Caviar and Lip of Moose
 On the menu were caviar, pickled mushrooms, lip of moose and suckling pig. Mr. Clinton, inevitably, started talking about razorback hogs.
United States officials described the meetings today as excellent, and one expert on Russia said that for the first time, the two sides were "no longer merely passing points across the table." He said "the quality of the discussion was fundamentally different for me as a participant" because relationships had become institutionalized in the last year.
Mr. Yeltsin assured the Americans that he would continue to back reform despite the backlash manifest in the election, but he made no commitment to the reform strategy urged upon him by the United States and international banks -- the need to end subsidies to inefficient industries, curb rampant inflation and create a more sustainable social safety net.
Nor did he offer any assurances, the officials said, that the two Deputy Prime Ministers most thoroughly committed to rapid reform, Yegor T. Gaidar and Boris G. Fyodorov, would remain in office when Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin forms his new government, which is due any day now. Mr. Chernomyrdin is considered an advocate of a slower, socially oriented approach to reform.
But the American delegation took the reappointment of Anatoly B. Chubais, head of the State Privatization Committee, today as a hopeful sign.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen praised Mr. Yeltsin for what he has accomplished so far, but he pointedly noted that Mr. Clinton had insisted -- and Mr. Yeltsin had agreed -- "that more attention has to be paid to easing some of the hardships that we've heard about." But he said no one had raised with the Russian leader the problem of endemic corruption in the Government, which is said to have contributed to popular disillusionment.
The Americans emphasized that more reform would mean the release of more aid from international banks and the Group of Seven major industrial countries. To show how much had already been done, Mr. Clinton handed his host a map showing where American dollars had gone -- mostly outside Moscow and St. Petersburg -- and what they had been used for.
With inflation at 12 percent a month and the ruble at an all-time low, Russia has yet to prepare its 1994 spending plan. More than $14 billion in long-term, low-interest loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are being withheld until the plan is approved.
 
'Equal Partners'
 For his part, Mr. Yeltsin seemed to be sending a none-too-subtle message to his visitors, to the effect that the thunder on his right made it important for him to stand up for his country and its place in the world.
His spokesman, Vyacheslav Kostikov, emphasized to American reporters that Mr. Yeltsin's main point was "that the U.S. and Russia are equal partners, as opposed to Russia being in a position where it has to plead for American help." Since the elections, the spokesman said, Russia has joined the ranks of the world's major constitutional democracies, and the United States now realizes it cannot solve Europe's problems without Russia.
If that seemed like a belated response to the opposition's major themes in the campaign, Mr. Clinton clearly picked it up. Tonight at the Ambassador's house, he spoke lyrically of how, "over the centuries, the Russian people have shown their greatness in many ways -- in culture, on the battlefield, in government, in space" -- and now stood poised to make their country "strong and vital and alive for hundreds of years into the future."
To further underline his respect for his host and for Russian tradition, Mr. Clinton agreed today to spend Friday night, which will be his last here, in an apartment in the Kremlin. That will make him the first American President to do so since Richard M. Nixon in 1972.

HEADLINE: Welfare Plan Places Limit on Cash Grants

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts today proposed an overhaul of the state's welfare system that would force a majority of able-bodied welfare recipients into full-time community service after 60 days.
Joining a growing number of other governors who are also pushing new welfare rules, Mr. Weld said in his State of the State address tonight that his plan would put 50,000 welfare recipients -- about half the state's total -- to work. The state would continue to provide health insurance and food stamps, as well as day care. 
 "I don't believe we can continue a welfare program that rewards illegitimacy and long-term dependency," Mr. Weld said in his State of the State address. "Those monthly cash grants succeed most in keeping people out of the work force, and poor. Most children who grow up in this system merely repeat its dismal failures. It is time to rewrite government's exhausted prescription for poverty and dependency."
 
Some Exempt From Plan
 The chief architect for the Governor's plan, Charles Baker, who is the State Secretary of Health and Human Services, said there were plenty of jobs available for able-bodied people. Those who cannot find jobs after 60 days would have to do community service or forfeit their cash benefits.
The benefits received by those doing community service jobs, like working in a neighborhood school or hospital, would amount to less than the minimum wage. The maximum grant for a mother with two children is $539 a month.
A welfare recipient who refuses to work would not receive day care or child care or a cash grant, but would remain eligible for food stamps and Medicaid.
The Governor's plan would exempt teen-age mothers -- who will be required to graduate from high school, and live at home -- women in the third trimester of pregnancy or who have recently given birth, legal guardians, disabled people and those caring for disabled children.
For a Republican Governor with national aspirations, the announcement is a way to leap to the forefront of an issue that many other politicians have only flirted with. A cornerstone of Bill Clinton's campaign for President was his pledge to end welfare "as we know it," but the Clinton Administration is apparently putting welfare on a back burner as it wrestles with health care.
With a record 5 million families in America on welfare -- slightly more than 14 million people -- many elected officials have been talking about getting tough on welfare recipients. In his recent State of the State address, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York advocated increasing a program to detect welfare fraud by fingerprinting state recipients.
Oregon has a proposal awaiting Federal approval that would take all the money now spent on welfare, food stamps and a few other small social service programs and roll it into a work program. Instead of welfare, applicants would get a subsidized job.
 
Approval for Wisconsin
 Colorado won Federal approval on Wednesday to remove welfare recipients from the rolls after two years if they refuse to take a job or training. Wisconsin won approval in November for its plan to cut off people's welfare checks after two years if they do not work or look for jobs.
Last year Governor Weld proposed a less ambitious plan to overhaul welfare, but the legislation did not pass the Legislature. Therese Murray, a Democratic State Senator who is the chairman of the Human Services and Elderly Committee, said that her committee was considering its own welfare overhaul proposal this year.
If Governor Weld's plan wins Federal and state approval, then all new welfare recipients would be required to find jobs within 60 days. Those who are already on the roles would have more time -- closer to a year -- to find employment. The state welfare department estimated that close to 30,000 welfare recipients would find jobs by the end of the first year.
There is considerable debate about how many jobs, and what kind of jobs, are out there. Mr. Baker said that one way the state would help people find jobs was by giving them access to the Department of Employment and Training's job listings.
Wallace Graham, the public information director for that department, said there were 13,000 listings, which are primarily aimed at unemployed people seeking to re-enter the work force. "Those jobs are not aimed at welfare people," Mr. Graham said. "We still place people from welfare, but that's not the point of this agency." A quarter of the 13,000 listings are for part-time jobs, Mr. Graham said.
Unemployment in the state is at 6.3 percent. There were 200,000 unemployed people in the state last month, according to the latest figures.
 
'Where Are the Jobs?'
 Deborah Harris, a lawyer for the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, a legal services group, said in response to the Governor's plan: "Where are the jobs? Everyone knows that the jobs are simply not available."
But Mr. Baker said that only a small number of welfare recipients would end up without jobs -- and in community service.
Mark Greenberg, a senior staff lawyer for the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington, said that in the past community service programs had been ineffective. "They're administratively difficult," he said. "They cost money, and there doesn't seem to be evidence that they raise employment rates or reduce welfare costs."
But Douglas Besharov, a resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, praised Mr. Weld's plan. "This is a serious attempt to replace welfare with work," he said. "The object of welfare policy should be to move people off welfare. You might view this as a more realistic version of the Clinton plan. It's the wave of the future."
Still, Mr. Besharov raised questions about how many jobs were available. "The question is are there enough jobs for all the people on welfare," he said. "That's the $64 question."

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Fall

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits declined by 1,000 last week to the lowest level since Christmas, the Government said yesterday. The Labor Department said the number of newly laid-off workers filing for jobless benefits dropped to 354,000 for the week ended Jan. 8, compared with 355,000 in the previous week. The change was much less dramatic than the past two weeks, when claims had soared 62,000 after having fallen by 37,000 in the previous week. Economists had expected a much bigger drop, but layoffs in the textile and apparel industries helped to make the decline more moderate. The job market has been unpredictable in recent weeks.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose 2.7% in 1993

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
The smallest annual rise in the cost of medical care since 1973 helped hold the overall inflation rate to 2.7 percent last year, the smallest increase in seven years, Government figures showed today.
The Consumer Price Index has now risen less than 3 percent for two consecutive years, the first time this has happened since the 1960's. 
 With a rise of just two-tenths of 1 percent in December, consumer inflation remains mild despite a rapid acceleration in the economy that began in late summer. Today's data encouraged most private economists to agree with the Clinton Administration in predicting there would be little pressure to increase the low interest rates that have helped fuel economic expansion.
 
Easing Some Fears
 Although there were some warning signs flashing in the Government's year-end report today, it put an end for now to fears that arose last summer in Washington and on Wall Street that the economic recovery would cause inflation to spurt and the Federal Reserve to stunt the growth by raising short-term interest rates. For now, Wall Street, where record highs have been set in the stock market recently, is euphoric as the economy generally seems to be growing nicely with inflation in check and interest rates at historic lows.
Confirming the rebound in the economy, shoppers spent at a surprisingly brisk pace last month, according to a separate report today, with the main beneficiaries being sellers of autos and other big-ticket items rather than the more traditional holiday presents of clothing and toys.
Retail sales climbed eight-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department said, putting sales for the month 6.9 percent ahead of the December 1992 level and further raising expectations for overall fourth-quarter growth.
The bond market took the news on inflation in stride but began a selloff after the retail sales figures were much stronger than had been expected. The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond fell 13/32 , while its yield -- which moves in the opposite direction -- rose to 6.26 percent, up from 6.18 percent on Wednesday. [Page D12.]
Widespread holiday discounting helped limit the overall monthly price index to a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent, the same as its gain in November. And while medical costs for the full year rose 5.4 percent, or twice the inflation rate as a whole, the yearlong trend was clearly downward.
During the second half of 1993, medical inflation fell to a 4.4 percent rate from 6.3 percent in the first six months as the cost of services like doctors' fees dropped sharply while the price of commodities rose moderately. The rise in the cost of health care, as with oil prices in the 1970's, is now shown to have limits, even without legislation.
"The consumer is just saying no to higher prices," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Chemical Bank, referring to high prices of all kinds.
This was especially evident in clothing prices, which fell seven-tenths of 1 percent last month, with men's and boys' apparel among the weakest.
 
Costly Goods Sell Well
 The retail sales results were once again dominated by durable goods, which are costly items like cars and appliances intended to last at least three years. Their sales jumped 1.7 percent, to $77.14 billion, with all three major categories posting sizable gains.
Auto dealers raised sales 1.2 percent even after a sharp upward revision for November that transformed what had been initially tallied as a small decline into a 1.8 percent gain.
Merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes increased receipts 2.7 percent last month while those selling furniture and other equipment for the home took in 1.8 percent more.
This strength, driven largely by low interest rates, could push the economy's fourth-quarter expansion even higher than the 4.5 to 5 percent pace that most analysts expect to see when the data come out on Jan. 28.
On the other hand, cautioned Laurence H. Meyer, an economic consultant in St. Louis, the durable-goods sectors will "likely play a diminished role" in 1994, suggesting that an expected slowing in business activity could be substantial.
Sales of nondurables last month posted a slight gain of three-tenths of 1 percent, to $141.12 billion, the Commerce Department report showed.
There were increases of 1.1 percent at restaurants and bars, five-tenths of 1 percent at food stores and three-tenths at drug and proprietary stores. But sales fell nine-tenths of 1 percent at stores selling apparel and accessories and three-tenths at department stores and others selling general merchandise.
Gasoline service stations showed no change in sales last month, holding their own despite what the inflation report showed as a 2.2 percent decline in the price of fuel.
Total sales for 1993 were $2.08 trillion, up 6.2 percent from 1992. Roughly half the rise reflected higher volumes, the other half higher prices.
The Labor Department's report on December inflation, which had few surprises, showed accelerating rises for food and shelter that were partly offset by lower prices for clothing and energy. The report did, however, have some disquieting notes.
For example, dividing the index into two broad categories shows that services climbed four-tenths of 1 percent last month, the highest since August. Services account for nearly 56 percent of the Consumer Price Index and are generally considered a greater threat to price stability than are commodity prices, which edged down one-tenth of 1 percent.
The so-called core inflation rate -- excluding the often-gyrating food and energy components -- posted its third straight rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in December, a result considered neither particularly good nor ground for immediate concern.
 
Moderating Influences
 For the full year, however, core inflation was 3.2 percent, the lowest since Government price controls in 1972. This reflected, among other things, a record 5.9 percent drop in tobacco prices and moderation in medical care inflation, which has been nearly cut in half since 1990, according to C. J. Lawrence, a New York investment house.
Most of December's rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in food prices resulted from a 5.2 percent surge for fresh fruits and vegetables. But prices also rose for poultry, cereal and bakery products and dairy products, the report showed.
Higher rents and costs of home ownership helped push the heavily weighted housing component up three-tenths of 1 percent last month, the highest since August.
Transportation costs, on the other hand, eased two-tenths of 1 percent as lower gasoline prices and a 1 percent drop in automobile finance charges countered another sharp jump in air fares, up 2.9 percent for the month and 17 percent for all of 1993.

Recovery Bandwagon Passes Figgie

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Harry E. Figgie Jr. and Gerald Swanson made the best-seller lists last year with "Bankruptcy 1995: The Coming Collapse of America and How to Stop It," an apocalyptic view of the nation's economic future that focused on rising Government debts. But Mr. Figgie's credibility on Wall Street has collapsed even faster.
Losses at Figgie International Inc., the $1 billion conglomerate of which the 70-year-old Mr. Figgie is chairman and chief executive, have piled up while companies around him have ridden the wave of economic recovery. 
 "The environment is not that bad," said Sidney Heller, who follows conglomerates for Lehman Brothers. "They have a lot of businesses that could be good but nothing that's performing particularly well. At this point, I have no confidence in any of their projections."
Figgie, based outside Cleveland in Willoughby, Ohio, owns Rawlings sporting equipment, Fred Perry sportswear, a wide range of fire equipment and security companies, packaging and materials handling companies, insurance and leasing operations and an oil and gas company.
 
 
Attracting Bottom Fishers
 Through the 1980's, it was one of the nation's better-performing conglomerates and the stock rose smartly despite Wall Street's dismay at strong anti-takeover measures it adopted to preserve the Figgie family's control. But these days, Figgie is strictly an investment for bottom fishers.
Analysts and portfolio managers say the company fell from favor quickly after earnings peaked in 1989 at $3.04 a share. Since then, investors have been punished every time they crept back into the stock expecting a turnaround.
Figgie surprised investors in November when it reported a third-quarter loss, which was accompanied by a cut in the dividend to 6 cents a share, from 12.5 cents. But it stunned them last week when it warned there would be another loss when fourth-quarter results are released next month, leading to a full-year loss for the first time in its 30-year history.
Figgie's B shares, which carry most of the voting power and are 18 percent owned by the family, peaked at $35.50 in 1990. They finished yesterday at $15 in Nasdaq trading. The A shares, which are more liquid and typically trade at a 10 to 25 percent discount, finished yesterday at $13.
Figgie has plenty of explanations for its troubles. Flooding at three factories in Kansas, for example, had a lot to do with last year's $14.4 million third-quarter loss. Commercial real estate, an important market for several Figgie companies, has not yet joined the economic recovery. And the company has been investing at a staggering rate in consolidating and modernizing manufacturing in an effort to make itself a world leader in making products, like industrial fire-protection systems, that are produced intermittently in relatively small numbers.
Figgie cites as benchmarks of its restructuring success a cut in the 3,400 machine tools it used to 250 flexible systems, the shuttering of more than 50 factories and a reduction in employment from 13,000 to 9,300. For all that, the few analysts who follow the company regularly believe that the economic recovery should have shown up in profits and now wonder whether Figgie is bungling its modernization drive.
Figgie's reputation will not be helped by a lawsuit filed on behalf of shareholders last fall in an Ohio court. It says that Figgie manipulated its balance sheet to look healthier than it was by overstating the value of property it is developing near Richmond, overvaluing inventories and failing to recognize bad loans in its insurance operations.
The suit also says that equipment deals between Figgie companies and the Clark-Reliance Corporation, a separate company owned by the Figgie family that Mr. Figgie has described as "the proving ground" for modernization efforts, were structured to strengthen Clark-Reliance at Figgie's expense. Finally, the suit says that the Figgies have used corporate aircraft and other assets for personal purposes.
Figgie will not comment on the accusations, which it is fighting, and Wall Street clearly does not believe the suit's contention that the company is "in imminent danger of irreversible business decline." But the suit does reinforce Wall Street's qualms about the depth of the company's management and the wisdom of giving senior management positions to Harry Figgie 3d and Matthew Figgie, two of the founder's sons. Harry Figgie 3d is the vice chairman and chief architect of the modernization drive. Matthew, 27, was named head of mergers and acquisitions, currency trading and investments in November.
"There's a real restructuring story here," said T. Edward O'Neil, whose recent report on Figgie for the S. W. Ryan Company, a stockbroker in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., recommended that speculative investors buy Figgie. "But it would help if they brought in a strong outside manager."
Mr. O'Neil said Figgie was the only conglomerate he followed that was trading below the book value of its tangible assets, which he put at $16 a share. Most other conglomerates, a group that historically trails the rest of the stock market when prices are rising, have already risen substantially from last year's low, making Figgie cheap by comparison.
Some portfolio managers who specialize in undervalued companies say Figgie should begin a strong profit rebound by the second half of this year. They note that Figgie says that most of its investment in modernization is behind it and that the company has retained investment bankers to help it sell noncore assets. Wall Street's preferred targets include consumer products, particularly sportswear, financial services and natural resources.
"This company is under-followed, it's unwanted and the outlook is uncertain," said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors Inc., a New York money management firm that has been a long-term investor. "That creates an investment opportunity, but it's a matter of timing. You don't have to work hard at all to see the stock in the 20's once it's perceived as a turnaround."
Asset sales would be used to reduce the relatively high debt load, a goal Mr. Figgie has set and then let slide in the past while pursuing longer-term opportunities. Mr. Katz said significant asset sales would be a clear sign that Mr. Figgie has become more concerned about the views of outside investors.
"Harry Figgie always had an attitude that this was his company and he would run it for the long haul," Mr. Katz said. "His ego has been working against us for the past few years. Now it's going to be working for us."

HEADLINE: The Battle for Macy;
Against Long Odds, Retailer Fights To Remain Independent and Intact

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Myron E. Ullman 3d, the chairman and chief executive of R. H. Macy & Company, has vowed to keep the department store company independent in the face of an attempted takeover by its longtime nemesis, Federated Department Stores, but most analysts and retail watchers say that could be difficult.
He might find a white knight with a packet of cash, or scotch Federated's overtures by finding another suitor. Or he could pay off Federated entirely; a creditor paid off in a plan of reorganization has no further say in the bankruptcy process. 
 But the forces arrayed against him are impressive. Federated has at least two cards in its favor. Any retailer with an interest in Macy can make a strong economic case for combining operations and reducing redundancies.
And before last September, Diane Baker, Macy's chief financial officer, alienated many creditors by not returning telephone calls and berating them for questions she considered illogical or ignorant.
Although James P. Kenny, senior vice president for corporate planning, stepped in as Macy's liaison with the creditors in September, relations with the banks, mutual funds, investment groups and bondholders who are its creditors are not as solid as they might be.
"Macy stands a chance of remaining independent and has a fair number of weapons available to it, but Federated has perhaps more will and more wherewithal," said Jack Hersch, an analyst at M. J. Whitman L. P., which specializes in trading distressed securities.
Mr. Ullman's biggest trump card is Judge Burton R. Lifland, who is minding the Macy bankruptcy in court. Bankruptcy experts and analysts said Judge Lifland, who has a history of allowing debtors like Macy to dictate the course of their bankruptcy, would almost certainly extend the company's exclusive right to submit a plan of reorganization, which expires on March 15. He has extended it three times previously, by three or six months.
Harvey R. Miller, the wily lawyer for Weil, Gotshal & Manges who is representing Macy, is likely to argue that the company cannot possibly cobble together a reorganization without its No. 2 executive, Roger N. Farah, who, because of Federated, his former employer, cannot start his new job until July 1.
Judge Lifland has gone along with Mr. Miller and his clients in several other cases, including the bankruptcy of Eastern Airlines, which dragged on so long that the company ultimately was forced to liquidate. The judge might well have Eastern and other drawn-out cases on his mind as Macy enters its third year of bankruptcy. Mr. Ullman can also call on considerable financial resources. His roommate at the University of Cincinnati, Peter Woo, is the chairman of Wheelock International, a Hong Kong conglomerate with investments in hotels, retail and real estate with an interest in United States retailing.
Macy's board is also packed with potential investors like Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman and chief executive of CBS and the Loews Corporation. But Macy will have trouble convincing its creditors that a financial investor would be better than a strategic one. A retailer combining operations with Macy could offer them the same value plus a premium from any savings.
 
Suitor Rebuffed
 To be sure, Mr. Ullman could seek a partnership with another retailer. But Mr. Ullman has repeatedly rebuffed advances from one interested party, Dillard Department Stores, as recently as a week ago.
Analysts said a merger might save the new Federated-Macy from $100 million to $200 million, although Peter N. Schaeffer, an analyst who used to work for Bloomingdale's, said: "Both companies are really bare-boned already. I think it will end up being a wash."
Federated, however, has gained the upper hand in previous deals with Macy. In 1988, when Mr. Ullman joined Macy, the company was lagging behind competitors in computerization, and hired the Sabre Group, a division of Federated, to catch up. Macy pays Sabre the cost of the services plus 20 percent, giving Sabre little incentive to contain costs.
Federated may have also gotten the better of Macy in its public dispute over Mr. Farah, the head of its merchandising office, who was hired by Macy last summer. To settle the dispute, Macy agreed to pay Mr. Farah's salary and benefits, potentially as much as $835,185, through the duration of his contract with Federated, which expires on June 30. But Mr. Farah was prohibited from working for Macy until July 1.
In hindsight, Federated deprived Macy of a chief merchant until next summer, forcing it to request more time in bankruptcy so Mr. Farah could shore up its merchandising.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Strong Retail Sales Hurt Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Conflicting signals in recent economic data and a forecast of strong economic growth from a Federal Reserve governor prompted a selloff in the bond market yesterday.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond fell 13/32 , while its yield -- which moves in the opposite direction -- jumped to 6.26 percent, from 6.18 percent on Wednesday. Bond prices had soared nearly 3 points in the previous five trading days amid optimism that economic growth was moderate and not likely to fuel inflation. 
 Yesterday's losses reversed gains on Wednesday that came after the release of producer price data that showed inflation under control in December. The Labor Department affirmed the low inflation outlook yesterday, reporting that consumer prices rose a lower-than-expected two-tenths of a percent in December. At the same time, however, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose a strong eight-tenths of a percent in December. Economists had expected a rise of just three-tenths of a percent.
 
Retail Sales the Key
 Thomas J. Runkel, a portfolio manager at the Franklin/Templeton Group of Funds in San Mateo, Calif., said the Consumer Price Index was about what was expected, but it was the higher-than-expected retail sales report that started the market's downward movement.
"People were taken by surprise by the strong retail numbers," he said. Matthew Alexy, government trading strategist for CS First Boston, said that even though December's retail numbers were higher, there was a large downward revision in November's figures, excluding autos, "which neutralized some of the impact of today's numbers."
A Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare, told a business gathering in Boston that he expected growth in the fourth quarter of last year to be around 5 percent and growth in the first quarter this year to be 3 to 4 percent. Mr. LaWare said he expected the gross domestic product to rise 3 to 3.5 percent in 1994.
Mr. Runkel described the Fed official's comments on interest rates as confusing, saying they could be taken two ways: "One, that the central bank is taking a neutral position, or two, that it is taking a negative bias."
 
Lower Estimate in Market
 Mr. LaWare's projection of 3 to 4 percent growth in the first quarter contributed to the selloff, because the market had been expecting growth of 2.5 to 3 percent.
"The combination of his unclear statement and first-quarter growth was an overall negative for the bond market," Mr. Runkel said. "It's a nervous market that has gone from fear of tightening to no tightening at all."
Some traders viewed the selloff of bonds as healthy, since they believe the market had gotten ahead of itself over the last few days. '
An analyst at MMS International said the firm's Fed policy outlook remained unchanged after yesterday's data, with the Fed keeping a steady policy for now. But the firm expects a slight upward nudge on interest rates late in the first quarter or early second quarter.
In municipal bond market matters, the New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, in testimony to the New York State Assembly Ways and Means Committee, announced that he would develop a plan to use the competitive bidding process in the sale of New York City bonds and increase the opportunity for underwriting firms owned by minorities or women.
He said the city should use competitive bond sales when they were cost effective, depending on market conditions, with the aim of having a broadly agreed-upon standard to encourage competitive bidding.

HEADLINE: Retreat of Blue Chips Continues on Profit Taking

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell on another bout of profit taking yesterday after their recent run to record levels, but Nasdaq stocks, which had been lagging, edged into record ground.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 6.20 points to close at 3,842.43, marking its third consecutive losing session since hitting a record high of 3,865.51 on Monday. 
 In the broader market, declining issues led advances, 1,142 to 936, on moderate volume of 278 million shares.
The Nasdaq composite, helped by a late rally, rose 0.94 point, to 787.81, enough to surpass its record close of 787.42 on Oct. 15. The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 1.70, to 472.47. The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.19 point, to 480.06.
A jump in credit market interest rates dampened the buying enthusiasm for stocks, analysts said. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 6.26 percent, from 6.18 percent on Wednesday.
The rise was linked to news that retail sales in December had posted a ninth consecutive month of gains, making 1993 the best sales year in four years and providing new evidence that the economy was gaining.
But analysts said they were encouraged by the stock market's relative strength in the face of higher interest rates. They also noted a restrained rise in the Consumer Price Index, up just two-tenths of 1 percent last month, as a bullish sign for stocks and an indication that rates would stay low.
There were no clear trends in the market yesterday, analysts said. Automotive, bank and brokerage firm stocks found buyers, while drug and technology shares were mostly lower.
"It's a day where people are low on conviction so they're trying to look for things that are cheap," said Ron Hill, an investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 Peter Canelo, the chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities, said he was fielding calls from investors who were worried that the recent decline might be a sign that the stock market was headed for a sharp correction.
But he took the investors' concern as a bullish indicator. "Nobody's worried about the upside; everybody's worried about the correction," Mr. Canelo said. "That's usually a sign you're in the middle of a good move and it's going to go a lot further."
The Dow index, he said, could approach 4,000 before the rally ends.
Among the big movers, Quaker Oats tumbled 3 3/8, to 66, after saying its earnings for the fiscal second quarter would fall 15 percent to 20 percent below those in the comparable period a year ago, noting the weak European economy.
The GTE Corporation said it would cut 17,000 jobs in its telephone operations over the next three years and take a $1.8 billion pretax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. Its stock slipped 1/4, to 34 5/8.
Procter & Gamble lost 1 1/2, to 57, on news that it will close four plants and shut down production lines at six other sites in the United States and Canada as part of a previously announced restructuring.
Bear Stearns gained 3/4, to 23 7/8, after reporting record quarterly earnings.
The stocks of other brokerage firms also rose, with Morgan Stanley up 1 3/4, to 74 3/4, and Paine Webber up 1/4, to 27 1/4.
J. P. Morgan added 3/4, to 70 3/8, after reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings, including record trading revenues of $606 million. Citicorp rose 2 1/8, to 40 3/4, on an upbeat earnings forecast.

A 2-Year Peak for the Dollar Against the German Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar reached its highest level against the German mark in more than two years yesterday after United States Government data showed an unexpectedly strong rise in retail sales last month.
The dollar was also higher against other leading currencies except the Japanese yen. 
 Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery jumped $3.70 to close at $390.60 an ounce.
The dollar, which has been trading in a narrow range against the mark, jumped up to close in New York at 1.7505 marks, compared with 1.7335 on Wednesday. The dollar was trading at its highest level against the mark since September 1991, traders said.
Some traders said the market decided to test whether it could push the mark above 1.7500 without stirring a reaction from the Bundesbank. The German central bank has been quietly buying marks in recent weeks, bolstering the currency against the dollar, traders said.
The dollar's move came as the Commerce Department in Washington reported a higher-than-expected rise in retail sales last month, of eight-tenths of a percent. The figure provided still more evidence of an economic recovery, which has caused the dollar's recent rise.
But the dollar fell against the Japanese yen as Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown joined a chorus of Clinton Administration criticism of Japan for not doing more to reduce its trade surplus. Mr. Brown told reporters that progress in talks with Japan had been "disappointing."
"Comments like that are giving people at least concern over the dollar-yen going higher," said Jack Griffin, a vice president at the New York branch of Fuji Bank Ltd.
In New York, the dollar slipped to 111.77 yen, from 112.25 yen on Wednesday.
Mr. Griffin said investors sold marks and bought yen, believing the Japanese currency would remain strong because of trade tensions. The mark-yen trading magnified the dollar's move against the currencies, traders said.
Investors believe that American officials favor a strong yen so that the trade gap will not widen. A strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive in the United States, and American imports to Japan cheaper.
The British pound ended at $1.4977 in New York, down from $1.5035 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Data Highway Accelerating In Connecticut

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Southern New England Telephone, the local phone company in Connecticut, announced plans today for upgrading its service that could make the state the first to be fully tied into the nation's developing fiber-optic telecommunications network.
Nearly 40 percent of the state will be connected within three years, and every home and business will follow by the year 2009, executives of the independent telephone company said. They predicted that the project will give Connecticut a strong advantage in competing with other regions for businesses and jobs in an age of computer and video communication. 
 Connecticut's commissioner of economic development, Joseph McGee, expressed delight with the project. "This is one of the most significant business announcements made here in the last 10 years," he said.
 
Plans by the Regional Bells
 Regional Bell companies across the country have announced ambitious plans to upgrade their networks. More than a year ago, New Jersey Bell became the first telephone company to commit itself to link every customer within one state to a fiber-optic system, by the year 2010.
In New York, Nynex has not announced a schedule, pending changes it is seeking in the state's regulatory system that would free it to compete with rivals like MCI on a more equal basis. But spending $1.25 billion a year to modernize lines, Nynex has already installed 530,000 miles of fiber optic wire in New York and replaced nearly all of the crucial trunk lines that form the foundation of the emerging telecommunications systems.
Southern New England Telephone, known across Connecticut as SNET, is small by comparison, with just 2,500 miles of fiber optic wires installed. It will need no more than 50,000 miles to serve its 1.3 million customers.
The SNET system will use fiber optic wire to connect every switching station in the state with nodes serving up to 500 customers. Coaxial cables, like those used by cable television, will then connect the nodes to each home or business, providing "dial tones" not only for audio communication, but also for video and data transmission. Though coaxial cable cannot match the carrying capacity of fiber optics, it will more than suffice for the range of services a single home or business is likely to require, telecommunications experts say.
The eventual cost of the new network is estimated at $4.5 billion, or $300 million a year, though that figure incorporates the more than $200 million a year the company already spends on modernization.
According to SNET's chief executive, Daniel J. Miglio, within three years, 500,000 homes and businesses in the Hartford and New Haven areas and in Fairfield County will have full access to the interactive capabilities of what enthusiasts call the information superhighway.
SNET intends to accomplish this without raising telephone rates, he said. Instead it will increase productivity, cut costs and introduce profitable new services.
 
SNET Keeps Pace
 Mr. Miglio said that SNET is keeping pace with New Jersey Bell and other national leaders, not only in moving toward providing the new network to all customers, but also in rapidly putting it to practical use.
SNET has already installed a new system that combines fiber optics and coaxial cables in a part of West Hartford to test the market for video on demand. That pilot project, just getting under way, allows people to do things like order movies to watch at their convenience on their television sets. That test will be expanded this year throughout the Hartford suburb, in neighboring towns and in Fairfield County.
As the technological ability is extended, said Ron Serrano, vice president for corporate development, SNET will be testing what residents and businesses want to use it for, introducing new products and services every few months.
In announcing their plans today, SNET executives laid out their strategy for competing in a once-staid marketplace based on local telephone service that now is roiling with change. The change has already been painful for SNET's 10,000 employees, who this month began receiving the first of 2,500 termination notices expected under a company reorganization during the next two years.
While the new fiber optic network will be installed by SNET employees, Mr. Miglio said it would not itself provide new jobs. But as the network's abilities provide a growing array of services, from video conferencing to movie programming, interactive college courses and video games that can be played with friends across the country, entire new businesses would be established and employment should rise, he said.
 
Local Competition
 The new telecommunications services, if SNET is successful, should make up for revenue being lost to new national competitors within Connecticut, where last year regulators began allowing A.T.& T., MCI and other long-distance companies to compete with SNET for in-state toll calls.
Those long-distance rivals are also developing ways to avoid the costly fees that local providers like SNET charge for access to their networks as the final link in a long distance call. This month, for example, MCI announced plans to invest $2 billion in its own local-service networks in the nation's 20 largest cities.
But one necessity for SNET, as for Nynex, is to win changes in their regulation as monopoly utilities that would allow them to keep pace with MCI and other competitors, which they say can pick and choose their markets, while they are still required to provide universal telephone service at reasonable cost.
In both Connecticut and New York, regulators are considering moving away from the traditional practice of setting a fixed rate of return for telephone companies. The idea is to encourage the companies themselves to make the immense investment demanded by the new telecommunications network by giving them the freedom to cut costs and set prices, within limits set by the states. The companies would have the incentive of a higher return if they succeed.
 
Incentives Needed
 Without those incentives, said Bob Varettoni, a spokesman for Nynex, the telephone companies have great difficulty investing more than their already substantial annual budgets for upgrading lines.
"We believe that we have a network that's second to none already in place," he said, "but other states are rapidly catching up and could pass us in the next few years because they're under incentive regulation. We're struggling to maintain the same level of investment."
As of Jan. 1, Nynex was required by New York's Public Service Commission to cut its residential rates.
"Certainly investment in telecommunications does help a region retain and create jobs," Mr. Varettoni said. "We are in competition with other states, and we feel that any delay in initiatives toward incentive regulation does a disservice to the state."

HEADLINE: Value of New York City Real Estate Still Falling

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
The value of real estate in New York City has fallen for the fourth year in a row, and though the rate of decline has slowed, the figures indicate that the city's economy is only fitfully climbing out of the depths of recession, the city's Department of Finance said yesterday.
The decline in market values means a decline in the assessed value on which the city bases its tax bills, compounding the difficulties facing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as he tries to close a gap in next year's budget that his aides estimate has now grown to $2.3 billion. 
 Mr. Giuliani has declined to specify what steps he will take to balance the budget for the fiscal year that begins in July, though he has promised to try to avoid tax increases by concentrating first on wasteful spending. His budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, has already asked the city's agencies to cut 1 percent of their budgets immediately and to plan for deeper cuts.
Yesterday Mr. Giuliani asked City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi to use his authority to review spending by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, whose current budget of $3 billion has fallen out of balance by as much as $160 million, according to fiscal monitors.
At the same time, Mr. Lackman ordered the corporation, which operates the city's 11 municipal hospitals as well as health clinics, not to consider any new spending or sign new contracts unless there was a health emergency until the budget shortfall was resolved.
"The city cannot afford to be a deep pocket for H.H.C.," Mr. Lackman wrote in a letter to the corporation's chairman, Luis A. Miranda Jr., and its outgoing president, Dr. Billy E. Jones.
The drop in the taxable value of the city's real estate -- particularly of cooperative apartments, condominiums and apartment buildings and of commercial and industrial properties -- is expected to cost the city at least $100 million in revenues for the 1995 fiscal year, which begins in July, officials said.
The administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins had actually predicted that those revenues would increase about $100 million. That change, coupled with another $100 million that officials expect to lose through challenges to the tax assessments, means the budget gap Mr. Giuliani faces has grown $300 million since late last year. The increase confirmed the direst forecast by Mr. Lackman last month.
"The good news -- if one wants to call this good news -- is that it doesn't come as a surprise to the administration," said Marc V. Shaw, the Finance Commissioner, who announced the annual property assessments at a news conference yesterday.
 
A Slower Decline
 The total market value in 1993 of all real estate in New York City -- about 1 million properties -- is now estimated by the city at nearly $296 billion, a 17 percent decline from the peak of $358 million in 1989. The total fell 1.5 percent from 1992, a slower decline than in previous years.
The biggest decline came in properties known as Class II, including co-ops, condominiums and apartment buildings, which declined 3.8 percent in value citywide. The decline was steepest in the Bronx, where values fell 6 percent, and Brooklyn, where they fell 5 percent.
Commercial property values continued to fall, though at 2.4 percent the decline was considerably less than the 6.1 percent drop last year. According to the Department of Finance, the decline reflected the lingering glut in office space, almost entirely in Manhattan. Commercial values on Staten Island, by contrast, improved slightly, in part because of expansion of the Staten Island Mall.
The market value of homes -- from one-family to three -- appears to have stabilized, but the amount of the assessed value of those that is taxable increased 2 percent because previous increases are still being phased in.
The taxable value of properties -- derived from the market value under a complex rate schedule -- amounted to $77.2 billion for the fiscal year that begins in July, down from $78.2 for the current fiscal year. The billable assessments tend to lag behind changes in the market value.
"There's some light at the end of the tunnel," Mr. Shaw said.
Still, the decline in revenues from property taxes -- which generate roughly a quarter of the city's nearly $32 billion budget, the largest single source of money -- complicates Mr. Giuliani's efforts to balance his first budget without tax increases or painful cuts in services.
The drop in revenues could be offset in part by increases in revenues from other taxes, including those on sales, income and corporate profits. The amount the city can expect from those taxes will be made available later this month.
While not identifying specific ways he hopes to close the budget gap, Mr. Giuliani has indicated that he will try to employ a variety of tactics, including cuts in agency spending and help from the state.
In the case of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates a budget independently of the city's, Mr. Giuliani appeared intent to exert more control over spending right away.
Under a new financial restructuring agreement, the city contributed $278 million to the corporation in this year's budget. With its costs rising, however, the corporation asked for $50 million more, though fiscal monitors estimated its shortfall to be $160 million, Mr. Lackman said.
In a statement, the corporation's chairman, Mr. Miranda, who was appointed to the post by Mr. Giuliani, said he was "as worried as Mayor Giuliani" about the "difficult financial situation."

HEADLINE: Innovation In Sending Donations To Neediest

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
During a season when many longtime contributors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund have been forced to send less because of economic hardship, hundreds of others have instead seen the difficulties as a challenge.
In letters with their contributions, they describe how they have taken up the cudgels of innovation to try to meet the challenge, collecting money from their fellow employees or neighbors, holding auctions, sending along windfalls or even raising money from recycling to help those in need. 
 The second-grade class at Public School 81 in the Bronx, for example, decided in early December to hold a bake sale in the school's lunch room to add to the coins they usually collected to help the Neediest Cases Fund.
"Parents not only donated beautiful baked goods but their time and effort in helping organize, set up, count change and a million other details," the students wrote, sending along a check for $369.24. "The 2d graders beamed as their goods were sold and could not have been more pleased as our dollar amounts increased. We hope the contribution helps bring a bit of the holiday to others in our New York neighborhood."
Gregg and Diane Deger of Sag Harbor, L.I., encouraged their friends to give to the fund by letting them know, in a not-so-subtle way, that the Degers had already contributed $200 in their honor.
Their tactic was to include a small printed note with all their Christmas cards announcing: "In the spirit of holiday giving, we have made a contribution to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund in the names of our families and friends."
"We know that they will share in the happiness we have in making this small gift so it will help make a merrier Christmas for a family that is truly in need of assistance," the Degers wrote.
Others seized on a happy occasion to persuade their colleagues to dig into their pockets. For Steve Innerfield, a controller at Admaster Inc., a marketing and communications company in Manhattan, the occasion was a particularly auspicious communication between two people in his office last year.
"What happened was that Andrew Corn, our president, decided to propose to another employee who worked in the computer graphics department," Mr. Innerfield said. "And the result was that Andy and Lisa were married Dec. 12."
The best wedding present for his boss, Mr. Innerfield decided, would be to help those in the city who really needed it. "It just seemed like a natural," he said yesterday. "So we passed the hat and everybody kicked in a couple of bucks." Five days after the wedding, the employees sent a check for $101.
Collective efforts to help have included those of tenants of apartment buildings, such as the Edgewater on East 72d Street, which collected checks totaling $910. Employees at a branch of Dean Witter Reynolds, in Wayne, N.J., raised $115 by recycling soda cans.
Because The Times pays the expenses of the campaign, which in its 82d year, contributions like these are sent directly to seven social-service agencies to help provide a wide range of assistance to New Yorkers who are poor, hungry, disabled or abused.
The appeal, which will end Feb. 28., continues to need gifts of any size to help charities whose resources are stretched thin. At this time last year, the fund had collected $3,540,061.08. This year, collections stand at $3,454,457.77, or a negative difference of more than $85,000.

A Little Whorehouse Carries On
It appears there will be enough new musicals for a full complement of Tony nominees after all. The long-rumored arrival of "The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public" was confirmed this week by the producer, Stevie Phillips, and Larry L. King, who, with Peter Masterson, wrote the book. The show is a follow-up (though not really a sequel, Mr. King said) to "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," the musical about a small-town brothel called the Chicken Ranch that opened on Broadway in 1978 and ran for nearly four years. It is scheduled to open on May 10, the day before the Tony deadline, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, whose owners, the Nederlander Organization and Stanley Stahl, have agreed to spend $1 million to renovate.
The show is to have a cast of 39, including Dee Hoty as the brothel keeper, Miss Mona, and a full pit orchestra (the original made do with a country-western band). The creative team that put on the first show -- the composer and lyricist Carol Hall; Tommy Tune as co-director (with Mr. Masterson) and choreographer -- is back. (Jeff Calhoun will share the choreography with Mr. Tune.) And once again, Universal Pictures is putting up all the money. Ms. Phillips wouldn't say how much, calling it "unladylike" to speak about such things, but another person close to the show -- definitely not a lady -- said, "Seven million would be a good guess, but you didn't get that from me." 
 Mr. King, a playwright and novelist, based the first show on an article he wrote for Playboy magazine about the closing of the Chicken Ranch, and this one was inspired by real events, too.
"About four years ago," Mr. King said in his gravelly drawl, "the I.R.S. seized a brothel in Nevada for back taxes, and then they tried to run it, and even considered taking it public. Nothin' much come of it, but we immediately saw a great opportunity to have a lot of fun with the I.R.S., the Government, Wall Street and so forth. The next thing we knew we were out in Nevada interviewing the bankruptcy referee who'd been brought in to see, if they went public, if the Federal Government could recoup its money. And then Pete Masterson and I even visited a few brothels out there, to get the conversational lay of the land, so to speak."
"The show kind of moves back and forth from Las Vegas to Texas to New York to D.C., changing times and places, kind of like jump cutting a movie or channel surfing on TV," Mr. King said. "It makes a lot of use of state-of-the-art electronics, stuff that's gonna cost a ton. But in addition to the razzmatazz, it's got a good story."
Ms. Phillips said that the paltry Tony field (the only other eligible new musicals this season are "Cyrano," and two that haven't opened yet, "Beauty and the Beast" and "Passion") was certainly part of the decision to open before the deadline. So, evidently, was the Nederlanders' willingness to spruce up the Lunt-Fontanne, the shoebox-shaped auditorium that seats 1,492 and has been occupied sparingly of late. (Last year, it housed, briefly, "Ain't Broadway Grand.")
The renovation, Ms. Phillips said, was "absolutely mandatory."
"We could not go into that theater and be comfortable the way it was. They'll be pulling out the whole front of the house, reconfiguring aisles, pouring a new cement floor to regrade it, putting in all new seats." In addition, she said, the clouds and cherubim on the ceiling would be removed, and the theater would be repainted and recarpeted in a color scheme complementary to the show's set, though what the colors were she declined, in ladylike fashion, to say.
 
Bon Voyage for 'Oleanna'
 "Oleanna," David Mamet's two-character campus drama about harassment, sexual and otherwise, is to close on Sunday after a remarkable Off Broadway run -- 15 months, 513 performances and 15 previews -- at the Orpheum Theater in the East Village.
The play, which is still sending audiences out onto Second Avenue and into the local bars seething and trembling, was capitalized at $325,000 and, in the words of one of its producers, Fred Zollo, "It's made a bucket of money." The return has been estimated by another producer, Peggy Hill Rosenkranz, at $1 million.
That is far from the end of it, however. Three regional productions of the show are now running, with four others having already completed limited engagements. Seven other American productions, including a tour, are scheduled for 1994.
English-language "Oleannas" are on stage now in London and Johannesburg; in German, the play is now touring Germany, Austria and Switzerland; it's touring in Italy, as well, in Italian, naturally.
Further, beginning with a Swedish production, opening in Stockholm tomorrow, foreign-language versions are scheduled for 1994 in the following countries: Japan, Canada, Israel, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Brazil, Portugal, Greece, Hungary and France. Before the play opened, Mr. Mamet and his producers considered opening it on Broadway, but chose the less expensive route. (It would have cost about $750,000 to open "Oleanna" at, say the John Golden, Mr. Zollo said.) With so many plays having opened and died on the Broadway boards since then, it seems, in retrospect, to have been a wise decision.
Nonetheless, one wonders whether the spotlight of the Broadway stage, in addition to the controversy the play generated all by itself, would have attracted an even larger audience to it, whether "Oleanna" is the kind of "event" play, like "Angels in America," that would have a chance in the Broadway environment that now seems so hostile to nonmusicals.
"None whatsoever," Mr. Zollo said, asked if he'd had second thoughts about eschewing Broadway. "It felt right in the Orpheum space, that perfectly square stage, like a boxing ring."
He added: "I could've seen it at the Golden. But it would've had a limited run. We didn't have famous actors and the chances of awards to pump up your volume was slim, because of the presence of 'Angels', " which, incidentally, Mr. Zollo also helped produce.
At the Orpheum, a 299-seat house with a potential weekly gross of more than $80,000, the show cost not much more than $30,000 a week to run.
"It was a nice economic situation," he said. "We had four or five sellout months, and then it fell into a pleasant valley where, because it costs X instead of Y, it could run in that pleasant valley."
Mr. Zollo, who will happily deliver some of the more colorful ravings against the dwindling audience for drama, is nonetheless producing, with Gregory Mosher, Mr. Mamet's next play, a three-character drama called "The Cryptogram," which New Yorkers may well see this spring, perhaps even on Broadway.
"Should we go to the Golden?" he said. "We're thinking about this."
 
Footlights
 *"Unfinished Stories" by Sybille Pearson, a contemporary drama set on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, is next up at the New York Theater Workshop. The play, which begins performances on Feb. 4 for an official opening on Feb. 16, focuses on a Jewish family -- a newly remarried middle-aged man, his ex-wife, his father, who is dying of cancer, and his son -- stars Laurence Luckinbill, Christopher Collet, Delphi Harrington and Joseph Wiseman. It is being directed by Gordon Davidson, the artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, where the play was developed and first produced the season before last. Mr. Davidson is, of course, a transplanted New Yorker and a frequent visitor back (recently as a co-producer of "Angels in America" and "The Kentucky Cycle"), but he hasn't directed a play here since "The Lady and the Clarinet" in 1983.
*A merry-go-roundish change in the schedule at the Manhattan Theater Club: The world premiere of Terrence McNally's play "Love! Valour! Compassion!," which had been scheduled for the mainstage this spring, will now open the fall season instead; the hope is that at that time Jerry Zaks will be available to direct. In its place, "Kindertransport" by Diane Samuels, which had been scheduled for Stage II, now moves to the mainstage, for an April 26 opening. The title refers to the German-Jewish children who were evacuated to England during the war, and the play focuses on the life of one girl as she grows up and confronts her heritage. Moving into the vacant slot on Stage II is "The Arabian Nights," a contemorary adaptation by Mary Zimmerman, imported from the Lookingglass Theater in Chicago.
*Attention, Gilligan! Tina Louise, who appeared on Broadway in "Li'l Abner" (1956) and "Fade Out, Fade In," (1964) before being marooned on a desert island, makes her Off-Broadway debut in "Good as New" by Peter Hedges ("What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"), one of four one-acts being presented by the Manhattan Class Company at 120 West 28th Street. Performances begin Feb. 13.

GRAPHIC: Photo: "Golden Oldies in Concert Form" -- "Encores!," a new series of concert versions of American musicals, begins at City Center, Feb. 9 to 12, with Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's "Fiorello!," starring Jerry Zaks (above) in the title role, and also featuring Faith Prince, Adam Arkin and Donna McKechnie. The series continues March 2 to 5 with Annie Potts in Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Allegro," and May 4 to 7, with "Lady in the Dark," by Kurt Weill, Ira Gershwin and Moss Hart.

Not Heat, but Humidity
Frank Lloyd Wright took his time designing and building the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (17 years from start to finish). So complex was his design that the only builder he could find to execute his drawings economically was a man whose expertise was constructing concrete parking garages and freeways. Now the Guggenheim is taking its time again, but the issue is how best to solve some of the longstanding problems (a few left over from Wright's design) that weren't fixed by the museum's $45 million restoration and expansion in 1992. Again, museum officials say, lack of money is part of the problem.
This winter's harsh weather hasn't helped. While it may not be noticeable to the average visitor, the museum is grappling with condensation problems. Everyone connected with the museum -- from conservationists to architects -- says that when it is particularly cold outside, moisture from skylights and windows that have not been sufficiently insulated drips down some interior walls. 
 In Wright's grand spiraled rotunda, the trouble spots are particularly noticeable on the third and sixth ramps. Portions of what the museum calls its "little rotunda," a small atrium at the north end of the building, are having similar problems. Long stuffed tubes of absorbent material, giant sponges that resemble blue sausages (museum officials call them socks), line the perimeters of the floors to absorb the moisture that condenses on the windows. These same sausages are discreetly tucked behind paintings in the large rotunda; the art there has been hung on brackets away from the walls.
"As far as I know there has never been any damage to the paintings," said Paul Schwartzbaum, the Guggenheim's chief conservator. "The museum has always had these problems; in fact, before the restoration they were much worse. Now they seem more noticeable because we're much more in the public eye."
Portions of the building that for years were closed off to visitors are now part of the museum again. The "little rotunda," for instance, which now houses the Thannhauser Collection and the Thannhauser Galleries, were office space before the recent refurbishing; the top gallery section of the spiral ramp in the central rotunda was used for storage.
Some of the worst condensation problems were solved when insulated glass was substituted in the large skylight of the main building, Mr. Schwartzbaum said. Before the restoration, the dome had leaked; now, not only is it airtight, but also condensation is avoided with a system that diverts water to the outside of the building through weep holes. These tiny holes have also been made in the bottom of the window frames in the skylights that wrap around the main rotunda, but because the original uninsulated glass remains in these skylights, condensation is still a problem.
"When Wright built the museum, technology was a very naive discipline," said the New York architect Charles Gwathmey, who with his partner, Robert Siegel, refurbished Wright's building and designed the new, 10-story limestone addition. "It's a whole new sophisticated world now."
In the restoration, sophisticated air, electric and humidity systems were installed and hidden so as not to disturb Wright's design. Plans for the re-stuccoing of the building's exterior and the addition of an elastic coating, or vapor barrier, to the outside, as well as replacement of the remaining skylights and window frames -- what Mr. Gwathmey calls Phase 2 of the project -- have been approved by the Landmarks Commission. Mr. Gwathmey, who estimates the cost of these renovations at under $1 million, is waiting for a green light from the Guggenheim to proceed.
Both Mr. Schwartzbaum and Michael Govan, the museum's deputy director, say money isn't the only factor that has delayed Phase 2. While everyone agrees on what work should be done, museum officials say they want more time to study the problem. "Any restoration has a life of its own, and certain things get priority," said Mr. Schwartzbaum. "There wasn't time to do the proper studies and raise the money to meet the schedule for the reopening. The museum felt it was more important to be diligent about studying the problems and finding the right solutions."
On Thursday, Mr. Schwartzbaum said, two prototype thermal-resistant large-paned windows will be installed in the little rotunda.
"It's hard to come up with the right technical solutions while at the same time respecting the Wright landmark," he said. "You don't want to turn a Chihuahua into a cocker spaniel."
 
Dia Director to Leave
 Just as the Dia Center for the Arts in Manhattan is beginning to move away from its status as a small alternative space and into the mainstream of the museum world, it is losing its director, Charles Wright, who has resigned from his post, effective June 1, giving family obligations as his reason. Mr. Wright will remain on Dia's board. Ashton Hawkins, the chairman of Dia's board as well as the executive vice president and counsel to the trustees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said Dia was just beginning to search for a successor.
Among the projects Mr. Wright has overseen, all of which are nearing completion, is the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, which is scheduled to open in May. The museum has been a collaborative effort involving Dia, the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts in New York. Another is the Cy Twombly Museum, a collaboration by Dia, Mr. Twombly and the Menil Foundation that is to open next year in Houston. And a new space for Dia's permanent collection of art from the 1960's to the 1980's is to open next year in a newly renovated building at 535 West 22d Street, in Chelsea.
"It's a great time for someone to come in and shape Dia's future," Mr. Wright said this week. "In the next 20 years it will be known as the next major museum in the city, the one that has shown artists like Warhol, Beuys, Flavin, Judd, who changed the ground rules mid-century. It's an ideal time to be leaving."
 
New Head for Dealer Group
 The Private Art Dealer's Association, a four-year-old nonprofit organization that represents about 60 dealers who run nonpublic galleries in North America, has elected Robert Dance to be its new president.
Mr. Dance, a Manhattan-based dealer in Old Masters and drawings who specializes in Italian paintings and drawings, replaces Jill Newhouse, a Manhattan dealer who has served as president since the organization's inception.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN EUROPE;
In Belarus, Memorials Define a Nation

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINSK, Belarus, Jan. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton's decision to lay a wreath in the Kuropaty Forest, just off the highway from the airport, as he arrives in Minsk has ignited a debate that tells much about Belarus's fragile sovereignty and Soviet-style politics.
The fuss threatens to overshadow Mr. Clinton's six-hour visit here on Saturday, a quick thank-you to the former Soviet republic for agreeing to give up all 81 of its SS-25 nuclear missiles, an accord that was reached without any of the haggling needed to produce a similar pledge by Ukraine. 
 Kuropaty, an ice-covered clearing in the forest marked by a crude wooden cross embellished with a circle of barbed wire, is not one of the plentiful memorials in this blood-soaked country to the victims of Nazi Germany. It is the site of a mass grave of those executed by Stalin's secret police from 1937 to 1941, and it is thought to contain up to 200,000 corpses.
 
Symbol of a Nation
 The current Government looks at Kuropaty with extreme ambivalence.
When excavation at the site began in 1988, Kuropaty took on symbolic importance for nationalists. The archeologist who discovered it, Zyanon Paznyak, a leader of the political opposition, regards Prime Minister Vyacheslav F. Kebich as a traitor, accusing him of "conducting a pro-imperial, pro-Russian policy."
So the wreath-laying will serve to highlight Mr. Clinton's support for faster political and economic change in this nation of 10.7 million, including early elections to a Parliament that has been in place since 1990, before independence.
Mr. Kebich said in an interview that the legislature had decided to ask the White House to schedule Mr. Clinton's visit to Kuropaty last, as he departs -- and not before paying his respects at the official Soviet-built monument to the victims of Nazism in downtown Victory Square.
 
Legacy of Bloody Wars
 But for Mr. Paznyak, such a schedule change would be an outrage.
"The old Communist Party and Supreme Soviet are still in place in Belarus," he said. "Kuropaty is a crime committed by their predecessors, and they hate that Mr. Clinton will pay respects to this horrible place, this factory of death. It is a symbol of Stalin's genocide and the massacre of our nation."
A senior Western diplomat said it was unlikely that Mr. Clinton's schedule would change.
Like Ukraine, to the south, Belarus has seen centuries of bloodshed and has been chewed up by many larger neighbors. An estimated 1.3 million Belarusians died during the Nazi occupation in World War II -- including virtually every Jew and half the population of Minsk.
Up to 2 million died in Stalin's purges.
And Belarus, like Ukraine, is trying to build an independent state, but on weaker foundations, with little left of ancient Belarusian culture. Except for the Nazi occupation and a few months of independence after the Russian Revolution, the area has been under the control of Russia since 1772, and of Poland and Lithuania before that. Few people even speak Belarusian.
"Not so long ago, on a tram car, if I heard someone speaking Belarusian, I knew who it was without even turning around," said Ihar Germyanchuk, an opposition deputy and editor of Svaboda, or Liberty, a small nationalist newspaper.
So Kuropaty is also important in the search for symbols of Belarusian nationality. Minsk's vast main street, for instance, once named for Lenin, is now named for Frantsisk Skaryna, born about 1490. He was Belarusian all right, but he is honored for having printed the first Bible in what was then Lithuania, and he spent most of his life in Cracow and Prague.
 
'Think of Survival First'
 Stanislav S. Shushkevich, the embattled centrist democrat who is Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, says Belarusians have learned humility from their history, which helps to explain the paucity of reform and the willingness to kowtow, if necessary, to Russia.
"We've been beaten so many times and put in such difficult situations, we always think of survival first," said Mr. Shushkevich, a nuclear physicist.
Mr. Shushkevich has been kept in power by Mr. Paznyak and the opposition, but he tries to steer a course between them and the old Communist officials around Mr. Kebich, who now promises elections this year, after rejecting a petition to hold them earlier.
"I don't sense the building of an independent state," Mr. Shushkevich said. He finds the Government to be reactive and wavering, first promoting a Belarusian currency and then, as inflation worsened, promoting an ill-defined economic union with Russia.
 
In the Bear's Embrace
 Many workers see the embrace of Moscow and its ruble as a sort of salvation. One said, "I can't think of sovereignty and independence when I can't feed or clothe my son."
Mr. Kebich denies that economic union, which is by no means fully negotiated, would diminish sovereignty -- despite the need to coordinate Minsk's currency, budget and financial policies with Moscow.
"We're realists," he said. All oil and gas pipelines come from Russia and 75 percent of Belarusian industry depends on Russian products and markets.
But when asked if he is worried about Russia's putting economic pressure on Belarus, he replied: "Of course we're worried. That's why we should behave ourselves! That's why we must behave very quietly!"

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Politics of Nativism

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
When California political consultants talk with their focus groups these days about such issues as crime, schools or jobs, they find an underlying concern about something else: immigration. There is a strain of ferocious anti-immigrant feeling in the state.
Fear of immigrants is not new in California. As long ago as 1848 an outcry against Peruvian miners led to a Foreign Miners Tax, and there has been periodic anti-immigrant fever since. 
 The present agitation focuses on illegal immigration. Of California's population of 31 million, about 1 million are estimated to be undocumented aliens, most of them from Mexico and other Latin American countries. But the hostility really seems to extend to all immigrants, legally admitted or not.
The anti-immigrant mood is plainly connected to California's current economic distress. It is said that immigrants take jobs away from citizens and put a costly burden on schools, hospitals and other public facilities.
In fact, most economists believe that immigrants benefit, not burden, the economy. Julian L. Simon of the University of Maryland, writing in The Wall Street Journal last year, showed that immigrants do not reduce others' jobs and that the average immigrant family pays $2,500 more in taxes annually than it receives in public services. (But most of the tax money goes to the Federal Government rather than the localities that pay for such things as schools.)
"Some people genuinely worry about the problem of too many immigrants in a stagnant economy," Prof. Bill O. Hing, an immigration expert at the Stanford Law School, says. "But for most, economics is a diversion. Underneath it is race."
People say that immigrants are clannish, live by themselves, don't speak English. All of those things were said 100 years ago about Jews and Italians and others whom nativists denounced as "undesirable immigrants." Much of what is going on in California today is old-fashioned nativism or xenophobia.
A frequent claim, for example, is that today's immigrants do not assimilate as readily as those in the past. But English-language courses have long waiting lists.
The historic American pattern of striving immigrants building the economy also continues. Here in San Jose, the big city of Silicon Valley, Vietnamese are about 10 percent of the population. Vietnamese businesses are thriving, and many a high school valedictorian is of Vietnamese origin.
But facts are being overwhelmed by the emotions of fear and hatred. And politicians are running with those feelings much the same way they used to with anti-Communism.
Gov. Pete Wilson has staked out the low ground on the issue. Last summer he published an open letter to President Clinton demanding sweeping measures against illegal immigrants.
Mr. Wilson called for a constitutional amendment to repeal the 14th Amendment's provision that everyone born in the United States is a citizen. American-born children of illegal immigrants should not be citizens, he said -- and should be denied the right to attend public schools.
The Supreme Court held in 1982 that denying education to illegal aliens was unconstitutional. Even the dissenters, in an opinion by then Chief Justice Warren Burger, said that as a matter of social policy it would be "senseless for an enlightened society to deprive any children . . . of an elementary education."
The Governor sought advice from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an anti-immigration group, which urged him to seek exclusion of undocumented aliens from public hospitals and schools. FAIR gets support from a New York foundation, the Pioneer Fund, that also subsidizes researchers seeking to prove that blacks and Latinos are inherently inferior.
Democratic politicians have tried to jump on the anti-immigrant bandwagon. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer have proposed fierce new measures to tighten the border. But one political observer, paraphrasing the saying about a segregationist Senator in the old South, said: "Nobody's going to out-immigrate Pete Wilson."

HEADLINE: Anti-Zionists Do the Work of Anti-Semites

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"U.S. Jews Don't Clamor for Spy's Release" (letter, Dec. 30) by Alan V. Stone, president of the American Council for Judaism, is an unfortunate example of the way serious, controversial issues can be exploited to advance a private agenda. 
 For Mr. Stone, the Jonathan J. Pollard case provides a convenient vehicle to promote the standard propaganda line of his 50-year-old anti-Zionist organization.
It opposed the United Nations partition of Palestine in 1947, opposed the creation of Israel in 1948 and consistently took an anti-Israel position in the decades that followed. In that same period, the Arab states waged wars and economic boycotts against Israel while forcing international isolation of Israel.
By ignoring the centuries of longing and love for Zion by Jews in the diaspora, the Amercan Council for Judaism has made a fetish of emphasizing Israel's "foreignness."
It is ironic that, out of their own fear and defensiveness, Mr. Stone and his colleagues are raising the same specter of false and sinister "dual loyalty" against American Jews that anti-Semites have conjured up for so long.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Declares an Election-Year War on Crime

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Escalating an election-year war of posturing over crime, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo took the unusual step today of ordering the Legislature to meet on Monday to consider legislation aimed at curbing gun violence.
Last month, the Democratic Governor asked the Legislature to convene for a special session on Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, an invitation rejected by the Republican leadership of the State Senate. 
 Only four days ago he suggested that it might be a waste of taxpayers' money to force the senators to come to work on Monday, a state holiday, particularly when they can begin work as early as Tuesday on a variety of crime bills.
But Mr. Cuomo said today that he thought the special session would be useful to focus attention on the issue of crime even if it produces no action. The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, responded by saying his members would comply with the edict. But he fired off a news release characterizing the Governor's tactic as "a cynical attempt to camouflage his opposition to the death penalty and his failure to stop the growth of criminal violence during his 11 years in office."
Both the Governor and the Senate Republicans have declared their support for several crime bills, including legislation to restrict the possession and use of assault weapons. But they have spent the last month jockeying for political advantage with a succession of tactical maneuvers intended to underscore their commitment to fighting crime.
When Mr. Cuomo asked both houses of the Legislature to meet in Albany on Jan. 17, the Democratic-majority Assembly, which passed an assault weapon ban last year, quickly assented. But the Senate Republicans, wary of letting Mr. Cuomo take control of the anti-crime agenda, said they would not attend. They vowed to act before the Jan. 17 session on their own anti-crime bills.
But that has not happened. Today Mr. Cuomo changed his request that the Legislature return into an order, a power granted him by the State Constitution.
 
Seeking 4th Term
 Mr. Cuomo is running for re-election to a fourth term this year and the Republicans plan to make major issues of his handling of crime and the economy. The fear generated by last year's fatal shootings on the Long Island Rail Road and the bombing of the World Trade Center have made crime a particularly potent political issue.
Of course, the Governor cannot force the Senate to vote on his bills. He has often remarked, most recently on Monday, that attempts to force the Legislature to act can be counterproductive.
Mr. Cuomo has used his authority to call an "extraordinary session" only three other times in his 11 years as Governor, always in December after the Legislature had recessed for the year. A 1985 extraordinary session to deal with medical malpractice legislation was considered an extraordinary failure.
"The worst way in the world to try to get things done is to order people to agree," Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference on Monday, when he was asked whether he would order the Senate to return. "You cannot order people to agree. And that's why I have not done it since, what, 1984 or '85, when it was a fiasco. All it did was waste people's money.
"I don't like pounding myself on the chest saying, 'You must come and do this.' They won't. They'll come and they won't do it and they'll waste your money."
But Mr. Cuomo said today that the lack of action by the Republicans compelled him to force their return.
"There is no power, constitutional or otherwise, that can force legislators to act, although it is possible to force them to be present," he said in a statement. "By calling an Extraordinary Session beginning on Jan. 17 I can assure that the issue of gun violence becomes the central focus of our attention.
"Also, the unusual use of this special executive power properly emphasizes the great importance I attach to this issue, an issue that involves nothing less than the lives, the safety and the peace of mind of the people who have chosen us to govern."
 
Not a Costly Day
 Mr. Cuomo said in an interview today that next Monday's session would not, in fact, cost much. Because the Legislature technically has been in session since Jan. 5, the only expenses will be the $89 paid each working day to lawmakers and any holiday pay earned by legislative employees paid by the hour.
The Governor's order for the Legislature to return came one day after Senate Republican leaders proposed a crime package of their own. It includes tougher penalties for several crimes and a ban on about 20 brands of assault weapons. The assault weapon ban would be paired in the same bill with reinstatement of the death penalty, a measure that Mr. Cuomo has vetoed each year of his tenure.
Because the Republicans know that Mr. Cuomo would veto the death penalty again, and the assault weapon ban along with it, the Governor blasted the plan as a "cynical political game" intended to highlight his opposition to the death penalty.
"It would be to take the assault weapons bill, tie it to a giant boulder, and throw it into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean," he said on Thursday.
 
Bills Held Hostage
 In his statement today, Mr. Cuomo urged the Senate "not to hold hostage effective measures against crime in their campaign to keep the death penalty alive as a political issue."
Mr. Marino responded that "Governor Cuomo is the only obstacle to achieving both the death penalty and a ban on assault weapons."
Several Democratic legislators said they did know whether Mr. Cuomo's move today ultimately would accelerate negotiations on crime legislation toward an agreement or prolong them through partisan bickering.
The Governor said he was not trying to pick a fight and said he did not think his order would prove counterproductive.
"I don't think it will antagonize them at all," he said. "How could they have expected anything else? We all said it was urgent. You said you would do it before Jan. 17. You failed to do it before Jan. 17. What would you say to the victims?"

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN EUROPE;
For Clinton in Russia, TV and Empathy

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Just as he has on "Donahue" and MTV, and at town hall meetings in scores of American cities, President Clinton perched himself in a studio audience here this afternoon, opened himself to inquiries from far and wide, and assured the uneasy that he could sense their pain.
"Let's go to Nizhni Novgorod," the President commanded at one point in the broadcast, which was carried live throughout much of the former Soviet Union on Government television. As Russian producers cut to a hookup from that industrial capital, Mr. Clinton looked into the wide screen and asked: "Did I say it right?" 
 On the American campaign trial in 1988, Mr. Clinton gamely fielded questions from all comers, including a self-described pagan witch. And in what amounted to a 100-minute "Bill Clinton Show" today, he applied to diplomacy his well-honed skills of empathy.
 
Praise of Words
 Asked by one questioner whether there might be something the United States could learn from Russia, as well as the other way around, the President responded with praise. "If Boris Yeltsin came to the United States and did what I'm doing here, very few of the students could stand up and speak to him in Russian, as you're doing in English," he said.
And when one woman asked the President what he thought of astrological predictions that Russia "will soon become the center of everything," Mr. Clinton readily agreed that "there's a great energy here, I think." He later shook the hand of a well-spoken 13-year-old boy, Aleksandr Fyodorov, who he said might well become President of Russia, just as Mr. Clinton moved into the White House three decades after shaking the hand of John F. Kennedy.
With so many Russians left uneasy by the country's state of turmoil, Mr. Clinton had already made efforts at reassurance a centerpiece of his conversations here with everyone from President Yeltsin to a bakery clerk. But the White House effort to extend its message to millions more people brought to the country's television a most unusual display.
Mr. Clinton spoke at the Ostankino television center, where Russian troops battled with anti-Government forces only three months ago. He was introduced by Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, the former aide to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who earlier admonished an invited crowd of 800 students, teachers, journalists and professionals not to "engage in a polemic with the President."
 
A Call to Action
 Standing in front of a backdrop that showed American and Russian flags draped together over a globe, and flanked by two risers stacked five-high with listeners, Mr. Clinton began with an address to the Russian people, in which he said the nation's future was "still yours to make, yours to write, yours to shape."
But once finished with his set piece, he shed all pretense of formality, leaving his podium behind to walk down a ramp and onto a platform that extended into the crowd. Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and bold purple tie, he assumed the demeanor of a sympathetic talk show host.
"I'll take one from the right, one from the left, I'll do the screen and come back, O.K.?" he asked at the outset, while the audience nodded in agreement. Asked mostly for his views about Russia and the world, Mr. Clinton once used the word "partner" four times in a sentence.
He even claimed to envy the power given to Russia's President under the country's new Constitution. But he also spoke repeatedly of the difficulties still at hand here.
 
In Search of Wisdom
 Asked with whom he would speak if he could choose only one person in Russia to tell him about how things stood, Mr. Clinton said he would "speak to the wisest person I could find in a medium-sized city in Russia that was having a difficult time with those economic changes."
He said such a person, rather than someone in Moscow, could best tell him how ordinary Russians "were viewing what was going on now."
Many in the crowd later spoke with admiration of Mr. Clinton's performance and said they had been impressed by his candor and his knowledge. "It is a great difference from our President," said Yuri Zinchenko, a psychology faculty member at Moscow State University, describing Mr. Clinton as "very open."
But others said they remained skeptical of Mr. Clinton's motives in reaching out. "He is a very informed man on Russian problems," said Mariya Leontyeva, a 19-year-old college student. "But we're a big power, so he needs to be concerned."
 
Common Interests
 Hillary Rodham Clinton was also in the audience. She arrived in Moscow today with the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, to join Mr. Clinton for the final weekend of his trip, which will end on Sunday in Geneva.
Mrs. Clinton spent the morning visiting a pediatric ward and a birthing clinic in a Moscow hospital with Mr. Yeltsin's wife, Naina, who shares Mrs. Clinton's interest in health care. The two women shared the head table with their husbands at tonight's state dinner in the Kremlin.
Chelsea Clinton, who is 13 and is making her first visit to Russia, passed up both the talk and the pomp. Along with Mr. Yeltsin's two grandchildren, White House officials said, she spent the evening at Moscow's famous circus.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Cancel a Timber Deal in Alaska

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
Reversing decades of preferential treatment for a timber company in Alaska, the Clinton Administration said yesterday that it intended to end a 50-year contract providing low-cost wood from the nation's last largely intact rain forest, the Tongass National Forest.
The National Forest Service told the Alaska Pulp Corporation, one of two timber companies that have long-term contracts to harvest trees in the lush forests in Alaska's southeastern panhandle, that the company had breached the contract by shutting down a pulp mill at Sitka last year. 
 The contracts, guaranteeing high volumes of old-growth timber at low prices for another decade, have been criticized by conservation groups for years.
Alaska Pulp, a Japanese-owned company, was given 30 days to demonstrate to the Government that the contract should not be terminated, something that it could theoretically do by taking the unlikely step of reopening the mill, which had 400 workers.
Officials at Alaska Pulp said they were working on a plan to convert the plant to make fiberboard, a process that pollutes less and could earn more revenue.
 
Company Seeks Resolution
 "We are confident that information provided to the Forest Service earlier this week will resolve differences on the matter," said Frank Roppel, the company's executive vice president.
But the bluntly worded letter from Michael Barton, the Forest Service's regional contracting officer, left no doubt as to the Government's intentions to end the contract as quickly as possible.
Under terms of the contract, the Government would be required to tell the company by mid-February where logging would be permitted for the next three years. In total, the Government was to identify a supply of timber probably amounting to more than 100 million board feet annually.
Spanning 17 million acres on the rocky shores and numerous islands, the Tongass is the biggest of the national forests, once described by the naturalist John Muir as "an endless rhythm and beauty."
But in recent years, scientists and forest managers at the agency have identified serious declines in wildlife and in the general condition of areas that are being logged, and conservationists have warned that unless forestry practices were significantly changed, the damage could become grave and irreversible.
The long-term contracts for the Alaskan forest were signed in the 1950's to try to create jobs in Alaska, chiefly by providing raw materials for a product called dissolving pulp, which is used for cellophane and other industrial products.
But there is a worldwide glut of those products, and the timber companies have used much of the wood for more profitable sawmill operations, which provide far fewer jobs.
The other company with a long-term contract, the Ketchikan Pulp Company, is also under pressure from the Government, which is reviewing the latest big timber sale to Ketchikan Pulp from the Tongass.
 
Urged to Cancel Contracts
 In a letter to the Administration last week, six members of Congress called for both companies' contracts to be canceled. Although Ketchikan Pulp, a subsidiary of Louisiana-Pacific, is operating its pulp mill intermittently and thus might not be technically in breach of contract, the letter said that the company had hardly been a model corporate citizen and that it is facing Federal Clean Water Act complaints.
Even without the long-term contracts, the companies would be able to cut timber in the forest but only in the competitive bidding procedures used elsewhere in the national forest system.
Their preferential contracts guaranteed them a continuous supply of timber in quantities unparalleled in other forests and at prices that were unusually low. They received further Government help in the form of roads and other services. The Forest Service loses millions of dollars every year, because the revenue from timber sales does not offset the cost of these services.
Opponents of the logging practices under the contracts have argued, using studies done by the Forest Service, that by the time the contracts expire the forest would be severely damaged, leading to an inevitable decline in logging at that point.
Although the forest is vast, much of it is mountainous glacier, peat, scrub timber and the like. Only about one-third of the area is considered suitable for commercial cutting, and only 4 percent contains the high-volume stands that are used by the timber companies, according to a study by the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, a conservation group.
 
Conservationists Offer Plan
 Conservation groups have argued that the forest could be better managed by letting small-scale loggers work there, while preserving much of the oldest growth to shelter species like Sitka deer and salmon, which provide for an economic base built on tourism, fishing and other activities.
The conservation groups hailed yesterday's development as a clear indication that the Clinton Administration is taking a fundamentally new direction in the management of the nation's forests.
"This is a very significant action," said Charles M. Clusen, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private conservation group. "I would put it right their with passage of the Tongass Timber Reform Act in 1990."
That law directed important changes in how the forest is managed, but Congress decided at the time not to terminate the contracts outright, and critics of the Forest Service have complained that some of the act's other provisions have not been carried out.
Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, praised the decision.
"This egregious contract has long been the driving force in mismanagement of the Tongass National Forest," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns Japanese Over Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The United States warned Japan today that it was being inflexible in talks to open up its market to foreign goods, although American efforts to sell more cars in Japan have begun to register some success.
In both Tokyo and Washington, American officials warned that tensions could mount before Japan's Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, visits Washington on Feb. 11, unless there was progress in talks aimed at increasing Japanese purchases of foreign cars, auto parts, medical equipment and telecommunications equipment.
 
 
Nissan Dealer to Sell Fords
 There was some good news for the Americans today. The Nissan Motor Company said its largest dealer, Tokyo Nissan, was planning to sell cars made by the Ford Motor Company. 
 It is believed that other Nissan dealers are also negotiating to begin carrying Ford vehicles, although spokesmen for both companies would not comment. A central goal for the United States in its talks with Tokyo is to get more Japanese dealers to carry American cars.
Expressing the American view of the talks, a senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said in an interview: "Less than a month before that visit, we haven't had a serious engagement with the Japanese in these negotiations. What the political leaders in Japan may not know is how focused the Administration is on these talks and how united the American Government is on them."
At a news conference today in Tokyo, Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, sent out the same message, saying that after a week of talks, "The fact is, we haven't moved an inch."
 
 
Toughest Stance in Months
 Today's stern message is the toughest stance the Administration has taken toward Japan in months, and, some officials say, could signal the end of the honeymoon between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa. At the same time, this message appears to be part of the normal jawboning of international negotiations.
Responding to the American criticisms, Masafumi Ishii, first secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Washington, said: "Japanese officials are as eager to reach an agreement as United States officials are. We are making our utmost efforts."
The two countries are seeking to flesh out a so-called framework agreement signed in July after a summit meeting in Japan at which Tokyo said it would liberalize its Government rules to allow for increased imports of telecommunications and medical equipment. Japan also promised to take steps to allow foreign insurance companies to sell more policies in Japan.
Although the Clinton Administration recognizes that Prime Minister Hosokawa is sitting atop a fragile political coalition -- one that could be weakened by making concessions to Washington -- officials say they are intent on pushing his Government to make good on an agreement signed by his predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa.
"One of the sources of frustration is so much of what the U.S. is asking for is consistent with the direction Hosokawa promised of increasing consumer choice and improving life style," an Administration official said. "What we're asking would reduce prices and give consumers a wider choice of goods."
 
Difficult to Pin Down
 After Joan Spero, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, returned from Tokyo this week, she told other officials that it was difficult to pin down the Japanese because there are so many parties in Mr. Hosokawa's coalition and because Japan's powerful bureaucracy has an uneasy relationship with the Hosokawa Government.
One dispute is over the quantitative indicators that the framework agreement says should be set up to monitor progress in improving market access in Japan. American officials maintain that the Japanese have rejected every quantitative indicator suggested by the United States.
Tokyo insists that it will not agree to setting numerical targets for such things as purchases of foreign auto parts by Japanese companies, because that would violate the rules of free trade. Washington asserts that it is not asking for simple targets, such as achieving a certain market share in a given year. But it is asking for goals that are more vague -- like increasing the number of dealerships selling American cars. The Japanese insist that these are, in effect, targets.
Mr. Garten said that in autos, "there is not even agreement on the nature of the problem."
Washington contends that foreign auto sales in Japan are low because Japanese business practices, like close links between Japanese manufacturers and dealers, exclude foreign cars. But Tokyo says the problem is that Detroit's cars do not suit the Japanese market.

HEADLINE: Russia's New Parliament Chooses Ally of the Communists as Speaker

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 14

 BODY:
As President Boris N. Yeltsin gave President Clinton general assurances that economic change would proceed in Russia, its newly elected lower house of Parliament chose an anti-reform Communist stalwart as its Speaker today.
The vote was another graphic reminder of the political realities facing Mr. Yeltsin once Mr. Clinton goes home. The victorious candidate, Ivan P. Rybkin, had the support of the Communist Party and its allies, and of the far-right nationalist party headed by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. 
 The lower house rejected pro-reform candidates for speaker in its first round of voting on Thursday and chose today between Mr. Rybkin and a nationalist independent, Yuri P. Vlasov.
 
Led Old Communist Faction
 After Mr. Vlasov announced that he would vote for Mr. Rybkin in order "not to split the nationalist forces," the legislature elected Mr. Rybkin, 47, a leader of the Communist faction in the old Parliament, which Mr. Yeltsin dissolved in October.
Mr. Rybkin, now a member of the pro-Communist Agrarian Party, won the bare majority needed in the 444-member lower house, 223 votes, after the pro-Government Russia's Choice faction, the largest, chose to abstain. There were 111 votes against him, including members of the second-largest reform faction, headed by Grigory A. Yavlinsky. In a separate ballot, Mr. Vlasov, a famous weight lifter who has expressed strong anti-Western and anti-Zionist views, received 23 votes.
Mr. Rybkin, an engineer from Volgograd, was supported by the Communists, the Agrarians -- who are allied with the Communists but say they represent collective farmers -- and the nationalist Liberal Democrats led by Mr. Zhirinovsky.
By conceding in favor of Mr. Rybkin, Mr. Vlasov demonstrated the potential of any nationalist-Communist alliance. Such a bloc seems unlikely to solidify but could come together often on specific issues.
But the Communists and their Agrarian allies have shown strength and superior organization in the last two days of maneuvering in the lower house. They worked to set a quorum of half of the 444 registered members, making it impossible for any one faction, like the reformist Russia's Choice, to block the legislature. Russia's Choice favored a two-thirds quorum.
The Communists and nationalists also insured that Mr. Rybkin, as the new Speaker, would maintain the power to prepare the lower house's agenda, and pushed the threshold for achieving official status as a parliamentary faction, qualifying a group of lawmakers for important privileges, to 35. Russia's Choice wanted the number to be 20, to dilute the power of the opposition.
 
Reformers Not Very United
 By contrast, the reformers, mustering just under 200 votes, have not had enough strength to push through their own agenda, and they have not been very united in Parliament's first few days.
Officially, Russia's Choice is listed as the largest faction, with 76 seats, followed by Mr. Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats with 63; the Agrarians with 55; the Communists with 45; the reformist Russian Party of Unity and Accord, 30; the reformist Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc, 25; Women of Russia, 23, and the centrist Democratic Party, 15. That leaves 112 members officially classified as independent -- a huge swing vote.
But no matter which side prevails in Parliament, it will have only a limited ability to block or change the policies of the Yeltsin Government. Under the new Constitution, a bill that passes the lower house becomes law if the upper house approves it or takes no action in 14 days. If the upper house rejects it, the lower house may override with a two-thirds vote. If the President vetoes a bill, a two-thirds vote in both houses is required to override the veto. Moreover, presidential decrees automatically become law unless judged unconstitutional by the courts or blocked by new legislation, which must survive possible presidential veto. So it is difficult for the legislature to force laws on Mr. Yeltsin, though its powers over the budget, which it must approve, remain important and untested.
 
Promises Fairness to All
 Mr. Rybkin promised to work with all factions fairly. He also said he supported political amnesty for all those who had taken part, without criminal activity, in the failed coups of August 1991 and last October, and he emphasized a need to make some corrections in economic policy.
One of the failed candidates for Speaker was Mr. Zhirinovsky, who angrily withdrew his candidacy on Thursday, shouting, "Every candidate for Speaker must be sent to a psychiatric hospital!" Today, he was punched in the face in Parliament's cafeteria. An independent member from St. Petersburg, Mark L. Goryachev, was waiting in the buffet line and apparently resented Mr. Zhirinovsky's loud demand for immediate service when he entered with aides.
As waitresses rushed to Mr. Zhirinovsky, Mr. Goryachev complained that he and other legislators had been waiting for some time. Witnesses told the Interfax news agency that Mr. Zhirinovsky then rushed to Mr. Goryachev, telling him to "shut up" and that Mr. Goryachev then punched him. Mr. Zhirinovsky was quoted as commanding Mr. Goryachev to "get out of here while you're still in one piece" and called for the police.
Mr. Zhirinovsky later denied that any such incident had happened.
 
Yeltsin Praises Lawmakers
 At a news conference today with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Yeltsin said he could work with the new Parliament, which he said was "cleverer and more intellectual and has more experience" than its predecessor. On Thursday the upper house of Parliament, made up largely of local officials and bureaucrats, elected a Yeltsin ally, First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir F. Shumeiko, as its Speaker.
Mr. Yeltsin will provide the first real indication of any possible policy shifts when he announces a Cabinet shuffle, perhaps as early as Monday, in which some key economic reformers may be demoted.
Today, Mr. Clinton referred genially to Mr. Yeltsin's looming troubles with Parliament. "It's nice to be in a place where some other president is having trouble with his Parliament instead of me," he said.
But he suggested that lawmakers learn how to work within a more democratic spirit of give-and-take than Russia is used to.

HEADLINE: German Giant's Ills Endanger a U.S. Oil Company

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Ripples from the financial crisis confronting Germany's Metallgesellschaft A.G. have spread across the Atlantic to the Radnor, Pa., home of a small oil company.
On the eve of last-ditch talks between the Frankfurt-based conglomerate and its creditor banks, the Castle Energy Corporation said yesterday that the banks' failure to approve a $1.95 billion restructuring package could impair Castle's ability to finance its operations. That is because Castle, whose stock is owned in part by the metal conglomerate and its senior executives, relies on Metallgesellschaft for much of its revenue.
 
Revamping Could Be Affected
 The paradox is that Metallgesellschaft's relations with and commitment to Castle may be a major impediment to its restructuring. 
 "If I were a banker I would have serious questions about Metallgesellschaft's ability to continue without a substantial change in all its contracts with Castle," said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Metallgesellschaft has said all 120 of its creditor banks must accept the restructuring plan in its entirety for the rescue to go ahead. If not, it has said, it will file for bankruptcy.
Metallgesellschaft, Germany's 15th-largest company, is on the brink of ruin mainly because of huge losses in oil futures trading at the MG Corporation, its American subsidiary, in the last three months of 1993.
Metallgesellschaft's relationship with Castle began in 1989, when it gave Castle much-needed financial support and entered into the first of two agreements to buy 100 percent of the oil refined by Castle at fixed profit margins that are extremely lucrative for Castle, ranging from $2 to as much as $4 a barrel above margins currently earned by most refiners.
In an unpublished analysis of the Metallgesellschaft crisis, Mr. Verleger put the combined value to Castle of these two contracts, which extend to the end of the century, at around $310 million a year.
"In this market, it was a very, very rich processing fee," he said. "People at the major oil companies would love to be paid that much."
Until the end of September 1993 Metallgesellschaft and its executives held 49.3 percent of Castle Energy stock. That changed in late November when Castle sold 2.8 million shares in a secondary offering. The German company now owns 40 percent of Castle shares, and three of its executives own an additional 3.9 percent. As shareholders, they benefit from the lucrative contracts.
A good chunk of the $42 million raised in the stock offering was used to pay down debt owed to Metallgesellschaft.
Perhaps coincidentally, Castle's stock offering was priced less than 24 hours before Metallgesellschaft announced it had taken a quarterly loss and eliminated its dividend.
Joseph L. Castle 2d, Castle Energy's president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview yesterday he had no idea of Metallgesellschaft's problems when the stock deal was priced.
"I found out on Dec. 6 that they had problems," when the company admitted the losses it was facing were bigger than initially reported, he said.
Officials at MG, the New York-based subsidiary, did not return telephone calls for comment.
In the prospectus detailing the stock offering, Castle disclosed that three top MG executives were board members and big shareholders. The three were Siegfried K. Hodapp, MG's president and chief operating officer, a senior vice president of the parent company and Castle's chairman since May 1992; W. Arthur Benson, a senior vice president at MG and a well-known oil futures trader, and Joseph M. Rinaldi, another MG senior vice president.
 
Dismissed in December
 Mr. Hodapp was dismissed by Metallgesellschaft in December after the huge oil futures losses. Mr. Rinaldi and Mr. Benson remain.
Castle's stock, priced at $24 a share on Nov. 23, has slid steadily since. It closed yesterday on Nasdaq at $10.125, down 37.5 cents.
In addition to its equity stake in Castle and its refining arrangements, MG also holds about $30 million in Castle debt and separately provides Castle with credit lines that according to the prospectus appear to exceed $300 million.
In the telephone interview, Mr. Castle said his company, which made $67.8 million in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, would have lost money in 1993 but for the MG arrangements.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN EUROPE: A Russian Tightrope;
The President Does Not Fall Down, But He Does Wobble Now and Then

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 14

 BODY:
American Presidents used to come here to treat with monolithic governments. On his arrival here this week, Bill Clinton found no real government at all, but rather two inchoate groups, one composed of reformers, the other a mix of "go slow" pragmatists and counter-reformers, all struggling for power, staggering into an unfathomable future.
That put the young, inexperienced President on something of a diplomatic tightrope, fighting to keep his balance. He did not fall off, but he did not make it across without a few wobbles this way and that. 
 "I thought the tone was excellent," said a senior European diplomat who had never seen Mr. Clinton in action before. "He never condescended to them. He told them how great their country is, which they need to hear, especially from the mighty Americans. He said their country was not the only one with problems, and he talked about his own difficulties in pushing health-care reform through Congress. He also told them, as they have learned to their cost, that the free market doesn't have all the answers."
 
Four Meetings With Yeltsin
 The President and his senior aides chose to spend most of their time with the leader of the first group, President Boris N. Yeltsin. Only at a reception Thursday night at Spaso House, the American Ambassador's residence, did he briefly encounter the second group, mingling with and praising members of all parties in the new Parliament. His national security adviser, Anthony Lake, spent most of his time there with the leader of the semi-reformed Communist Party, with whom the Americans may want to do business.
Upping his bet on Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton chose not to visit the Parliament, not to speak at length to its members, not to hold substantive meetings with its leaders, at least partly because the parliamentary hierarchy has not yet solidified. He held four long meetings with Mr. Yeltsin.
"There is a 'with us or against us' mentality in this country, which Clinton has chosen to accept," said a Briton long a resident in Moscow. "He chose not to stress the importance of Parliament because Parliament is obviously Yeltsin's adversary. He opened not an inch of space between himself and Yeltsin, although Yeltsin is in decline, arguably terminal decline."
 
Some Object
 Other people noticed, too, and some objected, as have critics in Washington, to what looked like excessive identification with one man.
"Mr. President," a man in Red Square said to Mr. Clinton during his televised town meeting, "we're getting an impression you're supporting not so much the reforms in Russia but the personality of Mr. Yeltsin."
Mr. Clinton, who had answered a similar question a few moments before, replied: "I'm the President of the United States. I should be open to meeting with and listening to all the democratic voices in Russia. But in the end, I still have to work with your President."
 
Excellent Chemistry
 Mr. Yeltsin spoke, for all the danger that awaits the Russian politician who overidentifies with the United States, of "my friend Bill Clinton." It was said, as it has been ritually said at every summit meeting for decades, regardless of who was involved, that there was excellent chemistry between the two.
Beyond that, the conference produced or expedited important achievments -- an agreement not to aim missiles at one another, a three-way agreement under which Ukraine's President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, pledged to scrap his country's nuclear arsenal, an agreement to open the American market to Russian uranium -- even if it yielded no magic elixir for Russia's ills.
Yet it is Parliament, elected only a month ago, that most vividly reflects the grass-roots fury of this vast and turbulent nation -- and in particular the mounting anti-Americanism. However much they love their Cokes and Levis, however much they may privately admire American wealth and success, many Russians blame the United States for their country's loss of empire and superpower status, for the poverty and privation in which many workers find themsleves and for the crudity of nascent capitalism here, with its sleazy products, crooked politicians, swindlers, racketeers and profiteers.
 
Parliament Is Safety Valve
 Mr. Yeltsin has the constitutional powers to sidestep Parliament, but it is still the Parliament that can provide the safety valve for the steam of wounded pride, the Parliament where new political coalitions will have to be built and consensus on grand strategy, if any, achieved, and the Parliament that will serve as the forcing ground for the young politicians who will have to provide the answer to the question, After Yeltsin, who is there?
Mr. Clinton and his advisers believe passionately that a slower pace of reform, as advocated by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, whose star is in the ascendancy here, will only delay the dawn of recovery and prolong the pain. Viewing him as the only viable counterforce to the gradualists, the Americans extracted from Mr. Yeltsin a pledge to press on, undaunted, with his relatively radical reform program, and they warned as bluntly as good manners permitted that international aid would be forthcoming only if he did.
"It's reassuring," said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, "to be back here in the presence of the Russian leaders and find them undeterred by any events, indeed redoubling their efforts to move forward on reform."
 
Whistling in the Dark?
 His Cabinet colleague, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, added: "What you're seeing is a country that's stabilizing." That sounded like whistling in the dark to many Russians, who have seen the ruble slide to an all-time low this week and who still, despite considerable progress, still suffer inflation of 12 percent month. Indeed, Mr. Bentsen seemed to contradict himself when he said things would have to get a lot better before foreign investment would soar.
Mr. Yeltsin's ability to deliver may be limited, not least by his own sense of what is politically wise. To appease the nationalist and Communist foes of reform, who won about 45 percent of the party preference votes in the Dec. 12 election, Mr. Chernomyrdin is expected to demote or jettison one or more of the chief architects of Mr. Yeltsin's reform policies when he forms his new Cabinet next week.
In an effort to outflank the nationalists, Mr. Yeltsin has begun to picture Russia, however fancifully, as an actor on the world stage with a role fully equal to that of the United States. According to his spokesman, he told Mr. Clinton that new security arrangements with Europe could not be reached without Russia's assent -- in effect claiming a veto over American policy in the region that President Clinton has heatedly denied giving him.
 
U.S. Can Do Little
 But that kind of muscle-flexing, which did not disturb the Americans very much, won't provide the social services, including health care and education and pension plans, that Russia so desperately needs as an analgesic for the pain of economic transition, and Mr. Clinton readily acknowledged that the United States can do little to help beyond providing technical advice.
Each in his own way, Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton tried at the closing news conference this morning to dispel any suggestion that Russia was dancing to an American tune, as some of Mr. Yeltsin's critics have asserted.
Eager to avoid any appearance of begging or dependence, and conscious of the budgetary strictures in Washington, Mr. Yeltsin asserted, "We don't need direct social aid because such aid is also needed by the American people."
Mr. Clinton drove the point home: "The implication that we have somehow tried to direct the course of policy is just not accurate and not true. We have our problems at home, too -- every country does. The United States has no interest in charting Russia's future; that's for Russia to do."
Now he will have to go home and wait to see what happens.

HEADLINE: New York State Reports Surplus of $300 Million

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 14

 BODY:
State will end its fiscal year on March 31 with a $300 million surplus, the result of a slowdown in Medicaid inflation, a moderate increase in tax revenues and tighter spending policies, state officials said today.
State officials welcomed the projection as new evidence of an improving regional economy. The surplus in the $32 billion budget will be the second in a row for the state, which laid off thousands of workers and cut services to close budget gaps at the height of the recession. 
 But the New York officials warned that some areas of business, particularly in manufacturing, remain weak and could face additional layoffs this year. And they noted that the state, even in a strengthening economy, faces a $2 billion gap between projected spending and revenues for the coming fiscal year.
"What these two surpluses in a row tell us is that we have brought the ship through those rough waters," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who announced the surplus on a statewide talk show on public television Thursday night. But, he added, "The surplus is not huge."
The stage is now set for the annual battle of the budget. Mr. Cuomo will introduce his spending plan for the next fiscal year on Tuesday, and he is expected to call for modest spending growth for education, new prison cells and youth programs, as well as cuts in some Medicaid services. He will also call for laying off 160 state workers, down sharply from the 2,495 layoffs Mr. Cuomo proposed in last year's budget.
 
Budget Fight Looms
 The surplus from the previous year is traditionally one of the first skirmishes of the new budget fight, with the Legislature demanding that the money be used for expanded services and Mr. Cuomo arguing that it should be used to close budget shortfalls.
This year, the Republicans who control the state Senate have predicted that the surplus will be $500 million. The Senate may raise its estimate and demand that the money be used to increase aid to the suburban school districts they represent, Senate Republican aides said.
In the strongest indication that the state's economy has turned, revenues from a range of state taxes are up from last year. Leading the way have been Wall Street financial firms and banks, whose end-of-the-year bonuses have translated into increased income tax revenues.
As of November, income taxes were up 8.8 percent, banking taxes were up 15.4 percent, estate taxes were up 21 percent and sales taxes were up 3.8 percent from the same period a year before. Sales tax revenues were particularly strong in New York City, Long Island and Westchester, where tax revenues have grown faster than inflation for three consecutive quarters.
This year's surplus is also the fruit of several consecutive seasons of state layoffs. Since 1991, the state work force has shrunk by about 25,000 positions.
 
Medicaid Growth Slows
 Also underlying the surplus has been a slight slowdown in the growth of Medicaid spending, which represents about 16 percent of the state's general fund budget. Aides to Mr. Cuomo said the Medicaid growth rate might dip into the single digits for the first time in several years, largely due to a leveling off of health care costs across the region.
The projected surplus would have been larger if Mr. Cuomo had not decided to use about $120 million of it for a Medicaid payment that was delayed last year to help eliminate a gap in that year's budget. Though the bill could have been paid out of next year's budget, his aides said Mr. Cuomo decided to retire it sooner in an effort to appease Wall Street, whose credit-rating agencies have given the state the second-lowest bond rating among the 50 states.
It has long been the hope of Cuomo aides that the state's bond rating would be raised this year, when Mr. Cuomo is seeking his fourth term as Governor.
For the coming budget year, the state faces a shortfall of about $3.3 billion, aides to Mr. Cuomo estimated. However, about $1.1 billion of that gap comes from scheduled reductions in personal income and hospital taxes, and the Legislature is likely to delay both rollbacks.
In his budget message to the Legislature on Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo is expected to repeat his call for a state takeover of local Medicaid costs in exchange for a share of local tax revenues, something New York City has long sought. Under Mr. Cuomo's multiyear plan, the state would assume no local Medicaid costs this year, about $120 million the second year and an increasing amount in successive years.
But facing a $2.3 billion gap in next year's budget, New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani joined last week with the Republican county executives from Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland and Westchester Counties in imploring Mr. Cuomo to begin assuming local costs this year.
Though Mr. Cuomo's budget will not include the $120 million needed to do that, his aides said the Governor will call on Legislative leaders to discuss the idea -- in effect challenging Senate Republicans to help the city's new Republican Mayor.

HEADLINE: NEW SET OF DATA BOLSTERS OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Evidence mounted today that the economy grew at a rate exceeding 5 percent in the final quarter of 1993 as car and truck production powered an unexpectedly big jump in December industrial output. The operating rate of American factories, mines and utilities also climbed last month, reaching its busiest pace in four and a half years.
Many economists, who until recently had estimated economic growth in the final months of last year at about 4.5 to 5 percent, are beginning to raise their sights for this year, particularly for the year's first quarter. 
 "What is crystal clear is that the economy is showing even stronger demand" than most people had expected, said John Lipsky, an economist at Salomon Brothers.
 
Consumer Confidence Soars
 Prospects for a continuation of the rapid expansion were bolstered by the University of Michigan, which reported that its indexes of consumer confidence surged early this month.
The figures appeared to undermine a longstanding consensus among economists that business activity would repeat the pattern of a year ago in which holiday-season vigor was followed by a sharp slowdown early in the new year.
Salomon Brothers told its clients today that this time the economy was still gathering steam as the year ended. The momentum, it said, "probably will prove sufficient to sustain growth in a 3.5 to 4 percent range" in the early months of 1994.
 
Source of Optimism
 Mr. Lipsky said there was now little chance of a flip-flop in gross domestic product like the one that occurred when a 5.7 percent pace of expansion in the fourth quarter of 1992 was followed by expansion of just eight-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter of 1993.
A major contributor to the current optimism that higher taxes and weak export prospects will not sink the recovery is the fact that interest rates, which have worked their magic on housing and cars, are still relatively low. The fact that rates were low a year ago did not forestall some softening in the beginning of last year, but proved a prime factor eventually in the acceleration of economic growth.
Although still lacking some data, particularly on international trade, Merrill Lynch now predicts that the Government will report in two weeks that the economy expanded at a 6 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter. This would be a pace comparable to the boom-like year of 1984, when total output of goods and services spurted 6.2 percent for the full year.
Between early December and early January, before this week's barrage of good news, the consensus fourth-quarter growth prediction of 50 forecasters in the Blue Chip survey had risen to 4.2 percent from 3.8 percent. Early this month, the 10 most optimistic economists had put the quarter's growth rate at 4.8 percent.
Analysts noted, however, that the fourth quarter would benefit from spending related to the continued efforts to recover from the summer's floods and drought.
While today's figures -- a seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in industrial production and a jump in consumer sentiment to 95.8 from 88.2 -- sent interest rates up somewhat, many analysts expressed little alarm.
Indeed, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve, said today at a conference of mortgage bankers in New York that he expected inflation to remain in a 2.5 to 3 percent range this year, a level that would represent little or no acceleration from the 2.7 percent pace recorded for 1993. Interest rates, though they generally lag in affecting the economy, tend to track the inflation rate closely.
Robert Rubin, a senior economic adviser to President Clinton, said he saw no pressures to drive prices up at a time when there is global overcapacity in manufacturing and many economies remain sluggish. His comments could be seen as at least partly an effort to tell the Federal Reserve that the Administration wants it to avoid trying to head off the possibility of revived inflation with actions that might be premature now.
And though high operating rates in industry have traditionally been seen as harbingers of inflation, many analysts said today that the climb of recent months, which took capacity utilization to 83.5 percent in December, was probably benign.
 
Mitigating Factors
 They contend that actual capacity is substantially greater than the Federal Reserve's figures assume, reflecting a recent boom in capital spending.
"This investment has not been fully captured," said Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist at Nationsbank in New York.
Analysts also cited improvements in productivity, estimated by Merrill Lynch to be growing more than 5 percent a year, that allow companies to produce more goods with fewer workers and other resources.
"Few bottlenecks are likely to develop in the coming year," said Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch.
The economy's resurgence since about Labor Day has bypassed some parts of the country. But even in California, which has been battered by military cutbacks, there are signs that the nationwide strength is bringing some stability. The state's unemployment rate, which stood at 9.8 percent as recently as October, has fallen more than a percentage point.
 
Revisions for Earlier Months
 Today's production report showed not only a seventh straight rise, but also presented revised data showing that the gains in October, November and December were each at least twice as large as those in any of the preceding four months.
Output at factories, which advanced seven-tenths of 1 percent, was concentrated in durable goods. Production of motor vehicles and parts jumped 4.9 percent in December.
In contrast to durable goods, which rose by 1.3 percent over all, nondurables like clothing, paper products and fuels fell two-tenths of 1 percent last month after rising six-tenths of 1 percent in November.
The operating rate for factories was put at 82.7 percent last month, with primary processing at 86 percent and advanced processing at 81.4 percent, the Fed report showed.
Output from mines, which includes oil wells, rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month after a November skid, while utility output posted another solid gain, 1 percent.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment raced to 95.8 at its preliminary January reading from 88.2 in December, according to subscribers to the survey. This was the highest since September 1989.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 24.77 to Record In a Broad-Based Climb

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Stock prices surged across the board yesterday, pushing several key market indicators to record highs, as evidence of strong economic growth and higher corporate profits offset a rise in interest rates.
Technology and semiconductor stocks rose, led by Motorola, which reported strong earnings on Thursday. Electrical equipment, chemical, auto and entertainment stocks also gained. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.77 points, to 3,867.20, topping Monday's record of 3,865.51, and bringing its gain for the week to 46.43 points.
 
Reports Raise Confidence
 The stock market is "focusing on the strong economic numbers rather than the typical negative reaction in the bond market," where investors are wary of more inflation, said Philip Smyth, analyst at Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn.
A rash of reports raised confidence in the economic recovery. The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index surged to 95.8 in January from 88.2 in December, the highest reading in more than four years. Industrial production surged seven-tenths of a percent last month to the highest level since the middle of 1989.
Among broader market indicators, the Nasdaq combined composite index climbed 4.50 points, to 792.31, setting its second straight high, and the Dow Jones transportation average reached a record 1,834.81, up 10.73 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 2.44, to 474.91, near its Monday record of 475.27, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.17, to 262.90, which was just above Monday's record of 262.76.
Volume remained heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, where 304.9 million shares changed hands, up from 278 million Thursday.
 
An Upbeat Outlook
 "Investors are interpreting the environment as the best of all possible worlds," with "low interest rates, low inflation and solid corporate profits," said Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Sherwood Securities.
The outlook for stocks is bright as long as interest rates stay low, fueling the recovery and making stocks more attractive investments relative to fixed-income securities, investors said.
Stocks rallied even as long-term interest rates moved up yesterday, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond at 6.29 percent, up from 6.26 percent on Thursday.
"Something terrific's happening," said Cummins Catherwood, managing director at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood Inc. in Philadelphia. "We've got momentum, let's face it."
Shares of Motorola surged yesterday after it reported earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations.
"Any time a stock like Motorola reports better-than-expected earnings, the stock's going to go up," said Jack Baker, head of equity trading at Furman Selz Inc. "I don't see any selling pressure in the market."
 
Motorola Up 1
 Motorola, up 1 at 99, said late Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit rose to $1.15 a share from 64 cents. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.03.
Among other technology stocks, Wellfleet Communications gained 2 3/8, to 70 1/8. It also posted stronger-than-expected earnings.
Bank stocks rose amid optimism about quarterly profits. Citicorp gained for a second day, rising 1 1/4, to 42, after it said on Thursday that it would post strong earnings and that it was getting rid of its money-losing Quotron business. J. P. Morgan rose 1 1/8, to 71 1/2, a day after it said fourth-quarter net income rose 77 percent. And Wells Fargo added 2 3/8, to 133 7/8, after setting a 52-week high of 134 1/8.
L.M. Ericsson Telephone's American depository receipts rose 3 3/8, to 45 1/2. A unit of the Swedish telecommunications company won a cellular telephone contract in South Africa.
But Excel Industries dropped 1/2, to 17 7/8. Ford Motor plans to sell its 24 percent stake in the maker of automotive window systems. Ford gained 3/8, to 68 1/4.
Castle Energy fell 3/8, to 10 1/8. The oil refiner said it might be hurt by problems at Metallgesellschaft, a troubled German company that is Castle's largest shareholder.
 
National Media Gains
 National Media rallied 2, to 10 1/4. Valuevision International, which owns 9.8 percent of National Media's stock, made a takeover proposal for the entire company. Valuevision fell 3/8, to 14 1/2.
The Medstat Group fell 2 1/4, to 13 3/4. The marketer of software to analyze medical claims was lowered to "sell" from long-term "attractive" at Equitable Securities.
In Tokyo yesterday, Japanese stocks staged a late-afternoon rally, pushing the Nikkei index of 225 issues up 396.44 points, or 2.13 percent, to end at 18,973.70.

HEADLINE: Beauty Beyond the Turnpike;
Jokes Aside, New Jersey Tries to Shed Inferiority Complex

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Here's a classic New Jersey story, offered instructively as Christine Todd Whitman prepares to govern a state with probably more diversity than it knows what to do with.
Two business travelers on a plane strike up a conversation. Both are from New Jersey but don't know it. 
 "Where are you from?"
"New York."
"You live in Manhattan?"
"No, I live outside."
"Brooklyn?"
"Actually, I live across the river. In New Jersey. Montclair."
"Gee, that's a terrific town. Why didn't you say so?"
"Well, if I say that, people will make cracks about New Jersey. If I say I'm from New York, everybody accepts that I'm an O.K. guy."
 
<SC0>Beauty Beyond the Exit Ramps
 The storyteller, Gordon A. MacInnes Jr., a Morristown Democrat who recently won a State Senate seat, is encouraged that such encounters with closet New Jerseyans seem to be decreasing. It is a sure sign of progress in the battle to separate the words New Jersey from Turnpike and to make America and Jay Leno understand that, yes, there is beauty beyond the exit ramps.
For Mrs. Whitman, who takes figurative command of the state's 567 fiercely independent municipalities and 21 counties on Tuesday, the challenge will be to forge and burnish a cohesive image of a state whose residents sometimes seem to have only their differences in common.
Do its commuters identify with New York, Philadelphia or the town where they sleep and eat? Can those who live "down the Shore" understand those in the Highlands or the Pine Barrens? Can gentrified suburbanites shed a tear (or a tax dollar) for the poor of Camden or Newark?
All these people, and more, live in New Jersey, but do they recognize their New Jerseyness? Can they be persuaded to? Increasingly, pollsters and pundits say, they do and they can.
Most armchair sociologists date this image transformation to the "era of good feeling" under the popular Gov. Thomas H. Kean ("New Juhsey and you. Puhfect togethah," 1981-1989). It continued for four years under his successor, the unpopular Gov. Jim Florio, who despite rough political and economic times, kept the nation focused on his battles over taxes, gun control and welfare reform -- and away from questions like, "Is Jimmy Hoffa really buried in the end zone at Giants Stadium?"
And now, with recessionary forces abating, Mrs. Whitman is poised to inherit this small (46th in area) powerhouse of a state that exhibits more contradictions than Edward J. Rollins Jr. and over the years has had an image problem nearly as large as his. Lots of work remains to do on that, but even New Jersey catches a break once in a while. After all, it is not Long Island.
New Jersey's essential enigma (its identity crisis) is a big one, though, and it was crystallized in a song, "I'm From New Jersey," that has haunted the halls of the State House in Trenton for more than 35 years. Its author, Red Mascara of Phillipsburg, has unsuccessfully lobbied all this time to adopt these words as the official state song:
I'm from New Jersey and I'm proud about it, I love the Garden State.
I'm from New Jersey and I want to shout it, I think it's simply great.
Immortal phrases? Perhaps not. But Mr. Mascara's ardent chauvinism exposes the core of the problem. To proclaim I'm from New Jersey is to prompt another question: So what does that mean?
 
Blueberries and Cranberries
 Well, it means its citizens live in the nation's most densely populated state -- the only one with more than 1,000 inhabitants per square mile -- yet almost 60 percent of its land is forest or farm. It has 127 miles of Atlantic beachfront and 1,400 miles of trout streams, ranks second in production of cultivated blueberries and third in cranberries.
It leads in pharmaceuticals and telecommunications, and its tourism industry -- the beaches, Atlantic City, ocean and stream fishing -- contributes almost 10 percent of the state's gross product.
As the first all-suburban state, New Jersey has no major city. Its six largest contain less than 10 percent of the population, most of it poor. It has more horses and more scientists per capita than any other state. Parts of its northern and western counties resemble Vermont (though no one has ever said that Vermont resembles New Jersey) and nearly a quarter of the state is the wild and pristine Pine Barrens in the south. If the Mason-Dixon Line had been extended, a fractionof New Jersey would have been in the Old South.
And while it strives to market the New Jersey name -- "Jersey Fresh," New Jersey Transit, NJN (the state-run cable television network), "New Jersey and You" -- it is the only state that does not lend its name to the state university system. In fact, for too many years, too many high school graduates sought their college degrees beyond its borders.
 
Now, About the Turnpike
 One New Jersey name needs no introduction: the turnpike, with its notorious vistas of gas and oil tank farms at the northern exits. It's a tough picture to paper over, so it's easy to forget that New Jersey was home to the first incandescent lamp (Menlo Park, 1879), the first condensed soup (Camden, 1897) and the first solid-body electric guitar (Les Paul, Mahwah, 1940).
Easier to remember is that this quaint colony of George III later nurtured the corrupt political machine of Frank Hague in Jersey City, provided the setting for the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby and toxic-waste dumps and produced Henry Krajewski, a Secaucus pig farmer who ran for President.
And one day, about a century ago, probably on a vaudeville stage in Manhattan, a baggy-pants comic searching for a sure-fire insult came up with a line about Joisey. There simply aren't enough dignified antidotes to invoke -- not Princeton University, not Woodrow Wilson, not William J. Brennan, the former United States Supreme Court Justice -- to overcome one well-timed Joisey jape.
Like its cousins -- Brooklyn, Peoria, Cleveland and Oshkosh -- New Jersey at the turn of the century was meant to be funny simply because it wasn't New York, wasn't big time, wasn't sophisticated. It was flat, it was farms, it was hayseeds at large. It was, in fact, exactly what Benjamin Franklin said: a "keg tapped at both ends," a stepchild of two political bullies, Philadelphia and New York City. Through the 1940's, it was also the grimy industrial state where more than half the jobs were in manufacturing -- those that weren't on the piers.
 
From a Lemon, Lemonade
 What can you do with a state like that? You learn to turn liabilities into assets. You learn that with maturity often comes sophistication. You gain the wisdom to accept what you can't change -- you can't pretend the turnpike doesn't exist.
So last fall, confronting the What exit do you live near? refrain, the State Division of Tourism issued a guidebook with maps of all major roads, their exits and brief descriptions of notable sites within 10 miles of the off-ramps. It is called the Road Scholar program.

HEADLINE: Justices to Decide on a Right Of Review of a Jury's Award

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the right to judicial review of a jury's award of damages is constitutionally required to protect defendants against excessive judgments.
The case is a challenge to an Oregon rule that makes the size of jury awards unreviewable either by the state trial judge or by an appellate court. The Supreme Court appeal was brought by the Honda Motor Company, which an Oregon jury ordered to pay $735,000 in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages to a man who was injured when a three-wheel all-terrain vehicle made by Honda flipped over on him. 
 While the case concerns damages in general, the Court's focus will almost certainly be on the punitive damages aspect. Five times in recent years the Court has tried and failed to articulate a constitutional theory for limiting the multimillion-dollar punitive awards that have been a growing concern to the business community.
A majority of the Court appears to share this concern, but has been unable to agree on an approach. Just last June, for example, the Court upheld a $10 million punitive damages award for a $19,000 economic injury. The 6-to-3 ruling in that case, TXO Production Corporation v. Alliance Resources Corporation, was not supported by a single majority opinion, and the predominant tone in the plurality opinion was one of discomfort with the outcome.
 
Effect Could Be Narrow
 Two years before that, the Court suggested that some punitive damages awards can be so "extreme" as to violate the constitutional requirement of due process of law. But that decision, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Haslip, which upheld a punitive damage award of $840,000 in a $3,800 insurance fraud, stopped well short of specifying when that point might be reached.
The case the Court accepted today, Honda Motor Company v. Oberg, No. 93-644, will not necessarily lead to a more definitive result. The Court's ruling could be narrow, with little significance outside Oregon, the only state that bars judicial review of the size of a jury's damage award. Even if the Court agrees with Honda that the absence of any review procedure at all violates due process, the decision would not necessarily illuminate the more general punitive damages questions.
On the other hand, if the Justices viewed the case only as a challenge to an anomalous law of a single state, they would not necessarily have agreed to review it. The case offers a vehicle for a broader ruling on whether the Constitution's due process guarantee places limits on other states' procedures for handling punitive damage awards.
Under Oregon law, judges may review jury damage awards to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. But the size of the award itself is insulated from judicial review by a provision of the state constitution that the Oregon Supreme Court has interpreted as barring judges from reconsidering a jury's factual determinations. The Oregon Supreme Court rejected Honda's constitutional challenge to this rule in a decision last May.
Honda is basing its appeal to the United States Supreme Court in part on a long tradition in English and American law of providing judicial review for the size of jury verdicts. Juries' decisions on damages are "fraught with the risk of injustice," the appeal asserts, particularly when the defendant is a big out-of-state corporation. "The risk of aberrational results is simply too high" to go unreviewed, Honda told the Court.
The plaintiff in the case, Karl L. Oberg, suffered head injuries when his all-terrain vehicle flipped over on him as he tried to drive it up a steep embankment. The jury found that he was 20 percent at fault in the accident, with the manufacturer bearing 80 percent of the fault. The trial court permitted his lawyers to introduce statistics compiled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission on the large number of injuries associated with these three-wheel vehicles.
 
Accountant Rule to Be Heard
 In another case, the Court agreed to hear a Florida lawyer's constitutional challenge to a state rule that bars lawyers who are also certified public accountants or certified financial planners from using those designations on their business cards, letterheads or listings in the yellow pages.
The rule, enforced by the Florida Board of Accountancy, was challenged unsuccessfully in the state courts by Silvia S. Ibanez, a lawyer who also holds a state license as an accountant and represents clients in Internal Revenue Service proceedings. Her listing in the yellow pages, which an anonymous sender mailed to the accountancy board, included her C.P.A. designation. The board reprimanded her on the ground that the listing was "inherently misleading" because she was not conducting an accounting practice.
Her Supreme Court appeal, Ibanez v. Florida, No. 93-639, argues that the state rule infringes her First Amendment right of commercial speech. The Justices have been sympathetic to similar arguments. Last year they struck down the same state board's limit on the right of accountants to solicit clients.

HEADLINE: Messages for Neediest Cases: Someone Cares

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
For many regular contributors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, sending a donation is a way to show gratitude for business success, to remember a loved one, to celebrate an anniversary or simply to feel they have done their civic duty. The checks arrive with a small note attached or sometimes with only a few words jotted next to a signature.
But there are scores of other donors who feel it is not enough just to contribute. In a city where friendliness can seem in short supply and where it is easy to become inured to suffering, these donors see the Neediest Cases Fund as a way to let their fellow New Yorkers know that they are still affected by the poverty they see around them every day. 
 "This is really a beautiful season," wrote Liv Hempel of Manhattan, who gave $250. "But it's also one of the saddest times of the year. You are constantly confronted with the terrible discrepancy of haves and have-nots. It's time for those of us who have something to be thankful for to share some of it with those so much less fortunate."
Jed A. Levine sent $50 along with a letter describing his family's mourning at the death of his grandmother, Lillie Levine, who was 96. "Sadly, this year has also been a difficult one for the city that we love," he added. "The streets are filled with ever-increasing numbers of homeless men, women and children. Violence has become so commonplace that we are in danger of becoming complacent about the random deaths of innocent citizens. Many of this city's children go to bed at night hungry and hurting. It is our hope that this contribution will help."
 
'Where Are Our Priorities?'
 Some letters convey a rising sense of frustration. "The amount of suffering and deprivation seen on the streets of New York grows worse and less tolerable every year," wrote Bernice K. Leader of Wayne, N.J., who sent $50. "Where are our priorities? How can we ignore the plight of fellow human beings? Why isn't enough being done to eliminate the problems of homelessness, hunger and poverty? I feel more helpless and hopeless every year."
Others, like Irene and Albert Libchaber of Princeton, N.J., hold out cautious optimism. "We have hope this year will improve the economic state of the homeless," they wrote in a letter accompanying their $400 donation. "Recovery has not yet arrived and I know our check is a drop in a well of desperation. But we have to be thankful and share as much as we can."
The Times pays all overhead costs for the campaign, which is in its 82d year, allowing donations to be sent directly to seven charities to assist the homeless, the hungry, the abused and the mentally ill. The campaign continues until Feb. 28.
Many of the donors' letters say they hope their contributions set an example to encourage others to give. "I'm sending more than usual this year," wrote B. J. Goodspeed of Fairfield, Conn., who enclosed a check for $300. "The need is so great and I feel so fortunate that everyone in my family is healthy and happy. Sometimes I wonder how I got so lucky."

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasury Securities Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities prices fell yesterday, closing a week of seesaw trading. Stronger-than-expected economic data released yesterday continued to rattle bond traders who were already worried about economic growth, the potential for rising inflation and possible moves by the Federal Reserve to tighten credit.
By late in the day yesterday, the price of the Treasury's 30-year bond declined 1/2 point, to 9917/32 , to yield 6.29 percent, up from 6.26 percent on Thursday. The rate on shorter maturities rose slightly, with three-month and six-month bills up 2 basis points, to 2.96 percent and 3.14 percent, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 After some early strength, strong numbers on industrial production in December, up seven-tenths of 1 percent, and capacity utilization, reported at 83.5 percent in December, helped depress prices of Government securities. The production gain was higher than the four-tenths of a percent that had been expected, and capacity utilization was in line with expectations.
 
G.D.P. Growth Expected
 In addition, November business inventories were up six-tenths of a percent, compared with a revised figure for October of three-tenths of a percent. Analysts said the unexpected surge following a sharp upward revision could bolster the market's forecast for fourth-quarter growth in the real gross domestic product.
And the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for January showed solid gains.
Such signs of economic strength worry bond traders because a growing economy has a tendency to generate inflationary pressures, which erode the value of fixed-income investments.
Traders said the market was likely to waffle through the next couple of weeks as it waits for January statistics and starts to shift some of its focus toward supply.
Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company, Chicago, said that yesterday's trading was an extension of Thursday's, with losses from strong economic data providing an impetus for selling.
 
Brooding Over the Fed
 "Basically there has been a shift from last week to this week, with the market first believing the Fed will tighten in the second half and then back to thinking it will happen late in the first quarter," Mr. Dederick said. "And unless there is good news for the market, the brooding over some Fed action will begin soon.
"The market is also thinking increasingly of supply again, with the Treasury announcing next week the size of its two-year and five-year note auctions and upcoming February quarterly refunding."
Because the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday will be observed on Monday, the Government securities market will be closed, although other financial markets will be open. The Treasury will hold its weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills on Tuesday.
 
Pressure on Rates
 Most of the market is aware that the Fed will eventually have to nudge short-term rates higher. With the first-quarter data a crucial variable for the Fed in deciding when and how much to act, the market is concerned that the strength seen in the late fourth-quarter figures, and now the early reading of consumer sentiment in January, will push up the Fed's timetable.
Analysts at MMS International continue to believe that the Fed will not act before it gets more hard evidence that the economic growth will be sustained in the first quarter. Thus, it will wait for at least a couple of months of data before deciding on a course of action, traders say.
Meanwhile, "prices will back up further and possibly the market will digest all the data, Mr. Dederick said. "But until something new comes along, prices will slither down a bit," he added.
At a briefing for foreign journalists in New York, Robert E. Rubin, the chairman of the National Economic Council, estimated that the economy would grow about 3 percent this year and said he saw no new inflationary pressures.

HEADLINE: Democrats Offer a Plan For Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Seeking to move ahead of New York's new Republican Mayor on tax cuts, the two most powerful Democrats on the City Council offered a plan yesterday to reduce taxes on commercial rents, hotel rooms and cooperative apartments and condominiums.
Later Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani endorsed the principle of cutting taxes on city businesses. He said that he would present a budget on Feb. 2 that included some cuts in the hotel tax and the commercial occupancy tax but that he believed that a reduction in the property tax on co-ops and condominiums was unlikely this year. 
 "There's no question that one of the things that we have to do is to show some reduction in taxes as an economic incentive," Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference at City Hall yesterday afternoon. "The question becomes, 'How far can we go in that direction when we have $2.3 billion deficit?' "
In announcing their plan, the Democratic leaders -- the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Herbert E. Berman -- proposed cuts that would cost the city $72 million in lost revenue. They said, however, that the cuts would bolster the city's economy by easing the burdens that taxes have imposed on businesses, tourists and homeowners.
 
Opening Bids
 The proposals amounted to the opening bids in the complex, sometimes wrenching negotiations between the Mayor and the City Council over the budget, which is for the fiscal year that begins in July.
Mr. Vallone and Mr. Berman said the cuts were feasible, despite the looming deficit, because of higher-than-anticipated increases in revenue from taxes on personal income, banks and corporations.
Those increases, which their aides estimate could total $170 million by the end of the year, appear to reflect the tentative improvements in the city's economy, a day after the Department of Finance reported that the value of the city's real estate continued to decline. Breaking with the Democrats' call for protecting city services whenever possible, Mr. Vallone and Mr. Berman said they felt that it was now more important to reduce the city's most regressive taxes -- even if it meant Mr. Giuliani had to cut some services.
"While we agree that the budget difficulties facing the city are a serious concern, we remain committed to a strategy for tax reform that will send a message that New York City is a good place to live and do business," Mr. Vallone and Mr. Berman wrote in a letter to Mr. Giuliani.
 
Jostling for Voter Support
 By moving to propose cuts ahead of the Mayor, Mr. Vallone, the city government's ranking Democrat, has tried to become the first to offer tax relief to merchants and homeowners, as the Democrats seek to recapture the support of the frustrated middle-class voters who helped elect Mr. Giuliani.
For his part, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he was glad the Democrats "had joined him" in seeking tax cuts for businesses, particularly small businesses.
Under the plan outlined by Mr. Vallone and Mr. Berman, the city would increase the number of businesses exempted from the 6-percent tax on rents for commercial space. The tax is now levied against businesses that pay more than $11,000 in rent each year in Manhattan below 96th Street or more than $15,715 elsewhere. The city has already approved raising the exemptions to $21,000 and $30,000, but the new proposal would raise them to $28,000 and $40,000. The change would exempt 12,000 businesses of the roughly 90,000 that now pay the tax.
The tax, first imposed in 1964 and unique among municipal taxes in the nation, has long been criticized by merchants and business leaders.
The change would cost the city about $20 million next year.
Mr. Vallone and Mr. Berman also proposed reducing the city's tax on hotel rooms to 5 percent from 6 percent over the next two years. Last week, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed a gradual reduction in the state's 5 percent tax on hotel rooms.
 
An Appeal to Cuomo
 Mr. Giuliani has appealed to the Governor to reduce the state's share of the tax on hotel rooms, which totals 19.25 percent. Also, New York City assesses a flat $2 fee on rooms costing more than $100. Yesterday, he said he would also propose reducing the city's share, as Mr. Vallone and Mr. Berman proposed.
While the tax raises $120 million a year for the city, many argue that it has hurt tourism, particularly through a boycott by the Professional Convention Management Association.
The other proposed cut would reduce the taxes on co-ops, condominiums and apartment buildings, which are taxed at a higher rate than homes for one, two or three families. For example, the owner of a single-family home worth $255,000 pays $1,950 a year in property tax, while the owner of a comparably valued co-op pays $3,900, according to City Council financial advisers.
Mr. Vallone and Mr. Berman proposed phasing in a reduction of the tax on those properties over the next decade. While the reduction would cost $44 million in the next year alone, Mr. Berman argued that it would allow more people, especially young people, to afford homes and that it could spark "a real estate boom."
At a news conference, Mr. Giuliani played down the possibility of the cut in property taxes but said he would keep an open mind as his aides prepare a preliminary budget.
Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson praised the spirit of the proposed tax cuts, saying it was important that the Mayor and the Council work to improve the city's image among the business leaders. "A few small cuts will say to them, 'It's not getting any worse,' " Mr. Dyson said.

Dollar Slips After Reaching 2-Year High Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped after rising to a two-year high against the German mark yesterday, as traders sold it to lock in their profits ahead of the weekend.
The dollar also lost ground against the Japanese yen. 
 Gold prices fell in New York after finishing mostly higher overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery slipped 50 cents, to $390.10 an ounce.
The dollar rose in early trading yesterday against European currencies after the Federal Reserve reported a seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in production at United States factories, mines and utilities in December.
 
Consumer Confidence Helps
 Also pushing up the dollar was an increase in the University of Michigan's survey of consumer confidence, to 95.8 percent in the first part of January from 88.2 percent in December. The data were further evidence that the United States economy was pulling away from the European and Japanese economies.
The dollar, which hit a two-year closing record of 1.7505 German marks on Thursday, traded as high as 1.7565 marks yesterday before turning around as investors cashed in. It ended the day in New York at 1.7495 marks.
"Market participants used the industrial production numbers and market sentiment numbers as a way to essentially take profits on their gains," said David De Rosa, a director at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
 
Decline Against Yen
 The dollar continued to decline against the Japanese yen as foreign investors piled into the Tokyo stock market. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 110.98 yen, down from 111.77 yen on Thursday.
The dollar was also hurt by trader fears that Washington would start to "talk up" the value of the yen, Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said.
"The market is looking at the lack of progress in trade talks between the U.S. and Japan," he said.
Clinton Administration officials expressed concern recently when the yen softened. A weaker yen could cause America's trade deficit to expand, since it can make Japanese exports cheaper.
Meanwhile, the British pound fell in New York to $1.4934, from $1.4977 on Thursday.

Weather Gives Heating Oil Biggest Day's Gain in a Year

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Heating oil prices soared about 5 percent yesterday, the biggest one-day gain in more than a year, as the longest sustained cold spell since the mid-1980's settled over much of the continental United States.
Rises for copper and heating oil lifted the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities to a three-year high. The index, a gauge of inflation, rose about a point to settle at 228.86. 
 Weather forecasters have predicted weekend temperatures of around 0 degrees Fahrenheit in both Chicago and New York. The weather in the Northeastern states has been colder than normal since Christmas and no let-up is expected this month.
Jerry Samuels, managing director with Arb Oil in Los Angeles, said that "it's a heating-oil-dominated market" and that prices could move higher "as long as that cold weather continues."
Light sweet crude oil for February delivery gained 27 cents, to $14.78 a barrel, while heating oil jumped 2.35 cents, to 51.26 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline gained 0.66 cent, to 42.56 cents a gallon.
Natural gas prices soared 3 percent as well, to a five-week high. Gas has soared 23 percent since Dec. 21, and heating oil has leaped 16 percent since Dec. 28.
Even with the sharp rise in home heating fuels, prices remain depressed, Mr. Samuels said. A year ago, heating oil sold for about 60 cents a gallon, he said, "so there's room to go up."
 
Copper Hits 4-Month High
 In the copper market, traders bet that strong American economic growth would stimulate demand, sending future prices surging to a four-month high. Copper is used in many industrial applications and demand is thought to rise when economic activity increases.
"It's strictly speculative," said Robert Lesemann, an analyst with Resource Strategies Inc. in Exton, Pa. "Granted, the economic outlook in the U.S. is good, and demand here has been very good." Even so, he added: "It's very myopic to look at the copper market and draw conclusions based on the U.S. Demand from Japan is still very poor."
Copper for March delivery jumped 1.55 cent, to 84.50 cents, a pound on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Stockpiles have not fallen enough for the supply-demand balance to improve, Mr. Lesemann said, with world stockpiles still 600,000 tons above normal.

HEADLINE: When Devilish Details Block a Mortgage

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
Dr. Daniel Fass, a radiation oncologist with a private practice in Greenwich, Conn., and his wife, Jessica, expected to breeze through the mortgage process for their first home. After all, he had the money for a down payment, a squeaky clean credit history and a rock-solid career.
The lender sized up the situation far differently. Dr. Fass was rejected because he could not show that his practice had been profitable for at least two years, the customary requirement for someone self-employed. "It was a real Catch-22," he said, explaining that his office had been open only a year. 
 Like many first-time home buyers, the Fasses learned that anything unusual can stymie a mortgage application and that lenders have changed since the free-wheeling 80's. "The screws have definitely been tightened," said Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage tracking company in Butler, N.J. He cited as reasons the increases in both delinquency and default rates during the recession and the regulatory pressure on lenders.
First-time buyers get particular scrutiny, Mr. Havemann said, because they are notorious for fudging the facts out of fear of being rejected. And many of the people flooding into the housing market, where sales rose to a seven-and-a-half-year high in November, are first-timers, as low rates and low prices combine to make housing more affordable. This week, the average fixed rate on 30-year mortgages fell below 7 percent.
For the millions of Americans considering a home purchase this year, self-employment is just one of the potential stumbling blocks. Problems may arise over an incorrect or a tarnished credit report. Even a history of paying bills on time may be insufficient. Sometimes lenders balk at multiple credit cards, which expose the potential for future debt.
With some persistence, such obstacles can generally be surmounted. The Fasses, for example, ultimately triumphed with the help of a mortgage broker who found a more accommodating lender.
The hassle, though, could be costly. If your mortgage application is delayed, someone else may step in to buy the house you so desire. Or interest rates may rise while you smooth out problems. And if the lenders with the best rates completely reject you, you will wind up paying more.
A few simple steps can help make the most of your situation.
Among the easiest problems to detect is an error on a credit report. Margaret Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services of Manhattan, advises people to contact the three big reporting agencies -- TRW, Equifax Inc. and the Trans Union Corporation -- before they even apply for a loan. A mortgage broker can also screen your record through available data bases.
If you find an erroneous entry, you will probably have to send a letter of explanation to the bureau, which will contact the source of the problem. If a legitimate debt appears on your report, say a long-forgotten unpaid account at a department store in another city, you may want to contact the lender and set up a payment plan.
Mortgage brokers, real estate brokers and lawyers can all provide advice on how to deal with a credit problem. A credit advocate or counseling agency might be able to help. Be cautious, though; fraud has been a problem in this unregulated business. Make sure the credit counselor will do more than charge $100 for copies of your credit reports, available for no more than a nominal fee.
Steven Berman, president of Credit Advocates of Manhattan, said he would negotiate with creditors for a settlement of overdue debts, urging them to accept partial payment, at an average cost to the client of $400. To finish the job, he gets creditors to submit a clearance letter to remove the blot from credit reports.
Any delinquency on a credit report or unusual gap in employment history should be explained in a letter accompanying a mortgage application. For example, if bills fell overdue because of an illness, divorce or layoff, inform the lender and explain that payments have otherwise been timely. The same applies to a break in work because of a death in the family or some other crisis.
Of course, mortgage makers may still balk, even at apparently good credit records. Cathy Huskins and her husband, Dennis, stumbled over a problem last fall. Because they had paid a mortgage in the past and owned some property outright, they considered their record stellar.
"We owed no money," said Mrs. Huskins, who lives in Fairfield County, Conn. "We had no car loans, no debt." Yet the couple had a total of $150,000 in credit lines on about a dozen credit cards, none of which they were using. They had to cancel all but two of those cards before they could borrow $100,000.
Geri Detweiler, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer education group in Herndon, Va., said lenders used to look only at the amount of debt outstanding, but now delve deeper. "You could run up bills on all those card tomorrow," she explained, "and not be able to pay your mortgage."
Because home lenders still consider an applicant's total debt, it may be wise to postpone major purchases, like a new car, until after buying a house. In any case, home buyers will want to pay off credit cards and other debt where possible, to keep the total, including mortgage payments, under the lender's benchmark of 36 percent of gross monthly income.
A lender may be unwilling to approve a loan if it appraises a house for less than the selling price, a particular problem in the Northeast. Alternatives include renegotiating with the sellers, challenging the appraisal by showing similar valuations in the market and asking the sellers to finance the difference.
The simplest solution might be to try another lender, since appraisals vary, as well as down payments. Some lenders permit a 5 to 10 percent down payment instead of the usual 20 percent. Countrywide Funding of Pasadena, Calif., for example, makes low-down-payment loans with geographic and income restrictions, and most government-backed loan programs have relaxed requirements.
Scanning the market can be time-consuming, whether looking for a lender who will be flexible or simply finding the best rate. One way to simplify the process is to hire a mortgage broker, who receives a commission from the lender and should not add to the borrower's cost.
For Dr. Fass, Vicky Papson, a mortgage broker in Stamford, Conn., found Pawling Savings Bank in Pawling, N.Y., a small lender that specializes in helping physicians. To obtain a mortgage on a four-bedroom house from the bank, Dr. Fass reluctantly agreed to pay 25 percent in cash, instead of 20 percent. As he found, a bigger down payment may persuade lenders to overlook certain imperfections in an application.
TRW can be reached at (800) 392-1122; Equifax at (800) 879-4094 and Trans Union at (800) 851-2674. The cost of each credit report should not exceed $8. For $24, Credco Inc. will supply a comprehensive report and can be reached at (800) 443-9342.

Low Interest Rates in Credit Card Offers Are Often Just Teasers

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane 

 BODY:
The new year brings an onslaught of credit card offers -- some very enticing to consumers laden with holiday bills.
If the offers look too good to be true, make sure you read the fine print. A popular ploy is a teaser rate, a very low initial rate that may rise markedly after a short period. 
 A New York woman recently received a letter from a unit of the Banc One Corporation offering a pre-approved Visa card at an annual rate of just 5.9 percent. Only by studying the fine print on a small enclosed card did she discover that this rate would soar after her August billing period to the prime rate, now 6 percent, plus 9.9 percentage points, for a total of 15.9 percent, slightly above the national average.
"This is very confusing for consumers," said Gerri E. Detweiler, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America. "It is one of those cases where consumers have to read every word."
John W. Fisher, Banc One's marketing manager, defended the practice. "We say in several locations in the letter that it is a low introductory rate," he said.
Federal law requires all applications and solicitations for credit cards to state somewhere what the annual percentage rate is, whether it is variable and how it is determined. Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, introduced a bill last April to require additional disclosure. "I'd like to see the actual interest rate be clear as a bell to the consumer," he said.
Consolidating holiday bills on a low-rate card could make sense, especially if consumers pay off the balance before the rate rises. Issuers, of course, expect few people to cut up their cards. "I don't think any credit card issuer wants a short-term relationship," said Mr. Fisher of Banc One.

Junk Bond Group May Have Some Life Left

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
The junk bond market bottomed out in late 1989 and 1990, and then took off like a rocket, resulting in 20 percent-plus annual gains for many of the top junk funds over the last three years.
Those big returns are not likely to continue, analysts say. Still, the category may have some life left. 
 For one thing, junk bonds are less sensitive to interest rates than long-term Government issues. Therefore, any rise in rates would be less painful for junk-bond holders. Also, junk bonds stand to benefit from any improvement in the economy. That's because the issuers of the bonds would grow more creditworthy.
But don't overlook the risks, said Erik Laughlin, an analyst with Morningstar Inc., the mutual fund rating company in Chicago. The American economy might slip back into recession, he said, or the bond market might correct.
Low interest rates may also have lured smaller issuers to the junk bond market -- with riskier issues. Finally, "there's been such a huge issuance that if demand dries up, there can be an oversupply and a drop in price," Mr. Laughlin said.

HEADLINE: Jim Florio's Good Governance

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio did the right thing, and that is why his time is up. Christine Todd Whitman succeeds him as New Jersey's chief executive on Tuesday, in large part because of the huge hike in taxes enacted in his first 100 days. It was a necessary move, but many voters regarded it as a betrayal. It set off a tax revolt that propelled the Republicans in 1992 to control of the Legislature, and now Mrs. Whitman to the governor's mansion.
If Jim Florio failed on that count, he succeeded on gun control. In the same burst of activity that saw reluctant Democratic legislators approve his tax bill, he put through a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. New Jersey was first to do so; Governor Florio dared take on the powerful lobbyists of the National Rifle Association. Indeed, he beat them twice, on the original legislation in 1991 and again last year when he stood down the now-Republican Legislature's attempt at repeal. 
 In the battle over guns, he had the public on his side; in the battle over taxes, just the opposite. Campaigning in 1989 against a no-new-taxes Republican, he implied a pledge of his own -- "I see no need to raise taxes." On taking office, the need was all too clear -- to close a yawning budget gap, to ease the burden of property taxes and to comply with a court order to increase aid for urban schools. But when he moved to raise income and sales taxes by $2.8 billion, virtually without warning, and without building a consensus, public reaction was angry and demonstrative.
In the fall of 1990 Mrs. Whitman nearly unseated Senator Bill Bradley by hounding him for taking no stand on the Florio taxes, and a year later the voters installed veto-proof Republican majorities in both houses of the Legislature. Mr. Florio, chastened, became less daring.
Nonetheless, he built a record of using government constructively. He attacked pollution on the state's long oceanfront beaches, vital for attracting vacationers and for New Jersey's economy. He overhauled the automobile insurance system, which had been a key issue in his election campaign. He put more money into helping people on welfare with job training, education and day care, but cracked down on women who bore more children while collecting welfare payments.
Jim Florio entered public service as a State Assemblyman in 1969. He went to Washington with the Watergate class of 1974, and spent 15 years in the House. His election as Governor in 1989 was a landslide, his defeat last year a 26,000-vote squeaker. In those 25 years, he earned the respect of his state and the nation as a politician with backbone.

HEADLINE: Helping Russia -- and Ourselves

 BODY:
Why should the United States spend $3 billion this year to help revive Russia's crumbling economy? The answer: Containing the fractious, militaristic Russia that might emerge from total economic collapse could cost 10 times that much every year. With Russia stabilized and tranquil, America could substantially reduce the defense budget and plow the savings into reclaiming our cities, revitalizing our failed education system and preparing for the challenges of the next century.
Only now is Bill Clinton wresting the problem from the International Monetary Fund and speeding the aid the U.S. has already pledged. By taking the initiative, he shows he understands how much Americans have to lose from further delay. 
 Mr. Clinton needs to sell Americans on the dividend that will flow from the Russian rescue, and suggest how that dividend will be spent. At the same time he needs to acknowledge that it may already be too late to save Russian reform but that, even so, he has no choice but to proceed.
America has pledged its share of aid to Russia, but it has yet to deliver many dollars. It cannot let the opportunity slip away once more. The aid must be delivered even before Russia tightens its budget by shrinking subsidies to unproductive factories. Russia's reformers face a real dilemma. To bring the budget under control they have to put people out of work -- and worse.
The factory for most Russians means more than a job; it is their social safety net. It feeds and houses them. And it keeps paying them even if they aren't producing anything -- a form of unemployment insurance. The recent election results signal a resurgence of nationalism. But even scarier forces could be unleashed by closing down the factories and leaving millions destitute.
That's why Russia needs a new social safety net not tied to the factory. To get one started, it needs outside help.
Mr. Clinton and other Western leaders need to make good on their aid pledges now. And they need to persuade taxpayers to put up money for Russia's unemployed when their own people are experiencing many times Russia's unemployment rate.
Mr. Clinton himself summoned up the reasons in a town hall meeting in Moscow yesterday.
"It is in our interest," he told the Russians, "to be able to spend less on defense and to invest more in our own people, in the education and health and welfare and technology that will help to carry us into a better time in the 21st century. It is in our interest to curb the spread of weapons of mass destruction and to cooperate with you in reducing threats to peace all around the world. It is in our interest to develop new trade ties and new customers. And each of these developments is more likely if we have a genuine equal partnership with a strong and free Russia."
Now Mr. Clinton needs to say that to Americans. It takes the courage to change, as he once put it. That's true, and not only for Russians.

The Smoke Bomb

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN 

 BODY:
Thirty years ago this week, the first Surgeon General's report linking cigarette smoking to cancer was released in Washington. The press conference was held on a Saturday, lest the news cause a panic on Wall Street.
Ever since, the relationship between commerce, health and cigarettes has been a touchy and a two-faced one. On the one hand the government facilitates the sale and use of tobacco through farm programs and trade negotiations. On the other it decries its use through scientific papers and public education. 
 Under current Food and Drug Administration regulations, cigarettes would not be accepted for marketing if they were introduced today. But cigarettes have never been classified as either food or drug, which would require them to be safe and effective; they're classified as a "device of pleasure." Tobacco has always had friends in high places.
Yet despite the best efforts of elected officials amply compensated in campaign contributions and well-connected lobbyists amply compensated in fees, the tobacco industry has not succeeded in maintaining its standing in the United States. Where about 42 percent of all Americans smoked at the time of the Surgeon General's first report, now the number is down to about 25 percent. Once Americans got wise to the health consequences of smoking, there was only one thing left for the industry to do: Kill 'em abroad.
Philip Morris has acquired a controlling interest in what was once the state-owned Czech tobacco company. In Russia, it is building a factory in St. Petersburg and has agreed to assume a 49 percent stake and eventually the majority interest in a plant in Krasnodar, south of Moscow. In that factory, the company hopes to double cigarette production within three years.
This summer Philip Morris announced that it had reached an agreement with the China National Tobacco Corporation to produce and sell Marlboros and other brands in China. American trade negotiations in recent years have also made it possible for American tobacco companies to compete with home-grown competitors in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.
An oncologist in Tokyo said several years ago that he was constantly asked the same question: "Why are Americans trying to encourage Japanese to smoke?"
For the money, of course. The social and moral responsibilities of big business make for interesting debate, but any such discussion comes to naught with tobacco companies, who still deny the health risks of the product and insist they are merely playing suppliers to consumers' demand.
The truth is that tobacco companies have always created new demand for cigarettes by targeted advertising and sponsorship of sports and concert events. In China, for example, more than half of all men smoke but few women do. And if you believe disclaimers by the cigarette companies that they will not target those women, I've got a couple of Virginia Slims ads you can hang on your bulletin board.
In many of the same nations in which America provides aid or expertise to improve health care, American tobacco companies are moving in to, in essence, increase mortality. "The transnational tobacco companies exploit our countries' desperate need for immediate economic investment," public health officials from former Soviet bloc nations wrote to President Clinton. "But in so doing they damage our health and ruin our longer-term economic well-being."
For years they've been doing the same here: create jobs, kill workers. For three decades, the tobacco interests have had to hone their rationales, first here, now abroad. When you are pursuing the moral equivalent of selling asbestos handkerchiefs to foreign neighbors, you have to have a slick rap to go with it. Or not so slick. When he was questioned by lawyers in a class action suit last year, Bennett S. Le Bow, a New York investor whose holdings include the Liggett Group, a tobacco company, said he neither knew nor cared to know whether cigarettes cause cancer. "I'm a businessman," he said.
The truth about tobacco came out 30 years ago, in a State Department auditorium in Washington D.C. The cold war was still in full flower. Certainly no one could have imagined that the way we would find to eliminate the Russians and the Chinese would be, three decades later, to sell them cigarettes. And all in the name of progress. Cancer and capitalism -- what a pair.

HEADLINE: New York City's Taxes Drive the Tourists Away

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The New York tourist industry is keeping its fingers crossed that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo makes good on his promise to cut the special occupancy tax on hotel rooms that cost more than $100.
New York has a 21.25 percent total levy on hotel rooms, the highest in the country. Our tax tacks $23.75 onto the average New York City hotel room, compared with $11.36 in Chicago and $10.48 in Washington. 
 But the hotel and convention trades hardly suffer alone. Travelers also ride subways, eat in restaurants, shop in stores and go to the theater. According to the New York City Comptroller, the surtax drains $1.5 billion a year from the local economy.
Clearly, the plan to reel in new visitors has backfired big time, with the state losing, rather than gaining from the tax.
Last year the tax generated $64 million for the state, but lost $94.4 million in other tax revenues because tourists stayed away, according to the Hotel Association of New York City and the New York State Hospitality and Tourism Association.
By 1996, they predict, the tax will lose the state nearly $1 billion -- twice as much as it will generate.
We are completing a $5 million conversion from apartment building to hotel that began with the faith that New York still wants visitors from all around the globe. Thus, the Governor needs to seize the opportunity to show Albany -- and the world -- that New York means business. Otherwise, the city in particular will continue to pay the price of being far and away the most heavily taxed destination in the country.

Your Share Is $500

 BODY:
What good is that trade agreement signed by 117 nations in Geneva last month? According to Gary Hufbauer and Kimberly Elliott of the Institute for International Economics, it will save the typical American family $500 a year.
The two researchers estimated that existing tariffs and other barriers to foreign-made goods jack up prices in the United States by about $1,000 for the typical family. The trade agreement, when instituted, will cut that cost in half by opening up markets to low-cost imports. Even better, the poorest American families will reap the biggest dividends; the prices of goods they buy the most -- clothing, dairy products and other foods -- will tumble the furthest. 
Whatever benefit actually emerges, there will be a downside. Most consumer benefits come from imports of clothing and other low-priced goods that will displace about 200,000 American jobs over 10 years -- a period during which 20 million other American workers are also expected to lose work temporarily. But because the workers in apparel and the other vulnerable industries are low-paid, they are not likely to suffer large wage losses when they find new jobs. The nation's task is now to make certain the workers dislocated by imports get plenty of help so that they too can win.

On Russian TV, Clinton Backs Reforms

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 14

 BODY:
President Clinton plunged into a nationally televised "town meeting" today to urge Russians to stay the course toward a free market and democracy and to find a "new definition of Russia's greatness."
Clearly stimulated by candid and provoking questions from a live, youthful audience at the Ostankino television center in Moscow and similar groups linked by television from other cities, Mr. Clinton was alternatively professor, politician and preacher as he counseled Russians to "choose the future." 
 "I come here as a friend and supporter of the democratic changes going on in this nation," he said. "I hope that my nation and I can make a positive contribution, in the spirit of genuine and equal partnership. In the end, you will have to decide your own future. I do not presume to do that."
 
Supporting Yeltsin
 The telecast was the first such extemporaneous appearance by an American President in Moscow, and it offered Mr. Clinton a nationwide audience for the central theme of his visit -- to declare America's support for Russia's embattled reforms and struggling President, Boris N. Yeltsin. President Reagan, during a trip to Moscow in 1988, also got considerable attention from a speech to students and faculty at Moscow State University.
If any reminders of the Russian struggle were needed, the opening days of the new Parliament provided a constant drumbeat. Today, while the Presidents were meeting in the grand halls of the Kremlin, the new lower house of Parliament elected a devoted Communist as its Speaker, while the demagogic nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky was the center of another furor, this time when he was punched in the face by another deputy, who resented Mr. Zhirinovsky's demanding and being given preferential treatment at the Parliament canteen.
 
Accord With Ukraine
 The main agreements that emerged from the summit meeting dealt largely with the troublesome arsenals left over from the cold war.
The major bonus of Mr. Clinton's journey was realized at the start of the day when President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine joined Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin to sign a statement in which Ukraine agreed to turn its strategic nuclear warheads over to Russia for dismantling in exchange for security assurances and compensation in the form of nuclear fuel.
All three Presidents hailed the "trilateral statement" as a break in what a senior Administration official described as Ukraine's "stall mode."
 
Parliament Dragged Its Feet
 Though Mr. Kravchuk has signed agreements at least twice in the past to surrender the weapons, which are blocking the carrying out of major disarmament treaties between the United States and Russia, the Ukrainian Parliament has dragged its feet on ratifying the pacts, convinced that without the missiles Ukraine would become irrelevant to the West and vulnerable to Russia.
There was still no certainty that the Ukrainian Parliament would be any less stubborn than in the past. But parliamentary elections are scheduled for March 27, and Mr. Kravchuk may have calculated that new deputies might be more amenable to approving the agreements, especially after so public an endorsement.
The statement specifically called on Ukraine to turn over the warheads on its most modern and deadly weapons -- 46 SS-24 missiles, each with 10 warheads -- within 10 months. In exchange, Ukraine would receive immediate compensation in the form of nuclear fuel for its nuclear power plants.
In a related agreement, the United States agreed to buy 500 tons of highly enriched uranium extracted from former Soviet missiles over the next 20 years. At current prices, 500 tons is worth about $12 billion and amounts to the world demand for three years. A Russian official said it represents about 20,000 warheads.
 
No Mutual Targeting
 A third agreement dealing with the leftover arsenal of the cold war was a pledge by the American and Russian Presidents that by May 30 none of their strategic nuclear weapons would be targeted at each other, or for that matter at any other country.
Officials agreed that the measure was more symbolic than practical, since it carried no verification procedures, and since most missiles can be rapidly retargeted in any case.
Before today's agreement, Mr. Yeltsin had declared that no Russian missiles were targeted at American cities. But following his statement Russian arms control specialists said that there had been no change in Russian targeting and that missiles were still aimed at a variety of United States targets.
A central political issue of the summit meeting was the clamor by some East European and Baltic states to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an idea that riles Russia. Mr. Clinton's solution has been to invite allEast European and former Soviet nations to join in a vague "Partnership for Peace." Mr. Yeltsin heartily embraced the proposal.
"I think that the initiative of President Bill Clinton and also of some Europeans not to accept countries into NATO on a case-by-case basis, but to proclaim all of them to be partners in maintaining peace and security is a good formula," he said at a joint news conference, "because drawing one more line, dividing all into white and black anew, no, this won't do."
In contrast to past summit meetings, this one was not about aid. The only new assistance Mr. Clinton spoke of, in addition to what he had promised at the Vancouver summit meeting last April, was a request for $900 million in additional aid in the 1995 budget.
Mr. Yeltsin had no complaints about the American stance. "We believe that, unlike in the case of Vancouver, we will not count on the humanitarian sphere and direct social assistance," he said. "This is our business."
Americans, he said, needed social support themselves. "It would be absurd to help resolve the unemployment problem in Russia while neglecting the employment situation in one's own country," Mr. Yeltsin said.
Mr. Yeltsin was more critical of the Group of Seven, the major industrial countries, which pledged $2.5 billion in aid in April. "A decision has been passed and its implementation has been minimal," he said.
 
No Retreat on Reform
 As for Russia's own course, Mr. Yeltsin declared that there would be no retreat from economic reform. "As regards reforms," he said, "we will be resolute and radical."
Though Mr. Zhirinovsky was never mentioned directly by either President, his large showing in the December election cast a constant shadow over the summit meeting.
"It's nice to be in a place where some other president is having trouble with his Parliament instead of me," Mr. Clinton quipped.
But he continued with some stern words of advice to the new Russian deputies: "You are the product of the first genuinely democratic and constitutionally provided Parliament in the history of your country, and you ought to be willing to listen and learn and grow and deal with the issues."
Several other agreements announced during the summit meeting included joint statements on controlling the spread of nuclear weapons, on human rights and on the Middle East.
Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged some differences in discussions, evidently on the question of Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia and Latvia, and over policy toward Bosnia.
But with Russia in political and economic turmoil, this was not a summit meeting for major foreign-policy or disarmament initiatives. It was to show that the United States still stood firmly behind Mr. Yeltsin and reform.
"Throughout our discussions, I reaffirmed the strong support of the United States for Russia's commitment to democracy and transition to a market economy," Mr. Clinton said at a news conference.
Later, at the "town meeting," the American President was asked whether he did not identify Russian reform too closely with the person of Mr. Yeltsin."Do I intend to work with President Yeltsin as long as he embodies Russian democracy and as long as he is the choice of the majority of the people of Russia to be the President?" Mr. Clinton replied. "Of course."
 
'No Other President'
 "There is no other President," he continued. "There may be some people in Russia who wish someone else was President of the United States, but I am the only U.S. President you have right now. That's not the same thing as saying that I'm all there is to American democracy. I am not."
Students sat transfixed as Mr. Clinton wandered among them, picking questioners himself, bantering with them and introducing his wife, Hillary, who arrived in Moscow on Friday.
The session was televised live at 3:30 P.M. Moscow time. It was to be repeated Saturday afternoon, and parts of it were shown on evening news programs.
The format was a familiar one for Mr. Clinton, and one in which he clearly felt at ease, especially after a few questions in English.
 
Only One Saxophone Play
 What would he like historians to say of him? ("I would like them to say I restored a sense of hope and optimism to my country.") Would he play the saxophone? ("No, I played for President Yeltsin last night. I have a quota, one saxophone play per country.") Would he change places with Mr. Yeltsin? ("No, I like the job I have.")
A 13-year-old boy, Aleksandr Fyodorov, recalling a picture of Mr. Clinton shaking hands with President Kennedy, asked how old Mr. Clinton was when he "got the idea to become the President of the United States."
Mr. Clinton called the boy to him: "Come up here. Come shake hands with me, and maybe you'll be President of Russia someday."
But the core of Mr. Clinton's message was an earnest plea to the Russians not to lose faith.
"Let me say that I think this has been in some ways the most difficult period of all for you because you have taken a lot of risks, you have made a lot of changes already, and yet the changes have not been felt tangibly in the lives of most ordinary citizens in the country," he said.
"But I can say that just as an outside observer, it seems to me that it is likely that you will begin to see those changes. People will come to see that there is a light at the end of this long tunnel."
Mr. Clinton's day ended with an official dinner of caviar, salmon and cabbage soup in the Kremlin. The Clintons will then spend the night in the Kremlin, a tribute extended only to one other American President, Richard M. Nixon.

FACING UP
How to Rescue the Economy From Crushing Debt
and Restore the American Dream.
By Peter G. Peterson.
Foreword by Warren B. Rudman and Paul E. Tsongas.
Illustrated. 411 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $22. 
PETER G. PETERSON, who was Secretary of Commerce in the Nixon Administration and is now an investment banker on Wall Street, argues that the country is sinking in a sea of red ink formed over many years in which the Government spent too much and collected too little in taxes. Unless a rescue operation is mounted, he maintains, little will be left for the next generations and the American dream will be lost.
If the argument of "Facing Up" sounds familiar, that's because it is. So much has been written about the Federal budget deficit -- including much by Mr. Peterson -- that the prospect of reading still more on the subject may seem no more enticing than reading the multiplication tables.
But don't fall asleep yet. This book is worth reading, studying even, because in remarkably clear prose Mr. Peterson takes the decidedly unfamiliar step of describing just how painful rescue would be. It is the political equivalent of saying the emperor has no clothes.
In fact, with this treatise Mr. Peterson has set a bench mark against which the debate over lowering the Federal budget deficit will be measured for years to come. No longer will it be sufficient to suggest, as politicians and commentators have done for years, that the budget can be balanced by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, or by approving a constitutional amendment, or by placing higher taxes only on the rich, or by setting a cap on Government benefits, or by cracking down on welfare cheats, or by taking any other short cut that avoids the potholes of specifics.
"Facing Up" does not mince words:
"Most Americans -- emphatically including the middle class -- will have to give something up," Mr. Peterson writes in what amounts to the book's topic sentence.
"If one group (the nonpoor elderly) bears a somewhat disproportionate share of the sacrifice in my plan, it's because they now receive a vastly disproportionate share of our public largess," he writes at another point.
"In the end, there will be no way around the 'R' word -- rationing," he asserts. "As much as we like to think that health care is somehow different, here, just as in every other area of our lives, trade-offs are inevitable."
He would subject Federal benefits, including Social Security, to an "affluence test." The higher one's income, the more benefits would be slashed. Only retirees with incomes below $35,000 would be spared. He would also raise the Social Security retirement age to 68 from 65, substantially increase the out-of-pocket share of medical expenses the elderly pay under Medicare and require income taxes to be paid on a portion of Medicare benefits. Otherwise, his health care proposals follow more or less along the lines President Clinton has recommended, but Mr. Peterson would also place an absolute ceiling on how much the Government could spend each year on health programs.
Mr. Peterson does not shy away from steep new taxes. He would impose a 50-cents-a-gallon increase in the tax on gasoline and a 5 percent national tax on retail sales, and limit the tax deductibility of mortgage interest and employer-paid health insurance premiums.
He reports what all this would cost the average family -- read voters -- in various income categories in terms of lower benefits and higher taxes: $231 a year for families with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000; $1,817 for those with incomes between $30,000 and $40,000; $5,608 for those with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000; $23,294 for the average family with an income over $200,000.
The author believes the country and its political representatives are ready for such bitter medicine. Nothing that has happened so far suggests he is right about that. After all, President Clinton's budget barely passed Congress last year, and he avoided the sacred cows Mr. Peterson wants to slay.
Maybe Mr. Peterson is also wrong, although he makes a persuasive case, in his belief that only balancing the budget will enable today's children to match their parents' living standard. Or maybe it does not matter how the children fare. But he is definitely right about this: If politicians persist in saying that controlling the deficit is important, then they must cease practicing what he calls "the politics of denial."
The "have-it-all hubris" that has dominated politics for a generation, Mr. Peterson correctly holds, has left Americans "boxed into a corner from which there are no pleasant exits."
From now on, everyone proposing a solution to the budget problem will be subject to this test: If you don't like one aspect or another of the Peterson plan, then what particular spending cut or tax increase do you suggest in its place?

Prettification Patrol

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
Let's say you're trying to peddle some fake flowers. Do you call yourself a fake-flower peddler? Of course not; you're a floral marketer, artificial-flower division.
Now you look at your product -- sometimes quite beautiful, petals made of silk or whatever -- and you ask yourself, "Why artificial?" That's a word that turns buyers off. You brood about that, and come up with a fresh-as-a-daisy answer: you'll create a market for permanent flowers. That not only lends longevity to your produce, but it also knocks the noxious weeds turned out in hothouses and pesticide-ridden, inorganic, fertilizer-driven gardens as temporary flowers. 
 That's the art, or racket, of euphemism, from the Greek eu-, "good," and pheme, "speech." And it's been gaining speed ever since environmentalists were able to transform the damn jungle into the glorious rain forest (where you can get wetlands fever).
Some objects of green wrath, lumbermen and fishermen, counterattacked with euphemisms of their own. "The timber industry speaks of harvesting trees on public lands, the fishing industry of harvesting fish from the ocean," grumps Ray Sawhill of New York. "My understanding is that in order to harvest you have to have first reaped." Maybe he means sown; at any rate, if you have planted the trees, or raised the fish from caviar, you could then harvest them, although "harvest" is not a term that goes well outside the vegetable world. Thus, I would not use the headline, as The New York Times did last summer, "Giant Maw for Fish Harvesting."
No newspaper can be held responsible, however, for the prose prettification in its advertising. If you're appealing to a snooty clientele, you hate to use the word sale; nice stores don't have sales. (In France, sale is a dirty word.) If it's cheap but it hasn't been marked down yet, call it a special purchase. Or, if you're the Artium Gallery on Fifth Avenue, "Join us for our current anniversary exhibition of master jewelers and receive a 10 percent accommodation." Hotels provide accommodations; what will they now call a lowering of rates on rooms?
Even the most innocent words, when they take on a taint, are quickly euphemized. The Miss America contest, eager to shed any hint of royalism, now forbids the use of reign to denote the period in which here-she-comes holds the title; her once-reign is now "a year of service."
No longer need Shakespeare's Edmund, in "King Lear," cry, "Now, gods, stand up for bastards!" As Ben J. Wattenberg has written of those born on the wrong side of the blanket: "It was once called bastardy. Then illegitimacy. Then out-of-wedlock birth. And now, frequently, wholly sanitized, nonmarital birth." (He left out love child.)
"Do you do euphemisms?" writes Ben Bradlee, The Washington Post's vice president at-large. (In my view, the hyphen makes the words mean "not confined to a specific assignment"; without the hyphen, it would mean "sought after by the police.") He cited a broadcast by Peter Jennings of ABC when Yasir Arafat's plane was missing: "if something has befallen him in a terminal way. . . ."
Because the word lying is off-putting to some, we have seen some prettification under oath. Oliver North denied lying to Congress, but admitted he had "provided input which differed radically from the truth." And Roger Le Locataire notes from Ponders End, London, that British officials caught telling half-truths or otherwise deceiving the court admit they have been economical with the truth.
In the general derogation of politically correct terms, some euphemism has been parodied: nobody seriously uses vertically challenged for "short," or holds that a bad speller is orthographically impaired; Clyde Haberman of The New York Times was writing tongue-in-cheek when he described a rotund Turkish political figure as kilogramically endowed. But some writers have rejected prostitute for the less pejorative "sexual worker," and the person in charge of waste disposal (formerly garbage) for the township of Montclair, N.J., refers to herself as "Senior Sanitarian."
In politics, the Clinton Administration has made it linguistic policy to refer to the taxes necessitated by its health plan as premiums, which most people associate with insurance policies. Others say that if the payment is mandatory, it's a tax, which has become a political dirty word.
Almost as dirty as guns. When Richard Nixon came out with "Guns are an abomination," advocates for unrestricted sale of the things that shoot bullets searched for a euphemism. A reader of a Minneapolis city magazine, Mpls. St. Paul, wrote to the editor to assert that "thousands have saved themselves, contrary to the myth of the danger of a home-protection weapon." Jason Zweig of Forbes magazine objects to this euphemism: "I don't think it can transform a gun into a mom-and-apple-pie product. You can call a bullet a criminal-impairment projectile, but that will never blind the mind's eye to the ferocious furrowing of metal through flesh and bone." (Mr. Zweig, an old-school Hyphen Harry, agrees, however, with the letter-writer's use of the hyphen in home-protection weapon.)
We cannot leave today's subject without a look at dysphemism, defined in the Random House Unabridged, revised second edition, as "the substitution of a harsh, disparaging or unpleasant expression for a more neutral one." It turns euphemism on its head.
When Dick Gregory titled a book "Nigger," he bit down hard on a painful slur, turning it to his advantage. In the same way, the word queer -- like queen and fairy, long used as a derogation -- is being stolen by homosexuals for their own use.
"The vivid representation of identity," Edmund White said in a speech to the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies in New York, "is especially important for the queer community." As reprinted in The New York Times, the word seemed shocking until Mr. White repeated it: "Until recently, there were few openly queer films or publications."
Is gay passe? If queer is now acceptable, its etymology deserves a look: Hugh Rawson's "Devious Derivations" tracks Queer Street, a condition of financial impecunity, to the 1811 edition of Grose's Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, meaning "Wrong. Improper." Before that, the word queer -- perhaps rooted in the Greek for "oblique, off-center" -- was used by pickpockets and con men to mean "out of order," as in "queer as Dick's hatband." Until recently, bent was the term many homosexuals preferred as the antonym to straight, but the new usage has queered it.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
At 70, an Enfant Terrible As Elder . . . Statesman?

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: NANTUCKET, Mass.

 BODY:
AS STATESMEN, THE ELDERS OF American composition have proved an uneven lot in recent decades, often showing little care for social grace and tact. Although William Schuman was a suave administrator and diplomat, and Aaron Copland projected a sweet public persona, Virgil Thomson, Leonard Bernstein and John Cage could be brash and unruly. And David Diamond remains as waspish as Elliott Carter and Milton Babbitt are amiable.
Now Ned Rorem, the once and future enfant terrible of American music, has turned 70. He does not act it, and certainly does not look it, his ruddy, boyish face still uncreased. Nor, he insists, does he see himself as a grand old man. But he has mellowed with age. He gently boasts that after decades of flaunted philandering and conspicuous indulgence, he has lived monogamously with James Holmes, an organist and choir director in New York, for 27 years; that he has not touched cigarettes or alcohol for 23 years; that he never uses "naughty words" (well, hardly ever). 
 "I don't have much of a social life," Mr. Rorem said a few days ago, after helping Mr. Holmes serve a holiday dinner to five guests here at his second home. "This is about the extent of it. I hate parties." Yet he refers to "the bad Ned" of yore with obvious affection, and like Edith Piaf, he professes to regret nothing.
"One thing about being 70," he said, "whatever I am now, there it is, for better or worse. I have made a statement. I feel that I've earned the right to do what I've always done anyway. I feel I'm due a certain respect." But as ever with Mr. Rorem, vulnerability lurks close beneath the bold surface. "That comes from an inferiority complex," he added, "and I feel very guilty for saying it."
Another thing about turning 70, it is a wonderful excuse for a party . . . er, celebration. The perennial flurry of Rorem performances intensified shortly before the landmark birthday, last October, and has yet to subside. On Wednesday, Mr. Rorem, as pianist, will accompany the soprano Angelina Reaux in his song cycle "Women's Voices" and in the New York premiere of his seven-minute opera "Anna la Bonne" at the Kaye Playhouse on the Upper East Side. Next Sunday, the New York Festival of Song presents a Rorem tribute at the Greenwich House Music School in lower Manhattan. And on Jan. 27, the New York Philharmonic will give the premiere of his English-Horn Concerto, with Thomas Stacy as soloist and Kurt Masur conducting.
As usual, Mr. Rorem's songs, considered by many the cream of his output if not of recent American song as a whole, get the most attention. But his choral works are being presented weekly through the spring at St. Thomas Church in Manhattan, and Robert Shaw, the dean of American choral specialists, intends to offer an overview of Mr. Rorem's choral music next season in Atlanta. "He's about the most significant American song writer of the last half-century," Mr. Shaw said, "and the most significant choral writer, too."
Mr. Rorem has always been more than a composer, notably an essayist of uncommon wit, style and candor, and the anniversary finds him immersed in reminiscence and introspection. While still composing at full tilt (six sizable projects are in the works), he recently completed his memoirs, "Knowing When to Stop," scheduled for publication next fall by Simon & Schuster. The 735-page typescript, parts of which have already been printed and a copy of which was supplied by the publisher, awaits editing and trimming; with characteristic self-mockery, Mr. Rorem frets that the title, full of personal meanings, may be turned against the very thickness of the tome.
The memoirs draw freely on Mr. Rorem's copious earlier writings, both published and unpublished, especially his extensive diaries, infamous for their telling of tales out of bed and closet. His conversation, in turn, draws heavily on the memoirs. Familiar themes from Rorem lore come couched in familiar phrases, seemingly -- often demonstrably -- honed long ago. Whether in a professional or in a social setting, Mr. Rorem speaks carefully, closely weighing the effect of his words.
Effect, he argues, is everything. In a recent public forum, he said that although he has written a lot of "Goddy music," as he puts it, he does not believe in God; he believes in belief. "I said that largely for effect," he now explained. "But it also happens to be true. I say something for effect, but I also believe it.
"Music is for effect, too. Anyone can express himself. The important thing is whittling it down. The mere fact of whittling is for effect. Everything is for effect." Effect, in his world view, is French, perhaps, while plodding truth and conviction are German.
"I very early understood that the universe is divided between two esthetics: French and German," he begins his memoirs, elaborating on a recurrent theme in his writing and conversation. "Everything -- is either French or German. . . . Cats are French, dogs are German. Night is French, day is German. Women are French, men are German. . . . Gay is French, straight is German (unless it's the other way around). Schubert is French, Berlioz is German. Generalities are French, specifics are German."
Is it necessary to add that Mr. Rorem himself is French? "Contrary to what everyone says," he insisted, "I was Frenchified before I went to France." No matter that he was born in Richmond, Ind., and raised in Chicago. His father, C. Rufus Rorem, was an economist who helped found Blue Cross and Blue Shield. He died in 1988, at 93, shortly after the death of his wife, Gladys.
"I look in the mirror and see my father," Mr. Rorem said. "I have the same genes," he added, seeming to invoke longevity while explaining his own youthful appearance.
Both parents converted to the Quaker faith. Mr. Rorem, who lives with Mr. Holmes in an apartment near Lincoln Center, now attends only an occasional meeting of the Society of Friends, he said, but he calls himself "a good Quaker" and espouses pacifism. He has devoted several works to that theme, including "Swords and Plowshares," written for the Boston Symphony in 1990. (Having promised to play a tape of the Boston performance for a visitor, Mr. Rorem reneged, with typical self-deprecation: "I'm afraid it would be too painful for me to sit here watching you hate the piece.") He argues repeatedly, in conversation and in the memoirs, that gay-rights groups should seek to abolish the military, not to achieve fuller representation in it.
Mr. Rorem's musical talents developed precociously, somewhat in spite of stolid instruction, in Chicago, at Northwestern University, at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and at the Juilliard School. But his good looks (he was often called "pretty" in those years) and personal charm were no less crucial in thrusting him, in his 20's, into heady artistic company, hobnobbing with the likes of Thomson, Copland, Bernstein, Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, Paul Bowles and Marc Blitzstein, to list only composers.
He settled in Paris in 1952, developed formative relationships with Francis Poulenc and Jean Cocteau and spent periods in Morocco. In 1958, he returned to New York, where he has mostly lived since. He bought the home in Nantucket 18 years ago.
FROM HIS YOUTH, MR. ROREM composed in a refined, lyrical style, following his own Romantic bent even as tonality dropped out of fashion after World War II. As a composer, he was anything but an enfant terrible, and the real enfant terrible, Pierre Boulez, remains a symbol to him of an international musical establishment that treated him with malign neglect. "Boulez is a very intelligent person and a very imperious bastard," Mr. Rorem said. "I could have been a 12-tone composer, but I wasn't interested. It was poignant to see Copland and Stravinsky trying to please Boulez."
Despite -- or because of -- his independence, Mr. Rorem has always found performers eager to take on his music, and he has made his living almost entirely as a composer and writer, with little help from teaching stints. (He teaches at Curtis now and will begin at the Manhattan School of Music next fall.)
In the mid-60's the literary Rorem came loudly to the fore, with publication of the diaries from Paris and New York. Written with an incisive flair, these revealing and provocative volumes sent shock waves through the wide circle of Mr. Rorem's acquaintances and beyond.
Mr. Rorem says that the "Paris Diary," the first to appear, in 1966, was published at the insistence of the Braziller publishing house, "in spite of me."
"I don't like to hurt anyone's feelings, ever," he insisted. "I'm not a bitch. I'm not mean." And all of this seemed plausible as he spoke in his endearing manner. But how could anyone so conscious of effect not have known what pain his diaries might cause? As friends point out, Mr. Rorem likes to play the innocent, relying on his endless charm to get him out of scrapes, trusting that everyone will forgive him in the end; it usually works.
"I started writing more responsible prose when I knew strangers would read it," Mr. Rorem said. Yet even now, he pulls no punches. Consider this grand declaration from the memoirs:
"I can't sleep with famous people. Or for that matter with rich people, or people in power, used to being the center of attention. I have been in bed with four Time covers -- Lenny Bernstein, Tennessee Williams, Noel Coward and John Cheever (included among 3,000 proportionately anonymous souls, including one woman) -- and I performed out of a combination of duress and politeness. However, I grow uncomfortable when in other people's memoirs I read this sort of thing (maybe this will be excised when the time comes), especially when embellished by the writer's smug sense of charisma, boasting how he wouldn't put out for some star."
No, nothing will be excised when the time comes: effect, remember? Mr. Rorem's tally of sexual partners, murmured modestly in parentheses, falls far short of Wilt Chamberlain's but exceeds Don Giovanni's. Most of these dalliances took place before AIDS found its way into this country -- and before Mr. Rorem turned 45. How did he find time to compose so much?
Compose he did, following his own conservative path: symphonies and tone poems, piano and chamber works, songs and choral music. The songs drew the most attention, partly for their sheer excellence, partly because talented singers routinely sought out songs at the time, and few Americans were producing them. Supply has since outstripped declining demand.
"I used to be called America's No. 1 song composer because I was the only song composer," Mr. Rorem said with needless modesty. "Now nobody has commissioned me to write songs since Phyllis Bryn-Julson did in 1979. I don't want this to sound bitter. I should say wistful, not bitter."
Meanwhile, Mr. Rorem's star has risen in other areas of repertory, with the resurgence of Romanticism and tonality in American composition. As atonalists retrenched around him, Mr. Rorem quietly moved ahead, suddenly finding himself back in the mainstream. Sounding wistful again, he refers to himself as "the prodigal son's brother," unnoticed for having been in the right place all the time.
"He has always trod the kind of tonal path he began on as a kind of test of moral character," said David Del Tredici, one of the actual prodigal sons. Mr. Del Tredici cited Mr. Rorem as a model particularly for gay composers like himself: "He showed how to make an art of your gayness, using texts of Whitman and the like."
Again, Mr. Rorem takes a less exalted view of his accomplishment. "When I was out of fashion, it was like those cases in which parents are told by a psychiatrist that they molested their child," he said. "I thought maybe I was wrong, but the feeling was never strong enough that I wanted to give up. I'm an honest composer not because I'm a model human being but because I'm too lazy to be a whore, to jump on every bandwagon."
Lazy? Between the early diaries and the memoirs, along with his usual heavy regimen of composition, Mr. Rorem produced another 10 volumes of essays and other writings, as remarkable for their craft and prolificity as the music. "He is one of the best writers about music that I have ever read," said Stephen Sondheim, "and that is no easy thing to do."
THE MAGNITUDE OF MR. Rorem's output has at least become a bit more comprehensible now that he has shed some of the distractions. "My life was messy for a long time, but I've become very orderly about my work," he said. "I have a proprietary feeling." He spends most of his time at home, composing and writing, dealing with the outside world largely by telephone and letter. (In his current mania for order, he has filed 30,000 items of correspondence.)
Mr. Rorem has said, in fact, that he is working all the time, mentally plotting out a composition or polishing a phrase, whatever else he may seem to be doing, during every waking hour. And there are a lot of them.
"I haven't had a good night's sleep in 30 years," he said. "I lie awake wondering: When am I going to die? When is Jim going to die? How will the laundry get done?"
Though he does not dwell on his age -- seems hardly to believe it -- Mr. Rorem thinks about dying all the time, he said. "I'm not afraid of death. It's now a reality: I'm probably going to die. I don't want to die in a painful way, and I don't want to be a burden on my friends. I don't want to kill myself, because when you're dead, you're dead. Out of millions of galaxies and trillions of light years, our little romance on earth is all we've got."
He desperately wants to be remembered for his music. "No newspaper article can be me," he said. "My diaries have nothing to do with me. They do, but they don't. My music may be me." But he is pessimistic on the score of posterity (as on most others). "I'm a part of history," he said. "That's not a fantasy. But it's amazing how the important become more important with time and vice versa."
It is impossible to know, of course, what the future holds, but one detached observer finds cause for optimism. H. Wiley Hitchcock, a prominent historian of American music and no particular fan of Mr. Rorem's work, speaks of a Rorem renaissance and welcomes it. "It has let us experience more of his instrumental music, some of which is very well done," he said. Comparing Mr. Rorem to other American composer-authors like Virgil Thomson and Henry Cowell, Mr. Hitchcock seemed surprised at his own conclusion: "I wonder if Ned won't have more lasting worth as a composer."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Taking Steps On Safety Issue

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
FACED with mounting anxiety about crime against travelers, particularly in Florida, associations representing the major segments of the United States travel industry met recently in Washington to look for potential solutions. Representative Jim Bacchus of Florida, who represents a central portion of Florida's east coast and part of Orlando, speaking to the 80 travel officials and reporters at the Jan. 5 session, defined the gravity of the problem. In tourism, he said: "When Florida sneezes, the industry gets a cold. And Florida has pneumonia."
The safety of a destination ranks as travelers' top concern, according to a survey made in August and September for the marketing company Robinson Yesawich & Pepperdine of Orlando, Fla., by the market-survey organization Yankelovich Partners of Westport, which interviewed 850 representative United States households. More than 80 percent ranked safety concerns at the top. This was the second survey by those two companies, but safety of destination was not listed as an important attribute the year before, so comparison is not possible. 
 As there are no simple resolutions to the problems of violence and crime, the safety meeting saw no way to devise quick formulas to deal with root causes, or to get tourism out of the line of fire. Research into problem areas, education of travelers on the theme "travel smart" and anti-crime legislation were all endorsed.
On education, the last two years have seen a surge in folders and leaflets counseling travelers on how to avoid danger or scams, and the organizations at the meeting -- representing hotels, airlines, car-rental companies, cruise lines and travel agencies -- agreed to press ahead with that kind of education. But they decided against consolidating their tips into what one official called a fat little encyclopedia, concluding that information was most serviceable at the time it applied -- that hotel tips were most useful to people entering their rooms, for example.
In probably its most important decision, the meeting did agree to gather statistics to measure the problem travelers face: the percentage of hotel or motel guests who suffer assaults, rapes or thefts, how many renters of cars lose their belongings to thieves or are attacked at highway rest stops, and other data to put the effect of crime on travel into context. Paul M. Ruden, senior vice president of the American Society of Travel Agents, which convened the meeting, said: "There will be no more bald assertions by me that you are more likely to drown in the bathtub than to be shot while traveling. We will get the data together to prove it."
Cooperation and Legislation
At the conference, the Travel Industry Association, a trade group of 2,000 members that includes hotel chains, the National Park Service, the state tourism bureaus, theme parks, airlines, cruise lines and others, announced completion of a link to Crime Stoppers International providing rewards for anonymous tips that lead to solving crimes that cause severe injury to or the death of a traveler. Crime Stoppers, a coalition of local organizations affiliated with police departments and other law groups, interviews tipsters who call "800" phone numbers and sets up systems for them to collect rewards when suspects are arrested and indicted.
Bob Dickinson of Carnival Cruise Lines, chairman of the Travel Industry Association, announced the program, explaining that a traveler would be defined as someone 100 miles from home who plans to return but is not part of a plane or other operating crew and is not a student going to or from school. The rewards, to be provided by the T.I.A., will range from $500 to $1,000, depending on the information. The Crime Stoppers number is (800) 474-8477.
Also on the legal-legislative front, Representative Bacchus discussed a travelers' safety bill that he introduced last fall with Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii and James L. Oberstar of Minnesota, all Democrats. That bill would allow Federal law officials to be called in if a traveler from another country, or another state, is a victim of a crime of violence. David Gergen, President Clinton's counselor, spoke on behalf of the Administration's omnibus crime bill, saying that the freedom to travel, in addition to its economic value, was part of the American spirit, needed if the country is to remain "a beacon of freedom."
Releasing Crime Statistics
The conference brought together executive officers and security experts from the travel agents' group, from the Air Transport Association, the American Hotel and Motel Association, the International Council of Cruise Lines and the American Car Rental Association.
The plan to divulge crime statistics is remarkable, because in 1991, when a trial stemming from a rape at a motel in Dallas brought a $10 million settlement that became a focus of media attention, no one in the hotel-motel industry would divulge any figures, saying either that such figures did not exist or that they represented information the hotel chains chose to keep to themselves. Now, Kenneth F. Hine, president of the American Hotel and Motel Association, said: "The knee-jerk session is over. We have indications that systems and companies will release information to contribute to a pool of data."
In Florida, the rental-car companies have already formed a security council to meet with law-enforcement groups and other organizations to enhance safety. Steps have been taken there, including the creation of a detailed Dade County route map that Miami car-rental companies are required to give to customers. New lighting and signs around the airport have also been installed and a special police precinct has been created covering the rental-car-return area.
Travelers, Prepare!
Although many of the safety leaflets published in the last year rely on common sense, sophisticated precautions are evolving; for instance, it is now considered safe practice that your registration at the hotel or the folder with your key not list your room number along with your name. It is also urged that if a hotel clerk says, "Room 31, Ms. Traveler," you request a new room immediately.
A copy of those leaflets may be obtained by sending a stamped self-addressed envelope to the organization at the address given. The American Automobile Association's "Playing It Safe, Taking Care of Yourself and Your Stuff When You Become a Tourist" is available at many A.A.A. offices, or from "Playing It Safe," Mail Stop 700, 1000 AAA Drive, Heathrow, Fla. 32746.
The Hotel and Motel Association's pamphlet of 10 safety tips, 10 million copies of which have been distributed in hotel and motel rooms since it was published in March 1993, may be obtained from the association by sending a request and a stamped self-addressed business-size envelope to 1201 New York Avenue N. W., Washington, D.C. 20005.
"Stay Safe and Sound" by Loews Hotels may be obtained by writing to Loews Hotels, Corporate Security Department, 1 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016.
"A Consumer's Guide to Renting a Car," published by Alamo and the National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators, has a sheet of safety tips. Send a stamped self-addressed envelope to McCool Communications, Post Office Box 13005, Atlanta, Ga. 30324.

A Rush to Build for the County's Aging Population

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
IN recent years, the 27-year-old White Plains Hotel attracted few guests. But a developer now hopes it will appeal to a growing market as a residence for the elderly who need some help with daily chores.
In Rye, a nursing home built in 1908 is about to be transformed into an apartment building for the aged who wish to live independently, but in a structured environment. 
 Such projects, as well as total-care nursing homes, are now being planned all over the county to accommodate an increasingly aging population.
Perhaps the most popular type of housing is called "assisted living apartments," where the elderly rent units, and meals, housekeeping and other services are provided.
"There's a real market out there for assisted-living apartments," said Solomon T. Scharf, who last month bought the 105-room White Plains Hotel on South Broadway and Lyons Place, which had been foreclosed in October 1992 by The Bank of New York.
Mr. Scharf, who is president of Lloyd Equities, a development company in Manhattan, plans to convert the hotel into 284 apartments, which he said he could do by making mostly cosmetic changes, such as installing new furniture, carpeting and wallpaper.
"This hotel, like many others, has rooms with connecting doors," Mr. Scharf explained. "You can create apartments simply by opening the doors."
There will be studio, one- and two-bedroom units, all with kitchenettes, that will rent for $2,500 to $3,000 a month. The price will include three meals a day in a central dining area, housekeeping, recreation and local transportation. Amenities will include a card room, library, exercise room, an arts and crafts center and a chapel.
The plan still requires the approval of the White Plains Common Council, but there has been little opposition, Mr. Scharf said.
He said he expected to begin the renovation in the spring and phase in assisted-living residents while continuing to operate the building as a hotel. The phasing in, he said, could take as much as four years.
Mr. Scharf owns and operates the Esplanade Hotel, a 181-unit assisted-living accommodation at West End Avenue and West 74th Street in Manhattan. "With life expectancy continuing to go up, there will continue to be a need for this kind of housing in the future," he said.
That opinion is echoed by Stephen Lopez, Planning Commissioner for the town of Greenburgh, where a 160-bed nursing home is now being planned.
"There's such a variety of living arrangements for seniors now," Mr. Lopez said. "There's still a great need for total-care facilities, but there's a greater call for more intermediate care for seniors who aren't fully capable of taking care of themselves, yet don't need to be in an institution."
One ambitious project involves the $60 million expansion of the Osborn Retirement Community, now under way between Theall and Boston Post Roads in Rye. It will involve an 84-bed skilled-nursing facility and 188 independent-living residences, including 148 one- and two-bedroom apartments in three buildings, and 20 two-family homes, each with 1,638 square feet of living space.
THE community, on a 56-acre campus, already has a 125-bed retirement residence for men women in a 186,000-square-foot Georgian building opened in 1908 for women only. The building will be converted into 65 one-bedroom independent-living rental apartments and 40 assisted-living units.
The original building, which already has dining rooms, parlors and a 200-seat theater, will also be equipped with a fitness center, and another building will be constructed to house an indoor pool and a spa.
Fees for all the various housing options have not yet been approved, according to Mark R. Zwerger, chief executive officer of the Osborn Retirement Community, who has submitted an offering plan to the New York State Attorney General.
Mr. Zwerger said a one-time refundable entrance fee would be charged in addition to a monthly service fee for the 188 new independent-living units. "Our entrance fees will be comparable to the prices of similar sized condominiums," said Mr. Zwerger. "But residents won't own their units. They will be owned by the Osborn."
When the resident dies, or if he or she moves, the entrance fee will be refunded to the estate or the individual, he explained.
Each resident will get a package designed to accommodate individual preferences, Mr. Zwerger said. "If they want, three meals a day will be provided, as will housekeeping services and recreation."
Mr. Zwerger said that market research showed that the needs of the elderly were changing. "They wanted larger personal accommodations," he said.
The other major impetus for the expansion, Mr. Zwerger said, was economic. "We needed more people living on the campus to make it economically viable. We couldn't continue to make it with the 125 people we have now," he said.
The first stage of construction, which will begin in the fall, will involve 13 of the two-family homes and the first of the three apartment buildings, the new 84-bed nursing home and the new indoor pool.
Another complex looking to expand its services is the 127-year-old Wartburg Home at East Lincoln and Bradley Avenues in Mount Vernon. The home, which now has 240 elderly people on its 35-acre campus, plans to build a new 160-bed nursing home and create 44 assisted-living units in a building that now houses 90 people. In addition, an auditorium will be transformed into an adult day-care center accommodating 100 people.
WHEN the new building opens early next year, the complex will accommodate a total of 240 nursing-home residents and an overall population of 370, said the Rev. Glenn C. Stone, spokesman for the Wartburg Home, which is affiliated with the Lutheran Church.
In the Town of Greenburgh, a 160-bed nursing home has been proposed by the Hebrew Hospital Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that now operates a 480-bed home in Co-op City, in the Bronx. The site plan for the four-wing, 85,000-square-foot home to be built on just under 60 acres on Grassland Roads at Stephens Lane is before the Town Planning Board.
At one time, the property was to be used for a one-family-home development that fell victim to the downturn in the real estate market.
Many people in town are happy that the land will now be used for a nursing home, since it will preserve more open space.
"The building itself will take up a very small percentage of the property," said Mr. Lopez, the Town Planning Commissioner. "The rest will be used for sitting areas and about half of the property is steep slopes."
Mr. Scharf, the owner of the White Plains Hotel, believes that the trend toward converting old projects and buildings into residences for the elderly will continue for some time.
He cites statistics that show that, in the next decade, the number of people 65 years of age or older nationwide will grow by 3.3 million, to 34.87 million people.
"And with good medicine, a lot of these people will be healthy and want a wide variety of housing options," he said. "Nursing homes and living with relatives are not the answer for everyone."

HEADLINE: Altering Rules on Who May Take Over Apartments

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A MONTHLY publication called New York Landlord v Tenant is adept at boiling down the facts in lawsuits involving rent-regulated housing in New York City. With regulatory complexity steadily growing, there is no shortage of cases.
Many of them are on the issue of succession: who has the legally guaranteed right to take over an apartment when the tenant of record dies or moves? 
 "A landlord won the right to evict the ex-boyfriend of a tenant who had moved out," says one summary. "Although the boyfriend had some emotional and financial relationship with tenant, there wasn't enough proof of a committed family relationship for the ex-boyfriend to get the apartment."
And another: "Landlord sued to evict rent-controlled tenant's grandson after tenant died. The grandson was a relative who was entitled to pass-on rights simply by virtue of the blood tie and because he had lived with the tenant for two years."
These contrasting cases -- one in a rent-stabilized apartment, where there are leases of specific terms, and the other in a rent-controlled apartment, where occupancy has no limited term -- illuminate the issues that arise in succession cases, a growth area in landlord-tenant friction.
Barring the willingness of the United States Supreme Court to accept an appeal, a case decided by the State Court of Appeals last month has settled the law on succession rights. In a 6-0 decision written by Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, it confirmed the right of the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal to extend to rent-stabilized housing the same succession rights for family members as in rent-controlled units.
It also confirmed the right of the agency to widen the class of protected individuals from 18 categories of family members to other categories of nonfamily members without a specific legislative mandate. In its "regulatory impact statement" the agency named four classes of occupants as needing this protection: the life partners of unmarried people, the disabled, the aged, and the poor.
Left unsettled by the lawsuit is the question of the impact of expanded succession rights on rental housing. Is the stage being set for extending to rent-stabilized housing the familiar practice of passing along rent-controlled apartments from generation to generation? Are the snooping propensities of landlords eager to establish their claim on apartments when there is a tenancy turnover being encouraged? Undoubtedly, yes. Might tenants be tempted to practice deceit in order to pass on favorably priced rent-stabilized apartments to roommates? Again, yes.
The familiar clash between the need for protections on the one hand and the potential for abuse on the other is thrown into bold relief in the succession issue. Most cases never get to court, but the law serves as a backdrop for landlord and tenant behavior.
STANDING alone, the court decision does no more than protect individuals at risk of a dire housing fate, possibly homelessness. But it comes in the absence of an effective over-all policy leading to gradual decontrol of vacated apartments. It gives additional long-term occupants of regulated apartments a housing advantage unjustified by any income test. Meanwhile, the need for it is explained on the basis of a "housing crisis" that many would say is primarily the result of state regulation itself.
Last year the State Senate made an effort to moderate the most glaring injustices of the regulatory system by removing controls from very-high-rent apartments. But by the time a compromise acceptable to the Democratic leadership was reached and a law was passed and signed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, only those earning $250,000 or more for two consecutive years, and living in an apartment renting for at least $2,000 a month on a specific date -- Oct. 1, 1993 -- were affected. Many wealthy people so disposed will no doubt escape coverage by manipulating the years in which they accept income.
In any case, there is little doubt that the intention of the state agency was to meet the immediate needs of many people whose housing plight, sometimes after tragic personal loss, would be dire without protection. In particular, lifelong companions of individuals who died of AIDS might have faced eviction. So might elderly or poverty-stricken companions of a deceased rent-stabilized tenants.
In a lawsuit involving only rent-controlled housing, Braschi v. Stahl Associates, the Court of Appeals had already upheld the right of a longtime gay companion of a person who died of AIDS to inherit an apartment. The decision placed the burden of proof on the successor to establish the claim based on an "emotional and financial commitment, and interdependence" with the former tenant. Controlled apartments are those built before World War II and continuously occupied by the same tenant, or an authorized successor, since 1971.
Specific methods of demonstrating this relationship are suggested in the Braschi decision. These are incorporated in the state's revised regulation, making them applicable in about a million stabilized apartments -- postwar or prewar units vacated and rerented after 1971. Among the evidences that demonstrate the familial relationship are intermingled finances, formalized legal obligations, and a history of having represented oneself as a family member.
"MY concern is that poor people will have trouble meeting the standards, because they often don't have the documents," said Paris R. Baldacci, associate professor at the Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University, lawyer for intervenors on the state's side in the suit. "But in general the standards seem workable."
To win a succession right there is another test besides family membership or its equivalent: The successor must have lived in the apartment as his or her principal residence with the prime tenant for no less than two years (or one year in the case of people over 62 years of age or disabled). Or, if the occupancy is less than two years, the successor must have been there from the start of legal tenancy (the lease, in the case of a stabilized apartment) or the start of the relationship with the departed tenant.
Under a separate law, tenants may take in roommates, as long as landlords are informed. The route to improper succession, therefore, will be apartment-sharing leading to claims of interdependence. Smaller landlords who find it too difficult or expensive to mount lengthy lawsuits -- and even larger landlords, depending on the gap between the tenant's rent and the potential vacancy rent -- will be disposed to negotiate to keep the current occupant in place.
Sherwin Belkin, the lawyer for the Rent Stabilization Association of New York City, an owner's organization that challenged the regulations, said an attempt to appeal to the United States Supreme Court was possible. "An owner's right to determine who many possess his property is fundamental," he said. "We don't want to stand by and see that taken away by a state agency."
One Court of Appeals judge, Joseph W. Bellacosa, urged the Legislature in a separate statement to "carefully assess the sweeping power it impliedly invested in this administrative agency in the execution of a unique human sheltering mission." He predicted that "long, successive successorships" to rent-stabilized leaseholds would "bloom as perennials, becoming functionally transformed into perpetual stakeholds."
The Division of Housing and Community Renewal was represented in the suit by its chief of litigation, Cullen S. McVoy. The Small Property Owners of New York, intervening on the owners' side, was represented by Ronald D. Hariri.

HEADLINE: Battery Park City's Original Concept

 BODY:
To the Editor:
How ironic to read that the current administrators of Battery Park City are considering the introduction of subsidized housing units ("A New Neighborhood Along the Hudson," Dec. 26). 
 It was in the late 60's and throughout the 70's that the start of construction of the first housing units at the development was delayed while Battery Park City's then administrators and developers strove to produce housing at a cost that would qualify for a variety of Federal and state subsidized-housing programs.
The purpose was to insure an economically mixed development that would meet the goals of the project's fathers, the Rockefeller administration, to provide housing for all income levels, not just the wealthy. It should be noted that housing at Battery Park City came to fruition only when subsequent state administrations abandoned the mixed-housing concept and opted for housing only high-income residents.
To set the record straight also, Battery Park City, while sired by the late Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, was not an urban-renewal development, which would have had to rely on government financing for its development. Creation of the site and its infrastructure was, rather, funded in its entirety by bonds issued by the Battery Park City Authority.
Also, only 24 of the project's 92 acres resulted from excavation for the nearby World Trade Center. The bulk of the site, 68 acres, was created in the waters of the Hudson River by the Battery Park City Authority, which demolished the decaying, abandoned piers that were on the mile-long site and pumped in millions of tons of sand barged in from lower New York Harbor.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Splitting Fees;
When the Tenant With Clout Shares a Commission

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
LAST year, the American Telephone & Telegraph Company formed a subsidiary licensed to do real estate transactions in New Jersey. The company had as much intention of brokering deals as it did of building cars.
So why the license? Because A.T.& T. had named 222 Realty, a brokerage firm in Basking Ridge, as its agent for all New Jersey space searches of 75,000 square feet or less. In exchange for a lock on that business, the brokerage agreed to share its commissions with A.T.& T. And since under New Jersey and New York laws only licensed brokers can share in commissions, it was worth it to the telephone company to get certified. 
 "We got licensed purely to work out the compensation agreement," said Gary A. Decker, A.T.& T.'s real estate vice president.
Brokers don't like it, but such scenarios are increasingly dotting the real estate landscape. Barney Upton, the executive managing director of corporate services for Cushman & Wakefield, said the pace of demands to split fees had "picked up tremendously."
James S. Meiskin, a senior managing director at Wm. A. White/Grubb & Ellis, estimated that he had been asked to discount his commission on about 20 percent of the mid-sized transactions he handled, and about half of the deals for more than 100,000 square feet.
"With competition so fierce and long-term relationships so important, we have to agree at least half the time," Mr. Meiskin said.
From the corporate tenant's point of view, asking brokers to share commissions represents a simple quid pro quo. A growing number of companies have formed so-called strategic alliances or preferred vendor arrangements with brokerage firms in which they guarantee those firms most, or even all, of their space-search assignments.
In doing so, they are guaranteeing the firms a steady stream of business in a hotly competitive market. And they are saving the firms the marketing and sales costs involved in competing for each job separately.
"Our strategic alliances are supposed to be win/win based on total economics," said H. Bruce Russell, director of corporate real estate for Eastman Kodak. "So if the arrangement reduces the brokers' cost structure, they can get the same profit even if they pass along some of their commission."
But while brokers generally agree with that idea in theory, in practice they say the clients are expecting too much for too little. They note that since their commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of rent, the plummeting rents of the last few years have cut their incomes drastically.
Yet they increasingly are being asked to attend their clients' strategic-planning and human-resources meetings and to participate in expansion and relocation decisions. They are expected to act as financial consultants, relocation experts and brokers all rolled into one.
While the brokers say they welcome their expanded role because it can cement the relationship with the corporate client, some balk at selling themselves too cheaply.
Arthur Mirante, Cushman & Wakefield's chief executive, said he had begun to turn down requests to bid for assignments on which there was too little money to be made.
"We will no longer take an account just to get our foot in the door in the hope of making money in the future," he said.
Bruce Mosler, a Galbreath Riverbank vice chairman, is taking a closer look at the practice, too.
"We can't regularly cut fees to build a relationship anymore," he said. "We have to offer more services, and that means more costs that our revenues have to cover."
Still, not all brokers feel they have the luxury to just say no.
"Even if you know you can't make any money on a deal, you're afraid not to bid for it," said Stephen Riker, president of Abrams Benisch Riker/Colliers. "You're afraid that if you don't respond this time, you won't get a chance at the more lucrative deal next time."
Corporate executives are not deaf to such grousing. One corporate real-estate executive, who insisted on anonymity lest he offend corporate colleagues who are collecting fees, avoids the practice.
"When real-estate firms take a real burn on pricing it's tough for them to provide the quality of service we would want," he said.
OTHER executives now pay their brokers flat fees for consulting so that, even if a deal never happens, they've made some money.
"We try hard to cover costs and even some profit for any advisory or planning services we use," said Larry P. Ebert, director of real estate services for Ernst & Young, the accounting firm.
But while these companies may be finding ways to make the bitter pill of fee splitting more palatable, they are forcing the brokers to swallow the medicine nonetheless. To them, asking for a commission split is no different from expecting a raw-materials supplier to offer a volume discount.
While the philosophy may be the same, the methods are not. Companies pay their materials suppliers directly, which means volume discounts are easily negotiated. Real estate brokers, in contrast, are generally paid by landlords, so tenants must find ways to direct the discounts they negotiated back into their own coffers.
For companies with real-estate licenses, that is easy: They simply have the landlord write them a check.
The Travelers, for one, is licensed in Connecticut, the insurance company's home state, as well as in Texas, Michigan and Georgia, where it does many transactions. For large deals, it sometimes asks for as much as half of the broker's commission.
"It doesn't take all that much more work to do a 100,000-foot deal than a 20,000-foot deal," said Wayne E. Mills, Travelers' senior vice president of corporate real estate. He estimates that Travelers gets back more than $750,000 a year in real-estate commissions. "Most brokers recognize that the huge paydays of the past are simply gone," he said.
But many companies -- particularly those that have offices in many states -- don't want to go through the hassle of keeping active certifications going across the country. Instead, they tell their brokers to have the landlord plow part of their commissions back into the deal in the form of extra months of free rent, better contributions to building the space or even a lower rent.
That's the method Ernst & Young prefers.
"We don't want to worry about the tax implications of added income, or about setting up a real-estate license," Mr. Ebert said.
The International Business Machines Corporation has its own variation on that theme: It pays its strategic-alliance brokers a flat fee per square foot rented, on the proviso that they tell the landlord up front that no commission will be involved and that this saving should translate into a better deal for I.B.M.
"If we found out some company down the street got a better deal, we'd have a pretty serious talk with our strategic partner," said J. Thomas Benek, an I.B.M. director of real estate operations.
BEFORE its recent spate of layoffs, I.B.M. had salaried staff people handle its real estate negotiations without commission, so the company is used to evaluating the value of commissionless deals. But few brokers or executives think that is the optimum approach for most companies.
For one thing, it requires taking a lot of fairly illusory numbers on faith. "A company really can't know for sure that they got 50 cents off the rent because a broker took only 80 percent of his commission," conceded John F. Powers, an executive managing director at the Edward S. Gordon brokerage.
It also robs the real estate executives of a bit of corporate glory, added Mr. Upton of Cushman & Wakefield. "When you've just reduced the rent, the corporate guy can no longer say, 'Hey, here's half a million dollars I've brought back to the company's bottom line,' " he said.
Still, brokers say the approach can work well provided the idea of building the fee back into the deal doesn't come up until the very end of negotiations, when the tenant representative is certain the landlord will not budge any further on a deal.
"First I make sure I've squeezed all the juice out of the lemon," said Mr. Meiskin, the Wm. A. White/Grubb & Ellis executive. "Then I tell the landlord about the fee arrangement and ask for more concessions."

HEADLINE: Bill Seeks Hard-Labor Terms In Some Crimes

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
AN influential Republican state senator who says inmates are being coddled at taxpayer expense is introduceding legislation that would create a prison whose primary purpose would be to punish criminals through a regimen of intense physical labor.
That plan by the Senator, Gerald Cardinale of Demarest, calls for a "hard time facility" for violent felons that would combine backbreaking work, unbending discipline and the absence of such amenities as basketball courts, televisions and library privileges. The aim, he said, would be to make prison life so unpleasant that even the most hardened criminals would shun future illegal endeavors to avoid returning there. 
 Dr. Cardinale says his move is a response to growing public concern over crime and violence and a perception that prisons are not doing enough to rehabilitate criminals and deter recidivists.
"Prison should be punishment, not just rehabilitation," Dr. Cardinale said. "This is not meant to do anything in terms of rehabilitating prisoners. This is meant to rehabilitate their attitude toward crime."
Those who agree with him say that such drastic action is needed because prison life, with its emphasis on rehabilitation, has become an acceptable alternative to life on the streets for many career criminals.
"They're laughing at us," said Dr. Cardinale, a dentist, who was recently named the deputy majority leader in the Republican-dominated Legislature. "They're treated better in jail than they are out on the street. They have food, clothes, shelter, television, an exercise room and a library. They're essentially coddled at taxpayers' expense."
But critics include some corrections guards as well as civil liberties advocates and prisoners' rights groups. They say such an attitude toward corrections policy is likely to be counterproductive and would be unsuccessful because of the insurmountable difficulties involved in safely managing such a prison. Moreover, they say, confining inmates under such conditions would very likely be an unconstitutional violation of their rights.
"Yes, the public is frustrated with crime," said James V. Stabile, a spokesman for the State Department of Corrections. "But there's a lot of 'feel-good' legislation out there that would be difficult to put into practice. If this were the magic bullet, I'm sure that everybody would be doing it."
In fact, "hard time" prisons have been tried, with mixed results, in other areas of the country. For example, a program for dealing with violent offenders at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, Calif., has been met with lawsuits from inmates.
And in upstate New York, a "super-maximum security" prison in the Southport Correctional Facility, which is used to house inmates in long-term solitary confinement, has been receiving mixed reviews.
"I consider it to be a failure," said Edward I. Koren, staff lawyer for the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington. "It's a dead end. All these places are dead ends."
Mr. Koren also acknowledged public frustration with current corrections policy.
"I'm not saying we should coddle people, put them up in Holiday Inns," he said. "But certainly Rahway and Trenton State Prison aren't Holiday Inns by any stretch of the imagination."
Mr. Koren added that Senator Cardinale's proposal is a "variation on a theme."
"We've seen this year in and year out," he said. "But this business of hard labor is something new to me. We had it up until fairly recently in the South, but a lot of correctional history has been an attempt to get away from that mindless kind of backbreaking work that is abusive."
Under the proposed legislation, any person convicted of a first offense of a violent crime like murder, manslaughter, aggravated assault, kidnapping or robbery, or of being a drug kingpin, would spend a minimum of one-fifth of the sentence in what the bill calls a "people's prison." It would be situated in a maximum-security prison in the state. Any person convicted of a subsequent offense would serve his entire sentence in such a place.
According to the legislative statement accompanying the bill, inmates serving time there would live a "highly structured and regimented daily routine" including a minimum of 10 hours a day of "rigorous discipline and physical labor." Any inmate who refuses to participate in the physical labor would be confined to his cell and could be denied parole.
 
Would Receive No Training
 The statement also indicates that there would be no educational or vocational training, and inmates would be denied the standard prison amenities of television and telephone privileges, recreational activities and furloughs.
"These people are going to cut down trees, dig holes and break rocks," said Ryan St. Michael, chairman of the Committee for People's Prison, a grass-roots organization based in Dumont that is promoting the idea of such prisons across the country. "This is going to be a hard-time place for violent criminals. It's going to be a hellhole. It's going to be the worst place in the state to be."
Mr. St. Michael, whose sister was murdered nearly 20 years ago by killers who were never captured, said the state's current method of dealing with violent crime was inadequate.
"Everybody who has been a victim is fed up," he said. "They know that their money is being spent for institutions that just aren't working."
Officials acknowledge public support for more effective methods of dealing with violent crime and a recidivism rate of nearly 70 percent.
Mr. Stabile, of the State Department of Corrections, said corrections officials would not comment on the specifics of the legislation unless and until it became law. "We have to carry out whatever the law is," he said. "But I think the first cost of this law would be defending it in court."
 
Question of Constitutionality
 Mr. Stabile was referring to a belief among corrections experts that any law that imposes such harsh punishment would face an immediate constitutional challenge.
Susan R. Silver, director of the Office of Inmate Advocacy in the State Public Defender's office, said she had "serious reservations" about the constitutionality of the proposal, both in terms of its treatment of prisoners and in denying them parole if they do not comply.
"But a more basic problem with it is that it's basically throwing people away," Ms. Silver said. "Even violent offenders and recidivists can be doing something constructive. Breaking rocks doesn't seem to serve anyone."
Ms. Silver said a more reasonable approach to corrections would be to provide inmates with skills "so that when they come out they'll be able to reintegrate in the community in a positive way."
For someone like Patricia Rybka of Wood-Ridge, teaching criminals vocational skills may not be enough.
"Hard labor never killed anyone," said Mrs. Rybka, whose husband, a Bergen County sheriff's officer, was murdered 15 years ago by a prisoner he was guarding. "Breaking rocks? Sure. Why not. Bring it back like the old times."
Mrs. Rybka, who said that the man who killed her husband had prior criminal convictions, added that the way society now deals with violent criminals obviously isn't working.
"We have to teach them a lesson," she said. "They just have to realize that if they do something wrong they're not just going to get a slap on the hand."
 
Would Be 'Counterproductive'
 But Karen A. Spinner, director of public education and policy for the New Jersey Association on Corrections in Trenton, said that "punishment for the sake of punishment" would be counterproductive.
"We're going to end up with people who are more hardened, more angry and more difficult to control when they get out," Ms. Spinner said, adding that the "economic motivation" for criminal behavior is extremely high.
"It's not that they want to go back to prison," she said. "It's because they don't have legitimate means of making a living. They use crime as their means of livelihood. And I don't think making prison a harsher place will deter anybody."
Corrections officers say that another problem with "punishment for the sake of punishment" is that prisoners with nothing left to lose are much more difficult to control.
"The more you take away, the more dangerous they become," said Edward Murphy, vice president of Local 105 of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association in Trenton, the union that represents the state's 5,000 corrections officers. "When you put someone in that category, they're going to take the position that they have nothing to lose. There's no way that you can force those inmates to work. If they say they're not going to break rock, then that's it. They're not going to break rock."
And even if inmates do cooperate, he said, the scenario envisioned by supporters of the idea would create more problems in practice than in theory.
 
Security Concerns
 "The more direct contact between inmates and officers increases the potential of danger," Mr. Murphy said. "Whenever you give somebody a sledgehammer to break rocks, you're talking security concerns."
Notwithstanding the broad criticism and potential for legal challenge to his proposal, Dr. Cardinale is confident that its popular appeal will propel it through the Legislature.
"I don't think anybody is going to be against it," he said, adding that one vocal supporter, Senator Louis F. Kosko, Republican of Paramus, is chairman of the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee, where the bill will most likely be assigned.
And Mr. St. Michael, who is hoping that New Jersey's "people's prison" might be used as a model for similar prisons nationwide, said he was "100 percent sure" that the bill would ultimately become law.
"This is not a hard sell today," he said. "People are fed up. They're looking over their shoulder every time they go shopping. Nobody's safe anymore. And they want a change."

Virginia's Electronic Village

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: BLACKSBURG, Va.

 BODY:
WHILE others toil on and talk about national information superhighways, an unusual town-and-gown alliance is paving an electronic country lane here. The Blacksburg Electronic Village, now in the early stages, is intended to tie many of the 35,000 residents of this university town in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains to each other and to the world at large by means of a computer network. Just how many electronic villagers actually sign on will become clearer as the project unfolds.
Forget about visions of full-motion video and summoning "Gone With the Wind" on a whim. This bookish system will deal only in text. But it will let users send electronic mail worldwide via the Internet and give them access to thousands of bulletin boards. And through use of specialized software called Gopher, Blacksburg's electronic villagers will be able to hunt for books, documents and software scattered on thousands of computers at universities and government agencies. 
 And in a very literal application of the "electronic town meeting" concept, Blacksburgians will be able to peruse the minutes of town council sessions, keep track of various meeting schedules, communicate with local government officials and maybe even conduct referendums on key issues.
The reason that Blacksburg, rather than some other mid-size rural town, is joining the global village is simple: Virginia Tech. The Virginia Polytechnic Institute utterly dominates the town, with 8,500 of its 23,500 students living on campus and thousands of others scattered in apartments in and around town.
Add in faculty, staff and support services, and there are few people in town not involved with the university. "There is probably no one in the corporate limits of town that is not connected directly or indirectly with Virginia Tech," said Ronald A. Secrest, the town manager.
This results in a compact, relatively isolated community filled with an unusually high percentage of computer-literate people. That made it attractive to the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company, which is seeking to measure the public's demand for data services and the higher-capacity lines they are expected to require. C.& P. is owned by the Bell Atlantic Corporation, one of the most aggressive regional Bell companies when it comes to developing new types of information networks.
C.& P. has joined in an alliance with Virginia Tech and the town of Blacksburg to install high-speed, digital lines to apartment buildings, which largely house older students, and to public access locations, like libraries. Eventually, if demand warrants, the network may be extended to town offices, off-campus faculty homes and other locations.
"The whole Blacksburg Electronic Village is a test of when, and under what circumstances, people will demand information services," said John W. Knapp Jr., C.& P.'s director of partnership initiatives. "The town may be a precursor of the society at large."
Students who live on campus, and faculty members in their offices, already have direct computer connections to the university's local area network. Those off campus, however, have typically been forced to tap into the net through dial-up modems that send data over phone lines, a much slower procedure.
Kai Xu, a third-year electrical engineering student who lives off campus and is not yet part of the electronic village, said he regularly logs on to the university's network via modem to check for news, homework assignments, correct answers to previous assignments and messages. But "I don't download very often; with a 14.4-kilobit line it just takes too long," Mr. Xu said of his modem setup, which sends and receives data at 14,400 bits a second.
Luckier are the students who live in apartments already connected to the high-capacity optical-fiber and coaxial copper lines that C.& P. is installing in Blacksburg. "It's fiber to the basement and coaxial cables from there up," Mr. Knapp said. "We have about 700 apartment units wired up now." The lines have almost 1,000 times the data transmission capacity of Mr. Xu's modem.
The telephone company is providing high-capacity service free of charge for the rest of the current semester, which ends this spring, to see how much use people make of it and how valuable it becomes to them. "At the end of the semester, we'll ask them what they would be willing to pay for it," Mr. Knapp said. "That way we'll be able to determine whether it will be economically viable."
If demand warrants, the project's developers would proceed with plans to extend the network.
It is a function of planning, not mere chance, that the early testing is being done in student apartments filled with aspiring engineers. "We need a success with the initial group," said Irving Blythe, Virginia Tech's vice president for information services.
But everyone connected with the project knows the real test will come later, when people without technical backgrounds attempt to hook into the network. "My attitude is that I should be able to turn it on, put in the software and it works," said Kay Kriz, an administrator at the university. "Somebody said, it should be as easy to use as a toaster."
Such talk worries Andrew Cohill, the university official who is handling the technical parts of the project. He said people will have to be patient, as the bugs are worked out of the system.
"It's like the telephone was 100 years ago," he said. "You had to learn how to turn the crank to generate power to contact an operator. That's where we are now with computer networking. People will still have to get their hands dirty for the next two or three years."
One of the causes of soiled hands, Mr. Cohill said, is communications problems between remote personal computers and the Hewlett-Packard HP9000 computer on campus that controls the network. "In testing we found that it worked 80 to 90 percent of the time," Mr. Cohill said. "But we did have a lot of frustrated people. We hope that by providing telephone support we can get people over the bumps of the first week."
The good news, Mr. Cohill adds, is that once a communications link has been established, it usually does not require further attention.
THOSE who can ignore the technical details have the leisure of conjuring visions of what life will be like in an interactive town. Mr. Secrest, for example, the town manager, sees the electronic village as an economic development tool.
"It may be able to overcome our geographic isolation and attract high-technology research companies," he said. "If they are connected, they might like the quality of life in the clean air of the Blue Ridge mountains."
Mr. Secrest said he plans to install a personal computer in the main lobby of the town hall so that people who do not have their own computers can get onto the net. He expects all town departments to be connected, as well.
And at least one local retailer, although he is not yet on-line, thinks the network will change the way people shop. "We are going to design computers into stores," said Scott Wade, head of a 13-store chain of convenience stores in the Blacksburg area that bear his name.
He would like to see people send in E-mail messages ordering canned and boxed goods, and then come to the store to pick out the meats and produce to go with the other items that have already been assembled and bagged.
