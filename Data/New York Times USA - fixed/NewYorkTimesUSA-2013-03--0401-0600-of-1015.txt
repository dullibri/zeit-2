HEADLINE: New Book Tackles China and its Environmental Exports

BYLINE: EDWARD WONG


HIGHLIGHT: Craig Simons, the former Asia correspondent for Cox Newspapers, discusses his new book, &#8220;The Devouring Dragon: How China&#8217;s Rise Threatens Our Natural World.&#8221; 

 BODY:
BEIJING - The rapid degradation of the environment in China has become a central topic of discussion this year. Air pollution in Beijing and other parts of northern China hit record levels in January. Water pollution was thrust into the spotlight this week when official news reports said that nearly 6,000 dead pigs had been found floating in a river that slices through the heart of Shanghai. Meanwhile, environmental advocates are pressing the government to release data on soil pollution, which officials have categorized as a state secret.
It is no wonder, then, that delegates to the National People's Congress, which is holding its annual meeting now in Beijing, are debating environmental issues, even if the congress is largely a rubber-stamp legislature charged with giving Communist Party policy a veneer of popular legitimacy. 
Just as worrisome, if not as hotly discussed among Chinese, is the impact that China is having on the environment in other parts of the world. It is not an easy thing to gauge, but Craig Simons, a former Asia correspondent for Cox Newspapers, set out to do exactly that. He documented his findings in his first book, "The Devouring Dragon: How China's Rise Threatens Our Natural World," which was published March 12 by St. Martin's Press. Mr. Simons spoke recently about his reasons for embarking on this project, how Chinese officials assess climate change and what the U.S. can do to mitigate China's environmental effects. These are excerpts from that conversation.
 Q. 
Why did you choose this particular topic on which to focus?
 A. 
I'd lived and worked in China for over a decade, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later as a journalist, and I'd seen the costs of its environmental crisis on the lives of average citizens. Then, in 2005, I took a job covering Asia and began to travel regionally. In Indonesia, I reported on how Chinese demands had intensified logging and talked with experts worried that orangutans might become extinct in the wild. In Korea, friends told me about huge dust storms that had blown in from China. In Tuvalu, a tiny, low-lying South Pacific nation, locals worried that the growth of China's greenhouse gas emissions could speed global warming, which looked likely to eventually inundate their country. As I continued to have such experiences, I began to think that China's greatest 21st-century impacts are likely to be to the physical planet. I wanted to understand both how China's rise had affected environments around the world and, given that much of China remains relatively poor, what its continued growth could mean for our shared climate and Earth's remaining wildlife and forests. 
 Q. 
You've said that one of your goals is to put China's environmental impact outside its borders into a historical context. Can you tell us more about that context?
 A. 
The context is simply the tremendous physical changes to the planet humanity has caused since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. China only began to seek significant amounts of natural resources abroad over the last decade or so, and those demands are likely to grow dramatically before they plateau. But unlike for Europe or the United States, China's growth curve is rising at a time when the world's environments already are severely degraded. Since roughly the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, humanity has cleared more than one-quarter of Earth's forests, set off the world's sixth great era of extinctions - with losses occurring between 100 and 1000 times faster than the natural baseline - and pumped enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to warm the planet by more than one degree Fahrenheit. Fitting China into that larger narrative also helps us realize the global nature of today's environmental problems: it reminds us that we are all responsible.
 Q. 
What surprised you the most as you were doing your research?
 A. 
The most surprising thing was the reach of Chinese demands. As a nation with 1.3 billion people, 19 percent of humanity, and three-plus decades of annual economic growth averaging about 10 percent, it seemed there wasn't anywhere that China hadn't touched. One poignant example I found was a petition by Arkansas-based environmental groups to ban the collection of wild turtles because some species faced possible extinction due largely to Chinese demand for turtle meat. Even though data on U.S. turtle exports is spotty, they found that more than 256,000 wild-caught turtles were exported to Asia from the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas airport alone between 2002 and 2005. Another example is that air pollutants from China (as from other nations) are now reaching around the world. Dust, ozone, carbon monoxide and mercury polluted into the atmosphere in China are now regularly settling back to Earth in North America and other continents.
 Q. 
How aware do you think Chinese officials are of the impact that their policies have on the other parts of the world?
 A. 
While Chinese officials have become acutely aware of the impacts of China's development policies on its own environment, there is little public awareness of the effects of Chinese consumption on foreign nations. Despite that China is now considered the world's largest importer of illegally felled logs, few Chinese have thought about the problems caused by illegal logging. Likewise, few Chinese think about the impacts on wildlife of consuming traditional medicines and exotic species. I've seen animal parts, including tiger bone and rhino horn, for sale at Chinese markets and restaurants. Studies have also found a widespread desire to eat wildlife: according to a 2010 study by Traffic, the environmental NGO, for example, 44 percent of people interviewed in six Chinese cities had consumed wildlife in the previous year; most believed that eating many wild species should be a personal choice. With climate change there's more nuance, since the central government has made a very public push to improve energy efficiency and to increase the use of renewable energy sources. But experts believe that at the local level, most officials continue to focus on economic growth.
 Q. 
Within official circles, how do the Chinese now assess climate change, and does their assessment differ significantly from that of the United States?
 A. 
There is agreement among most top Chinese and American officials that climate change is a serious problem and needs to be addressed. However, there is significant divergence among experts on what China and other developing nations should do. China has generally maintained that, to be fair, any budget for future emissions should account for historical and per-capita emissions, which would give China a much larger share in the future. At recent U.N. meetings, Western nations have tried to push Beijing to accept binding limits to future emissions, but, as we saw during the contentious Copenhagen climate talks in 2009, Beijing has so far resisted accepting a quantitative cap.
 Q. 
Chinese officials often say that China has the right to grow its economy as it wants, and that the U.S. should not wag fingers over China's environmental impact since the U.S. spent many years growing its economy without thinking of the consequences. Even now, the carbon footprint per capita in the U.S. is still bigger than that of China. Do the Chinese have a valid point?
 A. 
Yes, that's a valid argument. Before the U.S. recession, China's average carbon footprint was between one-quarter and one-sixth of the average U.S. carbon footprint (depending on how one calculates it). More importantly, Chinese are much poorer than Americans. In 2011, China's average per-capita income was less than $4,000, one-eleventh of the U.S. average. In practice this means that people don't have many of the things Americans are used to - private vehicles, heated and cooled homes, the opportunity to travel internationally - and they're looking forward to those things. Another valid argument, however, is that every nation faces different challenges as they develop. Several experts I talked with pointed out that dealing with climate change, which might require slower economic growth, might be the burden China needs to bear.
 Q. 
You've said you didn't want to write a book that had only criticism. You've given some prescriptions on how China can lessen the environmental impact of its growth. What are some of the more helpful steps it can take?
 A. 
The most helpful step Beijing could take would be to adopt a cap on its greenhouse gas emissions or to impose a significant tax on carbon. Many experts now believe that the world will be able to rein in carbon emissions only if China and the United States, which together produce almost half of global anthropogenic emissions, commit to limits. Because China is relatively poor and it is still building much of its national infrastructure, such a commitment would be challenging.
 Q. 
What are some steps the U.S. can take in helping limit China's impact on the global environment?
 A. 
The more I reported, the more I saw that our environmental problems are shared. Because China is the world's manufacturing powerhouse, we all benefit from its cheap prices. But we also suffer from the pollution created by our increasing material affluence. China is a big part of that, but it's only the front edge of a larger wave of development that includes India, Brazil, Russia, and many other nations. The most important thing rich, developed nations can do is to realize that they need to become better role models by limiting their own global environmental impacts, including by controlling greenhouse gas emissions. After that, the West can do more to share the prosperity it has achieved. This could come partly through making environment-friendly technologies available at reasonable prices. It could also come through helping pay for the preservation of the world's remaining wild spaces, for example by providing income and opportunities to villagers in Papua New Guinea who choose to preserve their land or by helping train and equip wardens in wilderness areas like those I visited in northern India.
 Q. 
If China continues on its current path, what further effects will people living in other countries feel in the next decade?
 A. 
If the current trends continue, we can expect more of the world's remaining old-growth forests - which today make up a small part of remaining forested areas-to be logged and more species to become threatened or extinct. Without a Chinese commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions, we could also anticipate that the global community would be unlikely to generate a serious effort to address global warming. China is thus one key (the United States is the other) to coming together to save what remains: its impacts are so large and are growing so quickly that without Beijing's participation, governments will have difficulty generating the political will to act.

HEADLINE: The People Versus the Party

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans are out of sync with public opinion. 

 BODY:
The Republicans have hit a sour spot in politics - they are 180 degrees opposed to what most Americans want on just about any issue you care to name.
Remember, for instance, how the American people rejected the Romney/Ryan ticket, and in particular Paul Ryan's budget? Today Mr. Ryan released a remarkably similar budget. It even has the same Orwellian title: "The Path to Prosperity." 
The Ryan budget, which will become the official G.O.P. budget just as soon as the Republican majority in the House gets a chance to vote on it, gives nice big tax breaks to the wealthy. At the same time, it would turn Medicare into a voucher system, gut Medicaid by turning it into a block grant to the states, give states the ability to kick people off food stamps and repeal most of health care reform. (Except the Medicare savings, which Mr. Ryan has added to his deficit-reduction proposal.)

It would kill funding for high-speed rail, guaranteeing that the United States will never catch up to the rest of the world in public transportation. And it would cap Pell grants, guaranteeing that they will fall behind tuition inflation.
The budget is not merely terrible policy, but also bears no resemblance to what Americans want - at least judging from their rejection of the G.O.P. presidential ticket last year as well as more recent public opinion surveys.
Yesterday, House Speaker John Boehner crowed on Twitter about a new Marist/McClatchy poll. He claimed the survey shows that Americans prefer spending cuts to tax increases. But he read it wrong.
It's true that when asked in the broadest sense if they would prefer to reduce the deficit mostly by cutting government programs instead of mostly by raising taxes, Americans chose cutting 53-37 percent.
But when asked about specific kinds of government programs, respondents chose raising taxes over cutting Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, education and transportation. They said they would rather cut spending only when it comes to energy, the military and unemployment benefits.
Do you hear that, Mr. Ryan? A lot of Congressional Republicans want to cut jobless benefits, but they don't want to balance the budget at the expense of military contractors or the oil companies.
The divide between the people and the Republican party doesn't just exist on economic issues.
While Mr. Ryan was busy cooking up a budget that no one wants, his co-partisans were pushing against expanded background checks for gun purchases.
According to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, 91 percent of Americans support closing the so-called gun show loophole that lets about 40 percent of all gun sales go through without oversight. That includes 87 percent of Republicans and 91 percent of independents.

HEADLINE: Rome Tourism Rooting for an American Pope

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The papal conclave has provided a welcome off-season boost to visitor numbers in Rome. The tourism trade hopes the effect will last, with some favoring the election of a foreigner. 

 BODY:
ROME - The tourism industry here is mulling the possible ramifications of the Vatican conclave and some are crossing their fingers for the election of an American pope. 
The prospect of an influx of dollar-spending pilgrims would offer a welcome boost for an industry whose interest in the choice of next pontiff is understandably more secular than it is spiritual. 
"We're rooting for an American pope," La Reppublica headlined a report on Tuesday that quoted tourism sector workers who anticipated the positive impact on visitor numbers. 
"The word around the Vatican is that an American is best," according to the daily.
Hotel bookings went up more than 10 percent after Benedict XVI announced on February 11 that he was stepping down, providing an unanticipated boost in the tourism low season. One travel site reported a 60 percent increase in inquiries from Germany.
The 5,000 foreign journalists who have flown in for the conclave, as well as clergy from around the world, account for much of the immediate rise in visitor numbers.
The longer term effect on tourism, however, will probably depend on the nationality as well as the personality of Benedict's successor.
"If it's a pope from New Guinea, there probably wouldn't be a big influx," according to Giuseppe Roscioli of the Federalberghi hoteliers' association.
"If, on the other hand, it's a South American, or a Canadian or a European, there would certainly be a bigger influx," he told Il Sussidiario, a news Web site.
After the boom years of the superstar papacy of Pope John Paul II, Rome's religious tourism suffered leaner times during the reign of his less charismatic German successor, which coincided with the economic downturn.
Pictures of Pope John Paul, who died in 2005, still dominate souvenir stalls on the streets of Rome and the Vatican, alongside those of Benedict XVI.
Hoteliers looking for additional foreign visitors would prefer that the next pope not be an Italian. 
"A South American pope would be great. Or Mexico. In fact, anyone from the Americas," Antonio Galati, the manager director of a hotel near St. Peter's Square, told Agence France-Presse.
One American candidate for the papacy has already done his small bit for local tourism. TMNews quoted Archbishop Sean P. O'Malley of Boston as joking that it was difficult to eat badly in Rome.
On Tuesday, a major online bookmaker was offering 14-1 odds on Archbishop O'Malley and somewhat longer odds for the American cardinals Raymond L. Burke, the head of the Church's judicial authority, and Timothy M. Dolan, Archbishop of New York. 
And there was still time for Rome's hoteliers to place a bet.

HEADLINE: Statistics Challenge Cuomo's Claim of Record Job Growth

BYLINE: DANNY HAKIM


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo&#8217;s administration has pointed to the increase in New York&#8217;s private-sector jobs, yet the state lagged behind the nation during Mr. Cuomo&#8217;s time in office. 

 BODY:
ALBANY - Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's administration has boasted of New York's private-sector job growth "setting records." But the state actually slightly trailed the nation in private-sector job growth during the governor's first two years in office. 
The number of private-sector jobs increased by 4 percent in New York State from January 2011 to January 2013, according to the State Labor Department. Nationwide, over the same period, private sector jobs grew by 4.4 percent.
Those figures come despite the fact that New York State lost fewer jobs, as a percentage, than the nation did in the Great Recession. And they come as unemployment has fallen behind the national average on Mr. Cuomo's watch; as of January, New York State's unemployment rate (8.4 percent) still trailed the nation's (7.9 percent).
The data is potentially troublesome for Mr. Cuomo as he ponders a presidential run.
In a news release last week, the Labor Department emphasized that the state had a good month from December 2012 to January 2013, and it emphasized that private-sector jobs had been growing for a record 17 straight months coming off the downturn.
Howard Glaser, the governor's operations director, reacted sharply to reporters who raised questions about the overall job picture on Twitter. "Private sector job growth at record levels in NY (fact!)" he said in his own Twitter message. 
Edmund J. McMahon, director of theEmpire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative research group, said, "Judged objectively, it's not a great trend," adding, "I don't think a governor can make a significant difference in two years." 
"Then again, his administration is trying to act like they are making a difference, but the evidence doesn't support them," Mr. McMahon said. 
"Much of upstate is flat on its back and, really, the engine of growth more than ever is New York City," he said. "And even with that, we're not quite keeping pace with the national rate of growth."

HEADLINE: Even in Afghanistan, a Focus on Budget Battles of Washington

BYLINE: THOM SHANKER


HIGHLIGHT: At a recent town-hall-style meeting in Afghanistan with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, soldiers mostly wanted to hear about the budget battle back in Washington, and how spending cuts for the Pentagon would affect them. 

 BODY:
FORWARD OPERATING BASE FENTY, Afghanistan - The new defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, arrived at this rugged security outpost situated along a ratline of insurgent infiltration from Pakistan to talk to American troops about the war.
Instead, the soldiers wanted to hear only about the budget battle back in Washington - in particular, how steep reductions in spending for the Pentagon would affect their careers, their salaries and their health care benefits, and their eventual retirements.
Perhaps that could be viewed as a positive sign of the status of combat operations in Afghanistan. 
As Afghan forces take the lead in securing their own country, members of the 101st Airborne Division's First Brigade Combat Team were not so concerned about the quality of their body armor, or the details of counterinsurgency tactics, or whether there was a slackening of support for the war back home. Those are the sorts of things that usually come up when a defense secretary convenes a town-hall-style meeting with troops in the combat zone. 
In his opening remarks delivered this weekend at the forward operating base, located in Jalalabad, a strategic crossroads in eastern Nangarhar Province, Mr. Hagel discussed the war effort, of course, and thanked the troops for their service to the nation. And he pledged to always keep at the forefront the needs of America's service personnel and their families.
Then he opened up the dialogue to questions. Not a single one was about the war effort.
"Mr. Secretary," came the first question, "with the high unemployment rate facing our veterans of our Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, what is - what are we doing to help veterans as they transition out of the military and back into the civil sector to be successful?"
The second query to Mr. Hagel went straight at the across-the-board spending cuts, known as sequestration, and their impact on the military.
"Mr. Secretary," the soldier asked, "how will sequestration affect military P.C.S. movements?" The initials P.C.S. are military shorthand for "permanent change of station," the official term for being given a new assignment at a new location as members of the military advance their careers.
The next question went to a specific category of military spending, in particular whether a partner in a same-sex relationship with a member of the armed services would be receiving the full set of benefits traditionally given to spouses.
Following that was a question on "budget cuts and the downsizing of the military," followed by a final question on "how is everything going on in Congress right now going to affect us that are about to retire?"
"I think you all are aware of what's going on in Washington with sequestration," Mr. Hagel said. "We are required to take a cut in our budget. We are managing that. We are dealing with it. We will continue to manage with those realities."
But he acknowledged that the shifting budgetary foundation for the Pentagon "affects everything; it affects all of our programs." He told the soldiers that he and the military chiefs were committed to assuring that "our readiness continues to stay as active and alert and essential as at any time. And so we are adjusting in training, steaming time, flight time, areas that don't affect directly our men and women in uniform and our readiness."
The defense secretary did not try to dissuade the troops from fearing that sequestration was a serious problem. "If it continues, it'll be more and more difficult for us to do what we are required to do, and that is to assure the security of America around the world," he said. 
"We will work through it," Mr. Hagel concluded, "and we'll continue to work with the Congress on ways to make sure that that certainty of security is there, and will continue to be there."

HEADLINE: Representatives Release Carbon Emissions Tax Plan

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: The proposal imposes a fee on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, factories, refineries and other major sources. 

 BODY:
Almost exactly four years after unveiling his doomed cap-and-trade proposal to deal with global warming, Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, released a new plan on Tuesday to address climate change and federal budget woes: a tax on carbon emissions. 
Mr. Waxman, joined by Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, and Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, both Democrats, distributed a relatively simple proposal to impose a fee on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, factories, refineries and other major sources. The idea of a carbon tax, long favored by many economists as the most straightforward way of deterring pollution, has been kicking around the Capitol for years, but has never gained a broad following.
The plan contains three potential per-ton prices for carbon pollution, $15, $25 or $30, and a range of annual cost increases from 2 percent to 8 percent a year to ensure that greenhouse gas levels continue to decline over time.
The new proposal would return most of the revenue from the new tax to the public through utility rebates, federal deficit reduction, payments to displaced workers or investments in clean-energy projects.
"Putting a price on carbon could help solve two of the nation's biggest challenges: preventing climate change and reducing the budget deficit," Mr. Waxman said in a news release. "There have been carbon tax proposals made by others. What's unique about this one is its novel design. We are seeking to craft a system in which each agency does what they are good at and that minimizes compliance burdens and administrative costs. Utilities, oil companies and other major sources are already reporting their emissions to E.P.A. We build off of this existing program."
The draft legislation being circulated by the lawmakers covers only 11 pages, vastly smaller than Mr. Waxman's cap-and-trade bill, which grew to 1,200 pages after months of horse-trading and concessions to special interests before it passed the House in June 2009.
That bill, strongly supported by President Obama, never got a hearing in the Senate and the idea of a national approach to climate change fell by the wayside.
In his second Inaugural Address and his recent State of the Union speech, the president has renewed discussion of climate change, citing record temperatures and destructive storms fed by growing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. 
The president has specifically ruled out proposing a carbon tax, however, and it is unclear whether he would support the Waxman-Whitehouse approach, should it make any progress in Congress.

HEADLINE: Arizona Governor Introduces Bill to Expand Medicaid

BYLINE: FERNANDA SANTOS


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Jan Brewer stepped to the lectern under blazing sunshine and before a mostly friendly audience to introduce a Medicaid expansion bill she has championed. 

 BODY:
PHOENIX - Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona stepped to the lectern on Tuesday under blazing sunshine and before a mostly friendly audience to introduce a Medicaid expansion bill she has championed. 
In her brief remarks, Ms. Brewer twice used the word "conservative" to describe Arizona's Medicaid program, a managed-care system whose cost per patient is $680 less than the national average, and the bill she was endorsing, which would extend Medicaid coverage to anyone who made up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line.
Politically, it is a risky proposition in a state where Republicans are the majority in the legislature and where ideals like small government and small taxes are enough to carry people into elected office. And the proposal puts Ms. Brewer, an aggressive opponent of President Obama's policies, in a position of advocating one of the central pillars of his health care law.
Ms. Brewer had her way of packaging the news, though, saying that she is "proud to be a member of a pro-life party" and that being pro-life is exactly what expanding Medicaid - or restoring it, as she and her advisers have described it - is all about. (The state used to provide coverage for childless adults who made up to 100 percent of the federal poverty line, but discontinued it as a way to cut costs during the recession.) 
The event, well choreographed and on time, brought together cancer survivors, advocates for the mentally ill, doctors in smocks and other supporters, who carried signs that read: "The math makes sense. Restore." It came one day after a committee of senators in Florida handed a defeat to the state's governor, Rick Scott, by rejecting his idea to expand Medicaid.
If approved in Arizona, the expansion would bring in $8 billion to the state over the next four years and provide "a lifeline to rural hospitals," which are struggling under the weight of caring for the uninsured who seek care in their emergency rooms, Ms. Brewer said.
It would also keep roughly 60,000 childless adults from being dropped off the rolls by Jan. 1 - including those who lost their jobs during the recession and are "one serious illness away from disaster," she said.
Opponents have said Arizona would be better off if it opted out of the expansion, an important part of Mr. Obama's health care overhaul, and sought to reform its Medicaid program on its own. There is also strong resistance among Republican legislators to an assessment - or a tax, depending on whom you ask - that would be charged to hospitals to offset the state's share of the costs of the program.
Ms. Brewer and her team of supporters - more than 110 groups have come to her side, including associations representing hospitals, doctors and even county sheriffs - have been working hard to get just enough support for the bill. Some legislators have been making their way through the Capitol carrying a list of eight Republican senators the governor believes she can get on her side.

HEADLINE: Choice for Tight Times: Save More or Take On More Risk

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
BUILDING an investment portfolio that produces enough income to live on is one of the main goals of retirement planning, but lately the goal posts have shifted. With interest rates stuck near record lows, retirees must have more saved up to produce the same income through the usual high-quality investments, like Treasury bonds, or else they must venture into assets with higher yields but potentially higher risk
An alternative approach that financial advisers increasingly find appealing is to replace lost income with greater flexibility. Instead of seeking to generate more income, they say, investors should acquire a mix of assets that can produce greater total return -- income plus capital growth -- from which to finance retirement needs. 
''Investors have to look beyond the old strategy and realize that they're being constrained by the idea that they should never sell principal,'' said David Kelly, chief market strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds. ''They should take systematic withdrawals from their portfolio, whether they come from dividend income, coupon payments or from selling appreciated growth stocks.''
If that seems like a risky proposition -- what if growth stocks depreciate? -- Lex Zaharoff, head of the Investment Lab at Citi Private Bank, an in-house portfolio analysis group, suggests that a heavy concentration in bonds comes with its own hazards, starting with a lack of diversification.
''The danger of being overly focused on boosting yields is that some investors fall into the trap of boosting yields by a single dimension,'' he said. ''If they own longer-dated bonds, they're taking on risk if rates go up suddenly.''
What can make a fixation on income especially risky nowadays is that while many advisers have begun to take a more ''holistic, multidimensional approach,'' Mr. Zaharoff said, the quest for income by others with a more traditional approach has pushed prices too high and yields too low on many investments. ''Valuations matter,'' he said.
They also matter to Christopher M. Zelesnick, senior managing director at Ziegler Wealth Management in Chicago, who likewise finds few palatable options among income-producing assets. He considers it sensible to own high-yield corporate bonds, for instance, in anticipation of rising interest rates and an economic revival, the sort of backdrop that is anathema to Treasury issues, but lofty valuations are putting him off.
''High-yield bonds perform well if the economy is improving,'' he said. ''The problem today is that a lot of investors have run to that side of the fence and lowered yields below where they should be.''
Jordan Waxman, managing director of the financial advisory firm HighTower in New York, acknowledges that decent income is harder to achieve. Yet he detects it in enough corners of the markets, and with acceptable levels of risk, for retirees to avoid having to dip into their capital.
''With the caveat that you can't squeeze blood from a stone,'' he said, ''I would be in the camp that you should secure cash flow from investments to the extent that you can do that. There are areas that might be overlooked that can still get you where you need to go.''
The destination he has in mind is an average yield of 5 to 6 percent. His preferred vehicles include two that offer tax advantages that inflate investors' net yields: high-yield municipal bonds and master limited partnerships, which are businesses engaged mainly in oil and gas transportation -- the type of partnerships he favors -- and production.
Mr. Waxman also likes blue-chip stocks that pay big dividends. If that seems like a perilous choice with the stock market at multiyear highs, he points out that different kinds of stocks have enjoyed the rally to different degrees.
''The stock market has had a very nice recovery led by low-quality companies,'' he said. ''Most financially stable, rock-solid companies have not participated as much. Prices are similar to where they were 13 years ago.''
Higher-yielding stocks are a popular choice among investment advisers, whichever retirement-planning philosophy they adhere to, because they allow investors to have their cake and eat it, too.
''Dividend-paying stocks have yields close to 10-year Treasury yields, and in addition they have growth prospects,'' Mr. Zelesnick said. ''As a business does better it can increase its dividend.''
Mr. Zaharoff is a fan of stocks with healthy yields, too, particularly ''well-regarded global companies that have strong franchises and plenty of cash,'' he said. ''You want companies to be growing profitably and choosing to distribute some of that back in dividends.''
When trying to find the right mix of assets to produce a suitable mix of income and growth, investment advisers recommend using a professional because of the need to juggle the various market niches along with the needs and wants of investors. Which sort of professional is best depends on the approach an investor wants to take.
''There are two approaches,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''Work with a financial adviser to put together an appropriate portfolio, explaining what your risk tolerances and income needs are, and let the adviser figure out whether you're going to be selling assets to derive that income. Another way to go is to buy a broad asset-allocation mutual fund and set it up to take withdrawals every month.''
He considers a global income fund, with holdings in many markets and asset classes, to be a particularly good option, but he stresses to investors that how they put their money into the markets has nothing to do with how they take it back out.
''They should separate the distribution part from the strategic-allocation part,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''They're two separate issues. People often get them confused.''

HEADLINE: In and Out, Off and On

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
IT'S not your grandfather's retirement, not nearly as cut and dried. It's not the simple picture of stopping work at 60 or 65, moving to Florida and devoting oneself to golf and bridge -- not that it was ever totally that.
Nowadays retirement is all over the map. It's blurred, more elastic. Many people retire piecemeal. Or they retire and then unretire. Or they continue working well after they were supposed to have retired.
As part of a fast-changing retirement picture, many Americans leave their longtime job, but then, fearing that their Social Security benefits and nest egg will prove too small, plunge into part-time work -- as a consultant, say, or a salesclerk at a big-box store. Others step down from career jobs but then conclude, after a year or two, that they are bored and want to start their own businesses. So they unretire and become entrepreneurs.
Not long ago, it seems, the typical American's goal was to retire at 58, 60, 62 -- certainly no later than 65. But now, more workers are pushing back retirement to 68, 70, 72 and even later. 
Some delay retirement because they are still healthy and love to work. But many put it off instead because their 401(k)'s are so puny, or because their medical bills, even with Medicare, are so high. Or some delay because their stock portfolios haven't fully recovered from Wall Street's swoon five years ago, despite new highs set on the stock market last week -- nominal records spurred by low-interest-rate policies that have at the same time hurt retirement savings.
Some baby boomers understand all too well why they are called the sandwich generation: they need to continue working far longer than they intended, either because the bill for sending their children to college is so steep or because the cost of keeping a parent in a nursing home is so high -- or both.
Another twist is that many more Americans are living into their late 80s and 90s -- and many of them are outliving their retirement savings. Some companies are rushing to plug this hole by offering annuities that don't begin until age 80 or 85. The retirement picture in the United States has become so fluid that one survey found that while 43 percent of Americans say they can't wait to retire, 41 percent don't expect to ever retire at all.
''There's no consensus on what retirement is anymore,'' said Marcie Pitt-Catsouphes, director of the Sloan Center on Aging and Work at Boston College. ''We're starting to rethink it. Truly, today's grandparents are not like my grandparents. The experience of aging is different. People say, 'I'm not done yet.' ''
That's certainly the case for Leon Burzynski, 71, an electrician for 35 years before retiring from full-time work eight years ago. Mr. Burzynski, a father of seven who lives in Pewaukee, Wis., said his Social Security benefits and $16,000 yearly pension were not enough to pay for living expenses, a secondary health insurance plan and the elder hostel vacations that he and his wife love to take.
So he has taken on two part-time jobs, earning about $4,000 a year doing bookkeeping for several small companies and $6,000 a year helping with returns during the peak tax season at an accounting firm where one of his sons is a managing partner.
''On one hand, I would like not to have to work, and on the other hand, it gives me something to do,'' Mr. Burzynski said. ''It's kind of yin and yang. It allows my wife and me to maintain the quality of life that's consistent with what we've always loved -- to go to the theater, the symphony and to take trips.''
While retirement has assumed myriad forms across the country, many economists and other experts on retirement see some common, increasingly worrisome trends. A growing number of workers are convinced they will not have a comfortable retirement. A Boston College study in October found that 53 percent of Americans were ''at risk'' of being unable to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living once they retire, up from 30 percent in 1989. A study last May by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that 44 percent may not have enough money to meet their basic needs in retirement.
It is well known that many workers live paycheck to paycheck and find it hard to save much for retirement. A result is that one-third of retirees in the United States rely solely on Social Security, with benefits averaging just over $15,000 a year for an individual and $30,000 for a couple.
A generation ago, most workers with employer-based retirement plans were enrolled in traditional pension plans promising a monthly stipend for life after retirement. Now, just 26 percent of all workers are in such pension plans, including 17 percent of private-sector workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most people whose employers offer retirement plans are enrolled in 401(k)'s instead, and 58 percent of workers are not participating in an employer-based retirement plan, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
Most American workers with 401(k) plans save far too little to assure an adequate retirement. The Federal Reserve found that the typical household with workers aged 55 to 64 had a combined $120,000 in 401(k)'s and Individual Retirement Accounts. If that amount were used for an annuity, it would pay out only $6,000 or so a year. Added to the average Social Security benefit, that would come to just $21,000 a year in retirement income for an individual, or $36,000 for a couple with both receiving Social Security.
If America's vision of retirement might once have been called ''On Golden Pond,'' it would now more likely be called ''On Thin Ice.''
''If you look at my parents' time, the rules were pretty simple: you got a job, you stayed in that job and when you got to 65 or so, you stopped working, and the money kept coming in through your pension and you had a nice nest egg, and that was the program,'' said Neil Kelliher, who, at 71, continues to work as an executive consultant in New York. ''It happened with nearly everybody. Then our generation came along, and somewhere along the line they moved the cheese.''
Retirement experts seem unanimous on one piece of advice: most American workers, whether in their 30s or their 60s, have two choices if they want to assure they have enough to retire on. They must either save more or work more years than they planned, and if they do neither, their retirement future may be bleak indeed.
''The baby boomer generation is the first generation of Americans that will probably do worse than their parents in keeping their standard of living in retirement,'' said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School.
Among the reasons, she said, is that compared with their parents' generation, fewer retirees today have traditional pensions, and far more have mortgages and sizable credit-card debt.
No doubt such a downbeat retirement outlook will puzzle many of those heartened by the stock market's new highs. But many economists say the soaring market mainly benefits households in the top fifth by income, while those in the bottom two-fifths are hardly helped because they own very little in stocks, directly or indirectly.
''It's certainly good to have the stock market move up,'' said Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, the nation's leading research center on retirement. She said Wall Street's surge had probably lifted the average retirement savings in households with workers aged 55 to 64 to $135,000 from the $120,000 that the Federal Reserve reported.
''The difference between $120,000 and $135,000 is very, very small, considering people's needs for retirement,'' Dr. Munnell said. ''The big problem is people need multiples of their income to have any chance of security in retirement. Generally, their balances equal one times their income. So $135,000 is some improvement, but it's not a lot.''
Many retirement experts say Americans, at least those who don't have pensions, need to save eight to 12 times their annual income to assure a comfortable retirement. That can mean anything from $400,000 to far more than $1 million. A new study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that just 22 percent of households with workers aged 55 to 64 had retirement savings of more than $250,000.
Dr. Munnell said the retirement picture is also complicated by the good news of increasing longevity. ''The expected life expectancy when one turns 65 is another 20 years,'' she said. Indeed, for couples retiring at age 65, there is a 50 percent chance that one spouse will live to 92.
''That means many of us have to support ourselves for 20 years or more with no wage income coming in,'' she said. ''We can't afford to do that. We have to make that period shorter. That's why I'm a maniac about saying people have to work longer.''
Many have gotten the message. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 26 percent of Americans say they do not plan to retire until age 70 or later, up from 12 percent in 2002. And just 24 percent say they plan to retire before age 65, down from 50 percent two decades ago.
Miguel Gaona had hoped to retire at 65. That was five years ago. But every day around 8 a.m., he can still be seen opening up his barbershop in Bethesda, Md.
The reason he hasn't retired is simple, he explained: ''Not enough money saved up.'' Mr. Gaona, who emigrated from Paraguay in 1972, said he had saved less than he had hoped because he had a child in college and because ''there is a lot of competition in the barber business all over Bethesda.''
Mr. Gaona, who runs the barbershop with his wife, Maria, and a nephew, said he planned to retire in two years, at 72. But even then, he might not. ''I love working,'' he said. ''I enjoy people.''
By contrast, Jeff Bastable retired according to plan -- two Thursdays ago, at 66. That evening, he visited his 93-year-old mother and then headed out on a Caribbean cruise. Mr. Bastable, a Syracuse resident who spent decades as a hospital executive before becoming a top fund-raiser for the American Cancer Society, does not foresee a retirement of golf for himself.
Rather, he and his wife, Susan, who founded the nursing department at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, have gotten involved with charities in Africa. They recently traveled to Ghana with 12 nurses to provide expertise and teach at hospitals and clinics.
''It was a profound experience,'' said Mr. Bastable, who said he and his wife had solid pensions and retirement savings. ''There are lot of things on my list to do. I want to make the world a tad better. I'm already working on a number of things to follow up on this Ghana experience.''
Sara Rix, an analyst at the AARP Public Policy Institute, said one reason many people were working longer was that they realized they were living longer than previous generations. ''People tend to underestimate how long they're going to live,'' Ms. Rix said. ''In the back of people's minds, what's percolating is, 'I might not die at 82. I may hang on past 82. What am I going to live on?' They read about people staying in the labor force longer. That's making people begin to re-evaluate what they're doing. They're telling themselves, 'Maybe I should be doing the same thing.' ''
Seeing this increase in longevity, some financial companies are pushing a new type of annuity that can help retirees who live longer than they expected -- and longer than it takes for them to draw down their nest egg. These annuities, commonly called longevity insurance, are often structured so that they do not begin making monthly payments until one reaches 80 or 85.
Some retirement experts say such insurance is a good idea, for instance, for those who worry that they might spend down their 401(k) by their 80s. An ''advanced life deferred annuity'' allows retirees to fine-tune how to spend their retirement savings, knowing that these payments will kick in at a certain point. The downside is that people who may pay $50,000 or more in premiums to have an annuity begin at age 85 may die before then.
''It's all about having absolute confidence that you have a sustainable strategy,'' said Matt Grove, vice president in charge of annuity products at the insurer New York Life. ''We basically give the money from those who die early to those who die late. That means everyone gets a higher income than they would be able to have on their own.''
When it comes to retirement, Jack VanDerhei, research director at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, sees a tale of two Americas: one of fortunate workers whose employers offer retirement plans, whether traditional pensions or 401(k)'s with matching employer contributions, and one of unlucky workers who do not get a major boost from employers to have an adequate retirement plan.
''There's a huge bifurcation between those who have worked a long time for such employers and those who haven't, and it's going to be hard for those who haven't,'' Mr. VanDerhei said.
Maureen O'Brien, who retired last year at 65, is one of the lucky ones. She was the top tax auditor for the state of Alaska for a decade and later became head of tax compliance for a $400 million trucking company.
In the late 1990s, Ms. O'Brien said, she was planning to retire in 2000 or so, around age 53, helped by a stock portfolio of more than $1 million. But then the tech bubble burst, and her portfolio plunged by two-thirds.
In 2007, history repeated itself. She was again thinking of retiring, at age 60. But then, she said, ''the market went down so much, it took probably half my savings. That's when I went to work for the trucking company.''
But now she is happily retired, having spent a two-month vacation last year on the French Riviera. She nonetheless works one month a year for the trucking company, doing its tax returns for 40 different states -- not because she needs the money, but out of loyalty.
Despite her hefty retirement portfolio, Ms. O'Brien still worries. ''Having been through two stock market dives, you always know that's a possibility,'' she said. And if that happens again, she says, she might just unretire.

HEADLINE: Dispute Over a Balanced Budget Is Philosophical as Much as Fiscal

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- What is so special about a balanced budget?
That question is at the heart of the warring Republican and Democratic budget plans coming out this week -- with Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin vowing to eliminate the federal deficit within 10 years, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington State setting a more modest goal of bringing spending closer in line with revenue over time.
While economists generally agree that narrowing the government's deficit and limiting the size of the debt are necessary in the long run, most argue that balancing the budget would not restore the nation's still-weak economy to health in the near term. Indeed, rushing to do so with unemployment still elevated and the economy growing at only a sluggish pace could even set back the effort to reduce the deficit.
''There's nothing magic about exact balance,'' said Alice M. Rivlin, a Democratic economist at the Brookings Institution who has worked with Republicans like former Senator Pete V. Domenici on bipartisan deficit-reduction proposals. ''The really important thing is to keep the debt from growing faster than the economy.'' 
The question of whether to balance the budget and when is a new staging ground in the long-running fiscal fight between Republicans and the White House. Mr. Ryan, whose previous budget proposals did not bring spending below revenue for decades, vowed this time to do so by 2023, in part to satisfy the demands of the more conservative members of the Republican Caucus.
Democratic proposals -- both the Senate Democratic plan to be released on Wednesday and the White House budget coming next month -- are both expected to narrow the deficit substantially without balancing the budget or running a surplus.
This week, each side accused the other of fiscal imprudence. Republicans accused the White House of ''never'' balancing the budget, and Mr. Ryan argued that ending deficits would foster a healthier and faster-growing economy.
''This is an invitation. Show us how to balance the budget,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''If you don't like the way we're proposing to balance our budget, how do you propose to balance the budget?''
Democrats argued that Mr. Ryan's budget would balance only on the backs of the poor, cutting taxes for the wealthy while eviscerating the social safety net. Mr. Ryan's plan does not ''plausibly deal with deficit reduction,'' Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday. ''It is important to bring our deficits down and to reduce our deficit-to-G.D.P. But they are part of -- those goals are part of the broader purpose here, which is to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class.''
Economists offered more nuanced views. Closing the budget gap over the longer term could be vital to sustaining economic health, some stressed, by ensuring that the government did not crowd out private investment and by helping to keep interest rates low. But that does not make it an immediate necessity.
''Over a long period of time, you'd have a higher standard of living if you moved to a balanced budget and stayed there,'' said Joel Prakken, a senior managing director at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis. ''But you suffer some short-run pain, and you don't want to inflict that when the unemployment rate is already high, the economy is still recovering from the legacy of the Great Recession, and the Federal Reserve has used up most of what's in its quiver.''
Other goals -- including stabilizing debt as a proportion of economic output, rationalizing the tax code and tackling the long-term fiscal challenge posed by entitlement programs -- might prove more important in the coming years, several experts said.
''We need to do fundamental reforms to the system, and if we did fundamental reforms to the system, that would help so much that we wouldn't need to worry about the deficit as much,'' said Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard.
As sensible as a balanced budget might sound -- much like a balanced checkbook for a family -- countries are generally able to run modest deficits for years on end while still keeping debt stable as a share of economic output. One year's deficit is effectively paid off by later economic growth, especially if a government is investing in public goods like roads and schools.
But several right-leaning fiscal experts described a balanced budget as a tool to force a fractious Congress to tackle the nation's long-term budget problems.
''It is important to reduce the debt, and balancing gets you there faster,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a prominent Republican economist. ''That's paramount.''
He said a balanced budget is a goal everyone could understand. ''It gives Congress a way to say no,'' he said. ''Transparency and political buy-in are important, and people understand balanced budgets. It has a lot of virtues.''
The Senate Democratic proposal does not balance the budget, but it does reduce deficits to below 3 percent of economic output -- a level that would stabilize the debt, economists said. During the 10-year budget window, the debt would start to shrink as a proportion of the economy.
Mr. Ryan's budget balances by 2023. It keeps the current levels of projected tax revenue, and makes ambitious if lightly detailed cuts in a wide variety of domestic government programs, including turning the Medicaid program into a block grant to states.
A broader question, economists said, is the long-term effect the country's debt load might impose on the economy. In the past few years, a number of broad-based studies have suggested that having government debt equivalent to or greater than about 85 or 90 percent of economic output might eventually cut into growth. Currently, public debt in the United States is about 76 percent of the size of the economy. Including debts the government owes itself, like in the Social Security Trust Fund, the total load is in fact bigger than a whole year's economic output.
''The people who say the debt is irrelevant -- that's going too far,'' said Mr. Rogoff, who along with Carmen Reinhart of Harvard produced a study of the interplay between debt and growth. ''It's a very rarefied air that we're in already. And it could be a problem. You can't turn your debt around in a year, and you cannot reduce debt quickly and easily.''
The handful of balanced budgets achieved in the past four decades have tended to be the result of a strong economy. The surpluses of the late 1990s, for instance, came about in no small part because of unexpectedly strong economic growth and a bubble in the stock market, as well as tax increases and spending cuts during the Clinton administration.
Now, how and whether to get back to a balanced budget seems to be a new fight between Democrats and Republicans.
''It will generate a debate over the appropriate goal of long-term fiscal policy,'' wrote William A. Galston of the Brookings Institution in an analysis of Mr. Ryan's budget plan. ''Is it to eliminate the deficit and the debt, to ensure that the debt does not rise as a share of G.D.P., or something in between?''

HEADLINE: Non-Communist Parties Lend China an Air of Pluralism, Without the Mess

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Patrick Zuo and Shi Da contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- For those accustomed to the partisan jousting that frequently paralyzes Washington, the feel-good unity displayed last week by the leaders of China's eight so-called democratic parties was eye-opening.
One after another, the men and women who head political organizations with names like the China Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy took turns extolling the nation's economic progress, the leadership's unswerving commitment to environmental protection and, above all, the perfection of single-party rule.
''We will strive to construct a beautiful China, to contribute wisdom and strength for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve a new victory for socialism with Chinese characteristics,'' Chen Zhu, chairman of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, said during a news conference. It coincided with the opening of the National People's Congress, the annual gathering of 3,000 handpicked delegates who invariably approve the legislation put before them by the Communist Party leadership.
Largely invisible much of the year, China's non-Communist parties are thrust to the fore each March for a display of what the official news media calls China's system of ''multiparty cooperation and political consultation.'' 
The news conference, held in a gilded meeting room in the Great Hall of the People, is an Orwellian affair, with party leaders referring to the wonders of ''democratic centralization,'' heaping praise on the Communist Party and then answering fawning questions from the state media.
The parties, some created by Communist strategists during the civil war of the 1940s, bear little resemblance to political organizations elsewhere. For example, they cannot field candidates for public office. Their activities, which include banquets, conventions and the occasional overseas state visit, are wholly financed by the Communist Party.
''They are fake parties, just a mirage created for the benefit of ordinary people, although most people are not fooled,'' said Jin Zhong, editor in chief of Open Magazine, a Hong Kong political journal. ''People who join them have a fantasy that they can influence the Communist Party.''
Such sentiments are vehemently rejected by the organizations' leaders, who say the system works just fine, providing the government with detailed proposals and measured advice from those outside the Communist Party. Asked whether he hoped China might one day embrace multiparty elections, Wan Exiang, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said such questions betrayed a Western fixation with electoral democracy.
The Chinese people, he said, crave the growth and stability that have accompanied single-party rule -- or at least the last three decades of relative placidity that followed the 30 years of social chaos and economic stagnation wrought by the Communist Party under Mao Zedong.
''We once had more than 300 parties in the early stage of the Republic of China, and the consequences were rivalry among political parties and warlords, and national disintegration,'' he said. ''China could never have obtained such brilliant economic success today if we followed that kind of political system.''
The parties are not entirely empty shells. They raise money for college scholarships, study social problems and issue detailed reports that are submitted to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the advisory body that meets alongside the National People's Congress, which ends on Sunday. Recent proposals that party delegates have offered include a call to save historic wartime relics in Chongqing and a call to improve ophthalmological care for residents of China's far west.
Zhou Zhongxiao, 30, an executive at an online dating site in Beijing, said his participation in the China Democratic League had provided an outlet for promoting his pet project: the preservation of traditional wedding rituals. ''We provide a useful service by helping the ruling party govern the country,'' he said, adding with impatience, ''Why does a party always have to be seeking political power?''
Managed and financed by the Communist Party, the alternative parties are in some ways an ingenious attempt to neutralize would-be opponents among the educated urban elite while parrying critics who describe China as a single-party dictatorship. Like China's state-run trade unions and officially sanctioned religious organizations, the parties are the handiwork of the United Front Work Department, the party apparatus that seeks to co-opt segments of society that could one day congeal into an organized opposition. Just to be safe, the Communist Party ''lends'' some of its members to the eight democratic parties. In recent years, those daring to try to establish truly independent political parties were promptly jailed on charges of subversion.
Formed in the years before the Communists came to power, the parties fought against the Japanese and later sought a peaceful resolution to war between Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist army and Mao's rebels. When a victorious Mao called on the eight parties to join his inaugural consultative conference, they obliged, only to be swiftly subsumed by the Communist leadership.
The arrangement has had its hiccups. In 1957, after Mao encouraged public criticism during his Hundred Flowers Campaign and then persecuted those who took the bait, the parties were viciously suppressed.
Revived after Mao's death in 1976, the parties have grown to more than 700,000 members, up from 170,000 in the mid-1980s. The Communist Party's membership, by contrast, exceeds 80 million.
Joining one of the democratic parties is not easy. Prospective members must be recommended by at least two current party members, but more important they must hail from the so-called intelligentsia -- academics, scientists and artists -- or China's growing entrepreneurial class.
In addition to providing the Communist Party with a vehicle for assimilating would-be adversaries, the parties give their members an ego boost, opportunities for career advancement and perhaps a chance to hobnob at the annual consultative congress in Beijing, said Joseph Cheng, a political scientist at the City University of Hong Kong. said Joseph Cheng, a political scientist at the City University of Hong Kong. ''For a segment of the political elite that does not want to join the Communist Party, it can be an attractive way to get ahead,'' he said.
Many members agree. Wang Tongchun, 37, an advertising executive from the coastal Jiangsu Province, said his time as a member of the China Democratic National Construction Association had been a networking bonanza. ''It gives you social status and a sense of belonging,'' he said, all for dues of about $16 a year.
Others have found the experience less fulfilling. Liu Ming, 33, a lawyer and self-described liberal dreamer from the city of Changsha in Hunan Province, said he wanted to get involved in politics but had avoided the Communist Party ''because I wanted a clean conscience.'' Still, he complained that membership in the China Association for Promoting Democracy had yet to provide any opportunities for advancing his passion for judicial reform. ''I still feel like I'm a lone voice in the wilderness,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Preventing An Arctic Cold War

BYLINE: By PAUL ARTHUR BERKMAN. 
Paul Arthur Berkman, a biological oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is the author of ''Environmental Security in the Arctic Ocean: Promoting Co-operation and Preventing Conflict.''

 BODY:
JUST a quarter-century ago, and for millenniums before that, the Arctic Ocean was covered year-round by ice, creating an impregnable wilderness that humans rarely negotiated. Today, as the effects of global warming are amplified in the high north, most of the ocean is open water during the summer and covered by ice only in the winter.
This unexpected transformation has radically altered the stakes for the Arctic, especially for the eight nations and indigenous peoples that surround it. But while there has been cooperation on extracting the region's oil, gas and mineral deposits, and exploiting its fisheries, there has been little effort to develop legal mechanisms to prevent or adjudicate conflict. The potential for such conflict is high, even though tensions are now low. 
Several countries, along with corporations like ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, are preparing to exploit the region's enormous oil and natural gas reserves. New shipping routes will compete with the Panama and Suez Canals. Vast fisheries are being opened to commercial harvesting, without regulation. Coastal areas that are home to indigenous communities are eroding into the sea. China and the European Union are among non-Arctic governments rushing to assert their interests in the region. Some states have increased military personnel and equipment there.
The most fundamental challenge for the Arctic states is to promote cooperation and prevent conflict. Both are essential, but a forum for achieving those goals does not yet exist.
In 1996, eight countries -- the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark (which manages the foreign affairs and defense of Greenland) -- and groups representing indigenous peoples established the Arctic Council to chart the region's future. So far, this high-level forum has identified sustainable development and environmental protection as ''common Arctic issues.'' But another crucial concern -- maintaining the peace -- was shelved in the talks that led to the council's creation. The fear then, as now, was that peace implied demilitarization. It doesn't. But if these nations are still too timid to discuss peace in the region when tensions are low, how will they possibly cooperate to ease conflicts if they arise?
Since 2006, each of the Arctic nations has adopted its own security policy to safeguard its sovereign rights. What they must do now is compare their separate security policies, identify the ways in which those policies reinforce or conflict with one another, and then balance national interests with common interests.
How, for instance, will each nation position its military and police its territory? How will the Arctic states deal with China and other nations that have no formal jurisdictional claims but have strong interests in exploiting Arctic resources? How will Arctic and non-Arctic states work together to manage those resources beyond national jurisdictions, on the high seas and in the deep sea? Without ratifying the Convention on the Law of the Sea, a 1982 treaty governing use of the world's oceans, how can the United States cooperate with other nations to resolve territorial disputes in the ocean?
NATO's top military commander, Adm. James G. Stavridis of the United States Navy, warned in 2010 of an ''icy slope toward a zone of competition, or worse, a zone of conflict'' if the world's leaders failed to ensure Arctic peace.
Whether it is through the Arctic Council or another entity, there needs to be a forum for discussing peace and stability, not just environmental and economic issues. We need ''rules of the road'' to take us safely into the Arctic's future.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose economy is reliant on its rich deposits of oil and natural gas, clearly understands the benefits of a northern sea route and of the hydrocarbon deposits on his nation's continental shelf, and has emphasized the importance of peace and cooperation in the Arctic. So have leaders of other Arctic nations. But we have heard virtually nothing from President Obama, even as he has made the dangers of a warming earth a priority of his second term.
At an Arctic Council meeting in Tromso, Norway, last year, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, said ''the world increasingly looks to the North'' but did not go much further. She called for ''responsible management of resources'' and efforts ''to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change.''
As the head of an Arctic superpower and a Nobel laureate, Mr. Obama should convene an international meeting with President Putin and other leaders of Arctic nations to ensure that economic development at the top of the world is not only sustainable, but peaceful.

HEADLINE: 2 Parties' Budgets Show Big Rift As G.O.P. Renews 2012 Proposals

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and JONATHAN WEISMAN; Mark Landler and Jada F. Smith contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats and House Republicans on Tuesday outlined vastly divergent approaches to shoring up the government's finances, a reminder of how far apart they remain on fiscal policy even as both sides insist publicly that a bipartisan compromise is possible.
As part of the effort to find common ground, President Obama made a rare appearance at a gathering of Democratic senators -- his first of four meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week -- to explore ways that the two parties could overcome differences that have deadlocked the budget process for much of the last five years.
But in many ways, the two parties seemed to be working in parallel universes.
House Republicans, led by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, presented a tax and spending plan that relies on many of the same policies that became lightning rods for critics during the 2012 presidential campaign, when Mr. Ryan was the party's vice-presidential nominee. At the White House, a senior administration official said that the Republican budget demonstrated how complicated negotiations would be. 
The Republican plan sets out to balance the budget in a decade and would cut spending by $4.6 trillion through 2023, in large part by rolling back many of Mr. Obama's signature legislative accomplishments. It would repeal the health care overhaul of 2009, eliminate the subsidized insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion that make up the core of the law, and turn Medicare into a system of private insurance plans financed by federal vouchers.
Republicans would also do away with Wall Street regulatory laws that Mr. Obama championed and cancel the financing his administration sought for a high-speed rail network.
Senate Democrats, meanwhile, were pressing forward with a budget they planned to start moving through the committee process on Wednesday. Before they could proceed, they had to set aside differences among themselves over how much to change costly but cherished federal benefit programs. When Mr. Obama met with them on Tuesday, several voiced concerns about cuts to Social Security and Medicare.
The Democrats' budget plan will not call for adjusting the way inflation is calculated as a way to lower the future cost of those benefits, though Mr. Obama has said such a change should be on the table in talks with Republicans.
In stark contrast to the austerity measures and dismantling of top Obama administration priorities that are at the center of the Republican plan, the Democrats' budget would create new government initiatives, expand others and seek to generate more tax revenue.
Their proposal calls for a new $100 billion economic stimulus initiative for job training and repair to roads and bridges, projects that Democrats say they would pay for by closing loopholes in the tax code that benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals. All told, Democrats believe they can save nearly $1 trillion through such tax changes.
They would save an additional $1 trillion by trimming spending, with a quarter of those cuts coming from the Pentagon.
But as lawmakers on Tuesday began their budget deliberations for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, a stopgap measure to finance the government until then ran into trouble in the Senate as Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans, raised objections, saying it included wasteful pork-barrel spending.
Democrats immediately seized on Mr. Ryan's budget as a sign that the Republican Party had failed to heed the lessons of the 2012 elections, which denied Mr. Ryan and Mitt Romney the presidency and cut the Republican ranks in both houses of Congress.
Senior administration officials said the Ryan budget underscored the hurdles the White House would confront if it hoped to reach an overarching budget deal with House Republicans. If Republicans demonstrate that absolutism in negotiations, a senior official said, there is no chance for an agreement.
''This budget reflects the same skewed priorities the Republican Party has championed for years -- the same skewed priorities Americans rejected in November,'' Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said in remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday. ''We've seen this show before.''
But Mr. Ryan said the election results would not intimidate Republicans into backing down.
''The election didn't go our way -- believe me I, I know what that feels like,'' Mr. Ryan said at a news conference during which he was asked repeatedly why his party was doubling down on proposals that the American people appeared to have rejected in November.
''That means we surrender our principles? That means we stop believing in what we believe in?'' he said, continuing: ''We think we owe the country a balanced budget. We think we owe the country solutions to the big problems that are plaguing our nation: a debt crisis on the horizon, a slow-growing economy, people trapped in poverty. We're showing our answers.''
Republicans said their plan would balance the budget in 10 years, a contention the White House said was impossible given that it would cut the top marginal income tax rate, which the wealthiest Americans pay, to 25 percent from 39.6 percent, depriving the government of considerable tax revenue.
During the presidential campaign, Mr. Romney promised to cut the top income tax rate by seven percentage points, a $5 trillion hole in the government's financing that Mr. Obama mocked as mathematically impossible to fill. Mr. Ryan's plan would lower the top rate by 14.6 percentage points but keep the government's finances unchanged, it says, with closings of tax loopholes he has declined to detail.
Mr. Ryan said in his plan that the deficit would fall to $528 billion in the 2014 fiscal year, down modestly from the $616 billion deficit forecast last month by the Congressional Budget Office.
From there, the deficit's drop would be steeper; the plan projects it to be $125 billion in 2015 and $69 billion in 2016, with a $7 billion surplus in 2023.
Medicaid would be cut by an additional $756 billion, by turning it into block grants to the states and limiting growth. Other so-called mandatory programs -- not subject to Congress's annual discretion -- would be cut by $962 billion. States would be allowed to put time and access limits on food stamps, for instance, and agricultural subsidies would be cut by $31 billion.
Discretionary programs, already squeezed by caps imposed in 2011 and automatic across-the-board cuts that went into force this month, would be cut by an additional $249 billion. Pell grants, a popular federal aid program for higher education, would be capped at the current level of $5,645 for 10 years. And federal education and job training programs would be consolidated.
Neither party's budget will become law. They are merely statements of policy priorities. But they will form the basis for any negotiations to reach what lawmakers hope will be a broader compromise on fiscal and economic issues that will end the cycle of passing stopgap budgets.

HEADLINE: Providence Is Top City In Contest Of Ideas

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
When Angel Taveras, the mayor of Providence, R.I., got wind of a lucrative contest among mayors over ideas for improving their cities, his mind turned immediately to children.
A product of Head Start and later Harvard University, Mr. Taveras had been longing to do something for children whose parents could not afford preschool. His idea, using some spiffy technology to track the number of words that children 5 and under are exposed to each day, won his city first place and $5 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the foundation of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, which oversaw the contest.
Four other cities -- Houston, Chicago, Santa Monica, Calif., and Philadelphia -- were whittled down from more than 300 that competed for the innovation grants at a time when most American cities are struggling to pay for existing programs to improve life there, let alone establish new ones. Those cities will get $1 million to get their new projects going. ''As cities are seeing cutbacks,'' Mr. Taveras said, ''it's critically important to create innovation.'' 
The program, known as the Mayors Challenge, sought ideas last summer from cities across the country with populations of 30,000 or more, and this fall narrowed the list to 20 finalists, whose staffs came to New York for an ''ideas camp'' where they worked to hone and advance their proposals. There were four criteria for cities. ''Was their idea visionary, was it impactful and can it spread to other cities,'' said James Anderson, the director of the charity's government-innovation program. Also, cities needed to show they could pull off their projects.
Providence took the grand prize for its plans to improve early childhood literacy. The children who participate in the program would wear a small device called a digital language processor that would record their daily interactions with adults. Those would then be converted into audio files containing the day's adult word count and the number of conversational turns. That data would be used to help parents in monthly coaching sessions improve the quality of their conversations to improve their children's vocabulary.
Houston received a grant for a new recycling program that would allow residents to be free of sorting. ''We are the only major city in America that does not have a garbage fee,'' Mayor Annise Parker Said. ''Because there is no economic incentive for people to recycle,'' the city seeks to make it increasingly convenient.
Santa Monica will get its $1 million to carry out its Wellbeing Project. An index will look at economic vitality, education, social relationships, health and environmental indicators to create a single view on the well-being of residents of the beachside city.
In Philadelphia, city officials will work on the vexing problem of procurement of goods and services, which hamstrings many cities with rules and high costs, by putting together a process that would widen the field and increase the pool of organizations and companies that bid.
In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel will try to build a big data system to better understand various trends around the city, similar to programs used in New York and elsewhere to track crime patterns.
''These five ideas reflect the most promising innovations that are emerging from city halls around the country,'' said Mayor Bloomberg, in an e-mail, ''and we're excited to support them because they have the potential to be replicated in cities large and small. While Washington is paralyzed by partisanship, mayors are moving forward with bold new solutions to many of our nation's toughest problems.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama Goes To Israel

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Maureen Dowd is off today.

 BODY:
In case you haven't heard, President Obama leaves for Israel next week. It is possible, though, that you haven't heard because it is hard for me to recall a less-anticipated trip to Israel by an American president. But there is a message in that empty bottle: Little is expected from this trip -- not only because little is possible, but because, from a narrow U.S. point of view, little is necessary. Quietly, with nobody announcing it, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has shifted from a necessity to a hobby for American diplomats. Like any hobby -- building model airplanes or knitting sweaters -- some days you work on it, some days you don't. It depends on your mood, but it doesn't usually matter when that sweater gets finished. Obama worked on this hobby early in his first term. He got stuck as both parties rebuffed him, and, therefore, he adopted, quite rationally in my view, an attitude of benign neglect. It was barely noticed. 
The shift in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from necessity to hobby for the U.S. is driven by a number of structural changes, beginning with the end of the cold war. There was a time when it was truly feared that an Arab-Israeli war could trigger a wider superpower conflict. During the October 1973 war, President Nixon raised America's military readiness to Defcon 3 to signal the Soviets to stay away. That is not likely to happen today, given the muted superpower conflict over the Middle East. Moreover, the discovery of massive amounts of oil and gas in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is making North America the new Saudi Arabia. So who needs the old one?
Of course, oil and gas are global commodities, and any disruption of flows from the Middle East would drive up prices. But though America still imports some oil from the Middle East, we will never again be threatened with gas lines by another Arab oil embargo sparked by anger over Palestine. For China and India, that is another matter. For them, the Middle East has gone from a hobby to a necessity. They are both hugely dependent on Middle East oil and gas. If anyone should be advancing Arab-Israeli (and Sunni-Shiite) peace diplomacy today it is the foreign ministers of India and China.
Writing in Foreign Policy magazine last week, Robin M. Mills, the head of consulting at Manaar Energy, noted that ''according to preliminary figures reported this week, China has overtaken the United States as the world's largest net oil importer.'' Mills described this as a ''shift as momentous as the U.S. eclipse of Britain's Royal Navy or the American economy's surpassing of the British economy in the late 19th century. ... The United States is set to become the world's biggest oil producer by 2017.''
At the same time, while the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict emotionally resonates across the Arab-Muslim world, and solving it is necessary for regional stability, it is clearly not sufficient. The most destabilizing conflict in the region is the civil war between Shiites and Sunnis that is rocking Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and Yemen. While it would be a good thing to erect a Palestinian state at peace with Israel, the issue today is will there be anymore a Syrian state, a Libyan state and an Egyptian state.
Finally, while America's need to forge Israeli-Palestinian peace has never been lower, the obstacles have never been higher: Israel has now implanted 300,000 settlers in the West Bank, and the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza have seriously eroded the appetite of the Israeli silent majority to withdraw from the West Bank, since one puny rocket alone from there could close Israel's international airport in Lod.
For all these reasons, Obama could be the first sitting American president to visit Israel as a tourist.
Good news for Israel, right? Wrong. While there may be fewer reasons for the U.S. to take risks to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there is still a powerful reason for Israel to do so. The status quo today may be tolerable for Israel, but it is not healthy. And more status quo means continued Israeli settlements in, and tacit annexation of, the West Bank. That's why I think the most important thing Obama could do on his trip is to publicly and privately ask every Israeli official he meets these questions:
''Please tell me how your relentless settlement drive in the West Bank does not end up with Israel embedded there -- forever ruling over 2.5 million Palestinians with a colonial-like administration that can only undermine Israel as a Jewish democracy and delegitimize Israel in the world community? I understand why Palestinian dysfunction and the Arab awakening make you wary, but still. Shouldn't you be constantly testing and testing whether there is a Palestinian partner for a secure peace? After all, you have a huge interest in trying to midwife a decent West Bank Palestinian state that is modern, multireligious and pro-Western -- a totally different model from the Muslim Brotherhood variants around you. Everyone is focused on me and what will I do. But, as a friend, I just want to know one thing: What is your long-term strategy? Do you even have one?''

HEADLINE: Hostess Sells Twinkies Brand to Investment Firms

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
8:53 p.m. | Updated
Twinkies and Ding Dongs are back from the dead.
Hostess Brands, the now bankrupt owner of the cream-filled confections, agreed on Tuesday to sell the snacks -- along with Ho Hos, Sno Balls and Dolly Madison Zingers -- to two investment firms with a shared history of corporate turnarounds.
The deal, worth $410 million, was struck nearly four months after the last Twinkie rolled off the baking lines. 
When Hostess, unable to reach a deal with its bakers' union, announced in November that it would wind down operations, it set off waves of nostalgia for a symbol of American junk food. As recently as Tuesday, sellers on eBay were seeking to fetch as much as $250,000 for two boxes of Twinkies.
The sale will mean that Twinkies, born more than 83 years ago in an Illinois industrial kitchen, will live on, having survived wars, recessions and the South Beach and Dukan diets.
The new owners will be Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Company, which owns Pabst Blue Ribbon and Vlasic pickles. C. Dean Metropoulos, the food industry veteran who leads the firm that bears his name, is expected to become the chief executive of the snack business.
The deal includes five Hostess factories, which the buyers hope to restart so to begin restocking shore shelves by the summer. And the new company will almost certainly feature the Hostess name.
''There's a great consumer fan base that hasn't declined,'' Daren Metropoulos, one of Mr. Metropoulos' sons and an executive at the family firm, said in an interview. ''We saw a real opportunity to revitalize these brands, just with some T.L.C.''
That may come in the form of what the younger Mr. Metropoulos deemed ''guerrilla marketing,'' much as his firm has done with Pabst Blue Ribbon. Social media like Twitter are expected to play a big role going forward, he said, and comedian friends like Zach Galifianakis may be drafted as spokesmen. (Will Ferrell, for instance, has starred in commercials for Old Milwaukee beer, part of the Pabst family.)
The business' new owners also hinted that Twinkies might find a home in a broader array of stores, including discount retailers like Dollar General. Healthier options, like 100-calorie snack packs, are also expected to make an appearance.
Yet the buyers are unlikely to rely as heavily on a unionized work force as the old Hostess did.
''We look forward to discussing opportunities for our members with new ownership, and add value to the revival of these products,'' David Durkee, the president of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, said in a statement.
Apollo and Metropoulos emerged from what at one point seemed like a crowded field of bankruptcy bidders for the brands. At one point, more than 100 parties had expressed interest in Twinkies, a group that included international food giants and private equity firms.
But by 5 p.m. Monday, the deadline for bids, the only qualified offer came from Apollo and Metropoulos. Advisers to Hostess canceled an auction scheduled for Wednesday morning and declared the two the winner.
''It's not that we lacked interest,'' Gregory F. Rayburn, the Hostess chief executive, said in an interview. ''Other bidders felt that they could not top the price.''
The new owners bring significant food industry expertise to the deal.
C. Dean Metropoulos has worked side-by-side with private equity firms on his deals in the past. He oversaw several food transactions for the Dallas private equity firm Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, including International Home Foods, the parent of Bumble Bee Tuna and Chef Boyardee.
Mr. Metropoulos, who has a net worth of $1.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine, made a splash in 2010, when he acquired Pabst Blue Ribbon for $250 million. Pabst -- known as P.B.R. among the beer-drinking crowd -- has experienced a renaissance in recent years. Mr. Metropoulous's sons, Evan and Daren, work alongside their father at the firm, based in Greenwich, Conn.
Still, reviving Twinkies and Ring Dings could be their highest profile turnaround.
As for Apollo, the private equity firm has deep experience with food-related investments, having previously owned stakes in the grocery-store chains Ralphs and Dominick's.
Apollo currently holds a controlling stake in Sprouts, a large natural food store chain in the Western United States that, presumably, will not be selling Twinkies and Ding Dongs.
The sale is not done yet. It requires the approval of the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing Hostess' Chapter 11 case. A hearing has been tentatively scheduled for March 19.
Hostess is still selling its other remaining brands, including Drake's snack cakes. Those auctions are expected to conclude by early next month.
Mr. Rayburn said that at some point, Hostess executives will celebrate by popping open a bottle of Champagne.
For his part, Daren Metropoulos said that he and his family would sample some new batches of Hostess product -- ''and probably crack open a cold P.B.R.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China Knocks on Iceland's Door

BYLINE: By EINAR BENEDIKTSSON and THOMAS R. PICKERING

 BODY:
ICELAND'S long-isolated existence was broken by World War II and the Cold War when its strategic location at the gateway to the North Atlantic and the Arctic were key to the defense of NATO and the United States. But with the disintegration of the Soviet Union the island country seemed again to pass into irrelevance, and in 2006 the last American military aircraft were withdrawn from the Keflavik Air Base. Now the situation is changing again, as the melting north polar ice opens new ocean routes and access to vast natural resources.
According to a 2008 estimate by the U.S. Geological Survey, 13 percent of all the unexploited oil, 30 percent of natural gas and 20 percent of the natural gas liquid resources are located under the seabed of the Arctic. Iceland is an ideal location to base ocean research, drilling and support for extraction and transport. The shrinking polar ice also introduces a revolutionary change in ocean transport between Asia and Europe -- the Northeast Polar Passage would reduce transport costs by as much as 40 percent as compared with the traditional route via the Suez Canal. 
Once again, Iceland has become a strategic gateway, and among the nations that are showing a growing interest in the country is China. The time has come for the United States to strengthen its relationship with Iceland.
With the Ilulissat Declaration of 2008, five member states of the Arctic Council -- the United States, Canada, Denmark-Greenland, Norway and Russia, joined by Iceland, Sweden and Finland -- declared their jurisdictional rights in the Arctic Region under the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Though Iceland is not regarded as a coastal state in the North Polar region, it lies in the Arctic and has recognized exploitation rights on the potentially mineral-rich coastal shelf of the Jan Mayen Island under a 1981 bilateral agreement with Norway.
Although China has not stated an official policy on the Arctic, it is not likely to support the unilateral decisions of the Arctic Council. The polar sea route is of major importance to the world's leader in manufacturing. And China has made a major effort in recent years to acquire access to mineral and energy resources in many parts of the world. Chinese public institutes and scholars have maintained that Arctic maritime routes and seabed riches should be for the use of all mankind.
China has also begun to court Iceland to help get access to the Arctic Council. Last year, Iceland was the first stop on an official European tour by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and a large Chinese delegation. And when the Chinese icebreaker Xuelong paid a call on Iceland, the crew was received by President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson at his residence. The colossus China and tiny Iceland, half a world apart, are now discussing a bilateral free-trade agreement.
A Chinese proposal to build a ''tourist paradise'' at a vast, isolated site in northern Iceland could also be used as a facility for workers building and serving ports for trade and Arctic exploration. This undertaking in northeastern Iceland could also be integrated in China's recently announced interest in a multibillion-dollar project to develop iron mines north of Nuuk in Greenland.
In short, China is reaching out for a position in the Arctic, beginning in Greenland, followed by support facilities in Iceland -- which is not a member of the European Union and seemingly has been put out in the cold by the United States -- with potential use for naval vessels patrolling the Arctic and the Northeast Polar Passage.
Security and stability in the European Arctic region are a matter of vital interest to the European Union and the United States. Fortunately, bolstering that security does not require re-establishing a military base in Iceland or negotiating new treaties -- the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, the U.S.-Iceland Defense Treaty of 1951 and arrangements agreed to in 2006 regarding air policing, military exercises and the establishment of joint search and rescue cooperation at Keflavik airport all remain in force.
It is time for the United States to take the changing situation more fully into account. Firstly, that means first increasing consultations and cooperation with an old ally, friend and neighbor in the North Atlantic. At a minimum, the United States and Iceland should forge a closer relationship on Arctic issues. Supporting Iceland's efforts at economic security and stability would also bolster its continued importance for NATO in this increasingly important region.
Secondly, Iceland should be included in the proposed Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership while it concurrently moves toward membership in the European Union.
Thirdly, the United States should visibly join Norway and Iceland in the coming ''Northern Viking'' military exercise. And the U.S. and Icelandic Coast Guards should develop more robust cooperation in providing search and rescue assistance from Keflavik Airport.
It is through such clear actions of mutual help and cooperation that Iceland can continue to ensure its full freedom and independence. At the same time, the United States would make clear that full cooperation with Iceland, especially on access to raw materials and protection of the environment, are a key part of its national strategy in this increasingly important region.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Seek Backing for Landmark Trade Pact

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- President Barack Obama and the top trade official for the European Union sought to rally support Tuesday for a landmark trans-Atlantic free trade deal, saying it would benefit a wide variety of exporters and offer a significant boost to growth.
Karel De Gucht, the E.U. trade commissioner, said one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade deal with the United States would be automobile manufacturers like BMW that have long rankled at tariffs. 
Mr. De Gucht was shoring up support for a mandate to negotiate on behalf of E.U. member states -- like Germany, home to a powerful auto sector -- and whose governments still must agree to let him lead the talks. He called on the bloc to ''now quickly decide to open negotiations so work can begin with the United States before the summer break.''
Mr. De Gucht also sought to assuage France, where there is widespread skepticism about the benefits of free trade, by suggesting that Paris would not have to dismantle quotas and subsidies designed to promote French films and other cultural products.
His comments came as Mr. Obama spoke in Washington, signaling the challenges that lay ahead, indicating that ''we're going to need the help of industry and labor'' to get a deal done.
''One of the things that we've also been trying to do during the course of this process is to make sure that it's not just the Xeroxes and the Dow Chemicals that are benefiting from this,'' Mr. Obama said, ''although we want our Fortune 100 companies to be selling as much as possible.''
''We actually think that there's room for small and medium-size businesses to export directly -- not just supplying large businesses, but also to break open and enter into these markets,'' Mr. Obama told the President's Export Council, his main trade advisory committee on international trade, made up of lawmakers and other officials.
Exports of motor vehicles from Europe to the United States could increase 149 percent if a deal removed existing tariffs and harmonized different safety standards, according to a study conducted by the Center for Economic Policy Research in London and released Tuesday by Mr. De Gucht's office.
''I feel just as safe when I drive a car in the U.S. as I do when I drive in Europe, so we should find ways to align our systems to find ways to cut costs,'' Mr. De Gucht said at a news conference.
He also said that product tariffs, currently 4 percent on average, should be dropped to zero, either immediately or over an agreed period of time.
A surge in trans-Atlantic trade would increase the Union's vehicle manufacturing sector 1.5 percent, according to the study issued by his office. Other sectors in Europe likely to see significant increases in sales included metal products, processed foods, chemicals and transport equipment, the study said.
European auto companies, particularly German ones, want to make it easier to sell cars they now make in the United States in their home markets. An agreement could add hundreds of millions of euros annually to BMW's revenue, in part by easing restrictions that now add tariffs to the cars the company makes in Spartanburg, South Carolina, but ships back to sell in Germany and other European countries.
Between them, the United States and Europe already account for about half of global economic output and one-third of world trade. Bilateral trade in 2011 amounted to &#x20ac;455 billion, or about $593 billion, with a positive balance for the Union of more than &#x20ac;72 billion, according to Mr. De Gucht's office. The United States is the bloc's main export market, buying &#x20ac;264 billion of goods, or about 17 percent of total E.U. exports, according to his office.
But previous attempts to forge a free trade deal have failed.
Government officials and industrialists who support such a pact say it is different this time, partly because Europe is seeking ways to accelerate growth without raising domestic spending in the wake of its sovereign debt crisis, and partly because the United States is eager to set global standards with Europe that giant emerging economies like China would have to follow.
Mr. Obama gave the talks added impetus last month when he pledged to ''launch talks on a comprehensive Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union'' during his State of the Union address.
Mr. Obama's pronouncement at the time met with a frenzy of enthusiasm from large swathes of the business community on both sides of the Atlantic. On Tuesday, he reiterated that he wanted ''to lock in'' a deal.
But there are huge obstacles, largely because the biggest gains will not come from the relatively easy goal of dropping tariffs but from bulldozing ''behind the border'' restrictions like customs procedures that create bureaucratic hurdles.
In particular, the Union wants to pry open so-called public procurement markets and scrap ''Buy American'' clauses that restrict the ability of European companies to sell goods and services to states and cities. The Europeans also have long complained about restrictions on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines.
The Americans are eager to see a reduction in barriers to exports of agricultural goods including produce from genetically modified organisms and cloning, opposed by many Europeans.
The talks also could run into difficulties over European initiatives like privacy restrictions on major online operators like Facebook and Google, and a tax on financial transactions aimed at recouping money from bankers.
Mr. De Gucht said there still should be a ''comprehensive agreement'' covering a wide variety of sectors, but he also said it was possible to reach a ''living agreement with a number of approaches in it for the future that you then develop once the agreement is in place.''
''I'm not saying every topic and every comma should be finally and in a definite way resolved,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Karzai's Bet: Vilifying U.S.

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Taimoor Shah contributed reporting from Kandahar, Afghanistan; Sangar Rahimi from Kabul; and Farooq Jan Mangal from Khost, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The longest shadow in Afghan politics is cast by a traffic post that used to stand in Ariana Square outside the presidential palace: the Taliban hanged Najibullah, the last president of the Communist government, from it shortly after they marched into Kabul in 1996.
That history, and the reality that every modern Afghan leader has been ousted or executed, has surely not escaped President Hamid Karzai as he faces what is expected to be his final year in office, and with the American military pullout well under way.
Seeking a nobler ending than his predecessors after his long tenure in the palace, Mr. Karzai is taking a gamble: intensifying his vilification of his American allies at a critical moment in their Afghan endgame, risking their support for him in order to save himself politically.
Even as his government is negotiating the terms for a lasting American military presence, in just the past two weeks he has ordered Special Operations forces out of a critical province, railed against C.I.A. plots, rejected American terms for handing over detainees and, most recently, even equated the United States and the Taliban as complementary forces working to undermine the government. 
Interviews with tribal elders, business leaders, political analysts and diplomats here paint an image of a leader who is desperately trying to shake his widely held image as an American lackey by appealing to nationalist sentiments and invoking Afghanistan's sovereignty.
Many, however, believe that Mr. Karzai may not fully appreciate the risks he is taking in betting that the United States will commit billions of dollars in military and economic support for years to come despite growing differences with him, the budgetary and economic challenges at home and battle fatigue after a long war.
''Karzai, very confident of the Americans' need to stay indefinitely and with much invested already, believes he has a lot of leverage and can push back as much as he wants because he's gotten his own way in the past,'' said Saad Mohseni, an Afghan businessman who is close to many in Mr. Karzai's team and runs the Moby Group, an international media company that includes Tolo, Afghanistan's most popular television network.
''The second thing is his legacy: with only 12 months to go, he has this task to change the narrative. Rather than being the person who was installed through the Bonn process,'' Mr. Mohseni said, referring to a 2001 conference that set up a post-Taliban government, ''he wants to be remembered as the guy who kicked out the 'foreigners' -- in this case, the Americans.''
American and other Western officials in Afghanistan have bent over backward to reassure the Afghan public -- and Mr. Karzai -- that they will not abandon them as the Russians did. That retreat, in the early 1990s, led to the collapse of the government and the army and, ultimately, to civil war.
Indicators from the White House, though, have not been as sure. President Obama has yet to decide how many troops might stay on after combat units leave at the end of 2014. Many numbers have been floated, but nothing has been determined.
''At what point does dealing with him become such a political pain that people in Washington, in Congress, say, 'Let's rethink the map on this a little bit,' '' said one Western official in Kabul. ''I don't think Karzai fully understands this -- understands the advancement of U.S. feeling on this,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the continuing negotiations.
Many Afghan observers say that Mr. Karzai is trying to keep himself politically potent during the last year of his term by playing to at least three Afghan constituencies: his ethnic Pashtun base; ethnic Tajik and Hazara leaders in his government; and, notably, the Taliban, who have rejected negotiations with him.
In past speeches, Mr. Karzai has sometimes adopted a yearning tone as he has expressed a desire to be the Afghan leader who could unite the country's factions, including bringing the Taliban in from the battlefield.
And in his recent banning of American commandos from Wardak Province, a Taliban stronghold, some Afghan observers see an attempt to reach out to the insurgents by proving that he has the power to halt military action against them. Others believe he is trying to tap into Afghans' frustrations with giant foreign military vehicles on their roads, heavily armed foreign soldiers on foot patrols in their fields and night raids on their homes.
But since his words have had only limited effect on the Americans, they increasingly ring hollow to many Afghans. At the same time, the reality on the ground has changed: increasingly, the war is being fought -- and in some cases abuses are being carried out -- by Afghan forces that are seen as acting in Mr. Karzai's name despite having been mostly trained by Americans.
That leaves Mr. Karzai casting about for new ways to prove that he is not, as the Taliban insist, ''America's chief puppet.''
''President Karzai would like to portray himself as a national hero,'' said Malek Sitez, an adviser to the Civil Society and Human Rights Network of Afghanistan. ''He is kind of taking an antiforeigners policy, and many ordinary people in Afghanistan like this. But he does not understand how he, and his government, is totally dependent on the international community economically, and he doesn't understand the impact of his speeches on the relationship.''
Still, Mr. Sitez added, if Mr. Karzai cannot be remembered as a hero, ''he would like to be remembered as a victim of a crowd of international strategies.''
''He doesn't want to be remembered as a defeated politician,'' Mr. Sitez said. ''So he wants to remind people that he's a nationalist -- he kicked out foreigners.''
Many here see an echo in the last chapter of Najibullah's rule, when, after the Russians decided to withdraw, the president took an increasingly nationalist stand and even told the Russians to go and just leave the financing for the military. That is very much the message Mr. Karzai has sent to the Americans and the world, Mr. Sitez said.
For Afghans at a more grass-roots level, there is little faith in either the Afghan government or the Americans.
''Now Karzai is trying to deceive people that he sympathizes with the Afghan people, and also he is trying to show the Taliban that 'now I am independent from the Americans,' '' said Hajji-Abdul Majeed Khan, a tribal elder from Arghistan, a district in Kandahar Province where Mr. Karzai has had support.
''I don't think that Karzai and Americans have disputes at all -- they both are playing a double game to throw dust in people's eyes and bring another stooge government to Afghanistan,'' he added.
One elder in Khost Province, in southeastern Afghanistan, suggested that Mr. Karzai's negative comments were much more personal than universal. ''All Afghans do not share his views and ideas,'' said the elder, Yusuf Entezar. ''Let's not forget that for a long time there has been a lot of disagreement between Karzai and the Americans on one hand. And he has failed to strengthen the rule of law, and now he is trying to find some accomplishments he can show to people.''
Many Afghans who hold government or tribal authority have also come to rely on the development projects and security provided by American soldiers and civilians.
''This is political talk,'' said Hajji Agha Lalai, the head of the Kandahar provincial council and one of the few allies of Mr. Karzai's who was willing to speak to a reporter about the president's comments. ''These kind of remarks being made by Karzai make people worry about the future of Afghanistan.''
He added: ''People are still hopeful for a better future in Afghanistan, but we need the world community, and we are a fragile country and vulnerable. So the relationship that has been built with the world community should not be broken.''
Any American complaints at Mr. Karzai's latest remarks, in which he all but claimed collusion between the Taliban and the Americans, pale next to the Taliban's reaction.
They issued a searing response late Monday in which they dismissed Mr. Karzai as an abject hypocrite, eating food and wearing clothes paid for with American dollars.
Nationalism ''neither rescued Najibullah nor will it rescue Karzai; the Afghan nation is one of the nations of the world that knows its puppets and its heroes,'' said the Taliban statement, which was written by a man identified as Qari Habib.
''Hamid Karzai, at the end of his tenure, has resorted to the same hypocrisy as Dr. Najibullah,'' the statement continued. ''We offer him free advice: Do not take this road, because this road leads to Ariana Square.''

HEADLINE: Dow Ekes Out 8th Consecutive Gain in Otherwise Flat Trading

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market meandered on Tuesday, ending the day with little change, although the Dow Jones industrial average crept up to another nominal high.
The Dow, which has risen for eight consecutive trading sessions, added 2.77 points to close at 14,450.06 after wavering between small gains and losses for most of the day.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended down 3.74 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,552.48. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 10.55 points, or 0.3 percent, to 3,242.32. 
Stocks have surged this year as investors became encouraged by a recovery in the housing market and a pickup in hiring. Strong corporate earnings and continuing economic stimulus from the Federal Reserve are also supporting demand for stocks.
The Dow has gained 10.3 percent in 2013. Last week it surpassed its previous nominal high of 14,164.53. The S.& P. 500 has risen 8.9 percent this year and is less than one percentage point from its nominal high close of 1,565.15, set in October 2007.
David Bianco, chief United States equity strategist at Deutsche Bank, said the S.& P. 500 index would probably maintain its momentum in the coming weeks and surpass its nominal high. Strong first-quarter corporate earnings reports could also push the market higher.
''I wouldn't be surprised if the market has a typical 5 percent pullback in the summer,'' Mr. Bianco said. ''But I think we go higher before that happens.''
The last significant downturn for stocks began before the presidential election in November, when the Dow fell 8 percent from Oct. 5 to Nov. 15 on investors' concerns that a divided government in Washington might not be able to reach a budget deal to avoid sweeping tax increases and deep spending cuts.
Stocks have not had a correction, typically defined as a decline of 10 to 20 percent, since November 2011.
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, was among those saying investors should expect a pause in the market's advance.
''Nothing goes up forever,'' Mr. Cardillo said. ''We will be headed for a correction somewhere along the line.''
Merck was the biggest gainer in the Dow, advancing $1.38, or 3.2 percent, to $45.04 after it said that a data safety monitoring board had recommended that a study of its cholesterol drug Vytorin should continue.
Among the stocks on the move, Yum Brands rose 89 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $68.73 after the company, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, announced a smaller-than-expected drop in its sales in China for January and February after a food scare over its chicken suppliers.
Diamond Foods slumped $1.71, or 9.7 percent, to $15.89 after the company reported disappointing second-quarter sales and offered an estimate for the rest of the fiscal year that also fell short of Wall Street estimates.
VeriFone Systems gained $1.22, or 6 percent, to $21.68 after the company, a leading maker of terminals for electronic payments, said late Monday that its chief executive would step down after recent stumbles cut the company's stock price nearly in half.
Costco Wholesale rose $1.31, or 1.3 percent, to $103.75 after reporting that its fiscal second-quarter net income climbed 39 percent. Costco pulled in more money from membership fees, its sales improved and it recorded a large tax benefit. Even without the tax benefit, the results were better than analysts had expected.
Cabela's, an outdoor retailer, gained $6.75, or 12.5 percent, to $60.65 after it said that it expected its first-quarter profit to exceed market expectations.
In the bond market, interest rates declined for the first time in seven trading sessions. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 12/32, to 99 27/32, while its yield dropped to 2.02 percent from 2.06 percent late on Monday.

HEADLINE: Ohio's Resurgent Natural Gas Industry Spends Millions to Set Up Shop

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
LOUISVILLE, Ohio -- The countryside in eastern Ohio is marked by rusting tanks that stand in open fields and along the edges of family timber patches, like graveyard headstones for an era of energy riches that most people here thought had passed.
Petroleum from this region once supplied John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil refineries in Cleveland, 70 miles to the north. More than 6,500 conventional oil and gas wells have been drilled here in Stark County over the decades, according to state records; most no longer yield enough fuel to market. But natural gas buried in shale thousands of feet below the surface is attracting more than $1 billion in private investment and rapidly reviving the area as an energy producer.
To prepare, market and transport the natural gas, companies are building an expansive network of regional field offices, processing plants and other infrastructure. 
For example, the Chesapeake Energy Corporation, which is based in Oklahoma City and is the largest developer of the shale formation, known as the Utica Shale, is building a field office on a 291-acre site here that it bought here last year for $7.11 million. The project's centerpiece is a five-story, 85,000-square-foot office tower that is scheduled to be completed early next year. The company is also building a 55,000-square-foot receiving and maintenance building and a 6,000-square-foot repair shop.
Chesapeake's development plan, approved last year by this city of 9,200 residents, also calls for a second phase of construction to build a rail spur and eight storage silos to move sand from rail cars to trucks.
Thomas Ault, Louisville's city manager, estimated that the first three buildings under construction would cost $22 million to $24 million. Chesapeake employs 550 people in eastern Ohio, according to company records: Mr. Ault said that if Chesapeake moved a good portion of them into the field office, the company would become Louisville's second-largest employer next to the city's public schools, which have 618 teachers and staff members.
''We haven't had any private development around here to compare to this in a long time,'' Mr. Ault said.
Executives with Chesapeake declined to be interviewed. In public statements, though, energy industry executives have said drilling and production are being impeded by a shortage of processing plants and pipelines. Chesapeake and other leading production and processing companies are attacking that problem with an infrastructure development program never seen here, said Thomas E. Stewart, executive vice president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association.
''Really, there is nothing in Ohio's drilling and processing history to compare to what's going on now,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''It's transformational.''
Ohio remains a comparatively small producer -- 4.8 million barrels of oil and 78 billion cubic feet of gas in 2011 -- ranking it 18th in oil and 20th in natural gas production among the states, according to federal figures. Two years ago, though, the first wells penetrated the Utica Shale. Since then, according to the latest weekly tally by Ohio's Natural Resources Department, 255 of the 548 Utica wells that received permits have been drilled and completed, and 74 are producing natural gas.
Companies are using the process of hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, which pumps a mixture of sand, water and chemicals at extremely high pressure down a well to fracture the rock and release the gas. A completed Utica well, which dives vertically 6,000 to 10,000 feet and then travels horizontally through the shale for roughly the same distance, costs $6 million to $10 million, according to industry reports.
With all this energy-related construction, industry executives believe that Ohio will produce two billion to three billion cubic feet of processed gas daily within the decade. Even so, fracking has attracted some opposition in eastern Ohio, and the process has raised questions about water contamination and air pollution that are under investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Utica Shale yields ''dry'' natural gas, which is nearly pure methane and so plentiful in the United States that the market price, just more than $3 per thousand cubic feet, is near a record low.
The shale also contains more valuable ''wet gas,'' which is methane permeated with ethane, propane, pentane and butane that can be separated and used to manufacture chemicals, plastics, and liquid fuels like gasoline. The abundance of natural gas in the United States also drove prices lower last year for the four liquid compounds. But with a price range of $30 to $95 a barrel, depending on the product, processing and marketing wet gas can be very profitable.
A Utica well in Belmont County, developed by Gulfport Energy, last year produced 21 million cubic feet a day of natural gas, in addition to 945 barrels a day of ethane, propane, butane and other liquids. Tim Carr, a professor of energy at West Virginia University, estimated in January that at $3 per thousand cubic feet of gas and $50 for each barrel of liquids, the well generated more than $100,000 a day in revenue.
Such results have stirred the strong exploration activity in Ohio, where 28 drilling rigs are in operation, according to Baker Hughes, the oil field services company, which tracks rig operations nationally.
East of Louisville, in Mahoning County, NiSource Inc.'s Midstream and Minerals Group is working with an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company to build a $300 million gas-gathering system and processing plant in Springfield Township. The plant purifies and cools the gas to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit, turning it into a liquid that can be separated. Constructed on a 95-acre parcel, the cryogenic plant will process 200 million cubic feet of gas daily when it is completed later this year.
Three counties south, in Harrison County, Mark West Energy Partners, a Denver-based company, is working with the Energy and Minerals Group to build a processing plant near Cadiz, according to company reports. The plant expects to process 385 million cubic feet of gas daily. A second plant, near Summerfield in Noble County, also will process 400 million cubic feet of gas and will start operations this year.
Exterran, a Houston-based company, last year completed a $13 million, 65,000-square-foot office and fabricating plant in Youngstown, about 50 miles northeast of Louisville, to manufacture gas processing equipment.
Chesapeake's big move in Ohio -- by the end of 2012 it had drilled 184 Utica wells -- came amid sales of some of its reserves in Ohio to raise cash, as well as administrative turmoil that last year engulfed its home office in Oklahoma. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company and its chief executive, Aubrey McClendon, over a perk that granted him a share in each of the company's gas wells. Chesapeake conducted an internal inquiry into the well program and Mr. McClendon's finances and found no ''intentional'' wrongdoing by the executive. Mr. McClendon is set to retire on April 1.
At the close of 2012, Chesapeake Energy's holdings in eastern Ohio included 45 producing gas wells in the Utica Shale, 47 wells awaiting pipelines and 92 wells that were not yet complete. Production from those wells, and dozens more the company says it intends to develop, will make it the largest customer for a $900 million network of pipelines and processing plants under development by EV Energy Partners, Access Midstream and M3 Midstream/Momentum.
The first of the three processing plants planned for the project, which is capable of processing 600 million cubic feet of gas daily, is under construction near Kensington in Columbiana County. It is scheduled to be completed in early summer. Construction of a second plant, to store wet gas, will start in Harrison County in the spring. A third plant, with capacity to process 200 million cubic feet of gas daily, will start later this year in Carroll County, and production is scheduled to start in 2014.

HEADLINE: Blessings Of Low Taxes Remain Unproved

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
The proposition that low tax rates produce higher economic growth has been a central plank of the Republican platform since I was a teenager.
In 1980, ''The Blues Brothers'' were making the jump from ''Saturday Night Live'' to cult status on the silver screen when Representative Jack F. Kemp of New York, an economic adviser to President-elect Ronald Reagan, warned that taxes were ''strangling the ability of the private sector and the American people to grow and expand and invest and save.'' He laid out a plan to cut taxes, pare loopholes in the tax code and curb federal spending.
In 1996 Steve Forbes, the magazine publisher, donned the low-tax mantle just in time for Yahoo's I.P.O. and La Macarena. Running for the Republican nomination on the promise of a ''pro-growth, pro-family tax cut,'' he cornered the eventual nominee, Robert Dole, into promising cuts of his own.
Since then, we have had a dot-com bubble and a housing bust. The new standard-bearer for lower tax rates, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, is for the first time younger than I am. 
But while the message has not changed, the track record of the last three decades does not bear out the core proposition of Republican economic doctrine.
The argument has proved extraordinarily successful. Under Republican presidents, the top income tax rate fell as low as 28 percent, less than half the 70 percent level it was in 1980.
The top corporate income tax rate was 46 percent when President Reagan took office. Today it is 35 percent. Taxes on investment income, which primarily flows to the wealthy, are even lower. In laying out his plan for a balanced budget by 2023, Mr. Ryan has trotted out the same three elements of Mr. Kemp's formula: drastic curbs on spending, paring loopholes in unspecified ways and cutting tax rates even further, well below the roughly 40 percent top rate on income that was reintroduced by President Obama's recent tax increase.
''The goal of tax reform should be to curb or eliminate loopholes and use those savings to lower tax rates across the board -- not to fund more wasteful government spending,'' Mr. Ryan's budget plan states. Echoing Mr. Forbes, he called the new Republican proposal ''a pro-growth tax system that benefits families and businesses.''
Problem is, there is little evidence that tax cutting has worked as advertised.
Thomas L. Hungerford, an economist with the Congressional Research Service, got into trouble with Republicans last year when he published a study suggesting that the sharp drop in top tax rates since 1945 did little to lift economic growth but probably did contribute to soaring income inequality.
And there's no clear evidence that lower tax burdens have helped the United States grow faster than other advanced industrial nations with higher tax rates and much heavier tax burdens. Economic growth per person in the United States was a little faster than in France or Australia over the last 40 years. But it was a little slower than in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research organization for the world's richest countries.
While high taxes do have an effect on variables that affect growth, many other factors are much more significant and overshadow whatever taxes do.
In high-tax European countries as varied as Germany, France, Britain and Denmark, productivity -- or output per worker, the most important measure of a nation's ability to generate wealth -- grew faster than in the United States over the last 40 years. If income per person didn't grow much faster it's because people in those countries chose to devote much of their extra productivity to more leisure.
The average American worker spends 1,700 hours a year on the job, 100 fewer than in 1970. The average French worker, by contrast, works about 1,500 hours, 500 fewer than 40 years ago. Meanwhile, until the financial crisis struck, labor participation grew faster in the United States than in other rich countries, including Germany, Sweden and France.
Taxes probably played a role in this, most economists agree. Indeed, higher tax rates can reduce economic output because they change the decisions of workers, employers and investors. Income taxes reduce the rewards of work, potentially blunting the incentive to take a job. They can discourage paying for a costly higher education by reducing lucrative professions' take home pay.
Higher corporate taxes at home can encourage American businesses to invest money abroad rather than in the United States. Differential tax rates pull investments into low tax sectors of the economy at the expense of others that might be more productive. Broadening the tax base by eliminating preferences and exemptions -- an objective that Democrats and Republicans say they share -- would reduce some of these distortions.
The crucial question, however, is how big an effect taxes have, compared with the other forces affecting the economy. Edward C. Prescott, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has argued that higher income taxes account entirely for the difference in working hours between the United States and Europe.
A Harvard economist, Martin Feldstein, President Reagan's chief economic adviser in the early 1980s, agrees. ''Lower marginal tax rates lead to more labor input in the economy,'' he pointed out. ''More people working more hours, more effort, more productive occupations, etc.''
But there are many other factors at play, including strict labor market regulations in Europe and generous pension systems that encourage earlier retirement.
What's more, it's only natural that many people, given the opportunity, would take longer vacations as they became richer. As Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, told me: ''There is plenty of evidence that Europeans like leisure, and leisure has become much more attractive.''
Even Glenn Hubbard of Columbia, who as President George W. Bush's chief economic adviser helped shape the tax cuts that were partially reversed for the rich in January, noted: ''It's always hard to know what to make of correlations between tax shares in G.D.P. (or tax rates) and growth, as so many factors influence both.''
Recent history may even suggest the economy thrives when taxes are higher. Despite President Bush's tax cuts, the economy during his administration grew only about 17 percent, half as much as during that of his predecessor, Bill Clinton, who had raised them.
In 1996, the economists Jonathan Skinner of Dartmouth College and Eric M. Engen of the Federal Reserve Board tested Mr. Kemp's and Mr. Forbes's claims about the impact of taxes on growth. They concluded that a tax cut that reduced top rates by 5 percent and revenues by 2.5 percent of gross domestic product would add roughly 0.2 to 0.3 percent to annual economic growth.
They could not tell whether this effect would persist forever or peter out after 10 to 15 years. In any event, Mr. Skinner told me, the effect would be tiny relative to other factors, like education, regulatory policies and the quality of infrastructure.
This raises an additional point. Government spending -- on things like education, infrastructure and basic research -- can contribute to growth, too. ''Higher taxes that finance good projects help growth,'' said Peter Diamond, a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The nation's dilapidated infrastructure and its slippage down the international education rankings are testament to the costs of underfinancing these public goods.
As in the early 1980s, the economy today remains well below its capacity. And Republicans are again calling for lower tax rates as a tonic for faster growth. But if lower taxes do not deliver higher growth, why should the nation pursue them?
''It's hard to say for sure what our economic trajectory would have looked like with higher taxes,'' said Alan Auerbach, an expert on the economics of taxation at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Some of the disappointment that our low taxes haven't had a more obvious impact comes from overblown claims of tax cut supporters.''

HEADLINE: At Hearing, Nominee for S.E.C. Chief Vows to Be a Tough Wall St. Regulator

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mary Jo White moved closer to becoming a top Wall Street regulator on Tuesday as she sailed through a Congressional confirmation hearing. But even her supporters on Capitol Hill pointed to significant challenges awaiting the next leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
While she received a friendly reception during two hours of testimony, the Senate Banking Committee grilled Ms. White, the nominee for S.E.C. chairwoman, on her regulatory agenda, demanding that Ms. White complete new rules for Wall Street and take aim at financial fraud. Lawmakers argued that the agency, four years after the financial crisis, must confront a broad array of problems facing the public markets. 
Ms. White promised to tackle enforcement actions and unfinished regulation, but offered scant details on her plans. She did, however, signal a flexible approach to reforming money market funds, an approach that could draw scrutiny from investor advocates and liberal lawmakers.
Some lawmakers also pressed her to outline her strategy for navigating conflicting interests, another potential hindrance for her early days at the S.E.C.
Ms. White, who for decades bounced between roles as a federal prosecutor and a Wall Street defense lawyer, must recuse herself from investigating former clients for at least a year. After defending JPMorgan Chase for its role in the financial crisis, for example, Ms. White could have to sit out an S.E.C. investigation into the bank's recent $6 billion trading loss.
Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who has sounded alarms about Ms. White's turns through the revolving door connecting government and private practice, stressed the possible conflicts on Tuesday. ''Nobody questions your integrity but we need some reassurance,'' he said. ''What have you done over the last decade,'' he asked, that would comfort ''ordinary investors?''
Ms. White explained that her work for Wall Street ''does not change me as a person. It doesn't mean I embrace the policy thoughts of any of my clients.'' Now, she said, ''The American public will be my client, and I will work as zealously as is possible on behalf of them.''
Despite fielding some concerns from the Senate Banking Committee, Ms. White easily cleared the latest hurdle to her nomination. Showing no signs of strain, she struck a confident tone and maneuvered around the thorniest questions, prompting both laughter and praise from lawmakers.
The hearing cleared the way for the committee to vote on Ms. White's nomination as early as next week. Congressional officials expect her to ultimately cruise through the full Senate confirmation. Even one of the committee's Republicans, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, declared his intention to vote for Ms. White
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, set the tone from the start of the hearing. He praised Ms. White's ''long and distinguished career'' as the first female United States attorney in Manhattan and ticked off a litany of awards she won for prosecuting terrorists. Mr. Schumer also noted her playful side: animal enthusiast, motorcyclist, basketball player and lover of cold beer.
''The same toughness she shows playing basketball she will show as S.E.C. chair,'' he said, eliciting an uproar of laughter in the hearing room. ''She will score many points and not commit too many fouls.''
But Ms. White will encounter significant obstacles at the S.E.C., an agency that finds itself in a critical transition period. When Mary L. Schapiro became the S.E.C.'s leader four years ago, she faced a daunting task. Her primary job was to restore legitimacy to an agency blamed for missing the financial crisis.
With the agency now back from the brink, lawmakers say that Ms. White must elevate the agenda to take on topics outside her predecessor's regime. Ms. White, for example, vowed to examine the growing world of high-frequency trading, an issue that continues to confound the agency.
As for the dozens of unfinished rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, Ms. White called them an ''immediate imperative.'' But the agency to date has come up short, falling behind on dozens of Wall Street reforms, including the so-called Volcker Rule that reins in risky trading at big banks.
Ms. White will also step into the contentious debate over money market funds, the investments that needed government assistance to survive during the crisis. It's a sore spot for the agency after internal bickering and industry lobbying halted reform last year. While Ms. White promised that the S.E.C. would tackle the topic again, she indicated that any new rules would not interfere with ''the value'' of the funds.
Her words alarmed investor advocates, including some of Ms. White's staunchest supporters, while others noted that it was too soon to read much into her stance. The advocates argue that a regulator's job is to protect investors, not the funds that cater to them.
''Preserving the money market fund product is not an appropriate public policy goal,'' said Dennis Kelleher, the head of Better Markets, an advocacy group that has praised Ms. White's credentials.
Ms. White, the head of litigation at Debevoise and Plimpton, also faces questions about her role in some S.E.C. enforcement cases.
Citing the ''very high bar'' she sets for herself when confronting ethical issues, Ms. White explained that she would avoid former clients for a year. In addition to potentially stepping back from the JPMorgan investigation, Ms. White might also temporarily avoid cases involving UBS and other clients.
Lawmakers questioned whether such recusals, even if well intentioned, might cripple her authority.
''How will you signal that wrongdoing will not be tolerated?'' asked Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota, the committee's Democratic chairman.
''I don't think there's anything more important than vigorous and credible enforcement of the securities laws,'' she replied. ''I'll be very focused on that throughout my tenure.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

STEUBENVILLE, Ohio -- No cellphones, iPads or laptops will be allowed inside Juvenile Court here on Wednesday when two high school football players go on trial on charges of raping a 16-year-old girl last summer. Anyone who wants to post on Twitter or a blog will have to leave the building to do so.
The ban, imposed to help ensure order in the courtroom, may be the first time that social media have been absent from a case that for months has been played out in the electronic world.
The case first came to light through Twitter posts and a photo on Instagram. And the defendants, Trenton Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, who have pleaded not guilty, have already been accused, prosecuted, defended and judged guilty or not by their peers and strangers in blog posts, YouTube videos and entries on Facebook, Twitter and other sites. 
Adam Nemann, a defense lawyer for Mr. Mays, said that even members of his own family had asked, ''What is there to try?''
Steubenville is nothing if not close-knit: both the local prosecutor and the Juvenile Court judge recused themselves because of personal ties to the case. But the Internet onslaught that followed the disclosure has caused bitter divisions among the 18,000 residents of this industrial city on the banks of the Ohio River -- ''an old school town,'' as one local restaurant owner put it -- and introduced them to the modern court of public opinion, where a commentator or a critic might live next door or in New Jersey or Bangladesh.
To some here, the spotlight has brought needed attention to an ugly crime. Mr. Mays, 17, and Mr. Richmond, 16, popular members of Steubenville High School's Big Red football team, are charged with raping the girl during an evening of partying in and around Steubenville on the night of Aug. 11, while she was too drunk to resist. Witnesses testified at an October hearing that she was raped in a car going to one party and again after arriving.
Those residents argue that adulation for the football team, one of the few jewels left in a city eroded by economic decline, has fostered a culture that allowed such a thing to occur.
''Some want justice for the girl, and others want it to just go away and be swept under the rug,'' said Sarah Morris, 23, a college student home for the weekend.
But others here say that while they are shocked by what happened to the young woman, the online furor has tarnished the city and the football team for the actions of a few, spread misinformation and sullied the reputation of other students who have not been charged with any crime.
''It's making a mockery of the whole town,'' said one woman, a customer at Pee Dee's diner, who wore a Steubenville High School jacket and, like many residents, did not want to be quoted by name for fear of retaliation.
After the suspected rape, a blogger, Alexandria Goddard, posted Twitter messages and a photo taken that night, and named students who were present -- including some who testified at the October hearing -- saying that they acted criminally by failing to take action.
In January, after an article about the case appeared in The New York Times, a hacker group calling itself Anonymous posted a video of an intoxicated student making fun of the accuser -- he called her ''the dead girl'' and said that the two defendants had raped her -- and accused city and school officials of engaging in a cover-up.
Two protests organized by the hacker group were held later in the month. The controversy grew so intense that the city hired a consulting firm in Columbus to help deal with the crisis.
And then there were the threats. Ms. Goddard, a former resident of Steubenville, said that online detractors had maligned her mother and posted the phone numbers and addresses of other family members. One person who commented on her blog said she hoped Ms. Goddard and ''her friends'' ''get AIDS and die a slow death.''
Ms. Goddard was sued for defamation by the parents of one student, but now that the suit is settled she has become a minor celebrity, scheduled for interviews with ABC's ''20/20'' and The New Yorker magazine.
''It was very stressful,'' she said. ''The friends I've lost, that has been hurtful. But I wouldn't change a thing.''
In January, a threatening post on Facebook briefly sent Steubenville's middle school into lockdown. The personal information of a businessman who has nothing to do with the case was placed online by hackers who apparently confused him with a relative, according to William A. McCafferty, the Steubenville police chief.
And Chief McCafferty himself has been a target: His e-mail was hacked, he said, and a 15-year-old photo showing him wearing only underwear -- taken at a party at a resort in Jamaica -- was put online with the tag ''Thong Song.''
Mike DeWine, the Ohio attorney general, whose office is prosecuting Mr. Mays and Mr. Richmond, said that the state had a strong case and that months of investigation had found no indication of a conspiracy to protect the football team by Steubenville officials.
''We've seen no validity to that,'' he said. ''There's no evidence that the prosecutor is involved in a cover-up, and there's no evidence that the police are involved in a cover-up.''
Mr. DeWine did not rule out that possibility that more charges would be brought in the case. But, he said, ''This has been really very difficult for the victim and it's also been difficult for the community, and it's in its interest for this to be over with.''
Mr. Nemann, one of two lawyers representing Mr. Mays, said they intended to show in the trial that ''there was no rape.''
''We're denying that there was any nonconsensual contact, period,'' he said.
Mr. Mays and Mr. Richmond, who is represented by another lawyer, Walter Madison, have been under house arrest, allowed to go out only to attend school at the county jail and go to church.
As many as 40 witnesses may testify in the trial, including the accuser, who lives across the river, in Weirton, W.Va. ''We just want his over with and out of our lives,'' her mother said.
With a verdict, many here hope, the city can go back to discussing the shale drilling companies that are moving in and next fall's football prospects. The school system has held training on sexual violence.
But Mr. Nemann said that whatever the outcome, he doubted that the tensions would be entirely resolved. ''No one wins on either side,'' he said. ''Everybody loses on these types of cases.''

HEADLINE: Storms Swiftly Claim Trees, But Stumps Stay for Years

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
When a New York City tree crew removed a shade tree whose roots had damaged the sewer line in front of Gwen Grapes's home, the workers promised they would be back soon to grind down the stump.
That was four years ago. Mrs. Grapes, 85, a retired secretary who lives in the Richmondtown section of Staten Island, is still waiting.
Mrs. Grapes's is but one of a forest of stumps that has appeared across the city in recent years, the result of slashed budgets and a series of tree-snapping storms, including a tornado in September 2010, Tropical Storm Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy, which by itself felled 11,000 street trees, according to city officials. 
In 2008, New York City's parks department, which is responsible for trees along city streets, had $2.3 million allocated to stump removal. After the financial crisis of that year, that amount was slashed: in each of the last three fiscal years, there has been no money budgeted for removing stumps. As a result there are probably tens of thousands of stumps left behind where trees once grew -- the city does not keep an exact census -- while the city, in a public-private initiative announced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2007, is racing to have one million trees planted by 2017.
As of Tuesday, 662,111 trees -- the number is tallied daily -- have been planted, many of them in sidewalk tree pits.
It might seem an obvious strategy to put new trees where there are stumps, but costs and logistics conspire against it. Only 5 percent to 10 percent of the nearly 16,000 new street trees to be planted this year will actually replace stumps. Indeed, the tree planting budget is the main reason that any stumps were extricated at all last year; the city removed 1,616 of them, down from 9,634 in 2008.
''When you see places that could support new trees and you've got stumps instead, it's a lost opportunity,'' said Holly M. Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, an independent group promoting parks and open spaces.
The process of removing a stump, which involves grinding it down, is distinct from tree removal. Stumps can languish on waiting lists long after a tree hazard is gone. ''It's really two separate pieces of equipment and two separate crews and two separate skill sets,'' said Jeremy Barrick, deputy chief of forestry, horticulture and natural resources for the parks department.
The tree-planting campaign, which is largely being handled by outside contractors, generally singles out neighborhoods in need of more tree canopy. Often, large stumps exist in communities with plentiful tree cover. ''A contractor looks at mobilizing his crews, and it's all about efficiency and profit,'' Mr. Barrick said. ''He can set up on a street and plant one tree or set up and plant 20 trees.''
In the northeast Bronx, City Councilman James Vacca estimated that his district was home to 50 to 70 sidewalk stumps. Each time he spies one, he phones 311, the city's complaint line.
''I have stumps all over my district, and they are as big as day,'' said Mr. Vacca, pointing to a particularly large example in the Pelham Parkway section. ''Many have been here for years. They're unsightly.''
''And,'' he added, ''they prevent a new tree from being planted.''
One of Mr. Vacca's constituents, Michael Giordano, a property manager who lives on Lydig Avenue, said he had complained to the city four times about a stump that a crew left in place after it hauled away a tree that was dropping branches on his car. The city removed a stump by a neighbor's house several months ago, he said, even though he had been waiting longer.
''My tree fell before hers,'' he said in a phone interview. ''I don't get it.''
The city allows homeowners -- who first get permits -- to have stumps removed themselves. Such work can be expensive, however, ranging from $250 to $700, depending on the size of the stump, said Michael D. Almstead, vice president of Almstead Tree and Shrub Care. ''With city stumps,'' Mr. Almstead said, ''a lot of times you have cement or sidewalk in the way.''
''That presents problems,'' he added, ''because we can't grind the cement. We have to do some of the work by hand.''
In Mayor Bloomberg's proposed 2014 budget, presented at the end of January, $3.45 million was allocated for tree pruning, compared with $1.45 million a year earlier. But stump removal was once again unpaid for.
Given enough time, nature will take its course, said Nina Bassuk, a professor of horticulture at Cornell University. Tree stumps will eventually rot, she said, but it can take many years. ''You could have a functional tree that is producing benefits,'' said Dr. Bassuk, who is the program leader of Cornell's Urban Horticulture Institute. ''The stump is just taking up space.''
A number of stumps created by Hurricane Sandy are to be removed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to cover the costs of grinding down 4,000 of them, in cases where more than half of a tree was uprooted or where a sidewalk was damaged. That leaves, Mr. Barrick said, ''7,000 routine stumps that came into our realm from Sandy.''
Not everyone is averse to the stumps dotting the streetscape, even when they leave gaps in a majestic row of century-old trees. ''It's very comfortable,'' said Efrain Roldan, a Park Avenue doorman, as he considered the stumpy remains of what must have been an impressive oak near his home in the northeast Bronx.
''You can sit there and have lunch, or fall in love with your girlfriend,'' he said, grinning. ''I don't have a girlfriend. I have a wife.''

HEADLINE: Sudans Sign Agreement To Resume Oil Exports

BYLINE: By ISMA'IL KUSHKUSH; Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York

 BODY:
KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Sudan and South Sudan, moving to reduce the hostilities that have severely weakened both of their economies, signed an agreement early Tuesday morning that could lead to the resumption of oil production in two weeks. 
''Resumption of production shall take place as soon as technically feasible,'' the agreement read.
South Sudan became independent of Sudan in 2011, taking with it nearly three quarters of the oil wealth. The pipelines, refinery and port to export the oil, however, are in Sudan.
The two sides, longstanding enemies that fought one of Africa's longest and costliest civil wars, have been at odds for decades, and South Sudan halted oil production in January 2012 in a dispute with Sudan over transportation fees. Both countries came close to full-out war in April 2012.
Both countries have suffered from the loss of oil revenues, with South Sudan depending on oil for 98 percent of its revenue.
''We assume that we will resume as soon as possible,'' South Sudan's petroleum and mining minister, Stephen Dhieu Dau, told reporters in Juba, adding that it would take roughly three weeks to resume production, Reuters reported.
The agreement, signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, under the supervision of the African Union, sets a timetable and the mechanisms to enact a cooperation agreement signed by both countries last September.
In addition to oil production, other matters addressed in the cooperation agreement are to be immediately carried out in the next two to three weeks, including security arrangements, the demarcation of borders, the status of people living across borders, trade, economics and pensions.
''March 10th is the D-Day to implement the agreement,'' Sudan's chief negotiator, Idris Abdel-Gadir, told reporters in Khartoum.
Before Tuesday's agreement, the defense ministers of both sides agreed to begin the establishment of a demilitarized zone along the border as part of the agreed-upon security arrangements.
The Sudanese defense minister, Abdel-Rahim Hussein, confirmed on Sunday that Sudanese troops had begun withdrawing from the border zone. A day later, South Sudan's military spokesman, Philip Aguer, said orders had been given to South Sudanese troops to withdraw from the border area.
In a statement, the United States State Department said, ''The United States welcomes the technical agreement signed between Sudan and South Sudan establishing a safe demilitarized border zone (SDBZ), a firm timeline for the withdrawal of forces, and a way ahead for the deployment of a joint border monitoring force.''
At the United Nations Security Council, which discussed the Sudan-South Sudan tensions on Tuesday, Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador, told reporters that while council members had welcomed the agreements, she was also cautious, given the troubled history.
''There have been many agreements signed but too few actually implemented,'' she said. The importance of agreements, she said, was that ''they are not just signed and touted but in fact implemented in real terms promptly on the ground.''
No final agreement on the disputed district of Abyei was made, but a timeline to establish an administration, council and security council in the district were set up.
Both sides are scheduled to meet again on Sunday in Addis Ababa.

HEADLINE: Security Chief Says Cyberattacks Will Meet With Retaliation

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI and DAVID E. SANGER; Scott Shane contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The chief of the military's newly created Cyber Command told Congress on Tuesday that he is establishing 13 teams of programmers and computer experts who could carry out offensive cyberattacks on foreign nations if the United States were hit with a major attack on its own networks, the first time the Obama administration has publicly admitted to developing such weapons for use in wartime.
''I would like to be clear that this team, this defend-the-nation team, is not a defensive team,'' Gen. Keith Alexander, who runs both the National Security Agency and the new Cyber Command, told the House Armed Services Committee. ''This is an offensive team that the Defense Department would use to defend the nation if it were attacked in cyberspace. Thirteen of the teams that we're creating are for that mission alone.''
General Alexander's testimony came on the same day the nation's top intelligence official, James R. Clapper Jr., warned Congress that a major cyberattack on the United States could cripple the country's infrastructure and economy, and suggested that such attacks now pose the most dangerous immediate threat to the United States, even more pressing than an attack by global terrorist networks. 
On Monday, Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, demanded that Chinese authorities investigate such attacks and enter talks about new rules governing behavior in cyberspace.
General Alexander has been a major architect of the American strategy on this issue, but until Tuesday he almost always talked about it in defensive terms. He has usually deflected questions about America's offensive capability, and turned them into discussions of how to defend against mounting computer espionage from China and Russia, and the possibility of crippling attacks on utilities, cellphone networks and other infrastructure. He was also a crucial player in the one major computer attack the United States is known to have sponsored in recent years, aimed at Iran's nuclear enrichment plants. He did not discuss that highly classified operation during his open testimony.
Mr. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that American spy agencies saw only a ''remote chance'' in the next two years of a major computer attack on the United States, which he defined as an operation that ''would result in long-term, wide-scale disruption of services, such as a regional power outage.''
Mr. Clapper appeared with the heads of several other intelligence agencies, including Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the F.B.I. director Robert S. Mueller III, and the C.I.A. director John O. Brennan, to present their annual assessment of the threats facing the nation. It was the first time that Mr. Clapper listed cyberattacks first in his presentation to Congress, and the rare occasion since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that intelligence officials did not list international terrorism first in the catalog of dangers facing the United States.
''In some cases,'' Mr. Clapper said in his testimony, ''the world is applying digital technologies faster than our ability to understand the security implications and mitigate potential risks.'' He said it was unlikely that Russia and China would launch ''devastating'' cyberattacks against the United States in the near future, but he said foreign spy services had already hacked the computer networks of government agencies, businesses and private companies.
Two specific attacks Mr. Clapper listed, an August 2012 attack against the Saudi oil company Aramco and attacks on American banks and stock exchanges last year, are believed by American intelligence officials to have been the work of Iran.
General Alexander picked up on the same themes in his testimony, saying that he was adding 40 cyber teams, 13 focused on offense and 27 on training and surveillance. When pressed, he said that the best defense hinged on being able to monitor incoming traffic to the United States through private ''Internet service providers,'' which could alert the government, in the milliseconds that electronic messages move, about potentially dangerous attacks. Such surveillance is bound to raise more debate with privacy advocates, who fear government monitoring of the origin and the addressing data on most e-mail messages and other computer exchanges.
Traditional threats occupied much of Mr. Clapper's testimony. American intelligence officials are giving new emphasis to the danger posed by North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs, which are said for the first time to ''pose a serious threat to the United States'' as well as to its East Asian neighbors. North Korea, which recently made a series of belligerent statements after its third nuclear test, has displayed an intercontinental missile that can be moved by road and in December launched a satellite atop a Taepodong-2 launch vehicle, Mr. Clapper's prepared statement noted.
''The rhetoric, while it is propaganda laced, is also an indicator of their attitude and perhaps their intent,'' Mr. Clapper said during one exchange with a lawmaker, adding that he was concerned that North Korea ''could initiate a provocative action against the South.''
In his discussion of terrorism, Mr. Clapper noted that while Al Qaeda's core in Pakistan ''is probably unable to carry out complex, large-scale attacks in the West,'' spinoffs still posed a threat. Listed first is the affiliate in Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which Mr. Clapper said had retained its goal of attacks on United States soil, but he also noted militant groups in six other countries that still threaten local violence.
Mr. Clapper began his remarks by criticizing policy makers for the current budget impasse, saying that the budget cuts known as sequestration will force American spy agencies to make sharp reductions in classified programs and to furlough employees. The classified intelligence budget has ballooned over the past decade, and Mr. Clapper compared the current round of cuts to the period during the 1990s when the end of the cold war led to drastic reductions in the C.I.A.'s budget.
''Unlike more directly observable sequestration impacts, like shorter hours at public parks or longer security lines at airports, the degradation of intelligence will be insidious,'' Mr. Clapper said. ''It will be gradual and almost invisible unless and until, of course, we have an intelligence failure.''
The threat hearing is the only scheduled occasion each year when the spy chiefs present open testimony to Congress about the dangers facing the United States, and Mr. Clapper did not hide the fact that he is opposed to the annual ritual. President Obama devoted part of his State of the Union address to a pledge of greater transparency with the Congress and the American public, but Mr. Clapper, a 71-year-old retired Air Force general, made it clear that he saw few benefits of more public disclosure.
''An open hearing on intelligence matters is something of a contradiction in terms,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Teenage Pregnancy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Posters on Teenage Pregnancy Draw Fire'' (news article, March 7): 
There is substantial research showing the negative outcomes of teenage pregnancy: teenage parents and their children face a lifetime of economic, health and educational challenges. With more than 21,000 New York City teenagers becoming pregnant each year, it is estimated that taxpayers pay more than $21,000 a year for each child born to a teenage mother.
We applaud the city's efforts to raise awareness of this problem. But years of experience teach us that shame-based messaging is ineffective in discouraging young people from sexual risk-taking.
Instead, let's focus on the proven, evidence-based solutions for the teenage pregnancy epidemic in our city. These programs integrate age-appropriate sex education with access to medical, mental health, academic support, financial literacy and career planning services.
Adults don't prevent teenage pregnancy; young people do. Armed with the right knowledge and tools, they will see their own value and nurture a desire for a successful and productive life.
MICHAEL CARRERA New York, March 7, 2013

HEADLINE: John J. Byrne, 80; Turned Around Geico

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
John J. Byrne, who became an insurance industry legend by saving Geico from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970s and averting widespread financial damage, died on Thursday at his home in Etna, N.H. He was 80.
The cause was cancer, his family said.
Mr. Byrne's stature only grew in 1985, when he took Fireman's Fund public in what was then the biggest initial stock offering in history. Warren E. Buffett, who made some of his billions investing in Geico at the time Mr. Byrne was hired to reverse its downward spiral, called Mr. Byrne ''the Babe Ruth of insurance.'' 
Mr. Byrne succeeded by wielding a sharp pencil to cut costs, making cautious but wise bets and juggling many financial balls. In 2000, Forbes magazine said he ''made insurance look sexy.''
''Jack Byrne has distinguished himself as one of the insurance industry's pre-eminent general managers, most creative turnaround experts and most productive capital managers,'' the Insurance Hall of Fame said when it inducted him in 2009.
His rescue of Geico (the name is an acronym for the Government Employees Insurance Company) saved the nation from the sort of financial trauma it experienced when the Penn Central railroad declared bankruptcy in 1970, analysts said at the time. Insurance companies are intricately interconnected, and the collapse of one major institution can have a damaging impact throughout the industry, potentially requiring government intervention.
Geico was formed with the idea of offering federal employees auto insurance at reduced rates because they had fewer accidents. It worked magnificently, and even better after Geico opened its market to private sector white-collar workers as well.
But a combination of overexpansion, inflation, federal price controls, bad risks and its own questionable accounting caused Geico to struggle in the 1970s. In 1975 it experienced its first loss in 36 years, a whopping $126 million. Mr. Byrne agreed to take on the challenge after being passed over for the top job at Travelers Insurance, where he was executive vice president.
He began cutting costs at Geico by laying off 3,000 of the company's 7,000 employees. He withdrew from New Jersey and Massachusetts entirely because regulators there had kept premium costs too low to be profitable. He kicked high-risk drivers off the rolls and raised rates by as much as 40 percent. And he persuaded 27 competing insurance companies to contribute capital to help avert a Geico bankruptcy and so protect themselves.
At Geico's nadir, Mr. Byrne shocked Wall Street by offering the public $75 million in convertible preferred stock. Mr. Buffett responded by betting $4.1 million on the company, starting his purchases at $2 a share, according to published reports.
Five years later, Geico shares traded at $15. Mr. Buffett's investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, continued to buy Geico stock and in 1995 completed its purchase of the remaining shares, paying $70 apiece. Today, Geico is a jewel in Berkshire Hathaway's crown and a household name thanks to heavy advertising campaigns on television and radio.
Mr. Byrne also improved Geico's service. He boasted about handing a customer a check 13 hours after a 2 a.m. accident. By 1976, the company had $137 million in capital, enough to move ahead.
The Insurance Hall of Fame quoted Mr. Buffett as saying that Mr. Byrne was ''just beginning to get warmed up.'' In 1985, James D. Robinson III, chairman of American Express, hired Mr. Byrne to take over its Fireman's Fund unit, which had racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in losses since Amex bought it in 1968. Mr. Byrne said his assignment was to ''put a pretty face on the cover'' of a company that traced its roots to the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 and the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.
Amex spun off the company in an initial public offering that raised more than $900 million; a selling point was that Mr. Byrne would continue as chief executive. In dollars, it was the biggest initial offering to date. In 1991, Allianz, the German financial services company, bought Fireman's from shareholders for $1.1 billion.
Some of Fireman's assets that were not sold ended up in Mr. Byrne's hands, and he converted them into the White Mountains Insurance Group, a company registered in Bermuda with headquarters in New Hampshire that has operated troubled insurance companies for more than 20 years.
John Joseph Byrne Jr. was born on July 11, 1932, in Paterson, N.J. His father owned a small insurance company in Wildwood, N.J., and as a boy John Jr. did office chores for him. He earned an undergraduate degree from Rutgers and a master's degree from the University of Michigan, both in mathematics. He served in the Air Force before starting in the insurance industry as an actuary for the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company.
He is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Dorothy Cain; his sons, John III, Patrick and Mark; his brother, James; and seven grandchildren.
To illustrate Mr. Byrne's mastery of the insurance business, Mr. Buffett once compared him to ''the chicken farmer who rolls an ostrich egg into the hen house and says, 'Ladies, this is what the competition is doing.' ''

HEADLINE: What Do You Want to Be, Now That You're Grown?

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

 BODY:
FOR most of my working life, I have never had to commute or see the inside of a cubicle. As a television critic, I was ''forced'' to watch the tube, and as a sportswriter, I inhabited stadiums and press boxes rather than dingy offices.
For the last couple of decades as a freelance writer in the digital age, I have been able to work down the hall from our bedroom in my sweats and venture out only to talk to wise, wonderful or quirky folks. I even turned my favorite avocation -- watching my daughters play sports -- into a funny and sentimental memoir, ''Daddy's Little Goalie.''
So with the empty nest impending as my youngest daughter started her senior year of high school, I told friends that I was going to start testing jobs I might do in retirement. Their collective immediate reaction was, ''Retire from what? We never thought you worked.'' 
Still, over the last months, I have taken the certification to be a basketball and a girls' lacrosse referee, applied to be a grader of the Scholastic Aptitude Test writing examinations and put myself on tutor lists. The radio interviews I did for ''Daddy's Little Goalie'' were so much fun, a friend and I have proposals out to do our own radio show. My father-in-law, after retiring from the Ford Motor Company, knew he needed some structure and a few bucks, so he became a starter at the local golf course intermittently. He got to see people in good moods and had some golfing privileges on the side.
Increasingly, older adults are working in jobs they never trained for as young people. Many, like me, are testing them out before they leave what they have done for decades -- a sort of preretirement semi-job search.
Trying out an interest is a great idea if it does not jeopardize your full-time job, said Jean C. Setzfand, the vice president of financial security for AARP. ''We did research around people's desire for financial planning in retirement, and one of the key findings is that you don't know what that postretirement work will be like until you practice it. If you can do it a bit before you have to, then it is more tangible than just dreaming about it or worrying about it in the future.''
Ken Ehrman, 61, was pretty sure his job as a pastor at a United Methodist church in Minnesota was going to be his last. His wife, Sally Dyck (''the more high-powered of us,'' he said), was coming to the end of her tenure as bishop of the United Methodist Conference in Minnesota three years ago and was going to be transferred soon.
''Over the years, in different congregations, the thing I seemed to love most was mentoring seminary students or young ministers, showing them what to expect when they got their own congregations,'' said Mr. Ehrman. So he made it a point to do more of that in his last years at his congregation. When Bishop Dyck was transferred to Chicago, Mr. Ehrman took a part-time job helping place seminary students in internships through the Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary on the Northwestern University campus.
''I liken it to this: If you take a chemistry class, there is the book-learning part in the front of the classroom and the lab where you do all the fun experiments in the back,'' he said. ''I am the theological version of the lab guy. I get to work with all the fun stuff.''
On the side, he is taking improvisational courses at Second City, the famed comedy troupe in Chicago. ''You never know when you are going to need this in the ministry,'' he said.
Jerry DeLena's daughter started college last fall, and it was then that he started rethinking his 50-mile commute to Philadelphia International Airport, where he was a manager. The commute was necessary to keep his wife closer to the school in Lower Pottsgrove, Pa., where she is a teacher. The biggest perk of the job, virtually free standby flights, had become less attractive when his son went to school close by at Lehigh University and his daughter seemed always able to get a ride home from High Point University in North Carolina.
Before getting married, Mr. DeLena was a restaurant manager and even owned his own restaurant for a time. At 62, he was not inclined to go back to the 60-hour weeks that entailed.
''But there was a chance to bartend at the local V.F.W., so I thought I would test it out,'' said Mr. DeLena. He got some substitute shifts and liked it so much he also bartends at a Wegman's supermarket restaurant. His retirement date from the airport is now imminent. ''The work is low-stress, and I can pretty much make my own hours. A perfect way to pass the time.''
John Greenman had not exactly planned retirement in 2006, but his children were grown and he had been a producer and reporter at Maine Public Television for about 30 years, so he knew that plan could change. He was driving home one night and heard a report on National Public Radio about a service, Librivox.org, that was looking to make more audio recordings of books by famous authors available in the public domain. The book on his night stand at that time was Mark Twain's autobiography. That night, he went online to see if it was on the Librivox list, and it wasn't.
Mr. Greenman, who had perfected his broadcast voice in a long career in television, did a reading for the service and loved it. Within two months, he put in for retirement and never looked back.
''I just thought I would rather be reading Mark Twain at that point in my life,'' said Mr. Greenman, 66. Lately he has been reading psychology textbooks for another service, Iambik Audiobooks, and has been delving ever deeper into Twain, reading his journals and letters. ''I read in a way I hope generates interest and I just have fun making a few bucks.'' He is also using his broadcast background to do a monthly comedy show on WERU-FM in Orland, Me. ''You know Bob Elliott, of Bob and Ray, is 90 and lives up here, and he has been on the show three times. What a kick it has all been,'' Mr. Greenman said of his conversations with the comedian.
Statistics from the AARP Public Policy Institute show that more and more older people are working -- 18 percent of the population 65 and over last year as opposed to 10.8 percent 25 years ago. While the percentage of those working part time instead of full has increased in recent years, Ms. Setzfand said, it is difficult to say whether that is because of the sluggish economy or other reasons.
''But I get the sense that people don't even want to use the word 'retirement' as much,'' she said. ''People will say, 'my second act' or 'my what's next' and they aren't just taking their pensions and riding into the sunset. That they would prepare for it before they retire from their lifetime jobs seems natural.''
I ended up refereeing 36 basketball games this winter, from high-level boys' high school games to third-grade girls' recreation leagues. I don't expect to be in the N.B.A. any time soon, nor will it reasonably replace real income, but when I left the gym after a particularly raucous high school junior varsity game late in the season, one of the parents from the losing team caught me in the parking lot.
''I go to all the games, and I just wanted to say you and your partner were the best refs we had all year,'' he said.
It was almost like winning the Pulitzer.

HEADLINE: No Division Required in This School Problem

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
BOSTON -- While school officials and parents here were debating how to assign students to Boston's public schools, a lanky young man was quietly observing their public proceedings.
He quickly saw the Rubik's Cube-like puzzle: How could the school system design a plan that would send children to a good school, close to their homes -- in a city that had too few good schools? And could that plan also ensure that students from poor neighborhoods had the same chance of attending good schools as those from more affluent neighborhoods?
The current system, for kindergarten through eighth grade, divides the city into three large zones, a holdover from its traumatic experience in the 1970s with forced busing to end segregation. Today, many students are still bused far from home, yet many disadvantaged students are still in lower-performing schools.
Over the last year, a 27-member advisory committee pored over its options and weighed competing proposals, but became hopelessly tangled up as it considered proposals that created more zones to fix the inequality. 
The young man, Peng Shi, a 24-year-old doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, began asking questions and talking to parents. Then he made a suggestion: why not drop the idea of zones altogether?
For Boston, it was a breakthrough moment. Mr. Shi made some suggestions about how to assign the almost 40,000 students to the 96 schools without using zones and his proposal quickly rose to the top of a pile of about 10 others.
It went through several iterations. The final one gives families a list of at least six schools starting with the two closest high-quality schools, then the next two closest of at least medium quality.
Last month, after a year of study and more than 70 community meetings, the advisory committee voted overwhelmingly to recommend that the Boston School Committee adopt Mr. Shi's model. The school committee was planning to vote on it Wednesday night.
Not everyone is happy with the plan. Critics say it perpetuates inequities. But if it passes, the plan would represent the most significant change in the city's student assignment system in nearly a quarter-century, finally dismantling the remnants of the notorious busing plan.
That it took a dispassionate outsider with coding skills but no political agenda to formulate the model is a measure of the complexities facing urban school districts today. Many such districts, like Boston's, are plagued by inequities, with too few good schools and children mostly of color trapped in low-performing schools. Overcoming that legacy here has been so emotionally charged that previous attempts to redraw the zones have failed (though in 2005 the district did change the algorithm it uses to assign students).
Mr. Shi has no ties to the Boston school system; he was born in China and grew up in Canada. But he is deeply interested in market design, which helps policy makers think about complex trade-offs to bring about positive social results.
''It's groundbreaking in that it doesn't look at just geography but at quality,'' Carol R. Johnson, the school district's superintendent, said of Mr. Shi's model. (It was innovative for Boston though some other cities, including Chicago and San Francisco, have used a similar approach.)
The overhaul of the assignment system started last year, when Mayor Thomas M. Menino said he wanted students to attend schools closer to home, hoping to stimulate more parental involvement and neighborhood cohesiveness.
But many parents complained that there was not enough focus on the issue of equity and the district's fundamental problem -- the scarcity of good schools.
''Peng was at these meetings and just listening,'' said Megan Wolf, who is part of a grass-roots parents' organization.
One fear expressed by families of all socioeconomic backgrounds was that their children could be crowded out of the district's few good schools and end up at ones that are lower-performing. Some families would most likely opt out of the public school system, if not leave the city altogether, they said. Whites make up about 47 percent of Boston's population but only 13 percent of the public school population.
''He started saying things like, 'What I'm hearing is, parents want close to home but they really care about quality,''' Ms. Wolf said. ''He said, 'I'm working on something to try to meet those two goals.' He didn't have a political agenda.''
Mr. Shi became interested in school assignment last year after his national kidney exchange proposal had fallen through. ''I prayed about finding another project,'' said Mr. Shi, who is active in Christian fellowship groups.
He was born in Kunming, China, where his father was a statistics professor and his mother an abdominal surgeon. When he was 11, his family moved to Canada for his education. He graduated from high school in Toronto and was accepted at M.I.T., Princeton and Duke. Money was tight, so he chose Duke for its offer of a full scholarship.
He likes ''to use mathematics and quantitative thinking,'' he said, ''to try to use the gifts God has given me.''
But Boston was not an easy project. With his father ill with lung cancer, he worked 18-hour days from Toronto over the Christmas break, communicating long distance with his economics professors, Parag Pathak at M.I.T., and Tayfun Sonmez at Boston College.
The school district and Mayor Menino had commissioned Dr. Pathak's lab, at M.I.T.'s School Effectiveness and Inequality Initiative, to try to forecast what schools parents might choose under various new proposals. Using choices that the parents had made in the past, Mr. Shi built computer simulations, did demand modeling and generated hundreds of thousands of files and graphs.
But the advisory committee members still had to weigh the importance of things like distance from home, standardized test scores, whether a sibling attends the school, and overall equity.
''It boils down to what is fair and whose claims to a school are most deserving,'' Professor Pathak said. ''In the end, these are value judgments.''
A controversial element of the plan is the ''walk zone priority,'' which gives preference to students living within walking distance of a school.
Research by Dr. Pathak and Dr. Sonmez shows that the walk-zone priority does not actually give much of an advantage to students living nearby. But Mr. Shi's original proposal had no walk zone, and he said in an interview that he personally saw no reason for it; it was added in later.
The walk-zone priority has become intensely symbolic, and Ms. Johnson, the superintendent, said last week that she was ''rethinking my position on walk zone.'' She said she expected some attempt on Wednesday night to eliminate it from the plan before the school committee casts its final vote.
Still, even critics say that Mr. Shi helped everyone think outside the box and that without him, the end product would have been worse.
For his part, Mr. Shi said he found the work humbling.
''We can only contribute one piece of this, and we don't claim we have solved anything,'' he said. ''If you reduce this to a math problem, you think you can solve it. But real life is much more complicated.''

HEADLINE: France Proposes New Rules to Guarantee Equal Access to the Internet

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER and NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
SERRAVAL, France -- The French government on Tuesday called for a law requiring Internet service providers to give all the traffic on their networks equal priority, saying existing rules were insufficient for protecting free speech online and ensuring fair competition among Web publishers.
The proposal would mark a big shift in French policy and a break with existing European Union practice on the thorny issue of so-called net neutrality. And though almost certain to meet resistance from some Internet service providers, it could fuel calls for similar rules throughout the 27-country European Union.
The issue came to a head in France in January, when one service provider, Free, temporarily blocked users from seeing advertising sold by Google until the government ordered Free to restore access.
The proposal, by a French government advisory panel and endorsed by the minister overseeing digital commerce, pits companies that build and operate telecommunications systems against Internet players that rely on the networks to deliver their content to consumers. The French proposal would still need to be drafted as legislation and taken up by Parliament. 
''I do think that what happens in France could be a test case for what happens on these tensions globally,'' said Matthew Howett, an analyst at Ovum, a telecommunications consulting firm in London. ''There are a lot of countries waiting for someone else to move.''
In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission has sought to impose net neutrality regulations without legislation, but the initiative has gotten bogged down by legal challenges and other hurdles.
Google and Free, France's second-largest Internet access provider, declined to comment on the proposal Tuesday.
Thierry Dieu, a spokesman for the European Telecommunications Network Operators Association, a lobbying group in Brussels, declined to comment directly on the French proposal, but he said the group's members favored a ''harmonized'' approach across the European Union, rather than country-by-country legislation.
''For the single telecommunications market in the E.U. and the certainty of business, this is very important,'' he said.
Even some free-speech advocates questioned whether the rules proposed by the advisory panel were at odds with other moves by the government of the French president, Franois Hollande, to limit hate speech on Twitter and other social networks.
Until now, the European Union and national administrations in many of the member countries have said that no new regulations were necessary to ensure that Internet traffic -- whether simple e-mail messages or bandwidth-hungry video files -- was treated equitably by network operators. Telecommunications providers have generally been permitted to determine which files or traffic get priority during periods of peak network demand, which they say is essential, given ever-increasing traffic.
E.U. regulators in Brussels have said the high level of competition among Internet service providers was sufficient to prevent the kinds of abuses feared by advocates of net neutrality rules. According to the Brussels view, if a telecommunications company were to cut off access to a certain Web site for political or business reasons, users could simply move to a rival service.
The French showdown in January between Free and Google involved a dispute over the carriage of YouTube, Google's video-sharing service. Free complained that YouTube hogs vast amounts of bandwidth, forcing the networking company to make big investments in infrastructure without generating any additional financial benefit from YouTube's advertising revenue.
At the time, Fleur Pellerin, the French minister overseeing the digital economy, ordered Free to restore the Google advertisements. But she said the issue of net neutrality needed further study. On Tuesday, at a Paris news conference, she threw her weight behind the newly released proposal from the Conseil National du Numrique, or national digital council, which recommended legislation to enshrine net neutrality as a ''fundamental principle'' of French law.
''At this moment,'' Ms. Pellerin said, ''neutrality has not been defined from a legal point view.''
The digital council, composed of experts from the private and public sectors, recommended that exceptions to net neutrality should be possible only with the approval of a judge.
''Freedom of expression is insufficiently protected under French law, amid the development of techniques like filtering, blocking, censorship and slowdowns,'' the council said.
While free-speech groups have been campaigning for net neutrality regulations, the council's proposal drew a lukewarm response from some of them. One reason was a recommendation that the regulations should be extended beyond Internet service providers and should apply also to ''communications services.''
The council cited search engines and social networks as examples, without naming any, saying the dominant positions that some of these companies wield could create the scope for abusing their power.
''Today, the Internet is no longer just a physical network but also, and above all, a collection of services,'' the council said. ''It is pointless to impose net neutrality upstream if the rules are not changed downstream.''
That aspect of the report pleased some telecommunications providers, despite their general resistance to net neutrality regulations.
''We agree with the broad approach in the report of targeting not just operators but also service providers,'' France Tlcom, the country's biggest telecommunications company, said Tuesday.
Ms. Pellerin described neutrality as a two-sided question, requiring legislation that addressed not just freedom of expression but also ''the economic balance between the major players.''
''Our goal is to support the vision of an Internet that is free, open, respectful of rights and that is a driver of innovation,'' Ms. Pellerin said.
The proposal comes as the Hollande government has been discussing new curbs on other digital policy fronts. There has been talk, for example, of measures to restrict hate speech on social networks like Twitter, following a spate of anti-Semitic and racist postings on the microblogging site. How such a measure could be reconciled with legislation guaranteeing ''neutrality'' on social networks left some analysts scratching their heads.
''It would be hypocritical to enlarge the exceptions to free speech at the same time as legislating for network neutrality in the name of free speech,'' said Jrmie Zimmermann, a spokesman for La Quadrature du Net, a group that opposes any type of restrictions on information on the Internet.
France would not be the first European country to legislate on net neutrality issues. The Netherlands two years ago adopted a law banning mobile phone operators from blocking access to Internet communications services like Skype, which undercut network operators' call charges. But the Dutch measure is more limited in scope than the proposal outlined by the French digital council.
Ms. Pellerin acknowledged that any new French law would be of limited efficacy if not matched by other countries, given the border-hopping nature of the Internet.
''We're dealing with transnational actors, and the definition of a principle that is not recognized outside of France would be complicated to implement,'' she said. France will press the issue with other European countries, she said, with an eye to establishing ''common definitions and principles'' across the European Union.
While the European Commission has conducted a series of reviews of its network access rules, it has so far stopped short of proposing net neutrality legislation. Linda Cain, a spokeswoman for Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for information policy, said Brussels expected to publish new recommendations on telecommunications traffic management and related issues later this year.
Nicola Clark reported from Paris.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mixing Scripture Into the Batter

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, N.Y. -- At first, the prep work for 200 four-pound cheesecakes in the sunny, commercial kitchen seemed familiar, unremarkable. An elderly woman in a bandanna wielded a cheese cutter, slicing through fat bricks of cream cheese. Another woman with silvery bangs poured heavy cream into the mixer, dipped a tasting pinkie into the batter and grinned. Rich vanilla perfumed the air. As containers from Florida were opened, bright bursts of Key lime scent escaped.
Familiar -- and not. In this bakery, wall-mounted religious icons watched over the proceedings. Words on a poster speculated about how the Nativity would have been more efficient, nurturing and peaceful if Three Wise Women had been at the scene. Most strikingly, except for the clatter of aluminum springform pans being oiled by hand, the bakery was mostly quiet. When the nuns of New Skete bake, they pray.
''Scripture says, 'Pray always,' '' said Sister Cecelia Harvey, prioress of this monastery in rural upstate New York. She is a petite white-haired nun with an easy laugh and a wry sense of humor. ''Can you not be aware of God while you're putting cheese in a bowl and mixing things up?'' 
For at least 1,500 years, monastic orders have been producing fine foods and spirits to barter and sell. Today, monastic gourmet still pays the bills. In cupboards worldwide, the association of ''Trappist'' and ''preserves'' has become as commonplace as ''Benedictine'' and ''brandy.'' In December, the Belgian monks of the St. Sixtus abbey, who usually sell their prized dark beer, Westvleteren 12, at the monastery, permitted a one-time, wickedly expensive shipment (about $85 for a gift box of six bottles and two glasses), to cover costs of repairs, like a new roof.
In contrast to the solemnity of the monastic vow, the marketing of monastic food has become contemporary, even tongue-in-cheek. According to Will Keller, founder of monasterygreetings.com, a distributor who represents about 75 monasteries, popular items include Nun Better Cookies, baked by the Sisters of the Holy Spirit in Cleveland, and Praylines made by the nuns at the St. Benedictine monastery in Canyon, Tex. Mystic Monk Coffee, roasted by the Carmelite monks of Cody, Wyo., even features a single-serving pod called a ''monk shot.''
But as the population of many orders ages and dwindles, monastic kitchens face the challenge of maintaining business while trying to protect the contemplative quality of their lives and the standards of their products.
That's the battle joined by the Eastern Orthodox Nuns of New Skete, who bake, freeze and ship 13 flavors of cheesecake. The nuns have been self-supporting since 1969, when they left the Roman Catholic Church to found their monastery. But now the seven nuns, including two in a nursing home, range in age from 61 to 90. How to persevere?
In the last year and a half, the nuns and the nearby Monks of New Skete, known for their German shepherd breeding programs and puppy training books, started sharing a business manager, marketing director and a technology expert for their online businesses. In 2012, over 10,000 cheesecakes were sold through their online store, gift shop, fund-raisers and wholesale distribution. Their bakery facility has the capacity to produce 400 cakes per baking session. Currently, the nuns, with five part-time assistants, bake one to two days a week, about 37 weeks of the year.
Last winter, the nuns introduced a new flavor, raspberry chocolate. They are developing a gluten-free cheesecake. They recently took over the making of cheese spreads from the monks, whose gift line now includes German shepherd plush toys and kitchen towels.
With the monks, they have a Facebook page and a Web site for their commercial products, and a second set for homilies and spiritual beliefs. ''But I have the password,'' Sister Cecelia said.
Some 35 years ago, the nuns were casting about for ways to remain solvent. They had cleaned houses in town, sewn sacramental vestments and helped the monks raise the dogs.
Then an abbot from their affiliated church, the Orthodox Church in America, suggested they try selling a specialty food -- ''not inexpensive, because even in an economic slump, people will want to treat themselves,'' Sister Patricia Lawless said he advised them.
Sister Magdalene Oliver, who joined New Skete in 1975 and died in 2003, loved to bake. Her recipe still informs their basic cheesecake. The four-pounder, which serves 16, has lemon accents, is lined by pulverized vanilla cookie crumbs and retails for about $41. ''You don't put 'plain' on the label,'' noted Sister Patricia. ''Deluxe sounds better.''
In the bakery, Sister Patricia and Sister Rebecca Cown tamped down crumbs that rimmed the quivering cheesecakes. They placed pans on oven racks that would rotate like a Ferris wheel, from hotter to cooler, to prevent tops from cracking. The cakes, whose acclaim grew by word-of-mouth, are now shipped in ice packs and a cardboard container that reads, ''Voted Best Cheesecake in the Tri-Cities Area'' -- Albany, Schenectady, Troy.
''Anything that can go wrong, has gone wrong,'' Sister Cecelia said on a tour of the bakery, which the nuns designed to be energy efficient. The nuns made the cheese-slicers, carts and boxing frames in their carpentry shop, and had the spinning cake stands custom-built. ''But we are always looking for ways to do things better,'' she added.
The search -- for a better cheesecake, a more prayerful life -- has always animated the nuns. In 1960, Sister Cecelia was a teenager when she joined the Sisters of Poor Clare. ''I hated snakes and bugs, so I couldn't become a missionary,'' she said.
Cloistered behind walls in Evansville, Ind., she prayed eight times daily, baked communion wafers and was not permitted contact with the public. ''I wasn't allowed to look up at the blue sky because it would detract from prayer,'' Sister Cecelia said. She stayed nine years.
In 1969, seven nuns, ages 21 to 40, left together, searching for a way to live contemplatively and also engage with the world. After visiting the Monks of New Skete, they settled on a 12-acre hilly, wooded property, doing much of the construction themselves.
The nuns' self-reliance permeates their monastery. Sister Cecelia discovered a talent for iconography; she has sold about 350 gold-leaf religious paintings. Sister Patricia studied architecture and building codes to draw blueprints for a recent expansion, with a guest suite and a chapel.
Most of the present nuns chose New Skete after setting aside other lives: they include women who were Roman Catholic missionaries in China, Zaire and Burundi; an Episcopalian psychologist; a soil conservationist and widowed mother of eight.
Every evening, they join their brother monks at Vespers. They celebrate feast days with them and a small community known as the ''companions of New Skete'' -- married believers.
But their own communal day begins at 7:15 a.m. with Matins. Their pet German shepherds respectfully patrol the hallway. The nuns, in simple robes, file silently into their modest chapel and, after seven candles are lighted, chant prayers a cappella. ''O God, create in me a pure heart,'' they harmonize. ''In my belly, a new and constant spirit.''
Sister Patricia has another ritual that she observes faithfully. ''I enjoy a small slice of cheesecake every day,'' she said.
''I don't like liqueurs,'' added the nun, who lived in the Evansville cloister for 18 years before setting forth. ''But now our Kahla cheesecake is one of my favorites.''

HEADLINE: Night of the Living Alesina

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: They can&#8217;t let the confidence fairy go. 

 BODY:
Ah, remember the good old days of expansionary austerity? On both sides of the Atlantic, austerians seized on academic work by Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna claiming that fiscal consolidation, if focused on spending cuts, would if anything lead to economic expansion. It wasn't because the paper was especially compelling - even a quick look suggested that the methodology for identifying austerity was seriously flawed. But A-A told people what they wanted to hear, and they went with it. 
Since then we've had what has to be one of the most decisive combinations of scholarly critique and real-world tests of an economic doctrine ever - and expansionary austerity has failed with flying colors. The IMF went about identifying austerity through an examination of actual policy, and A-A's results were reversed. Critics showed that all of the alleged examples of expansion through austerity involved factors like currency depreciation or sharp falls in interest rates that don't apply now. Osbornian policies in the UK led to stagnation; and in the euro area, well ...
By the way, if you take out Greece, the result is pretty much the same, although the R-squared goes down.
So you might have expected austerians to change their minds, or at least to come up with other justifications. But no. Both David Cameron and Paul Ryan are still preaching that old expansionary austerity religion, confidence fairy and all.
This is, by the way, a fairly big deal for the Ryan budget, which actually produces a lot of front-loaded austerity, in part because it keeps the tax hikes that finance Obamacare while cancelling the Medicaid expansion and exchange subsidies. The result would be a lot of fiscal drag in 2014 and 2015 - years when the U.S. is very likely still to be in a liquidity trap, so multipliers will be large. This particular "Path to Prosperity" is, in the short to medium term, very much a path to continued depression.
Luckily it isn't going to happen. And a quick read of reactions suggests that the new Ryan plan is being greeted with derision rather than adulation. Is our pundits learning? A bit, maybe.

HEADLINE: Researchers Find 25 Countries Using Surveillance Software

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: A study traces government use of an off-the-shelf program called FinSpy to monitor the electronic activities of individuals, often in countries with a record of political repression. 

 BODY:
Last May, two security researchers volunteered to look at a few suspicious e-mails sent to some Bahraini activists. Almost one year later, the two have uncovered evidence that some 25 governments, many with questionable records on human rights, may be using off-the-shelf surveillance software to spy on their own citizens.
Morgan Marquis-Boire, a security researcher at Citizen Lab, at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, and Bill Marczak, a computer science doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, found that the e-mails contained surveillance software that could grab images off computer screens, record Skype chats, turn on cameras and microphones and log keystrokes. The word "FinSpy" appeared in the spyware code. FinSpy is spyware sold by the Gamma Group, a British company that says it sells monitoring software to governments solely for criminal investigations. 
Now, one year later, Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak have found evidence that FinSpy is being run off servers in 25 countries, including Ethiopia and Serbia, without oversight.
Until Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak stumbled upon FinSpy last May, security researchers had tried, unsuccessfully, for a year to track it down. FinSpy gained notoriety in March 2011 after protesters raided Egypt's state security headquarters and discovered a document that appeared to be a proposal by the Gamma Group to sell FinSpy to the government of President Hosni Mubarak.
Martin J. Muench, a Gamma Group managing director, has said his company does not disclose its customers but that Gamma Group sold its technology to governments only to monitor criminals. He said that it was most frequently used "against pedophiles, terrorists, organized crime, kidnapping and human trafficking."
But evidence suggests the software is being sold to governments where the potential for abuse is high. "If you look at the list of countries that Gamma is selling to, many do not have a robust rule of law," Mr. Marquis-Boire said. "Rather than catching kidnappers and drug dealers, it looks more likely that it is being used for politically motivated surveillance."
As of last year, Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak, with other researchers at Rapid7, CrowdStrike and others, had found command-and-control servers running the spyware in just over a dozen countries. They have since scanned the entire Internet for FinSpy.
The Munk School is publishing their updated findings on Wednesday. The list of countries with servers running FinSpy is now Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Britain, Brunei, Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Vietnam.
In Ethiopia, FinSpy was disguised in e-mails that were specifically aimed at political dissidents. The e-mails lured targets to click on pictures of members of Ginbot 7, an Ethiopian opposition group. When they clicked on the pictures, FinSpy downloaded to their machines and their computers began communicating with a local server in Ethiopia.
"This continues the theme of FinSpy deployments with strong indications of politically motivated targeting," the researchers wrote in their report.
A Turkmenistan server running the software belonged to a range of I.P. addresses specifically assigned to the ministry of communications. Turkmenistan is the first clear-cut case of a government running the spyware off its own computer system. Human Rights Watch has called Turkmenistan one of the world's "most repressive countries" and warned that dissidents faced "constant threat of government reprisal."
In Vietnam, the researchers found evidence that FinSpy was running on Android-powered phones. They found one Android phone infected with FinSpy that was sending text messages back to a Vietnamese telephone number. That finding was particularly troubling, researchers say, given recent clampdowns by the nation's government. Last year, Vietnam introduced censorship laws that prohibit bloggers from speaking out against the country's ruling Communist party. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 40 people had since been convicted and sentenced to prison terms. Many are now serving terms ranging from three to 13 years.
The sale of surveillance technology is still largely unregulated, but Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak's findings have prompted greater scrutiny. Responding to their findings last fall, Germany's foreign minister Guido Westerwelle called for an Europe-wide ban on the export of surveillance technology to repressive regimes. And last month, Privacy International and other groups filed complaints with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development against Gamma Group and Trovicor GmbH, a German company that also sells surveillance software.
"I don't think you can put technology back in the bottle," said Mr. Marquis-Boire. "I understand why police would want to use this type of technology, but I'm just not for commercial companies selling them to nondemocratic regimes with questionable human rights records."

HEADLINE: After Financial Crisis, Prosecutors Navigate Tricky Waters

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The dearth of prosecutions since the financial crisis is again stirring controversy, but there is still time for political leaders to hold corporate executives responsible when a company engages in misconduct. 

 BODY:
The question of whether large financial institutions can ever be held fully responsible for criminal conduct has again become a political controversy. 
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.responded to a question at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week about the failure to prosecute multinational banks for various transgressions by saying, "I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute - if we do bring a criminal charge - it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy."
Mr. Holder's frank admission that the Justice Department's hands are sometimes tied in responding to corporate wrongdoing was offered in the context of a larger discussion about how companies that are considered "too big to fail" have become effectively insulated from facing criminal charges. But the attorney general shifted the focus back to Congress when he went on to say, "I think that's something that we - you all - need to consider." 
Despite the finger-pointing, the fact remains that few executives have been held responsible when their company engages in misconduct.
Various officials have their own explanation for the lack of action. At another Senate hearing last week, Jerome H. Powell, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, said that the decision to not file criminal charges against HSBC over money laundering was not attributable to the regulators, who can only pursue civil remedies. Instead, he pointedly said that "the Justice Department has total authority" on deciding "who gets prosecuted for what."
Others have attributed the lack of prosecutions to the so-called Arthur Andersen effect, named because of the demise of the accounting firm after it was convicted of obstruction of justice related to its auditing work at Enron. After the firm was found guilty and was forced out of business, thousands of jobs were lost, sending a chilling message to prosecutors that they needed to tread carefully when pursuing criminal charges against a company in a highly regulated industry.
Despite the fear of charging a large bank with a crime, the Justice Department has tried to show its mettle recently in cases involving manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Its solution to the problem has involved having foreign subsidiaries of global banks plead guilty to a charge, rather than the whole entity. 
 As I noted in a previous post about how banks would have to settle these cases, this type of resolution is intended to limit the impact on the parent bank because the entity admitting guilt has no operations in the United States, so there a few collateral consequences from the conviction.
But the fear of putting a large company out business - even if a legitimate concern in some instances - does not mean that individuals should also avoid prosecution for their role in corporate misconduct. At the Senate Banking committee hearing, David S. Cohen, the Treasury undersecretary, acknowledged that regulators had not aggressively pursued individuals "who are responsible for the conduct that has resulted in fines and penalties against the institution itself." 
Although a few lower-level traders have been charged, the settlements involving large banks over manipulation of Libor have not involved any real costs to senior executives. And HSBC's money laundering case involved neither a corporate guilty plea nor any direct action against individuals responsible for long-running practices.
Of course, pursuing cases against individuals is often easier said than done. For a criminal charge to stick, the government must prove the requisite intent beyond a reasonable doubt, which allows for defenses like ignorance or good faith to be used. The government has won some convictions in banking cases, like one against the former mortgage executive Lee B. Farkas, who received a 30-year prison sentence. But those cases have been few, with none filed recently.
Trying to assess civil penalties against individuals involved in money laundering cases like HSBC's would not necessarily be easy, either. The statute authorizing the sanctions requires proof that the bank official acted "willfully." In Ratzlaf v. United States, the Supreme Court interpreted that term in a case involving currency reporting to require proof that the defendant intended to violate a known legal duty, a very high standard.
The banking law also authorizes civil penalties for negligent violations, a much lower threshold of proof, but those can only be sought from a financial institution, not individuals. The amount of any assessment is limited to $500 for a violation, or $50,000 for a pattern, which is not much of a deterrent against a multinational bank.
The government has also stumbled in its handling of other civil cases. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission lost its case against a midlevel executive at Citigroup for his role in the sale of a collateralized debt obligation tied to subprime mortgages, even though the agency only needed to prove negligence. 
S.E.C. charges against mutual fund executives for making misleading statements about the stability of a money market fund during the height of the financial crisis resulted in a finding against only one individual, and then just for negligence and not intentional fraud. The agency is appealing that verdict, but winning the case will be difficult.
Mr. Holder is certainly right when he said that the impact of a prosecution needs to be considered before charges are filed, and a repeat of the demise of a firm like Arthur Andersen is not something to be taken lightly. But the real frustration is the lack of individual prosecutions, which strengthens the impression that the company will take the hit by paying a large fine to protect executives. 
Whether a bank is "too big to jail" is not relevant to determining how to hold individuals accountable for corporate misconduct. Congress may want to consider measures to authorize regulators to hold corporate executives responsible when the company engages in misconduct if it wants to foster greater accountability.

HEADLINE: Challenges Facing Next S.E.C. Chief

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Mary Jo White would face significant challenges as leader of the S.E.C. | Hostess Brands struck a $410 million deal to save Twinkies and Ding Dongs. | A corporate spinoff can present a tempting opportunity to offload liabilities. | The Carlyle Group is lowering the bar for investors to participate in its private equity buyouts. 

 BODY:
Mary Jo White got a friendly reception during testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, moving closer to becoming the next leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But even her supporters on Capitol Hill highlighted the significant challenges that would await her in that role, DealBook's Ben Protess writes.
Striking a confident tone, Ms. White pledged to tackle enforcement actions and unfinished regulation, though she offered little detail. "She did, however, signal a flexible approach to reforming money market funds, an approach that could draw scrutiny from investor advocates and liberal lawmakers." While the agency's former leader, Mary L. Schapiro, had been tasked with restoring legitimacy to the S.E.C., now "lawmakers say that Ms. White must elevate the agenda to take on topics outside her predecessor's regime. Ms. White, for example, vowed to examine the growing world of high-frequency trading, an issue that continues to confound the agency." 
Lawmakers also pressed Ms. White to explain how she would navigate potential conflicts of interest. Ms. White, who represented financial clients after her tenure as a federal prosecutor, said her work for Wall Street "does not change me as a person. It doesn't mean I embrace the policy thoughts of any of my clients." Going forward, she said, "The American public will be my client, and I will work as zealously as is possible on behalf of them."
TWINKIES BRAND LIVES TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY | Hostess Brands struck a $410 million deal to sell a collection of snacks - Twinkies, Ding Dongs, Ho Hos, Sno Balls and Dolly Madison Zingers - to Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Company, two firms with experience in corporate turnarounds. "The sale will mean that Twinkies, born more than 83 years ago in an Illinois industrial kitchen, will live on, having survived wars, recessions and the South Beach and Dukan diets," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced and Peter Lattman write. C. Dean Metropoulos, leader of the firm that bears his name, is expected to become chief executive of the snack business.
"We saw a real opportunity to revitalize these brands, just with some T.L.C.," Daren Metropoulos, one of Mr. Metropoulos's sons and an executive at the family firm, told DealBook. That effort may include marketing efforts that resemble those for Pabst Blue Ribbon, which Metropoulos & Company owns. Social media may play a role, and comedians like Zach Galifianakis may be brought on as spokesmen. The deal includes five Hostess factories, and the new company will probably feature the Hostess name.
The field of potential buyers once seemed crowded, but by the deadline on Monday, the only qualified offer came from Apollo and Metropoulos. "It's not that we lacked interest," Gregory F. Rayburn, the Hostess chief executive, said in an interview. "Other bidders felt that they could not top the price."
WHEN SPINOFFS ARE A DUMPING GROUND | "A spinoff is a product of Wall Street math that says one plus one can equal three. Yet as shareholders of Time Warner may be about to find out, it can also be all about subtraction, as a company ditches an unwanted business, in this case, magazines," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column.
As deals by General Motors and Ford Motor show, it can be tempting to attach liabilities to the company being spun off. "This is often management's best opportunity to burnish its own company at another's expense. It's hard to resist." Mr. Davidoff continues: "The reason a spinoff is a preferred way to get rid of businesses a company no longer wants is that shareholders have no choice in the matter. The decision is simply made by the board."
ON THE AGENDA | Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, speaks at the Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Fla., at 8 a.m. A House Financial Services subcommittee conducts a hearing about mortgage insurance at 10 a.m. Data on retail sales in February is out at 8:30 a.m. Hot Topic, which recently agreed to sell itself to Sycamore Partners, reports earnings after the market closes. Martha Stewart is on CNBC at 2 p.m.
CARLYLE LOWERS BARRIER TO ENTRY | The Carlyle Group is lowering the bar for investors to participate in its private equity buyouts. Trying to reach a broader base of customers, Carlyle is preparing a new fund with a minimum investment of $50,000, compared with minimums of between $5 million and $20 million previously, The Wall Street Journal reports. (The opportunity will be available to "accredited" investors.) The move comes after other private equity giants have begun offering products for individual investors, but "in moving down-market to attract new funds, Carlyle and other firms could face questions from some institutional and ultrarich clients drawn to such firms partly for their exclusivity," The Journal writes.

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s chief executive, turned 57 on Wednesday. It was five years ago to the day that Mr. Dimon was asked to make one of the biggest deals of his career: buying Bear Stearns. 

 BODY:
DealBook readers, take note. Wednesday is birthday No. 57 for Jamie Dimon.
And unlike five birthdays ago, one can presume that Mr. Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, will not need to ponder buying a major rival on the verge of bankruptcy. 
In what is now Wall Street lore, Mr. Dimon was celebrating his 52nd birthday at a Greek restaurant in Midtown Manhattan on March 13, 2008, surrounded by his wife, his parents and one of his three daughters. But his dinner was interrupted by a call on his cellphone, which was normally used by his children.
As it turns out, the caller was Gary Parr, a senior deal maker at Lazard - who was working on behalf of Bear Stearns.
From Kate Kelly's "Street Fighters," with addenda in brackets:
"Jamie," Parr began, "I'm sorry to bother you. But I wouldn't call if it wasn't important."
Dimon wasn't thrilled. Even when it wasn't a special occasion, he hated being interrupted on his cellphone, which was reserved largely for his kids' use. This, he figured, must be a real emergency.
"I'm calling about Bear Stearns," Parr said. "We have a real issue here and we need to be talking to you and your team. They're in desperate shape. They need a lot of money." He asked if there was any chance Dimon could make Bear a big loan that night.
Dimon's mind whirled. He couldn't fathom making a purchase of Bear's size in just 12 hours. Still, there could be some possibilities there. He asked if Bear had been in touch with Hank Paulson [then the Treasury secretary] or Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman.
Parr said yes. Bear executives had been in touch with those parties all day, he said, and would continue to post them that evening as things progressed. He pressed Dimon. Though it would be tough to do an overnight deal, was he willing to explore some options? Would Dimon take a direct call from Alan Schwartz [then Bear's chief executive]?
"I'd be happy to talk to Alan, and I can get a team on it right away," Dimon replied. By now he had walked out of the restaurant and onto East Forty-Eighth Street, where he could speak more privately. He hung up and began dialing his deputies.
The rest is history. Mr. Dimon ultimately agreed to buy Bear for the bargain-basement price of $2 a share, which was later raised to $10 a share, with support from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis stronger than most of its rivals, making its chief one of the most powerful banking leaders around.
JPMorgan has taken a number of hits, including the enormous trading loss incurred by a powerful internal unit. That is the subject of a hearing scheduled in Washington on Friday.
Over all, the firm remains near the top of many banking league tables and still regularly turns a profit.
But Mr. Dimon may very well be hoping that this year, he will not be interrupted by a phone call.

HEADLINE: Rates on Some Student Loans Again Set to Double

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A year after Congress extended low interest rates on subsidized federal Stafford student loans, the rates are set to double at the end of June. 

 BODY:
It's March, and it's dj vu all over again as students and consumer advocates try to raise awareness of a coming increase in interest rates on some federal student loans. 
On July 1, just like last year, rates on subsidized loans made to low- and moderate-income undergraduates under the federal Stafford program are scheduled to double. Again, like last year, the rate is set to rise to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent for new loans made after June 30.
In case you've forgotten, here's a recap. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 reduced rates on subsidized Stafford loans over four academic years, to the current 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent. But the rates are scheduled to bounce back up, unless Congress acts to extend the current rate.
Last year, Congress extended the lower rates for one year. So, here we are again.
On Wednesday, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce will debate the costs and benefits of the federal student loan program, including student loan interest rates.
The debate comes as growing student debt, which has reached $1 trillion, has become a concern for policy makers and regulators.
"Congress must not double the rate," said Ethan Senack, higher education advocate with the United States Public Interest Research Group. The group and student leaders are calling on Congress make the rate reduction permanent. The group estimated that the lower rates this academic year saved nearly 8 million students about $1,000 each on their loan costs.

HEADLINE: Who Is Poor?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Three ways of defining poverty suggest three different approaches to relief. 

 BODY:
There are three ways of defining poverty in America: the official Census Bureau method, which uses a set of income thresholds that vary by family size and composition; an experimental income-based method called the Supplemental Poverty Measure that factors in government programs designed to help people with low incomes; and a consumption-based method that measures what households actually spend.

By defining poverty according to different criteria, these three methods capture surprisingly different populations of men, women and children. In a perfect world, these three methods would all tell us to do the same thing to alleviate poverty, but it's not like that. Each method suggests a different approach toward how our government should direct its poverty-fighting resources.
According to the two income-based methods of calculation, poverty is increasing; according to the consumption-based method, it is decreasing. Confusingly, I am afraid, both the official method and the consumption method of defining poverty suggest that we should shift benefits away from the elderly and increase programs serving poor children and their families, but the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which is also income-based, does exactly the opposite.
Needless to say, these three methods and their distinct outcomes have led to substantial disagreement among policy experts and social scientists. The lack of definition in our definition of poverty is part of the problem; it helps to answer the question of how the richest country in the history of the world could have so many people living in a state of deprivation. 
Let's go over this a bit. Start with the two alternative measures of poverty based on income. The official definition was established in 1963 by the Kennedy Administration and uses as a point of reference the average dollar value of all the food needed for a week, times three. Income is calculated on a pre-tax basis including earnings, unemployment benefits, Social Security, disability, welfare, pensions, alimony and child support. The poverty threshold is set at the point at which a family would have to spend more than a third of its income on food.
The second income-based method of calculating poverty, the Supplemental Poverty Measure, is also published by the Census. It was first released in 2011. The S.P.M. adds together cash income, tax credits (in particular, the Earned Income Tax Credit, the benefit most important to the working poor), plus the value of in-kind benefits used to pay for food (food stamps), clothing, shelter and utilities, and then subtracts taxes paid, work expenses (including child care), out-of-pocket medical costs and child support paid to another household.
The differences in the results of these two income-based measures are readily apparent in Fig. 1, a chart published by the Census. The bar on the right represents the S.P.M., and the bar on the left represents the official method.
The poverty rate for poor children, under the official measure, is 22.3 percent; under the S.P.M. it is only 18.1 percent. The rate of poverty for those 65 and older is 8.7 percent under the official measure, but it nearly doubles to 15.1 percent under the S.P.M.
If the S.P.M. were adopted as the official measure used by government agencies to define poverty, millions of poor children would either lose, or face reductions in, benefits from means-tested programs, while millions of those over the age of 65 would qualify for government assistance.
On Nov. 4, 2011, The Times reported the findings of its own study of poverty calculations. When deploying measures almost identical to those used in the S.P.M., the study produced very similar results, showing higher levels of poverty among the elderly than the official measure and lower levels of poverty for poor children and households led by single mothers. The following example from the Times involved a retired city employee in Charlotte, N.C.:
Such is the case for John William Springs, 69, a retired city worker in Charlotte who gets nearly $12,000 a year in Social Security and disability checks. That leaves him about $1,300 above the poverty threshold for a single adult his age -'officially not poor. Then again, Mr. Springs had a heart attack last summer and struggles with lung disease. Factor in the $2,500 a year that he estimates he spends on medicine, and Mr. Springs crosses the statistical line into poverty.
The Times also found that the S.P.M. approach reduced poverty rates among many of the non-elderly. Take the case of Angelique Melton, a divorced mother with two children, who lost her job in 2009:
Struggling to pay the rent and keep the family adequately fed, she took the only job she could find: a part-time position at Wal-Mart that paid less than half her former salary. With an annual income of about $7,500 - well below the poverty line of $17,400 for a family of three - Ms. Melton was officially poor. Unofficially she was not.
After trying to stretch her shrunken income, Ms. Melton signed up for $3,600 a year in food stamps and received $1,800 in nutritional supplements from the Women, Infants and Poor children program. And her small salary qualified her for large tax credits, which arrive in the form of an annual check - in her case for about $4,000. Along with housing aid, those subsidies gave her an annual income of nearly $18,800 - no one's idea of rich, but by the new count not poor.
The consumption method of measuring poverty - which was the subject, to some extent, of a column I wrote on Jan. 30 about the so called hidden prosperity of the poor - finds a substantial decline in the over-all rate of poverty, especially among the elderly. 
The consumption-based method, which was disparaged in an email to the Times by Shawn Fremstad of the Center for Economic and Policy Research as "not ready for prime time," is vigorously defended by Bruce D. Meyer and James X. Sullivan, economists at the University of Chicago and Notre Dame respectively. They argue in a series of papers that both the official and supplemental methods overestimate the level of poverty among those 65-plus for two reasons: "because older Americans are more likely (than other age groups) to be spending out of savings and using assets (like homes and cars) that they own" and because the two income-based measures of calculating poverty overstate the rate of inflation.
By Meyer and Sullivan's computations, consumption poverty among those 65 and older has fallen by 83 percent since 1980 to just 3.2 percent in 2010.
Sullivan, in an email to The Times, suggested that 
there is something in this paper for everyone (on both the left and right) to like, but others might say there's something for everyone to dislike. The right likes being able to say that poverty is declining.
He added that poverty scholars who have worked on development of the S.P.M. "have been very cold to our argument that a consumption-based measure of poverty is clearly better than one based on income."
This heap of contradictions demonstrates the wisdom of the warning from Aaron Levenstein, a business professor at Baruch College who died in 1986: "Statistics are like a bikini. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."
The battle lines have formed. The claim that the poverty rate among the elderly is low is grist for the mill for those arguing along the lines of Harry Holzer and Isabel Sawhill in a March 8 Washington Post op-ed headlined "Payments to elders are harming our future."
Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown, and Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, write:
Social Security and Medicare alone cost the federal government about $1.3 trillion last year, accounting for more than 37 percent of federal spending; they are slated, along with interest on the debt, to absorb virtually all currently projected federal revenue within the next several decades.
They go on to ask:
For how long will we continue to sacrifice investments in our nation's children and youth, as well as its future productivity, to spend more and more on the aged?
Arrayed against Sawhill and Holzer and others who share their views are numerous experts, including David Betson, a professor of public policy and economics at Notre Dame. Betson argued in a phone interview that "the game here is the elderly." Measures 
ignoring the family's cost of medical care not only understate the incidence of poverty for all groups but greatly understate the poverty rates of the demographic group that has the largest average out of pocket medical expenses, the elderly.
James Firman, president and C.E.O. of the National Council on Aging, told me that the official poverty measure is "grossly inadequate" because "it does not account for the 20 to 40 percent of total income that the elderly must pay out of pocket for health care, thus underestimating the poverty level among those 65 and older."
Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research, warned that many are convinced the elderly have it relatively easy because the official and most publicized poverty measure "does not take into account their high medical costs."
According to Munnell, credit card debt is rising faster among the elderly than other groups because of demands to pay growing medical fees and premiums just when higher and higher percentages of those reaching retirement age do not have defined benefit pension plans to provide support. Social Security, according to Munnell, which provides the average retired worker $15,168.36 a year, "plays a bigger and bigger role" as pensions diminish.
All three methods of measurement may undercount the poor. Kathryn Edin, a professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School, said in a phone interview and in a series of emails that a major problem with all three attempts to measure poverty 
is that the poverty level has no real empirical basis - it is not a good measure of how much it takes to survive nor is it a relative measure meant to reflect what is required for social inclusion in the society. The poverty level is most certainly too low. Most people can't actually live on incomes that hover around the poverty threshold.
An even sharper criticism of poverty measures, generally, comes from Shawn Fremstad of the C.E.P.R.:
There is broad recognition that the current poverty line ($21,756 for a family of four in 2009) falls far below the amount of income needed to "make ends meet" at a basic level. When established in the early 1960s, the poverty line was equal to nearly 50 percent of median income. Because it has only been adjusted for inflation since then, and not for increases in mainstream living standards, the poverty line has fallen to just under 30 percent of median income. As a result, to be counted as officially "poor," you have to be much poorer today, compared to a typical family, than you would have in the 1960s.
One of the most deeply informed analyses of this issue comes from Pat Ruggles, a senior fellow at the independent research group NORC at the University of Chicago. She shared her personal thoughts in an email to the Times:
Arguing that there is a moral case for spending less on the elderly and more on poor children, to my mind, has very little to do with poverty. Indeed, society may want to invest more in poor children because they will be around longer and will ultimately determine our future prosperity. Alternatively, some people feel that we owe a higher standard of living to the elderly because they supported us and gave us the foundation for our current prosperity. But neither of these arguments has anything to do with whether specific elderly or families with poor children need more or less.
The cost of caring for the elderly has risen substantially, Ruggles believes, 
because we can now treat many things that we couldn't treat 50 years ago when the poverty measure was first established. Elderly Americans live longer and have a better quality of life for more years than they would have two generations ago. In that sense they are clearly better off.
These new, and often expensive, medical treatments have become necessities of life for the elderly, according to Ruggles, and treating them otherwise will lead to a brutal, income-based rationing system:
Not taking these new necessities - for that is what they have become - into account in measuring and dealing with poverty among the elderly means making a decision that the improvements in technology and medicine that we have seen over the past decades should only be available to those who have sufficient incomes to cover their costs. This in effect says that low-income elderly who can't meet their co-pays should be allowed to suffer and to die early from things that are completely preventable.
Throughout the country, often with the active support of state governments, adults of all ages, but especially the elderly, are under mounting pressure to sign cost-saving advanced directives, allowing hospitals and doctors to end intensive procedures at various end-of-life stages. Three states now permit physician-assisted suicide. Another potentially controversial approach to cost control has been adopted by the 30 states that have"filial support" or "filial responsibility" laws on the books that make it the responsibility of adult children children to care for their indigent parents. 
Such statutes were rarely invoked in the past, but they establish grounds for shifting medical care in certain circumstances from the state to families, authorizing nursing homes and other long-term care providers to sue the families of patients unable to pay their bills. Indeed, there has been a spate of attention-grabbing stories about recent cases in which these laws have been reactivated.
In a seemingly unrelated development, the Wall Street Journal recently reported on surging adult hospital admissions to repair heart surgeries performed years earlier on infants born with congenital heart defects. What was arresting was that the article dealt with the phenomenon in large part as a matter of costs and as opportunities for doctors to make money. 
Jared O'Leary, a researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital, told the Journal that "In 2010, there were more than 100,000 hospital admissions of adults with congenital heart disease, incurring average charges per admission of $43,346, he said, or a total of more than $4 billion." The story also noted that "late last year, two professional groups approved a new medical subspecialty for adults with congenital heart disease, which is expected to increase the number of doctors who treat such patients."
In some ways, especially those who fall demographically on either side of the prime of life, every day seems to be more and more about the money, with competition accelerating among worthy claimants for access to limited resources. Virtual Mentor: The Journal of Ethics of the American Medical Association, reported a story on care in hospital neonatal units for premature babies: 
it is not unusual for costs to top $1 million for a prolonged stay. Expenditures to preserve life are limited in every society, and, although third-party payers have questioned this level of expenditures, courts have consistently reaffirmed the rights of parents to determine the treatment of their newborns.
In other words, both the beginning and the end of life are becoming increasingly subject to market decisions, cost-benefit analyses, and bottom line considerations that had not been so glaringly explicit in the past.

HEADLINE: Hidden Costs of the Minimum Wage

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The federal minimum wage should be lowered, not raised, so as not to compound the damage it causes, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
The current federal minimum wage of $7.55 an hour is increasingly creating economic damage that needs to be considered with the benefits it might offer the poor.
Democrats are now proposing to increase the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour. News organizations have repeatedly noted that economists do not agree on the employment effects of historical minimum-wage changes (the more recent federal changes in 2007, 2008 and 2009 have not yet been studied enough for us to agree or disagree on results specific to those episodes) and do not agree on whether minimum wage increases confer benefits on the poor. 
That doesn't mean that we economists disagree on every aspect of the minimum wage. We agree that minimum wages do some economic damage, although reasonable economists sometimes believe that the damage can be offset and even outweighed by benefits.
More important, we agree that the extent of that damage increases with the gap between the minimum wage and the market wage that would prevail without the minimum. A $10 minimum wage does less damage in an economy in which market wages would have been $9 than it would in an economy in which market wages would have been $2.

Moreover, elevating the wage $2 above the market does more than twice the damage of elevating the wage $1 above the market. (Employers can more easily adjust to the first dollar by asking employees to take more responsibility or taking steps to reduce turnover, steps that get progressively harder.) That's why economists who favor small minimum wage increases do not call for, say, a $100 minimum wage, because at that point the damage would far outweigh the benefits.
Market wages normally tend to increase over time with inflation and as workers become more productive. As long as the minimum wage is a fixed dollar amount, the tendency for market wages to increase over time means that economic damage from the minimum wage is shrinking. That's one reason that economists who see benefits of minimum wages would like to see minimum wages indexed to inflation, allowing the minimum wage to increase automatically as the economic damages fell.
But these are not normal times. The least-skilled workers are seeing their wages fall over time, largely because they are out of work and failing to acquire the skills that come with working. Moreover, the new health care regulations going into effect in January are expected to reduce cash wages, as many employers of low-skill workers are hit with per-employee fines of about $3,000 per employee per year, as the law mandates new fringe benefits for other employers and low-skill workers have to compete with others for the part-time jobs that are a popular loophole in the new legislation. (The minimum wage law restricts flexibility on cash wages, by establishing a floor, but makes no rule on fringe benefits.) 
To keep constant the damage from the federal minimum wage, the federal minimum wage needs not an increase but an automatic reduction over the next couple of years in order for it to stay in parallel with market wages.

HEADLINE: Portland, Ore., Approves Earned Sick Leave Policy

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: The City Council in Portland, Ore., has passed a law that will enable many employees there to earn up to five paid sick days a year. 

 BODY:
In Sheryl Sandberg's "Lean In," she declares the problem of women's advancement in the workplace to be a "classic chicken-and-egg problem." The chicken - her concern - is the impact of the choices women make that make career advancement harder. The egg is the impact of policies and society that push back, on women and all parents, as we work to both raise our families and financially support them. Without progress on both fronts, Ms. Sandberg argues, we'll never see workplace equality. 
I'm cheering on Portland, Ore., today as it directly addresses the egg. Portland's City Council voted in a unanimous decision to pass the Earned Sick Time policy, and became the fourth city in the country to adopt such a law.
Under the ordinance approved Wednesday, private employers in Portland will have to give employees up to 40 hours of sick leave each year. Employees will earn one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked. They will also need to work at least 240 hours a year to qualify.
The bill will enable more than 120,000 workers in Portland to earn up to five sick days a year, and will help them hang onto critical income, and their jobs, when they become ill. Can you imagine raising a family without any access to paid sick time, and with the constant threat of losing a job because of illness hanging over your head? Paid sick leave policies protect workers and families by helping provide stability, and a stable workforce benefits local economies as well.
Twenty years after the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, half the workforce still isn't covered, and depends on employers and local laws to provide the kinds of protections the F.M.L.A. affords. With federal expansion elusive (Representative Rosa DeLauro and Senator Tom Harkin plan to introduce the Healthy Families Act, which would set a national sick days standard, in mid-March), the momentum lies with cities and states.
New York City will hold a hearing on paid sick leave on March 22. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn has been holding up a vote on the question (a move that could cost her the support of Gloria Steinem for her mayoral campaign. ("Making life fairer for all women seems more important than breaking a barrier for one woman," Ms. Steinem said.) Besides Portland, only Connecticut and cities like San Francisco, Washington, Milwaukee, Seattleand Long Beach, Calif., have passed laws requiring paid sick leave for some employees. Philadelphia, Maryland and Massachusetts are considering similar legislation.
The original version of this post referred to Christine Quinn's gubernatorial campaign. Ms. Quinn is running for mayor of New York City, and conducting, therefore, a "mayoral" campaign.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: A Change Is Going to Come

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and around the Web, plus a look at the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
President Obama met with Senate Democrats on Tuesday about potential changes to entitlements, Mark Landler and Jennifer Steinhauer report. Even though the lengthy discussion remained civil, some senators voiced concerns about cuts to popular programs like Medicare and Social Security.
 

        
The Justice Department confirmed that its voting rights section has been torn over ideological splits between liberal and conservative factions dating to the Bush administration and continuing into the Obama era, Charlie Savage writes. The report recounts an array of "troubling" episodes and a distrustful culture.

        
It was a good day for President Obama's gun-safety agenda in Congress, with the Senate Judiciary Committee passing two measures designed to curb shooting violence. The approved bills - one aimed at expanding background checks to private gun sales and another that would renew a grant program that focuses on school safety - are now likely to go to the Senate floor for a full vote, Jennifer Steinhauer writes.

        
An appeals court ruled that Mr. Obama violated the Constitution when he made recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board last year, but the White House disagrees. The administration is now preparing to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, Charlie Savage reports.

        
No one is safe from Internet hacking - not the vice president of the United States of America, not even Beyonc. An investigation was started on Tuesday after a Web site originating in Russia posted the home addresses, Social Security numbers and other personal information of more than a dozen celebrities and politicians, Michael S. Schmidt and Nicole Perlroth report.

        
Though both sides have been reassuring the public that a bipartisan compromise on a budget deal is possible, Senate Democrats and House Republicans outlined vastly different approaches to coming up with a solution - a reminder of how far apart they remain on fiscal policy, Jeremy W. Peters and Jonathan Weisman report.

        
Annie Lowrey provides a news analysis about the debate over balancing the federal budget. While some economists agree that keeping a government's debt within reasonable limits is good and necessary, there is some disagreement over how important balancing the budget actually is.
 Around the Web 

        
Officials at the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs "were either unwilling or unable to say" who is leading the department, The Hill reports.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
President Obama will swing by Capitol Hill again Wednesday, this time to meet with the House Republican Conference. Later, he will meet with C.E.O.s in the White House to discuss cyber security and to get their input on how the government and private sector can work together to help eliminate threats to the nation's technological infrastructure.

        
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. will speak at an event in Rockville, Md., about the need to reduce homicides related to domestic violence.

        
Michelle Obama will deliver remarks to C.E.O.s of the Business Roundtable to promote her Joining Forces Initiative, which helps members of military families find jobs.

HEADLINE: Club for Growth Leads Conservative Charge, Sometimes at Republicans

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: As the Republican Party and the conservative movement continue to debate the lessons of 2012, the Club for Growth is looking to set up primary challenges to Republican incumbents who it believes have compromised on conservative principles. 

 BODY:
Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, would seem to be just the kind of promising politician his party needs at this stage: a telegenic, 35-year-old former Air Force pilot, close to members of the House leadership and an effective campaigner who won easily in both 2010 and 2012.
But to the Club for Growth, the conservative group intent on electing candidates who adhere strictly to a small-government, low-tax philosophy, Mr. Kinzinger falls short.
The group is featuring him on a new Web site intended to promote primary challenges next year to Republican incumbents who it believes have compromised on conservative principles. In Mr. Kinzinger's case, the group said, his failures include going along with the bipartisan agreement in 2011 to raise the federal debt ceiling and voting with Speaker John A. Boehner to ratify the deal at the beginning of this year to raise taxes on the wealthy but avert tax increases for the middle class. 
As the Republican Party and the conservative movement continue to debate the lessons of 2012 - a discussion that will get further attention this week at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington - the Club for Growth is playing the role of principle-driven counterweight to Karl Rove, whose political operation has been leading the charge favoring of a more pragmatic view of how Republicans can best regain power. 
It is a stance that has made the group and its president, Chris Chocola, beacons of conviction to economic conservatives who think the party's Congressional leadership has been too willing to make deals and back moderate candidates. But the Club for Growth's strategy has also exacerbated strains within the party and drawn criticism that ideological conformity is the wrong formula for a party seeking to broaden its appeal in the wake of successive losses in presidential campaigns.
"I have always been concerned with the Club for Growth's mission," said Rich Galen, a Republican commentator and former aide to Newt Gingrich and Dan Quayle. "As someone who came to Washington after Watergate when the House G.O.P. could meet in a phone booth, I have always felt it is too hard to elect our folks to put them at risk in primaries."
To be a broad-based majority party, Mr. Galen said, "you have to accept that the edges will get farther and farther apart and you have to accept that one edge will not agree on all items with the other edge - but they will agree more with that other edge than they would with Democrats."
To Mr. Chocola, that kind of attitude is exactly the problem.
"I can't go to the Capitol Hill Club anymore," he said, referring to the hangout for House Republicans. "But we have a $16 trillion debt because politicians worry about being popular rather than providing the leadership to do the hard things."
Mr. Chocola's argument is that the path to success for Republicans is to embrace sharp ideological differences with Democrats rather than sanding them down, even in states and districts that do not inherently lean conservative. As models, he points to Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Republicans who won their seats in 2010 in states that President Obama carried in both 2008 and 2012.
In an interview, Mr. Chocola dismissed the idea that Club for Growth and other conservative groups were responsible for losses in Senate races last year in Missouri and Indiana, where the Republican candidates, Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock, both collapsed after making statements about rape. His group had backed Mr. Mourdock but not Mr. Akin.
"Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin lost because they said stupid things," said Mr. Chocola, a former Republican member of the House.
"The real question is Heather Wilson, Tommy Thompson, George Allen, Denny Rehberg - why did they all lose?" Mr. Chocola said, referring to Republican candidates for Senate in 2012 in New Mexico, Wisconsin, Virginia and Montana. "If you have these kinds of establishment-backed Republican candidates who lost, in some cases in states where Romney won, that's a more interesting question and one that ought to be the focus of the party. I think the answer is that you just need candidates who are willing to articulate a clear, convincing, conservative economic message and aren't afraid of what Republicans are supposed to stand for."
Mr. Chocola said he did not see the Club for Growth being in a fight for the soul of the party with Mr. Rove's group. "But if they want to create a Republican primary establishment-versus-conservative battle, the conservative's going to win," he said.
It is not clear how aggressive the Club for Growth will be in fielding conservative challenges to Republican incumbents this year. Mr. Chocola said the group prefers to back candidates who have already decided to run rather than recruiting challengers to take on incumbents, and that it studies races carefully before jumping into primaries to ensure it is behind candidates who have a shot at winning.
"People ask about Lindsey Graham and Lamar Alexander and Mitch McConnell," he said, naming three incumbent Republican senators who are up for re-election in 2014 and are viewed as ideologically wobbly by some conservatives. "We're risk takers. But there are a lot of dynamics that have to be in place for us to engage in a race like that."
"We don't just do it because we like to make people miserable," he said. "We do it because we think there's a good chance of getting a champion of economic freedom in that seat."
The Club for Growth's supporters said the group helps the conservative cause even when it does not put its considerable financial clout behind a candidate, because the mere threat of a primary challenge keeps some Republicans from drifting into the political center. They said the group's advocacy of moving more aggressively to balance the budget in 10 years was one reason that Representative Paul D. Ryan offered a plan this year to do just that. Mr. McConnell, leery of the potential for a Tea Party-inspired primary challenge against him, has hired the campaign manager employed in 2010 by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Tea Party favorite.
For now, the Club for Growth is looking for smaller opportunities, chiefly among incumbent House members who are in safe Republican districts but have voting records that the group deems insufficiently conservative on the issues it cares most about - primarily, matters of taxes and spending.
In Mr. Kinzinger's case, Club for Growth gave him a 56 percent rating on its voting scorecard in a district that Mr. Romney carried with 53 percent of the vote - the kind of district that Democrats would need to put in play if they are to have a chance of winning back control of the House.
"We're not concerned with an out-of-touch D.C.-based PAC that, time after time, unsuccessfully attempts to force their Washington agenda on Illinois families and businesses," said Brook Hougesen, Mr. Kinzinger's spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: China Pollutes, the World Coughs

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The rapid degradation of the environment in China has become a central topic of discussion this year. Air pollution in Beijing and other parts of northern China hit record levels in January. Water pollution was thrust into the spotlight this week when official news reports said that nearly 6,000 dead pigs had been found floating in a river that slices through the heart of Shanghai. Meanwhile, environmental advocates are pressing the government to release data on soil pollution, which officials have categorized as a state secret.
It is no wonder, then, that delegates to the National People's Congress, which is holding its annual meeting now in Beijing, are debating environmental issues, even if the congress is largely a rubber-stamp legislature charged with giving Communist Party policy a veneer of popular legitimacy. 
Just as worrisome, if not as hotly discussed among Chinese, is the impact that China is having on the environment in other parts of the world. It is not an easy thing to gauge, but Craig Simons, a former Asia correspondent for Cox Newspapers, set out to do exactly that. He documented his findings in his first book, ''The Devouring Dragon: How China's Rise Threatens Our Natural World,'' which was published March 12 by St. Martin's Press. Mr. Simons spoke recently about his reasons for embarking on this project, how Chinese officials assess climate change and what the United States can do to mitigate China's environmental effects. These are excerpts from that conversation.
Q.
Why did you choose this particular topic on which to focus?
A.
I'd lived and worked in China for over a decade, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later as a journalist, and I'd seen the costs of its environmental crisis on the lives of average citizens. Then, in 2005, I took a job covering Asia and began to travel regionally. In Indonesia, I reported on how Chinese demands had intensified logging and talked with experts worried that orangutans might become extinct in the wild. In Korea, friends told me about huge dust storms that had blown in from China. In Tuvalu, a tiny, low-lying South Pacific nation, locals worried that the growth of China's greenhouse gas emissions could speed global warming, which looked likely to eventually inundate their country. As I continued to have such experiences, I began to think that China's greatest 21st-century impacts are likely to be to the physical planet. I wanted to understand both how China's rise had affected environments around the world and, given that much of China remains relatively poor, what its continued growth could mean for our shared climate and Earth's remaining wildlife and forests.
Q.
You've said that one of your goals is to put China's environmental impact outside its borders into a historical context. Can you tell us more about that context?
A.
The context is simply the tremendous physical changes to the planet humanity has caused since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. China only began to seek significant amounts of natural resources abroad over the last decade or so, and those demands are likely to grow dramatically before they plateau. But unlike for Europe or the United States, China's growth curve is rising at a time when the world's environments already are severely degraded. Since roughly the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, humanity has cleared more than one-quarter of Earth's forests, set off the world's sixth great era of extinctions -- with losses occurring between 100 and 1000 times faster than the natural baseline -- and pumped enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to warm the planet by more than one degree Fahrenheit. Fitting China into that larger narrative also helps us realize the global nature of today's environmental problems: it reminds us that we are all responsible.
Q.
What surprised you the most as you were doing your research?
A.
The most surprising thing was the reach of Chinese demands. As a nation with 1.3 billion people, 19 percent of humanity, and three-plus decades of annual economic growth averaging about 10 percent, it seemed there wasn't anywhere that China hadn't touched. One poignant example I found was a petition by Arkansas-based environmental groups to ban the collection of wild turtles because some species faced possible extinction due largely to Chinese demand for turtle meat. Even though data on U.S. turtle exports is spotty, they found that more than 256,000 wild-caught turtles were exported to Asia from the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas airport alone between 2002 and 2005. Another example is that air pollutants from China (as from other nations) are now reaching around the world. Dust, ozone, carbon monoxide and mercury polluted into the atmosphere in China are now regularly settling back to Earth in North America and other continents.
Q.
How aware do you think Chinese officials are of the impact that their policies have on the other parts of the world?
A.
While Chinese officials have become acutely aware of the impacts of China's development policies on its own environment, there is little public awareness of the effects of Chinese consumption on foreign nations. Despite that China is now considered the world's largest importer of illegally felled logs, few Chinese have thought about the problems caused by illegal logging. Likewise, few Chinese think about the impacts on wildlife of consuming traditional medicines and exotic species. I've seen animal parts, including tiger bone and rhino horn, for sale at Chinese markets and restaurants. Studies have also found a widespread desire to eat wildlife: according to a 2010 study by Traffic, the environmental NGO, for example, 44 percent of people interviewed in six Chinese cities had consumed wildlife in the previous year; most believed that eating many wild species should be a personal choice. With climate change there's more nuance, since the central government has made a very public push to improve energy efficiency and to increase the use of renewable energy sources. But experts believe that at the local level, most officials continue to focus on economic growth.
Q.
Within official circles, how do the Chinese now assess climate change, and does their assessment differ significantly from that of the United States?
A.
There is agreement among most top Chinese and American officials that climate change is a serious problem and needs to be addressed. However, there is significant divergence among experts on what China and other developing nations should do. China has generally maintained that, to be fair, any budget for future emissions should account for historical and per-capita emissions, which would give China a much larger share in the future. At recent U.N. meetings, Western nations have tried to push Beijing to accept binding limits to future emissions, but, as we saw during the contentious Copenhagen climate talks in 2009, Beijing has so far resisted accepting a quantitative cap.
Q.
Chinese officials often say that China has the right to grow its economy as it wants, and that the United States should not wag fingers over China's environmental impact since the U.S. spent many years growing its economy without thinking of the consequences. Even now, the carbon footprint per capita in the U.S. is still bigger than that of China. Do the Chinese have a valid point?
A.
Yes, that's a valid argument. Before the U.S. recession, China's average carbon footprint was between one-quarter and one-sixth of the average U.S. carbon footprint (depending on how one calculates it). More importantly, Chinese are much poorer than Americans. In 2011, China's average per-capita income was less than $4,000, one-eleventh of the U.S. average. In practice this means that people don't have many of the things Americans are used to -- private vehicles, heated and cooled homes, the opportunity to travel internationally -- and they're looking forward to those things. Another valid argument, however, is that every nation faces different challenges as they develop. Several experts I talked with pointed out that dealing with climate change, which might require slower economic growth, might be the burden China needs to bear.
Q.
You've said you didn't want to write a book that had only criticism. You've given some prescriptions on how China can lessen the environmental impact of its growth. What are some of the more helpful steps it can take?
A.
The most helpful step Beijing could take would be to adopt a cap on its greenhouse gas emissions or to impose a significant tax on carbon. Many experts now believe that the world will be able to rein in carbon emissions only if China and the United States, which together produce almost half of global anthropogenic emissions, commit to limits. Because China is relatively poor and it is still building much of its national infrastructure, such a commitment would be challenging.
Q.
What are some steps the United States can take in helping limit China's impact on the global environment?
A.
The more I reported, the more I saw that our environmental problems are shared. Because China is the world's manufacturing powerhouse, we all benefit from its cheap prices. But we also suffer from the pollution created by our increasing material affluence. China is a big part of that, but it's only the front edge of a larger wave of development that includes India, Brazil, Russia, and many other nations. The most important thing rich, developed nations can do is to realize that they need to become better role models by limiting their own global environmental impacts, including by controlling greenhouse gas emissions. After that, the West can do more to share the prosperity it has achieved. This could come partly through making environment-friendly technologies available at reasonable prices. It could also come through helping pay for the preservation of the world's remaining wild spaces, for example by providing income and opportunities to villagers in Papua New Guinea who choose to preserve their land or by helping train and equip wardens in wilderness areas like those I visited in northern India.
Q.
If China continues on its current path, what further effects will people living in other countries feel in the next decade?
A.
If the current trends continue, we can expect more of the world's remaining old-growth forests -- which today make up a small part of remaining forested areas--to be logged and more species to become threatened or extinct. Without a Chinese commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions, we could also anticipate that the global community would be unlikely to generate a serious effort to address global warming. China is thus one key (the United States is the other) to coming together to save what remains: its impacts are so large and are growing so quickly that without Beijing's participation, governments will have difficulty generating the political will to act.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fewer People Are Abandoning The Bronx, Census Data Show

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Danielle Jackson has lived all over New York City since she moved from New Jersey in 1998 to attend New York University. Last May, she moved from Flatbush to the South Bronx, where she co-founded a photography gallery a year earlier.
''My rent was being raised, I wanted a bigger apartment and the commute was killing me,'' she recalled. Ms. Jackson found a two-bedroom apartment in Mott Haven for $50 less a month than she would have paid for less space had she renewed her lease in Brooklyn. 
''I love where I live, I can get everywhere on the 6 train and I walk to work and for the first time I have real neighbors,'' she said. ''I know the Bronx has been maligned and completely misunderstood by outsiders, but what's kept the Bronx so great is that there is a community.''
Ms. Jackson, 32, personifies a remarkable demographic plateau revealed on Thursday by new census figures. For the first time in decades, people are no longer abandoning the Bronx.
Not only did the borough's population rise, but more people moved there in the year ended July 1, 2012, than left, according to the estimates. While the net gain in migration was only 115, it contrasts starkly with annual losses that were regularly in the thousands and neared 20,000 two decades ago.
''You've got to go back to the postwar period in the 1940s when we had a surge of people moving into the Bronx,'' said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the population division of the city's Planning Department.
Apartment buildings on the Grand Concourse have been refurbished; some South Bronx neighborhoods have boomed, luring a diverse influx of young professionals; and the foreign-born population -- mainly Dominicans moving from Upper Manhattan as well as Mexicans -- has grown. It is a far cry from the stock but now badly dated images of vast tracts of abandoned buildings or empty lots. ''It's pretty much the last frontier,'' said Ed Garcia Conde, a Bronx real estate consultant. ''It's the last affordable place. But I wouldn't say it's been gentrified to the point where people are being pushed out. Thousands of new apartments came on line.''
Overcrowding is another reason for the gains, said Gregory Lobo Jost, deputy director of the nonprofit University Neighborhood Housing Program. ''We have a lot of people who pay more than half their income in rent, so there's pressure to double up and make the rent affordable,'' he said. ''There are a lot of people coming from other parts of the city where they're being priced out.''
Over all, New York City's population was estimated by the census last July at 8,336,697, a surge of 161,564 since 2010 -- nearly as many as the city gained in the entire preceding decade.
The city's growth was achieved by another telling milestone: Since 2010, the number of people moving to the city has exceeded the number of New Yorkers leaving. The net increase from migration was 12,200.
''We haven't seen this since 1950,'' Dr. Salvo said. ''What we have now is a pattern that is really new.''
Professor Kenneth M. Johnson, senior demographer at the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire, said the city remained a migration magnet for ''20-somethings because they weren't tied down to houses'' while older New Yorkers had been ''frozen in place by the recession.''
Brooklyn was the fastest-growing borough, its population rising by 2.4 percent, or 60,900 people, and, with Manhattan and Queens, recorded a net gain from migration since 2010. After years of robust growth, Staten Island recorded what might have been its first population decline -- even if only a minuscule 219 residents.
The region drew 123,000 foreign immigrants since 2011, more than metropolitan Los Angeles and Miami combined, said William H. Frey, a Brookings Institution demographer.
Shannon Lee Gilstad, 29, a child welfare worker, lived in Manhattan and Queens before returning to the Bronx in 2008. She moved from the Grand Concourse to an $815-a-month studio in Bedford Park in 2010, which she can afford without roommates.
''You actually have the sense of a real neighborhood, with both a lot of immigrants and people who have lived here for quite a while,'' she said. ''It's the only place where I ever felt like home.''

HEADLINE: Group Leads a Charge For Conservative Ideals

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, would seem to be just the kind of promising politician his party needs at this stage: a telegenic, 35-year-old former Air Force pilot, close to members of the House leadership and an effective campaigner who won easily in both 2010 and 2012.
But to the Club for Growth, the conservative group intent on electing candidates who adhere strictly to a small-government, low-tax philosophy, Mr. Kinzinger falls short.
The group is featuring him on a new Web site intended to promote primary challenges next year to Republican incumbents who it believes have compromised on conservative principles. In Mr. Kinzinger's case, the group said, his failures include going along with the bipartisan agreement in 2011 to raise the federal debt ceiling and voting with Speaker John A. Boehner to ratify the deal at the beginning of this year to raise taxes on the wealthy but avert tax increases for the middle class. 
As the Republican Party and the conservative movement continue to debate the lessons of 2012 -- a discussion that will get further attention this week at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington -- the Club for Growth is playing the role of principle-driven counterweight to Karl Rove, whose political operation has been leading the charge favoring of a more pragmatic view of how Republicans can best regain power.
It is a stance that has made the group and its president, Chris Chocola, beacons of conviction to economic conservatives who think the party's Congressional leadership has been too willing to make deals and back moderate candidates. But the Club for Growth's strategy has also exacerbated strains within the party and drawn criticism that ideological conformity is the wrong formula for a party seeking to broaden its appeal in the wake of successive losses in presidential campaigns.
''I have always been concerned with the Club for Growth's mission,'' said Rich Galen, a Republican commentator and former aide to Newt Gingrich and Dan Quayle. ''As someone who came to Washington after Watergate when the House G.O.P. could meet in a phone booth, I have always felt it is too hard to elect our folks to put them at risk in primaries.''
To be a broad-based majority party, Mr. Galen said, ''you have to accept that the edges will get farther and farther apart and you have to accept that one edge will not agree on all items with the other edge -- but they will agree more with that other edge than they would with Democrats.''
To Mr. Chocola, that kind of attitude is exactly the problem.
''I can't go to the Capitol Hill Club anymore,'' he said, referring to the hangout for House Republicans. ''But we have a $16 trillion debt because politicians worry about being popular rather than providing the leadership to do the hard things.''
Mr. Chocola's argument is that the path to success for Republicans is to embrace sharp ideological differences with Democrats rather than sanding them down, even in states and districts that do not inherently lean conservative. As models, he points to Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Republicans who won their seats in 2010 in states that President Obama carried in both 2008 and 2012.
In an interview, Mr. Chocola dismissed the idea that Club for Growth and other conservative groups were responsible for losses in Senate races last year in Missouri and Indiana, where the Republican candidates, Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock, both collapsed after making statements about rape. His group had backed Mr. Mourdock but not Mr. Akin.
''Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin lost because they said stupid things,'' said Mr. Chocola, a former Republican member of the House.
''The real question is Heather Wilson, Tommy Thompson, George Allen, Denny Rehberg -- why did they all lose?'' Mr. Chocola said, referring to Republican candidates for Senate in 2012 in New Mexico, Wisconsin, Virginia and Montana. ''If you have these kinds of establishment-backed Republican candidates who lost, in some cases in states where Romney won, that's a more interesting question and one that ought to be the focus of the party. I think the answer is that you just need candidates who are willing to articulate a clear, convincing, conservative economic message and aren't afraid of what Republicans are supposed to stand for.''
Mr. Chocola said he did not see the Club for Growth being in a fight for the soul of the party with Mr. Rove's group. ''But if they want to create a Republican primary establishment-versus-conservative battle, the conservative's going to win,'' he said.
It is not clear how aggressive the Club for Growth will be in fielding conservative challenges to Republican incumbents this year. Mr. Chocola said the group prefers to back candidates who have already decided to run rather than recruiting challengers to take on incumbents, and that it studies races carefully before jumping into primaries to ensure it is behind candidates who have a shot at winning.
''People ask about Lindsey Graham and Lamar Alexander and Mitch McConnell,'' he said, naming three incumbent Republican senators who are up for re-election in 2014 and are viewed as ideologically wobbly by some conservatives. ''We're risk takers. But there are a lot of dynamics that have to be in place for us to engage in a race like that.''
''We don't just do it because we like to make people miserable,'' he said. ''We do it because we think there's a good chance of getting a champion of economic freedom in that seat.''
The Club for Growth's supporters said the group helps the conservative cause even when it does not put its considerable financial clout behind a candidate, because the mere threat of a primary challenge keeps some Republicans from drifting into the political center. They said the group's advocacy of moving more aggressively to balance the budget in 10 years was one reason that Representative Paul D. Ryan offered a plan this year to do just that. Mr. McConnell, leery of the potential for a Tea Party-inspired primary challenge against him, has hired the campaign manager employed in 2010 by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Tea Party favorite.
For now, the Club for Growth is looking for smaller opportunities, chiefly among incumbent House members who are in safe Republican districts but have voting records that the group deems insufficiently conservative on the issues it cares most about -- primarily, matters of taxes and spending.
In Mr. Kinzinger's case, Club for Growth gave him a 56 percent rating on its voting scorecard in a district that Mr. Romney carried with 53 percent of the vote -- the kind of district that Democrats would need to put in play if they are to have a chance of winning back control of the House.
''We're not concerned with an out-of-touch D.C.-based PAC that, time after time, unsuccessfully attempts to force their Washington agenda on Illinois families and businesses,'' said Brook Hougesen, Mr. Kinzinger's spokeswoman.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Last Pope And Next Budget

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
As long as we're fixating on the new pope, we should talk about St. Malachy.
Malachy was a bishop in Ireland who allegedly had a vision in 1139 in which he saw a procession of 112 future pontiffs, each of whom he described with a single, frequently oblique, phrase. The recently retired Benedict XVI, for instance, got ''the glory of the olive.'' Who knew? Then, after the olive, came the final pope, ''Peter the Roman,'' whose flock would suffer ''many tribulations'' not the least of which was the end of the world.
So, in theory, we're down to our last pope. True, he's Jorge the Argentinian, not Peter the Roman. But we can figure out a way to make the prediction work. (St. Peter was known as The Rock, and Buenos Aires probably has a lot of rocks.) True, the Malachy list seems to be a 16th-century forgery, whose remarkable spot-on accuracy comes to a screeching halt in 1590. But the point is that we have not had a serious doomsday discussion since that Mayan calendar thing last December, and I miss it. The nice thing about apocalyptic panics is that all you need for a feel-good moment is the earth not coming to an end. 
Also, it behooves us to keep talking about the papal election for as long as possible. Once it's over, we're back to the federal budget deliberations, and I prefer a story in which nothing gets sequestered but the cardinals.
Or, ideally, we could go for a merger:
**********
WASHINGTON -- White smoke poured from the Capitol today and crowds of onlookers broke into shouts of jubilation, crying: ''We have a budget!''
Inside, where the nation's legislators had been walled off in seclusion, the newly chosen tax-and-spending plan was garbed in the traditional brass staples for its first public appearance. Insiders said it planned to take the name of Budget for Fiscal Year 2014.
Some of the faithful feared this day would never come, citing the ancient prediction of The Last Budget. Legend has it that during his pneumonia-racked, monthlong presidency, William Henry Harrison fell into a trance and produced a list of 61 speakers of the House from the founding of the republic until the collapse of the Constitution, describing each with a characteristic word or phrase. Some were remarkably apt. Future Vice President John Nance Garner, for instance, was ''warm spit,'' and Republican Dennis Hastert was ''large gray-haired person.'' However, the slot for Speaker Nancy Pelosi was listed, inexplicably, as ''repair the microwave.''
The list predicts that after Pelosi comes a final speaker (''weepy kumquat'') who presides over an era in which Congress loses all remaining capacity to direct the nation's economic affairs beyond sporadically agreeing, via text, to have the nation's bureaucracy just keep doing whatever it was doing before.
Fearing the worst, a band of public-spirited citizens disguised as a touring scout troop stormed the Capitol, locked in the members of the House and Senate, and cut off their connections to the outside world. Deprived of their ability to Twitter, the lawmakers quickly came to an agreement.
**********
O.K., this tactic would probably not produce the most progressive document in the history of the world. The cardinals probably did not come up with the most progressive pope in the history of the world. If St. Peter were still around today, I don't believe he'd be referring to gay marriage as a machination ''of the Father of Lies.'' But there are moments when you feel that we should just get on with it.
How would you get the locked-in legislators to find a path to agreement? First, Paul Ryan would have to announce that somebody misplaced the real Republican budget proposal and that the thing he introduced this week was an old copy of his vice presidential campaign platform that he grabbed hold of on the way out the door. ''Obviously, we found out in November that people really hated those ideas,'' he could say. ''We've got something way different, but you're just going to have to wait until the staff finishes going through the Dumpsters.''
Then President Obama would promise all the Democratic senators who are up for re-election that he would go to their states and tell their voters that everything unpopular in the agreement was his fault. If necessary, the president would be prepared to say that he cried. However, if possible he would prefer to say that he won their votes in a poker game.
Then everybody would work out a reasonable compromise that includes new revenues. Then Rand Paul would ascend into heaven via the Capitol dome. All of this has been predicted by a little-known saint in the 19th century. I have a copy.

HEADLINE: Strong Retail Sales Bolster Outlook, Blunting an Expected Tax Increase Effect

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans spent at the fastest pace in five months in February, pushing up retail sales by 1.1 percent from January. About half the increase reflected higher gasoline prices, but even excluding fuel purchases, retail sales rose 0.6 percent. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed that Americans kept spending last month despite higher Social Security taxes that took effect this year.
Core retail sales, which exclude the volatile categories of purchases of gasoline, autos and building supplies, rose 0.4 percent in February compared with January.
Economists were encouraged by the stronger-than-expected gain in retail sales. Some said the increase means the economy may be growing faster in the January-March quarter than they had forecast.
''This all suggests that the hit to spending from the payroll tax cut and higher gasoline prices, which reduce the amount of cash available to spend on other items, hasn't been too bad,'' said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. ''The recent pickup in both employment and earnings growth bodes well for consumption growth later in the year, too.''
Auto sales rose 1.1 percent after a 0.4 percent January increase. The February gain was the biggest since December. Sales at gas stations surged 5 percent, the biggest advance since a 6 percent rise in August.
Sales at general merchandise stores, a category that includes major department stores such as Macy's and big discount stores such as Walmart and Target, rose 0.5 percent in February. But the department store category as a whole fell 1 percent.
The solid increase in retail sales showed that Americans kept spending despite a payroll tax increase that has lowered take-home pay this year for most workers. A person earning $50,000 has about $1,000 less to spend in 2013. A household with two high-paid workers has up to $4,500 less.
The economy grew at a rate of only 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, but many analysts believe the American economy will grow a modest 2 percent this year.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said businesses increased their inventories by 1 percent in January from December, an encouraging signal that they expect consumers will spend more this year. That increase is up from 0.3 percent growth in December and the biggest gain since May 2011.
Total business sales fell 0.3 percent in January after a slight 0.1 percent rise in December.
Retail inventories increased 1.5 percent. Wholesale inventories grew 1.2 percent, the biggest gain in 13 months. Inventories held by manufacturers rose 0.5 percent.
Finally, the Labor Department reported Wednesday that import prices rose 1.1 percent in February after a 0.6 percent gain the previous month. Fuel imports jumped 4.9 percent. Excluding fuel, import prices were flat.
Low import costs have helped hold down inflation in the United States. Even with the last two months of increases in oil costs, import prices have fallen 0.3 percent in the 12 months ending in February.
Export prices rose 0.8 percent in February from January, pushed up by higher prices for agricultural goods. In the past year, export prices have increased 1.5 percent, led by a 13.4 percent jump in farm goods.

HEADLINE: The Facts on Fracking

BYLINE: By SUSAN L. BRANTLEY and ANNA MEYENDORFF

 BODY:
OPPOSITION to fracking has been considerable, if not unanimous, in the global green community, and in Europe in particular. France and Bulgaria, countries with the largest shale-gas reserves in Europe, have already banned fracking. Protesters are blocking potential drilling sites in Poland and England. Opposition to fracking has entered popular culture with the release of ''The Promised Land,'' starring Matt Damon. Even the Rolling Stones have weighed in with a reference to fracking in their new single, ''Doom and Gloom.''
Do the facts on fracking support this opposition?
There is no doubt that natural gas extraction does sometimes have negative consequences for the local environment in which it takes place, as does all fossil fuel extraction. And because fracking allows us to put a previously inaccessible reservoir of carbon from beneath our feet into the atmosphere, it also contributes to global climate change. 
But as we assess the pros and cons, decisions should be based on existing empirical evidence and fracking should be evaluated relative to other available energy sources.
What exactly is fracking, or more formally hydraulic fracturing?
Many sandstones, limestones and shales far below ground contain natural gas, which was formed as dead organisms in the rock decomposed. This gas is released, and can be captured at the surface for our use, when the rocks in which it is trapped are drilled. To increase the flow of released gas, the rocks can be broken apart, or fractured. Early drillers sometimes detonated small explosions in the wells to increase flow. Starting in the 1940s, oil and gas drilling companies began fracking rock by pumping pressurized water into it.
Approximately one million American wells have been fracked since the 1940s. Most of these are vertical wells that tap into porous sandstone or limestone. Since the 1990s, however, gas companies have been able to harvest the gas still stuck in the original shale source. Fracking shale is accomplished by drilling horizontal wells that extend from their vertical well shafts along thin, horizontal shale layers.
This horizontal drilling has enabled engineers to inject millions of gallons of high-pressure water directly into layers of shale to create the fractures that release the gas. Chemicals added to the water dissolve minerals, kill bacteria that might plug up the well, and insert sand to prop open the fractures.
Most opponents of fracking focus on potential local environmental consequences. Some of these are specific to the new fracking technology, while others apply more generally to natural gas extraction.
The fracking cocktail includes acids, detergents and poisons that are not regulated by federal laws but can be problematic if they seep into drinking water. Fracking since the 1990s has used greater volumes of cocktail-laden water, injected at higher pressures. Methane gas can escape into the environment out of any gas well, creating the real though remote possibility of dangerous explosions. Water from all gas wells often returns to the surface containing extremely low but measurable concentrations of radioactive elements and huge concentrations of salt. This brine can be detrimental if not disposed of properly. Injection of brine into deep wells for disposal has in rare cases triggered small earthquakes.
In addition to these local effects, natural gas extraction has global environmental consequences, because the methane gas that is accessed through extraction and the carbon dioxide released during methane burning are both greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change. New fracking technologies allow for the extraction of more gas, thus contributing more to climate change than previous natural gas extraction.
As politicians in Europe and the United States consider whether, and under what conditions, fracking should be allowed, the experience of Pennsylvania is instructive. Pennsylvania has seen rapid development of the Marcellus shale, a geological formation that could contain nearly 500 trillion cubic feet of gas -- enough to power all American homes for 50 years at recent rates of residential use.
Some of the local effects of drilling and fracking have gotten a lot of press but caused few problems, while others are more serious. For example, of the tens of thousands of deep injection wells in use by the energy industry across the United States, only about eight locations have experienced injection-induced earthquakes, most too weak to feel and none causing significant damage.
The Pennsylvania experience with water contamination is also instructive. In Pennsylvania, shale gas is accessed at depths of thousands of feet while drinking water is extracted from depths of only hundreds of feet. Nowhere in the state have fracking compounds injected at depth been shown to contaminate drinking water.
In one study of 200 private water wells in the fracking regions of Pennsylvania, water quality was the same before and soon after drilling in all wells except one. The only surprise from that study was that many of the wells failed drinking water regulations before drilling started. But trucking and storage accidents have spilled fracking fluids and brines, leading to contamination of water and soils that had to be cleaned up. The fact that gas companies do not always disclose the composition of all fracking and drilling compounds makes it difficult to monitor for injected chemicals in streams and groundwater.
Pennsylvania has also seen instances of methane leaking into aquifers in regions where shale-gas drilling is ongoing. Some of this gas is ''drift gas'' that forms naturally in deposits left behind by the last glaciation. But sometimes methane leaks out of gas wells because, in 1 to 2 percent of the wells, casings are not structurally sound. The casings can be fixed to address these minor leaks, and the risk of such methane leaks could further decrease if casings were designed specifically for each geological location.
The disposal of shale gas brine was initially addressed in Pennsylvania by allowing the industry to use municipal water treatment plants that were not equipped to handle the unhealthy components. Since new regulations in 2011, however, Pennsylvania companies now recycle 90 percent of this briny water by using it to frack more shale.
In sum, the experience of fracking in Pennsylvania has led to industry practices that mitigate the effect of drilling and fracking on the local environment.
And while the natural gas produced by fracking does add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere through leakage during gas extraction and carbon dioxide release during burning, it in fact holds a significant environmental advantage over coal mining. Shale gas emits half the carbon dioxide per unit of energy as does coal, and coal burning also emits metals such as mercury into the atmosphere that eventually settle back into our soils and waters.
Europe is currently increasing its reliance on coal while discouraging or banning fracking. If we are going to get our energy from hydrocarbons, blocking fracking while relying on coal looks like a bad trade-off for the environment.
So, should the United States and Europe encourage fracking or ban it? Short-run economic interests support fracking. In the experience of Pennsylvania, natural gas prices fall and jobs are created both directly in the gas industry and indirectly as regional and national economies benefit from lower energy costs. Europe can benefit from lessons learned in Pennsylvania, minimizing damage to the local environment.
The geopolitical shift that would result from decreasing reliance on oil, and more specifically on Russian oil and gas, is one that European politicians might not want to ignore. And if natural gas displaces coal, then fracking is good not only for the economy but also for the global environment.
But if fracked gas merely displaces efforts to develop cleaner, non-carbon, energy sources without decreasing reliance on coal, the doom and gloom of more rapid global climate change will be realized.

HEADLINE: U.S. Citizens Join Illegal Immigrants In Pressing Lawmakers for Change

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On her trip to Washington to push for an overhaul of immigration laws, Cindy Garcia on Wednesday went straight to the office of Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, to tell him about how the looming deportation of her husband had affected her family.
Ms. Garcia, 40, is an autoworker from Detroit and an American citizen. She said she and her husband, a Mexican who has been living in the United States illegally for decades, since he was 10, had spent more than $50,000 over eight years on lawyers' fees trying to fix his immigration status, to no avail. 
Speaking emotionally in the senator's office during a brief protest, Ms. Garcia said her two children, also American citizens, live on edge, fearing they could be separated from their father at any time. She and other advocates chose to focus on Mr. Rubio because he has been a leader in talks among a bipartisan group of senators who are working to craft immigration legislation.
As the debate gathers steam here over how to fix the immigration system, Ms. Garcia is one of the new faces on the side of those favoring comprehensive legislation that would include a quick and direct path to citizenship for 11 million people living in the country illegally.
In 2007, when Congress last tried -- and failed -- to pass a similarly broad overhaul, much of the action by groups that supported that effort came during pitched battles over policy positions, fought largely behind closed doors. The populist momentum came from Americans who angrily opposed that proposal, which they said would give a break to immigrants they saw as lawbreakers.
This year, the forces favoring comprehensive legislation are showing new levels of confidence and organization, and, in a change from six years ago, illegal immigrants and their American citizen family members, like Ms. Garcia, are stepping forward to speak for themselves.
''My husband has earned a path to citizenship,'' she said on Wednesday. ''They need to stop living in the shadows, and they should have the right to vote so they can vote on issues that affect our families.''
Immigrant groups, having learned from the bruising they took in 2007, and in immigration fights since then in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia and other states, this time are staying clear of the policy weeds in Washington, instead working their way toward this city from the outside. Ms. Garcia arrived in Washington after participating in a bus tour organized by immigrant rights groups in Michigan. The bus convoy, conceived with the freedom riders of the civil rights era in mind, went through Wisconsin and ended in Ohio with a small rally at Andy's Cafe, the tavern near Cincinnati that was once run by the father of Representative John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House.
Organizers for the Fair Immigration Reform Movement, the coalition that organized the tours, said similar bus rides, many of them carrying immigrants who were revealing their illegal status for the first time, had taken place since mid-February in 19 states, including California, Colorado, Florida and Texas.
In each state, bus riders visited the offices of federal lawmakers, focusing on possible swing voters in the House, delivering letters that pressed them for legislation that would provide an unobstructed path to citizenship, which would also help to unify families facing separation by deportation.
The advocates are calling on the senators who are writing legislation -- including Mr. Rubio; Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans; and Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York -- to present a bill by next Thursday. The senators have said that they hope to unveil legislation by the end of the month.
Cristina McNeil, a Mexican-born American citizen from Boise, Idaho, who came this week to Washington, said she and other advocates had met in her home state with Representative Ral R. Labrador, a Republican who has expressed skepticism about a direct path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, but who favors programs allowing immigrants to work legally.
Ms. McNeil, who owns her own business, said she had pressed Mr. Labrador with an economic argument on behalf of legal and illegal immigrants. ''We have been stopped from being able to grow in so many different paths because of the reason so many don't have residency or citizenship,'' Ms. McNeil said
About 200 activists who participated in the bus tours showed up at a hearing Wednesday on Capitol Hill where family members, including many American citizens, described the toll of deportation on their families.
''We've spent the last five years building a lot of strength in the field,'' said Ryan Bates, director of the Alliance for Immigrants Rights and Reform, a Michigan group. ''We have political infrastructure now that is light-years beyond what we had during the last opportunity to pass reform,'' he said.
In a sign of the shift in immigration politics, primarily because of the strong Latino vote for Democrats in the elections last November, the groups opposing any legalization for illegal immigrants have so far been more muted than they were in 2007. But they may be keeping their powder dry for the fight after legislation is formally introduced.
Some groups seeking comprehensive legislation are using political advertising to try to build support for lawmakers, particularly Republicans, who are taking large risks by backing a path to citizenship. A coalition of evangelical Christians groups announced it would run a one-minute ad for two weeks starting on Wednesday ''at saturation levels'' on 15 Christian radio stations in South Carolina.
While the ad does not mention Mr. Graham by name, it says, in the voice of the Rev. Jim Goodroe of the Spartanburg County Baptist Network, ''Our South Carolina-elected officials need your prayers and to hear your voice.''
In the intense activity supporting reform this week, young immigrants who call themselves Dreamers -- after legislation known as the Dream Act, which would give them a special path to citizenship -- said they were starting a nationwide program of events where they would ''come out'' to declare their illegal immigration status with their parents and other family members.
''As an organizer, for years you keep hitting your head against the wall,'' Joshua Hoyt, chief strategist of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said Wednesday. ''Then you get to a tipping point, and all of a sudden the dam breaks open and things start happening very quickly.
''That,'' Mr. Hoyt said, ''is what is happening right now.''

HEADLINE: Domestic Politics, Pyongyang-Style

BYLINE: By SHEILA MIYOSHI JAGER. 
Sheila Miyoshi Jager, an associate professor of East Asian studies at Oberlin College, is the author of the forthcoming book ''Brothers at War: The Unending Conflict in Korea.''

 BODY:
OBERLIN, Ohio
ON Monday, North Korea declared that it had nullified the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, a new level of bellicosity that raised, at least on paper, the potential for the resumption of armed conflict on the peninsula.
The fiery rhetoric seemed to foreign observers a desperate attempt to force the United States and South Korea to restart stalled talks on denuclearization, in the hope of extracting aid and concessions. But recent history suggests that it was motivated less by international politics than by domestic concerns: North Korea's new hereditary leader, Kim Jong-un, may have been stoking fears of a foreign threat primarily to dampen political unrest at home. 
The belligerent talk, and the nuclear test North Korea conducted last month, its third, are part of a pattern that began in the 1990s when the North Korean economy collapsed following the end of the cold war.
Faced with chronic famine and international isolation, North Koreans have become acutely worried about their increasing dependence on China.
The Beijing government's diplomatic and financial support has been essential to North Korea for decades, of course. But China's influence in the country began to take on a new dimension in 2002, when it started an ambitious Northeast Asia Project. Ostensibly aimed at better integrating its three northeastern provinces -- Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning -- with the rest of the country, it quickly became clear that the project also aimed to rewrite Korean history.
At issue was the history of Koguryo (Gaogouli in Chinese), one of the three ancient kingdoms of Korea (along with Paekche and Silla) in the third through seventh centuries. Chinese scholars claimed that, because part of the former territory of Koguryo now resides within China's borders, its history ought to be considered Chinese, not Korean.
The political ramifications of this seemingly abstruse dispute have been far-reaching. South Korea charged that the Chinese government, by claiming Koguryo as part of its ancient past, was trying to undermine the legitimacy and political authority of North Korea.
The timing of China's apparently sudden interest in Koguryo's history is notable. It began in earnest in 2009, when the Chinese government announced an ambitious economic development program for North Korea. This project, covering the Chinese cities of Changchun, Jilin and Tumen, involved a vast area landlocked by Russia. North Korea agreed to lease the seaport at Rajin, a gateway to the Pacific, as well as sign on to various economic development projects.
By 2011, total Chinese investment in North Korea exceeded $6 billion. China, in fact, now provides an estimated 90 percent of North Korea's energy, 80 percent of its consumer goods, and 45 percent of the country's food.
As North Korea moves ever closer to becoming the ''fourth province'' of northeastern China, a pressing question Mr. Kim faces is how to sell this to his people, especially the elite. While many in the West assume that public opinion simply doesn't matter in North Korea's totalitarian state, the dictatorship could not have carried on as long as it has -- nearly 70 years -- without public support, continually manipulated though it is.
In the past, this support derived from the belief by North Koreans that the North -- unlike the South, which is considered a ''lackey'' of the United States -- was the only legitimate Korea because it abided by a core nationalist ideology of chuch'e, or self-determination.
That public conviction in North Korea's self-reliance has become increasingly tenuous as the country's poverty has deepened -- and as the propaganda the North Korean masses (and even the ranks of the elite) hear becomes all the more distant from the reality of their lives. And that is what has the Pyongyang regime scared.
As Mr. Kim, who came to power at the end of 2011, tries to consolidate his authority, he has the added challenge of convincing North Koreans that the chuch'e principle stands firm even against the ''friendly'' encroachments of China.
China appears to understand Pyongyang's dilemma, which is why it has continued its ambitious efforts to develop North Korea while shielding the new regime from internal collapse.
Stability on the Korean Peninsula is critical to China's own security, too. North Korea provides China with a buffer between it and the roughly 29,000 American troops stationed in South Korea. While Beijing's patience with North Korea was sorely tested after the nuclear test last month, and China has nominally agreed to economic sanctions, it has too much at stake in Mr. Kim's government to halt or withdraw its support entirely.
South Korea remains deeply suspicious of China, but having cut off all aid to North Korea after it sank a South Korean vessel in 2010, the government in Seoul surrendered any economic leverage over the North it might have had. Although it remains to be seen what policy South Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, will take toward the North, few South Koreans harbor any illusions about the dire state of the North's economy or the tremendous costs unification would entail.
In the 1990s, more than 80 percent of South Koreans believed that unification was essential; by 2011, that number had dropped to 56 percent. Today, just one in five South Korean teenagers believe unification is imperative -- a fraction of those who believed this in their parents' and grandparents' generations.
North Korea's apocalyptic threats may only make South Koreans -- and their American allies -- even more doubtful that a peaceful end to this long conflict is near. But it would be a mistake to read into them anything more than the noises of a dying regime that clearly recognizes the writing on the wall.

HEADLINE: Market Edges Up, Lifting Dow to 9th Consecutive Gain

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market rose slightly Wednesday, but enough to lift the Dow Jones industrial average to its ninth consecutive gain, its longest winning streak in more than 16 years.
The Dow edged up 5.22 points, to 14,455.28, for another nominal record close since March 5, when it surpassed its previous high, set in 2007. The Dow is up 10.3 percent this year.
The Dow's last nine-day winning streak occurred in May 1996. The following November, in the early days of the technology boom, it gained for 10 days straight. 
This year, demand for stocks has been propelled by optimism that the housing market is recovering and that companies have started to hire. Strong company earnings and continuing stimulus from the Federal Reserve also are making stocks more attractive.
Stocks overcame an early loss on Wednesday, having edged lower at the start of trading despite an unexpectedly strong increase in consumer spending last month.
Americans spent at the fastest pace in five months in February, increasing retail spending 1.1 percent compared with January, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. Economists had forecast a gain of 0.2 percent, according to FactSet.
The failure of the market to pick up directly after the report suggests that the bar has risen for investors as stocks have rallied.
''As the market rises, so do expectations,'' said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. ''So, even if you get good numbers, you don't necessarily get the market to go up.''
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.04 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,554.52. The S.& P. 500 has gained 9 percent this year and is less than 11 points from its record close of 1,565.15 in October 2007.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.80 points, or 0.1 percent, to 3,245.12. It remains well below its record close of more than 5,000, reached at the height of the dot-com boom in 2000.
Stocks of retailers rose after the retail sales report. Kohl's jumped $1.49, or 3.2 percent, to $48.82 and Best Buy gained 67 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $20.96.
Brian Gendreau, a strategist at the Cetera Financial Group, said that even if markets dipped in coming weeks, the trend of rising company earningswas likely to push stocks higher in the longer term. Companies have reported 7.7 percent earnings growth for the fourth quarter, the third straight quarter of gains, S.& P. Capital IQ said.
''Earnings growth has been quite strong. Corporations have found a way to make money,'' Mr. Gendreau said. ''New products, new markets, cost savings. I don't believe that is going to stop any time soon.''
Among the stocks on the move, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals plunged $4.64, or 37 percent, to $7.79 after it said sales of its drug Fusilev could fall by more than half this year.
Netflix rose $10.25, or 5.6 percent, to $192.36 after it said that it was adding a feature that would allow subscribers in the United States to automatically swap movie and television show recommendations with their friends on Facebook.
Dole dropped $1.06, or 9 percent, to $10.67 after its fourth-quarter results fell short of analysts' expectations. Dole cited lower banana prices in North America.
The clothing retailer Express fell 60 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $18.25 after its earnings report disappointed investors. Michael Weiss, the company's chief and chairman, told analysts that customer traffic was ''down noticeably'' from last year.
In the bond market, interest rates showed little change. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note slipped 1/32, to 99 26/32, leaving its yield unchanged at 2.02 percent.

HEADLINE: Deal for Sony Building Draws Attention to Its Buyer

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
For nearly 20 years, Joe Chetrit has sought to remain far outside the spotlight as he has bought and sold billions of dollars in property in New York City.
But some of the mystery surrounding Mr. Chetrit may come to an end with the closing on Friday of his biggest deal: the $1.1 billion purchase of the Sony Building, the 53-story tower on Madison Avenue with the distinctive curved top and pink granite walls.
His plan to convert the skyscraper, which has served as headquarters for AT&T and Sony, into a mix of luxury condominiums, a hotel and high-end retail shops is already drawing scrutiny from city officials, neighborhood residents, architects and other developers. 
Mr. Chetrit, a stout, blunt-talking man with a mustache and an old felony conviction, guards his privacy fiercely.
He first attracted significant attention when he led a consortium of investors that bought the Sears Tower, now called the Willis Tower, in Chicago, for $840 million.
His financial partners on his deals are largely unknown. Few people, friends or enemies, are willing to speak publicly about him.
''He has a nose for finding deals and an ability to make people comfortable with his ability to close a transaction quickly,'' said Ivan Kaufman, chief executive of Arbor Realty Trust, who has been both an investor in and a lender to Mr. Chetrit's projects. ''He is somewhat secretive, so it's hard to know all that he's involved in.''
Mr. Chetrit won the January auction for the Sony building in characteristic fashion, outmaneuvering 20 or so bidders.
Although at least two others offered a billion dollars or more, Mr. Chetrit clinched the deal with a $100 million down payment and a letter of credit worth nearly $600 million from a sovereign Middle Eastern investment fund, according to executives briefed on the negotiations.
He then asked a rival bidder, SL Green Realty, to arrange $925 million in financing for the transaction so he could close the deal on Friday, the executives said. The Bank of China is expected to provide a $600 million mortgage.
But many in the real estate industry say that the deal is fraught with risk. Sony will remain in the building for three years. Experts say it will then take up to two years and $500 million to completely renovate the building. Interest rates can soar and the market for expensive condos can dry up before the building reopens in 2019.
In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Chetrit declined to answer questions. ''It's a beautiful, iconic building,'' he said. ''We're going to keep it that way.''
Mr. Chetrit, 55, comes from an Orthodox Jewish family with roots in eastern Morocco, where his relatives were active in the import-export business. He arrived in the United States in the late 1980s and worked in the garment industry.
In 1990, he pleaded guilty to violating customs laws by illegally importing more than 1.5 million square yards of fabric into the United States from South Korea. He had the fabric shipped through France in an attempt to disguise its origin, according to court records.
Mr. Chetrit was sentenced to three years of probation and 250 hours of community service and was fined $10,000. His lawyer at the sentencing hearing said Mr. Chetrit had lost his business as a result of the charges. After his conviction, Mr. Chetrit plunged into real estate, gradually moving from smaller to larger buildings.
Mr. Chetrit buys and sells for profit, rather than with the goal of amassing a real estate empire.
Real estate brokers often say they love Mr. Chetrit because he is not hesitant about writing big checks, even as other developers scratch their heads over the prices he pays and wonder how he raises so much cash for his deals. His investors have made a fortune with him, real estate executives say, but partners have not always fared so well. More than one joint venture has ended in lawsuits and recriminations.
Unlike many prominent landlords, Mr. Chetrit is also more than willing to tangle with corporate or residential tenants who do not fit with his plans for his properties, which include the International Toy Building, Park West Village or the Chelsea Hotel.
Dozens of longtime residents at the Chelsea, the legendary hotel on West 23rd Street, have complained that renovations have often left them without heat and hot water, forcing them to endure dust, mold and toxic conditions. A lawyer for the tenants say they plan to go back to court charging that Mr. Chetrit violated a court order to improve conditions. ''They want the tenants out,'' said the lawyer, Janet Ray Kalson, referring to Mr. Chetrit.
Mr. Chetrit's partner in the Sony deal, David Bistricer, a real estate investor from Brooklyn, has also had trouble with the law. In 1998, the New York attorney general obtained a court order barring him for life from converting rental buildings in New York to condominiums or co-ops because he had committed financial improprieties. The lifetime ban was later partially lifted, according to state records.
But in 2007, the federal housing secretary ruled Mr. Bistricer was an unsuitable landlord and rejected his $1.3 billion bid for the country's largest federally subsidized housing complex, Starrett City in Brooklyn. Since then, Mr. Bistricer has been on the city public advocate's list of the worst city landlords in 2010 and 2011.

HEADLINE: Power to the People

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Across the country, cities are showing a renewed interest in taking over the electricity business from private utilities, reflecting intensifying concerns about climate change, responses to power disruptions and a desire to pump more renewable energy into the grid.
Boulder, Colo., for instance, could take an important step toward creating its own municipal utility, among the nation's first in years, as soon as next month. A scheduled vote by the City Council comes after a multiyear, multimillion-dollar study process that residents, impatient with the private electric company's pace in reaching the town's environmental goals, helped pay for by raising their own taxes.
And while Boulder's level of activism may be unusual, given its liberal leanings and deep-seated concerns over climate change and the environment, the desire to take control of the electricity business is not. Officials and advocates in Minneapolis and Santa Fe, N.M., are considering splitting from their private utilities, while lawmakers in Massachusetts are trying to make it easier for towns and counties to make the break. 
Over the years, many localities have examined creating municipal utilities, usually around the time their franchise agreements with private electric companies are to expire. But officials and advocates are now examining municipal utilities as concerns rise over carbon emissions from fossil fuels, especially coal, and as the ability to use renewable energy sources like solar and wind increases.
''Right now, a lot of the communities are looking at it for climate reasons,'' said Ursula Schryver, director of education and customer programs at the American Public Power Association. ''The biggest benefit about public power is the local control.''
But private utilities often resist giving up control -- and customers -- to new, public competitors, arguing that it leaves them unable to recoup investments made in anticipation of customer needs. In addition, the power industry cites its experience and long history in keeping the lights on while meeting environmental goals.
''This is our business. It's what we do,'' said David Eves, chief executive of the Public Service Company of Colorado, the division of Xcel Energy operating in Boulder. And because its parent company operates in eight states, he added, the utility can focus on being more efficient. ''We don't run other parts of the city operation and deal with those kinds of things. It's our specialty.''
Roughly 70 percent of the nation's homes are powered through private, investor-owned utilities, which are allowed to earn a set profit on their investments, normally through the rates they charge customers. But government-owned utilities, most of them formed 50 to 100 years ago, are nonprofit entities that do not answer to shareholders. They have access to tax-exempt financing for their projects, they do not pay federal income tax and they tend to pay their executives salaries that are on par with government levels, rather than higher corporate rates.
That financial structure can help municipal utilities supply cheaper electricity. According to data from the federal Energy Information Administration, municipal utilities over all offer cheaper residential electricity than private ones -- not including electric cooperatives, federal utilities or power marketers -- a difference that holds true in 32 of the 48 states where both exist. In addition, they can plow more of their revenue back into maintenance and prevention, which can result in more reliable service and faster restorations after power failures.
In Massachusetts after Hurricane Irene in 2011, for instance, municipal utilities in some of the hardest-hit areas were able to restore power in one or two days, while investor-owned companies like NStar and National Grid took roughly a week for some customers. According to an advocacy group called Massachusetts Alliance for Municipal Electric Choice, government-owned utilities on average employ more linemen per 10,000 customers than the private companies.
And in Winter Park, Fla., which in 2005 took over from its private utility, now part of Progress Energy, customers pay competitive rates for more reliable service, said Randy Knight, the city manager. It took time to get there: The utility lost money and raised rates in its early years while it made capital improvements to the system. But now, Mr. Knight said, it is making about $5 million in profit on about $45 million in revenue, profit that is paying to put the wires underground. The city has already buried 10 of its 80 miles of cable, a project that should be completed in the next 15 years at current rates and power supply costs.
''We're taking the money they're paying in income taxes and profits to the shareholders and that's the money that we can use for these different things,'' he said, adding that the city was helped by having a staff that works only in one town. ''Having our, granted, smaller staff totally dedicated to our nine square miles has been so much better for us.''
But supporters of investor-owned utilities say that restoration speeds vary among government-owned and private utilities. The large electric companies, they say, are often in a better position to muster resources after storms like Sandy and Irene because they can call on extra staff from other companies and regions.
''Very few utilities can really maintain the full complement of crews and equipment that they may need -- it's not economic,'' said James P. Fama, vice president of energy delivery at the Edison Electric Institute, which represents private utilities. ''Municipal budgets are under pressure, just as investor-owned utility budgets are under pressure because state commissions are hesitant to pass through rate increases.''
And the road to a new utility is steep and studded with pitfalls, a long and expensive journey that has stalled many towns that have embarked upon it in recent decades. The community and the utility must fix a price for the electric company's property, a calculation that includes not just the value of poles and wires but also so-called stranded assets, or investments made in things like power plants on the assumption of needing to provide service for a certain number of customers.
Aside from cost, towns must often battle the utility, which usually packs significant political and financial muscle. Sometimes, towns must push to change the law. In Massachusetts, the ultimate decision of whether to sell is left to the utility; lawmakers have been trying for nearly a decade to change that rule, citing high rates and the poor maintenance and performance of private utilities after storms as the main impetus.
''I don't foresee a rush by communities to do this,'' said Stephen L. DiNatale, a state representative from Fitchburg, in the north central part of the state, who recently reintroduced a bill that would require utilities to sell for the going rate if a town had the money, as determined by state regulators. ''But I think having that ability to do it would help to keep some of these investor-owned utilities in line.''
Sometimes the conversion goes the other way. Colorado Springs, Colo., is studying privatizing its utility, while residents of Vero Beach, Fla., are set to vote this month on whether to sell their utility to a private company, Florida Power & Light.
And in New York, where the Long Island Power Authority was harshly criticized for its failures after Hurricane Sandy, a commission handpicked by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo recommended privatizing the public authority, created under his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, as a successor to the Long Island Lighting Company and its Shoreham nuclear plant.
For now, though, Boulder, whose efforts are being closely watched by utilities, environmental advocates and officials across the country, is moving along even though its utility has among the best records for including clean energy, especially wind, in its portfolio. But a coal plant in Pueblo that went online in 2010 helped resuscitate a long-standing urge in the city to create an independent utility as part of an effort to reach its aggressive environmental goals.
The city just released an analysis with options for moving forward, some showing that it could get 54 percent of its energy from renewable resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 percent with a government utility. If the city decides to go ahead, it estimates that forming the new utility would take two to five years.
In the meantime, the Public Service Company of Colorado is working on a plan to satisfy the city's demands, Mr. Eves said, partly because it does not want to lose the customers, who are 4 percent of the company's business, but also because other areas it serves have set or are designing similar energy targets.
''It's not like we would do this just for Boulder,'' he said. ''It's something that we would apply with our regulators to be able to offer it in other communities in Colorado.''

HEADLINE: The U.S. Conference of Mayors, on Tax-Exempt Bonds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your March 5 front-page article about tax-exempt corporate bonds, ''A Stealth Tax Subsidy for Business Faces New Scrutiny,'' did not mention important concerns that have been raised by local public officials across the country about exemptions being curtailed or ended as part of a tax reform agenda. 
We strongly support the tax exemption for public bonds that finance public projects, such as repairs and expansion of schools, bridges, highways, and water and sewer systems. While we do not condone the use of tax exemptions for corporations that would do business in a jurisdiction even without the exemptions, we do support them for private activity in economically distressed areas and following a natural or man-made disaster.
The federal tax exemption on bonds for public spending, however, is crucial to cities and counties providing basic services to their residents. During the past decade, municipal bonds financed over $1.65 trillion in public service projects. In typical market conditions, the tax exemption can save taxpayers two percentage points on bonds. The investments also create jobs.
Meanwhile, no additional funding from Washington is in the pipeline for infrastructure projects, and transportation funds are flat. The tax-exempt bonds are all local officials have to finance major projects as we continue to struggle from the Great Recession.
Without them, the public will be forced to pay a regressive tax resulting from higher interest rates or will have to make do with deteriorating schools, highways, and water and sewer systems. We strongly urge the White House and Congress to preserve this important financing tool.

HEADLINE: Science | High School Senior's Research Wins $100,000 Prize

BYLINE: By ETHAN HAUSER

 BODY:
A high school senior who cultivated populations of algae under her loft bed won first place and $100,000 in the Intel Science Talent Search on Tuesday night.
The contestant, Sara Volz, 17, of Colorado Springs, Colo., researched ways to create populations of algae cells with high oil content; this algae oil can be converted into an economically feasible biofuel. ''It's something she's worked on for years, and that shows a certain passion and drive that you don't always see in heavily mentored projects,'' said David Marker, a mathematics professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and the chairman of the judging panel. ''And what really set her off was that she's so well-rounded in all areas of science -- I was able to ask her very advanced math questions that she answers easily.'' 
Second prize in the contest, $75,000, was awarded to Jonah Kallenbach, 17, of Ambler, Pa., for his project, ''Characterizing and Identifying Interactions of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins.'' Mr. Kallenbach's research, in the burgeoning field of bioinformatics and genomics, focused on ''disordered'' regions in protein chains -- areas with abnormal molecular structures. These areas eventually may serve as targets for newly developed drugs to treat diseases like breast cancer, ovarian cancer and tuberculosis.
Adam Bowman, 17, of Brentwood, Tenn., won third prize and $50,000 for research into less expensive ways to create ionized gases called plasmas, which have applications ranging from semiconductor manufacturing to nuclear physics. Current plasma sources are prohibitively expensive, and Mr. Bowman's findings, which grew out of a tabletop plasma ''gun'' he built in his garage, could make the gases widely accessible to lower-budget institutions.
Rounding out the top winners were: Hannah Larson, of Eugene, Ore.; Peter Kraft, of Munster, Ind.; Kensen Shi, of College Station, Tex.; Samuel Zbarsky, of Rockville, Md.; Brittany Wenger, of Sarasota, Fla.; Akshay Padmanabha, of Collierville, Tenn.; and Sahana Vasudevan, of Palo Alto, Calif.
The winners were chosen from more than 1,700 entries in this year's Intel Science Talent Search, the most prestigious high school science contest in the country. Seven of its alumni have won Nobel Prizes, 11 have received MacArthur ''genius'' awards, and two have received Fields Medals. Four contestants this year were profiled on Tuesday in Science Times.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Deal On Budget Seems In Doubt

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and ASHLEY PARKER; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's meeting with a restive and resistant House Republican majority on Wednesday underscored their deep divisions over fiscal policy as both sides acknowledged that an overarching budget compromise was in doubt despite a new push by the White House.
One day after Republicans rolled out a detailed proposal aimed at eliminating the federal deficit through steep cuts and repealing many of the president's accomplishments, Mr. Obama told them pointedly in a rare visit that their highest fiscal priority was not his.
''Our biggest problems in the next 10 years are not deficits,'' the president said, according to accounts from the meeting, bluntly rejecting an idea that has become Republican fiscal dogma.
That left many Republicans, who are resisting the president's calls to close tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy, wondering where they could find room for compromise. 
''Well, he doesn't want to balance the budget in 10 years, and he wants tax increases, and he wants new spending,'' Representative Darrell Issa of California said as he left the meeting early. ''But other than that, we're close.''
The hourlong discussion at the Capitol, and the release of a new budget by Senate Democrats on Wednesday that adds $100 billion in new stimulus spending and would impose higher taxes on large corporations and wealthy Americans, illustrated anew just how difficult it will be to resolve the issues that have split the Congress for years and created a perpetual cycle of deadline-driven short-term fiscal policy. Given the gap in the budget approaches, the president conceded as much in an interview with ABC News that ran on Wednesday before he went to the Capitol for the second consecutive day.
''Ultimately, it may be that the differences are just too wide,'' said Mr. Obama, who will meet Thursday with Senate Republicans and House Democrats. ''It may be that ideologically, if their position is, 'We can't do any revenue,' or, 'We can only do revenue if we gut Medicare or gut Social Security or gut Medicaid,' if that's the position, then we're probably not going to be able to get a deal.''
While the White House and Republicans characterized Wednesday's discussion as a cordial first step in what they hope will be a continuing dialogue, those who attended were frank about the prospects for compromise.
''The president seemed to say, 'If we're going to do the areas we agree on, you have to also do some of mine,' '' said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma, bristling at Mr. Obama's suggestion. ''If we can find the areas we agree on, why can't we just do those?''
The problem in coming together on areas of agreement is that there are so few. Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on the fundamental, underlying problem with the country's fiscal governance. Congressional Democrats and Mr. Obama, noting that the government has long operated with deep deficits, do not see a need for a balanced budget as long as spending is kept in check.
Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat and Senate Budget Committee chairwoman who outlined her budget on Wednesday, summed up her party's objections to Republican austerity measures, which Democrats have said rob the country of needed investment.
''Deficit reduction at the expense of economic growth is doomed to failure,'' she said.
Under their budget, Senate Democrats would have the government running a deficit of nearly $600 billion in 10 years.
In another sign of just how different the parties' priorities are, just before Mr. Obama arrived to meet with House Republicans, the Senate rejected a Republican effort to cut off financing for the president's signature health care overhaul in a party-line vote.
Other issues surfaced in Wednesday's talks that only further highlighted the partisan gulf.
Republicans vented their frustration that the president always seemed to be in campaign mode, questioning why he would speak to Organizing for Action, a nonprofit that supports his priorities, on the same day he visited them.
They pushed him to approve the Keystone oil pipeline and to reopen the White House for tours. Representative Candice S. Miller of Michigan told him that if he wanted to save on expenses, he should cancel the White House picnics and Christmas parties held for members of Congress instead.
When an aide passed a note to the president saying that a new pope had been selected, someone interjected with a friendly barb: ''Does that mean White House tours are back on?'' Mr. Obama deadpanned: ''No. Vatican tours are.''
Underlying the conversations was a deep mistrust among rank-and-file House Republicans, who feel the White House has vilified and ignored them for the more than two years they have been in power. On the budget, Republicans expressed the belief that they thought the president was purposely withholding the release of his budget (it is now more than five weeks late) so he could first beat up on Republicans for theirs.
''Almost every question had some grounding in the question of trust,'' said Representative Cory Gardner of Colorado. ''You're meeting with O.F.A. tonight, after you come and play nice with us, what's happening? And so there were a lot questions about what's happening and how it can work in that atmosphere.''
Mr. Lankford asked the president why on election night he had called the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Representative Steve Israel of New York, to congratulate him on their victories before he had called Speaker John A. Boehner. The president corrected Mr. Lankford, noting that he had called Mr. Boehner first but that the speaker was asleep.
Mr. Boehner laughed and confirmed that indeed he was sleeping when the call came.
Members of both parties have expressed skepticism that the president's overtures to Congress will yield much. But whether or not they only make for good political theater, the visits do insulate the Obama administration from a criticism they have heard frequently for the last four years: they make little effort to court Congress.
''Obviously we didn't solve the nation's problems in one meeting,'' said Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan.
Some said that while they appreciated the president's visit, he would have to do far more than simply visit Capitol Hill a few times in one week to smooth over more than four years' worth of tension.
''He has not put in the time, and his aides have said it doesn't matter,'' said Representative Pat Tiberi, Republican of Ohio. ''One trip is great. But one trip doesn't change his presidency in terms of the relationships that he's not built on either side of the aisle.''

HEADLINE: A New Pope, From the Americas

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN; Reporting was contributed by Rachel Donadio, Gaia Pianigiani and Daniel J. Wakin from Vatican City; Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome; Jennifer Medina from Los Angeles; Fernanda Santos from Phoenix; and Randal C. Archibold from Mexico City.

 BODY:
ROME -- The surprise selection on Wednesday of an Argentine, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, as the new pope shifted the gravity of the Roman Catholic Church from Europe to Latin America in one fell swoop, and served as an emphatic salute to the growing power of Latinos across the Americas.
The new pope took the name Francis and is the 266th pontiff of the church. He is the first pope from Latin America, and the first member of the Jesuit order to lead the church.
''I would like to thank you for your embrace,'' the new pope, dressed in white, said in Italian from the balcony on St. Peter's Basilica as thousands cheered joyously below. ''My brother cardinals have chosen one who is from far away, but here I am.'' 
The selection electrified Latinos from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires, and raised the hopes especially of those in Latin America, where 4 of every 10 of the world's Catholics now live.
But the choice also may provide a strategic boost to the church in the United States, where its following would have lost ground in recent decades were it not for the influx of Latino immigrants, who have increasingly asserted themselves as a cultural and political force, and played a critical role in President Obama's re-election.
The significance of the choice was not lost on church leaders. ''It's been more than 500 years since the first evangelization, and this is the first time that there is a pope from Latin America,'' said Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles, who is originally from Mexico.
''It's a huge role that we never had before,'' he said.
The new pope, known for his simple, pastoral ways and his connection to the poor, is in some ways a contrast to his predecessor, Benedict XVI, an aloof theologian who resigned the office -- the first pope to do so in 598 years -- saying he no longer felt up to the rigors of the job.
But Francis shares Benedict's core doctrinal positions and is not considered likely to push changes in positions like the church's ban on the ordination of women as priests or its strict opposition to abortion and gay marriage.
The choice of Francis, who is 76, also defied some predictions that the 115 cardinals would opt for a young pope who could energize the church at a time when it faces a shortage of priests, growing competition from evangelical churches in the Southern Hemisphere, a sexual abuse crisis that has undermined the church's moral authority in the West and difficulties governing the Vatican itself.
Pope Francis spoke by telephone with Benedict, now known as pope emeritus, on Wednesday evening, said a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi. He called it, ''an act of great significance and pastorality'' that Francis' first act as pope was to offer a prayer for his predecessor.
Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York told reporters he had heard that Francis would visit Benedict soon, although the Vatican did not include the visit on the new pope's schedule for this week. Italian news media reported that the visit would take place in the next few days and would be televised.
Mr. Obama was among the first world leaders to congratulate Francis in a message that emphasized the pope's humble roots and New World origins.
''As the first pope from the Americas,'' the president said, ''his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day.''
The cardinals could have chosen a pope from a country in Africa or Asia where Catholic converts are plentiful and the church is vibrant. Instead, they selected a cardinal from Argentina, to the surprise of even those who had hoped for a non-European.
''An Argentine! I can't believe it,'' said Gaston Aquino, a seminarian from Argentina standing in the packed crowd in St. Peter's Square in Rome as the name of the new pope was announced from the balcony above. ''Bergoglio, pope!'' he marveled. ''I think it will mean great joy'' for Argentina.
Catholics in the United States are holding steady at about a quarter of the population, and about one-third of those are Latinos. In Latin America, the church is confronting many of the same cultural and political battles as it is in Europe and the United States: a rise in acceptance of gay relationships, abortion and birth control, and a growing tide of people abandoning the church and professing no religion.
The Rev. Luis Calero, a Jesuit priest and professor of anthropology at Santa Clara University in California who studies the church in Central and South America said: ''A lot of Catholics are leaving the Catholic church in Latin America to go to evangelical and Pentecostal churches. They no longer find a home in Catholic Christianity.
''Going to a traditional parish is no longer fulfilling to them because the parish is impersonal,'' he said. ''It tends to not have a sense of community that is uplifting.''
Father Calero said the next pope might be able to turn the situation around if he could respond to what he said were the most pressing problems: poverty, pluralism and the shortage of priests because of the church's requirement of clerical celibacy.
The choice of Cardinal Bergoglio at least initially appeared to be celebrated across the continent. There had been faint hope in Mexico that the next pope would be Cardinal Jos Francisco Robles Ortega, the archbishop of Guadalajara, who was mentioned in Italian newspapers in the past week as a candidate gaining steam.
But many Mexican were joyous nonetheless, with newspapers playing up the historical turn of a Latin American assuming the throne of Peter.
''It fills us with joy because he is close to the Latin American people,'' Msgr. Eugenio Lira, the secretary general of the Mexican Conference of Bishops, told reporters. ''He could be sensitive to economic conditions and the suffering, joys and hope of people in these lands.''
The choice also points to challenges faced by the church in some parts of Latin America, like Portuguese-speaking Brazil, the country with the world's largest concentration of Catholics, where evangelical churches have made big inroads in recent decades. In Argentina itself, a nation historically seen as more Europeanized than its neighbors, the church is grappling with a declining number of Catholics who regularly attend mass.
Cardinal Dolan said in an interview after the conclave that ''Catholic is part of their DNA'' in Argentina. With Cardinal Bergoglio as pope, he said, ''think of the electricity that is going to send.''
But he said that country of origin was not the main factor for the cardinals who elected him.
''Most cardinals just want to choose the right man,'' he said. The pope should be a good pastor, governor and communicator. ''He fills those bills. Where he comes from is gravy. And we've got a lot of good gravy.''
Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian and political analyst, said there would be an expectation in Latin America for a pope from the region to promote democracy and human rights.
''If the church plays a role in favor of democracy and human rights as it played in Chile during the Pinochet regime, then the pope will be a factor in civic progress in these countries,'' he said. ''If the church takes up the banner of freedom it would be a great benefit in this continent that is the reservoir of Catholicism in the world.''
Outside St. Matthew Catholic School in West Phoenix, where she had gone to pick up her children, Deana Silva, 27, said, ''I didn't really connect with the other pope,'' but ''Papa Francisco,'' or Pope Francis, ''is different.'' He is ''more like us, you know, Latino,'' Ms. Silva said.
Her mother, Donna Reyes, 46, said she was ''very excited.'' ''We had been watching and waiting,'' said Ms. Reyes, whose parents were immigrants from Mexico. ''There are a lot of us Latinos in the Catholic Church. It was nice that the Church finally recognized it.''
As the children lined up to leave school, someone said a prayer and made an announcement about Lent over the loudspeakers, then, in Spanish, greeted the new pope, ''el primer Papa de las Americas,'' the first pope from the Americas.

HEADLINE: Cyberattacks a Topic in Obama Call With New Chinese President

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama used a congratulatory call with China&#8217;s new president to discuss the loss of American intellectual property from cyberattacks. 

 BODY:
Cyberthreats featured prominently in President Obama's congratulatory call to the new Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Thursday.
The president used the occasion to discuss the loss of United States intellectual property from cyberattacks. The mere mention of cyberthreats is a step forward for an administration that has been reluctant to confront Beijing on Chinese military attacks even as billions of dollars' worth of trade secrets have been stolen. 
But a spate of recent headlines about Chinese cyberattacks on The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and others have thrust the issue on the diplomatic stage. A report by Mandiant, a computer security firm, tying hundreds of attacks back to one Chinese military unit, made the issue even harder to ignore.
Mr. Obama has been increasingly vocal about cyberthreats, but has not gone as far as to call out China by name. In his State of the Union address, he was careful to omit China when he said "we know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets." And when the Obama administration sent the nation's Internet providers a confidential list of Internet addresses tied to a hacking group that had stolen terabytes of data from American corporations, it failed to mention that every single address could be traced to the Chinese military cybercommand.
But privately, administration officials have said they plan to tell China's new leaders that the volume and sophistication of Chinese cyberattacks have become so intense that they threaten the relationship between Washington and Beijing.
"In any discussion with China, the U.S. needs to have three agenda items: One, cybersecurity; two, cybersecurity; and three, cybersecurity," Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview.
China has long denied that it is responsible for cyberattacks on American companies and has said that it too is a victim of such attacks. And in discussions with American officials, Chinese representatives often refuse to discuss economic espionage.
"They say that the topic of economic espionage is 'embarrassing' for them," said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has participated in such discussions. "They say, 'In the US, military espionage is heroic and economic espionage is a crime, but in China, the line is not so clear.'"

HEADLINE: At This Conference, Gensler Is Strictly Ballroom

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Gary Gensler, a man more at home arguing the fine points of position limits or swaps reform, caught Tuesday Night Fever at the Futures Industry Association&#8217;s annual conference held in Boca Raton, Fla. 

 BODY:
[Video: Watch on Youtube.]
BOCA RATON, Fla. - MF Global's collapse put Wall Street on high alert at last year's futures trading bash here. In earlier years, the financial crisis similarly consumed the junketgoers. 
This year, Wall Street had other things to fill its dance card: Gary Gensler's moves. 
The regulator, more at home arguing the fine points of position limits or swaps reform, caught Tuesday Night Fever, causing him to bust a move on the Boca Raton dance floor, shaking loose with a former colleague. 
 Mr. Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, later explained that he simply liked to dance. Others speculated that he was savoring his last trip to Boca Raton as chairman, noting that Mr. Gensler could leave the agency by the end of the year.
Either way, the performance at the Futures Industry Association's annual conference drew rare praise and collective amusement from Wall Street executives accustomed to Mr. Gensler's no-nonsense style. 
"He actually looked good up there," one onlooker later remarked.
By Wednesday, Mr. Gensler had returned to form. He delivered forceful remarks about interest rate manipulation across the banking industry and called for action to overhaul the rate-setting process. 
But it was too late. Word of his performance had already ripped through the oceanfront resort, fitting neatly into a conference light on news and heavy on gossip. 
There was chatter that the the moment has been captured on video, fueling the fascination. Some at the conference took to refreshing YouTube over and over, eager for a peek at Mr. Gensler's performance. 
"We need to get that video," one attendee was overheard saying. But as of Thursday morning, the video had yet to surface online.

HEADLINE: Stop Stealing From Our Kids

BYLINE: STEVEN RATTNER


HIGHLIGHT: Forget the sequester. Washington&#8217;s focus should be a short-term growth strategy, coupled with long-term reform of entitlement programs that threaten the nation&#8217;s fiscal solvency. 

 BODY:
The sequester's arrival on March 1 has set off a raging debate over not only whether those immediate forced budget cuts are the right fiscal medicine, but also whether we should be trying to accomplish longer-term deficit reduction while the economy remains weak.
Of course we should.
Our budget outlook is so grim and the policy changes that are required will be so painful - politically as well as financially - that putting efforts to get our fiscal house in order on hold would be the height of irresponsibility.
Proponents of taking a pause offer a variety of arguments in support of their view: Congress can't do two things at once, and the need to fight the sequester should take precedence. The budget outlook for the next 10 years isn't so bad. The bond market is quiescent, even in the face of continuing large government borrowings. 
Those assertions may contain grains of truth, but none changes the overarching fact that working toward a sensible long-term fiscal policy is every bit as important as pushing for better short-term policies.
Thanks to decades of accumulated federal budget deficits and, more significantly, imprudent Medicare and Social Security policies, we've stolen almost $60 trillion from our children.
That's the amount that would be required to both pay off our national debt (a comparatively modest $11 trillion) and provide for benefits that we awarded ourselves without paying for them.
Every year that goes by - indeed, every day that goes by - causes this amount to increase. As shown below, just five years ago, these unfunded liabilities totaled $45 trillion.
Starting to chip away at this mountain of obligations doesn't require immediate austerity. In fact, what often gets lost in the debate over whether to address long-term deficit reduction now is that the policy changes needed to fix the long-term problem need not have any immediate deleterious effect.
History and common sense tell us that those kinds of changes are likely to be more palatable if they are phased in very gradually. So waiting for the problems to become more acute is exactly the wrong approach.
Back in 1983, Social Security was in worse shape than it is today. Yet, a bipartisan commission led by Alan Greenspan that year proposed gradually raising the retirement age by two years over a period of 27 years, not even beginning until 2000. Meanwhile, while scheduled tax increases were accelerated, they were still phased in over seven years.
What's remarkable about the 1983 changes is that Congress accepted them under arguably worse economic conditions than we face today. Unemployment averaged 9.6 percent in 1983, compared with 7.7 percent at present. Inflation had just begun to fall from double digit levels. Memories of a vicious recession remained fresh.
Today, our overall budgetary problems are far greater and yet we hear Serious People suggest that we wait a decade to address them. Yes, the economy is still weak and an immediate sharp cut in the deficit would be the wrong medicine. 
But no, that doesn't obviate the need to stop stealing from our children as quickly as practicable.
While the all-important ratio of debt to gross domestic product should stabilize over the next few years, after that it begins to rise. How sharply depends on assumptions about tax and revenue policies.
The chart below depicts two of the more extreme projections from well-regarded forecasters. What's evident in both is that the ratio begins to rise again and ultimately could reach or exceed the 90 percent threshold where economists believe economic growth begins to be constrained.
At the heart of the problem are the entitlements programs, Medicare and Social Security, and also Medicaid. In fact, their fast rising costs have regrettably squeezed discretionary spending, outlays that include important investment programs like infrastructure, research and development, and education. We need to create budgetary room to reverse this trend.
The challenge in reforming entitlements, of course, is how. While the path trod by the Greenspan commission provides a possible road map, simply raising payroll taxes across the board and lengthening the retirement age won't suffice. The hole today is too deep.
Social Security is by far the easier to fix. The present value of the unfunded liability is "only" $9 trillion. And the cost of the benefits is not enslaved to the vicissitudes of health care inflation.
To fix Social Security, we should first stop using the Consumer Price Index to adjust benefits for inflation. Using the C.P.I. overstates the impact of inflation and has also led to larger increases in benefits for Social Security recipients than the income gains of typical American workers.
Switching to another index - to so-called chained C.P.I., which would reduce annual cost of living adjustments - would erase about one-fifth of the shortfall in Social Security benefits. In addition to following the Greenspan approach, the balance could be made up through a combination of lifting the cap on the amount of earnings subject to Social Security taxes and reducing monthly benefits for the wealthy.
Medicare is a larger and tougher problem. Republicans put their faith in introducing competition and raising the eligibility age to 67. Democrats pin their hopes on innovative ways of delivering health care and squeezing payments to providers.
While elements of both sides' solutions should be included, they are insufficient. A typical couple at retirement age has paid $122,000 into the Medicare system and will receive $387,000 in benefits (after adjustment for inflation.). Additional surgery is required.
That can take many forms but should follow two principles. First, with income inequality at record levels, the burden should be disproportionately borne by the wealthy, through some combination of higher premiums and means testing of benefits.
Second, mechanisms like higher co-pays for all (perhaps also scaled to incomes) should be employed as a way of using market forces to discourage wasteful use of Medicare services.
This week, both House Republicans, led by the Budget Committee chairman, Paul Ryan, and Senate Democrats, led by their budget chair, Patty Murray, have put forward their visions for what budget policy for the next decade should look like.
Happily, while the plans are vastly different in philosophy and magnitude, both recognize that long-term deficit reduction must begin now.
We don't need to balance the budget, as Mr. Ryan suggests, nor should Americans accept the evisceration of services that he proposes. On the other hand, the Democrats' plan - while potentially stabilizing the important debt-to-G.D.P. ratio -tiptoes around the Medicare problem.
Recent history suggests that these will become yet another casualty of Washington gridlock. The American people deserve better. It's time for Congress to demonstrate that it can do two things at once by both replacing the ridiculous sequester with pro-growth short-term policies while addressing the deteriorating long-term picture.

HEADLINE: Big Banks Have a Big Problem

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Across the political parties, the tide is turning against the biggest banks, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
The largest banks in the United States face a serious political problem. There has been an outbreak of clear thinking among officials and politicians who increasingly agree that too-big-to-fail is not a good arrangement for the financial sector.
Six banks face the prospect of meaningful constraints on their size: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. They are fighting back with lobbying dollars in the usual fashion - but in the last electoral cycle they went heavily for Mitt Romney (not elected) and against Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown for the Senate (both elected), so this element of their strategy is hardly prospering. 
What the megabanks really need are some arguments that make sense. There are three positions that attract them: the Old Wall Street View, the New View and the New New View. But none of these holds water; the intellectual case for global megabanks at their current scale is crumbling.
The Old Wall Street view is that there is nothing to see - big banks know what they are doing and pose no threat to the economy. This position was in complete ascendancy before 2007 but is seldom heard today. In part, of course, the financial crisis made this view seem more than a little hard to defend.
And any attempt to resurrect this position was completely sunk by the "London Whale" losses suffered by JPMorgan Chase last year. We'll learn more in the hearing on Friday called by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, although the chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was not asked to testify. Senator Levin's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is also expected to issue a report. 
All these details about the London Whale will reinforce the view that even one of our supposedly great risk managers, Mr. Dimon, can lose control of what is happening in his business - on a scale that can matter for overall profits and, potentially, for the economy.
The largest banks have become too complex to manage. And when they fail, the consequences are huge for all of us. This point is completely nailed by Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig's new book, "The Bankers' New Clothes."
The New Wall Street view is that there is no too-big-to-fail subsidy. Or perhaps there is a subsidy but no one can measure it. Or perhaps someone can measure it, but not the people who have done so. If the first view ended in tragedy - the crisis and huge job losses of 2008 - this New View is simple comedy.
My colleagues at Bloomberg View have written a series of devastating editorials explaining for a broad audience the nature and likely scale of subsidies that very large banks receive. You should read the series, starting with the latest contribution this week, which includes useful links to previous salvos on both sides. 
The reaction of the industry is running roughly parallel to how church officials originally responded to Galileo's work. No doubt the bankers in question would like to compel Bloomberg View to renounce its opinions.
Fortunately, we have come a long way since 1633.
And the banks' lobbyists are making an uncharacteristic mistake by digging in with this extreme and indefensible view. Ask people in the credit markets if they think lenders to the biggest banks have some degree of downside protection afforded by the government (including the Federal Reserve). I have never heard any reasonable investor deny this reality in private.
The big banks are well down the road to acknowledging that there may be a subsidy and the question is how to measure it - and how to assess all the available evidence.
All data are complex. The Federal Reserve changes monetary policy on the basis of numbers that are hard to know precisely. What exactly is "core inflation" or the "natural rate of unemployment" at this moment? 
And whenever people try to bedazzle you with econometrics, go back to the simple numbers and see a powerful story: megabanks have a funding advantage, if you think about it properly and compare apples to apples. See, for example, this column by David Reilly in The Wall Street Journal this week. (Mr. Reilly endorses a position similar to one I have advanced with Sheila Bair and other colleagues.)
The New New Wall Street view is that too-big-to-fail exists but that Dodd-Frank will bring it under control. This argument remains the best hope for global megabanks, but even this perspective is now under severe pressure.
This position has some powerful adherents, including Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Jerome Powell, a member of its Board of Governors. (I wrote about Mr. Powell's views in this space last week and about Mr. Bernanke the week before).
The problem is that Mr. Bernanke clearly articulated, during the Dodd-Frank debate, that the big financial companies would be pressed to become smaller of their accord.
Three years later, there is no sign of actually happening.
And now come Richard Fisher and Harvey Rosenblum, knocking hard on the gates of Washington with an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, "How to Shrink the 'Too-Big-to-Fail' Banks."
Mr. Fisher is a successful private-sector investor who now heads the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, where Mr. Rosenblum is also a senior official.
From the heart of the Federal Reserve System - and deeply steeped in private-sector experience - comes a clear statement that too-big-to-fail exists and Dodd-Frank did not end it. 
Attorney General Eric Holder's testimony to Congress last week also confirmed the latter point: some banks are so big that the Department of Justice is afraid to bring legal charges against them, for fear of how that would affect the economy. Senator Warren of Massachusetts continues to press this issue relentlessly and very effectively. 
You should also listen to this Bloomberg radio interview with Arthur Levitt, who acknowledges "too big to jail" about two-thirds of the way through. Mr. Levitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is currently an adviser to Goldman Sachs, so I expect he'll have to walk this statement back.
Most worrying for the big banks, Mr. Fisher is more broadly on the right of the political spectrum. On Friday, he will address the Conservative Political Action Conference. I'm not sure a senior Fed official has ever done this before.
Mr. Fisher is not only entirely correct. He is also on a completely convergent path with Senator Brown of Ohio. In fascinating new development on Wednesday, Bloomberg News reported more details on the Fisher-Rosenblum push for a hard size cap on big banks, which would force JPMorgan and Bank of America, for example, to become significantly smaller. 
The executives who live well on subsidies at big banks should be very afraid.
The Fed cannot long resist the pressure to measure and assess too-big-to-fail subsidies. The Government Accountability Office is in the process of doing exactly this, at the request of Senators Brown and David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana. As Senator Vitter put it, "Despite the claims made by the paid cheerleaders of the megabanks, Too Big To Fail is alive and well, and the banks receive taxpayer subsidies." 
He went on to say: "Chairman Bernanke knows it, the market knows it, and the taxpayers know it," adding that he thought the G.A.O. study would "get to the bottom of" the facts.
We'll get a range of reasonable estimates. And they will all suggest the continuing presence of subsidies for financial companies that are perceived as too big to fail.
And then Mr. Fisher, Senator Brown and other sensible people can help us move toward policies that will impose binding size constraints on our largest financial institutions.

HEADLINE: The Breakfast Meeting: The 'Today' Show's Popularity Woes, and Anxiety at Time Inc.

BYLINE: DANIEL E. SLOTNIK


HIGHLIGHT: NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Today&#8221; show faces dwindling popularity, perhaps because of Matt Lauer; Time Inc. employees are worried about the company&#8217;s prospects after it is spun off; and some new Spanish media outlets are trying to look on the bright side. 

 BODY:
NBC's "Today" has continued to lag behind ABC's "Good Morning America" for 10 months now, a ratings slump that started just one week after its co-host, Matt Lauer, signed a contract with NBC said to be worth $25 million a year, the highest compensation ever on a morning show, Brian Stelter reports. Some "Today" staffers cite a lack of audience connection to Mr. Lauer as the root of the problem. Mr. Lauer's popularity plummeted when his co-host, Ann Curry, was forced out last summer. Mr. Lauer, 55, started a belated image campaign this week, publicly stating that he thought his bosses had botched Ms. Curry's departure, but it may be too late. Alex Wallace, the NBC News executive in charge of "Today," said NBC wants Mr. Lauer to be host for "years to come." The network has denied suggestions that it may replace him with a younger host like Willie Geist, 37, or David Gregory, 42. 
At a lavish party for Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg last week, some Time Inc. employees seemed rattled about the publishing company's coming separation from Time Warner, Christine Haughney writes. Parties like this one, held at Time Warner's headquarters, may become a thing of the past for Time Inc. as it confronts its steep financial challenges. As a stand-alone entity, the magazine publisher will face $500 million to $1 billion in debt - unlike News Corporation's publishing arm, which will be debt-free when it separates from its parent company this year - and Time Inc.'s circulation and advertising revenue have suffered sharp declines in recent years. The company's executives hope their newfound freedom lets them use profits to transition to a digital age rather than paying them back to a parent company.
Some good news for Spain is finally enjoying media attention, Raphael Minder reports. Blogs like Bright Spain and newspapers like Buenas Noticias (Good News) offer an alternative to the relentless pessimism about the country's economic prospects. Buenas Noticias, which is backed by Coca-Cola and Pepsico, ignored Spain's 26 percent unemployment rate to publish articles about companies that are recruiting workers in Spain, including Renault, McDonald's and Telefnica, which is offering 200 internships (Telefnica also plans to lay off 5,600 workers, which the article did not mention).
The approaching end of the television season means it's time for shows to be renewed or canceled, and leads Mike Hale to wonder: what will become of the ABC Family comedy "Bunheads"? ABC has not yet announced if it will be canceled, and the show, about life and dance in the California hills, has lost about 40 percent of its audience over the course of its season. It would be a shame to give up on a show that, beyond being charming and funny, is unlike anything else on television at the moment, Mr. Hale writes.
Joe Chetrit, a secretive property mogul in New York, could come into the spotlight on Friday with the closing of his biggest deal: the $1.1. billion purchase of the Sony Building on Madison Avenue, Charles V. Bagli writes. Mr. Chetrit outmaneuvered about 20 other bidders to secure the deal and plans to convert the building, which has served as the headquarters for AT&T and Sony, into a mix of luxury condominiums, a hotel and high-end retail shops. Many experts say the deal is very risky because Sony plans to remain in the building for three years, after which it will take two years and $500 million to renovate the building. Interest rates could soar and the condo market could dry up before the building is ready in 2019.
NBC's "Smash," an ambitious drama about creating a Broadway production, essentially ended on Wednesday when the network announced that the show would be moved to Saturday for the remainder of its second season, Bill Carter reports. The show's ratings have been abysmal, and the move, set to take place on April 6, basically means the show will die in obscurity. NBC said that the Tuesday slot previously held by "Smash" would be filled by the new reality dating show, "Ready for Love."

HEADLINE: Diskerud Stays in Norway but Still Has U.S. on His Mind

BYLINE: BRIAN SCIARETTA


HIGHLIGHT: U.S. national team midfielder Mix Diskerud is hoping to get off to a strong start with Rosenborg when Norway&#8217;s Tippeligaen season opens this weekend. 

 BODY:
When the 2013 Tippeligaen season opens this weekend in Norway, midfielder Mix Diskerud will be looking to help bring Rosenborg BK back to the elite level of European soccer. But he will also be looking to attract the attention of the United States national team coaching staff.
(If not, there's always Norway's, but more on that later.) 
Earlier this month, Diskerud and Rosenborg agreed on a new two-year contract, extending a relationship that began last season. Rosenborg, which last won the Tippeligaen in 2010, is hoping to qualify for its first appearance in the Champions League group stages since 2007.
"Rosenborg and Copenhagen are by far the two greatest teams in Scandinavia," Diskerud said. "It's just great to be part of a club with so much tradition. It's actually a bit scary to assume the role of taking some kind of lead and responsibility in their next chapters in history. In a way you can't beat what has already been achieved."
Diskerud, 22, began his career with Stabaek, where he won the league in 2008. When a financial crisis hit the team last year, he went on a brief loan to Gent in Belgium. In August, he signed a six-month contract with Rosenborg, where he played well as the club finished in third place. Diskerud also featured in the club's Europa League matches.
Signing Diskerud was a top priority for Rosenborg, because the midfielder had serious interest from several clubs. Most of Diskerud's suitors were from Europe but one option was in M.L.S.: the Portland Timbers. 
Last year Portland hired Caleb Porter as coach, and Diskerud played under him with the United States under-23 team last year. While that team was unsuccessful in qualifying for the London Olympics, Diskerud came away impressed with Porter. It was a tempting offer to join up with him again, but in the end Diskerud chose to remain in Norway, where he was born.
"It's true that Caleb Porter contacted me," Diskerud said. "After the failed Olympic qualifying effort, I was afraid he was going to be forgotten. He's a great coach. I'm so happy he's allowed to build a team for one of the best soccer crowds in the United States. He'll do well in one of the big leagues Europe in years to come. If I didn't have to lock all the doors to Europe for the foreseeable future, then I would have helped him build his dream team. I'm sure he'll do a good enough job without me."
While Diskerud decided against jumping to M.L.S., he continues to be hopeful that he can earn a spot on Jurgen Klinsmann's senior national team. Diskerud's involvement with U.S. Soccer dates to 2008, when he began playing with the Americans' under-20 team.
Diskerud was born in Oslo and is the son of a Norwegian father and an American mother. As a youth player, he played for both the U.S. and Norwegian youth national teams but ahead of the 2009 U-20 World Cup, he began to only represent the United States. A year later, Diskerud made his debut with the senior national team in an exhibition against South Africa; in that game, he assisted on the winning goal.
When Klinsmann replaced Bob Bradley as coach in 2011, it became harder for Diskerud to earn call-ups. In fact it wasn't until last November when Diskerud earned his first cap under Klinsmann, in an exhibition against Russia. He entered a second half substitute and scored a dramatic 90th-minute equalizer to produce a 2-2 draw. It was his first international goal.
"I don't know if people understand how big that was for me," Diskerud said. "I got to come in and deny the Russians a win in Russia against the United States in the world's biggest sport. I kind of felt like Rocky Balboa when he beat the Russian. Right then and there I felt like I could retire from soccer. Just coming from a small country bordering them, we have a lot of respect for them; maybe too much."
Diskerud was called up by Klinsmann for the January camp that followed that game, but the coach surprised many when he did not name Diskerud to the matchday roster for the exhibition against Canada.
Diskerud said bluntly: "I was surprised as well."
For now, Diskerud said he was simply hoping that a strong start to the season at Rosenborg will boost his chances in the eyes of Klinsmann. Since his only appearances for the United States have come at the youth level and in national team exhibitions, Diskerud is still eligible to switch his affiliation to play for Norway.
Norwegian national team coaches have gone public with their interest in Diskerud, but he says he remains in the American corner, for now.
"I'm going to do my best here in Rosenborg and I hope the best I can do is good enough for U.S. Soccer," Diskerud said. "I want to be in the World Cup and I think everybody has that goal. I feel like I can contribute and I do want to."

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths CAULO, JAMES E.

 BODY:
CAULO--James E.,Died peacefully on March 3, 2013 at his home in Hingham, MA. He was 96. Through a combination of self-determination and good fortune, Mr. Caulo overcame his humble beginnings and limited formal education to create a rich and satisfying life for himself and his family. James Edward Caulo was born on August 16, 1916 in Brooklyn, NY to Edward V. Caulo and Mary Maynard. His early years were spent in the care of his grandparents, Rocco and Antonina Caulo, Italian immigrants who spoke little English. 
They raised Mr. Caulo, his older sister, Vera and other family members in a small apartment in Brooklyn. A product of both the public school system and the streets of New York, Mr. Caulo came of age during the Great Depression. He dropped out of high school at age fifteen to deliver sandwiches to businesses in Manhattan. Later Mr. Caulo studied accounting as a non-matriculating student at NYU, which led to employment at Schaefer Brewery in Brooklyn in 1947. Mr. Caulo enjoyed a prosperous 20 year career at Schaefer, being promoted to Comptroller of its Brooklyn operations. After leaving Schaefer, Mr. Caulo was named Vice President at Becton-Dickinson where he was involved in a variety of finance-related roles, including numerous corporate acquisitions during the 1970s. In retirement, Mr. Caulo continued to apply his business experience by volunteering at American Women for Economic Development (AWED), mentoring aspiring entrepreneurs. In 1948, Mr. Caulo met Frances J. Smith, a nurse working at Post-Graduate Hospital in Manhattan. After a brief courtship, the couple was married in April 1949 and moved to northern New Jersey where they established and maintained a loving partnership that lasted for nearly 64 years. Along the way, they raised five children while living in Hillsdale and Franklin Lakes. A voracious reader, Mr. Caulo absorbed and mastered topics as broad as classic literature, history, current events, religion, opera, and sports. On any given day, he could quote the price of gold on the commodities market and also recall the featured performers from various opening night productions at the Metropolitan Opera. He welcomed and delighted in any opportunity to engage in a lively discussion on current affairs with family and friends, at the dinner table or beyond, with or without a glass of wine. He also was an avid gardener and tennis player. In addition to his wife, Frances, Mr. Caulo is survived by their five children: Susan (and Dr. John) Purcell of Cambridge MA; Nina Caulo Feirman of Redwood City, CA; John (and Debra) Caulo of Burlington, VT; Ellen Caulo of Arlington, MA and Peter (and Betsey) Caulo of Amherst, NH as well as ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild. A celebration of Jim's life for family and friends will be held on a later date. The family would also like to acknowledge the loving care Jim was provided in his final months by private caregivers and the Norwell VNA & Hospice. A donation in Jim's name can be made to the Norwell VNA & Hospice, 120 Longwater Drive, Norwell, MA 02061 (www.nvna.org).

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths NADHERNY, FERDINAND

 BODY:
NADHERNY--Ferdinand, 86, passed away on March 12, 2013. Born December 12, 1926 in Berwyn, Il to Fred and Martha Nadherny. He attended Jefferson Grade School before entering Morton East High School outside of Chicago. At Morton, he was an honor student and played three varsity sports, receiving All State recognition as fullback his senior year. Ferd was later recognized as one of the four most distinguished graduates of Morton East in the last century. 
He graduated from Morton in 1945 and joined the Navy. Following his discharge from the Navy he attended Yale University on the G.I. Bill, having been introduced to the school by Robert Anderson. Ferd later established a scholarship in the name of Anderson for scholar athletes from the Chicago area. At Yale he majored in economics and earned eight varsity letters in the late 1940's in football and basketball, receiving All America Honorable Mention recognition for his exploits on the gridiron as a hard running fullback. These exploits earned him the nickname, Ferdinand the Bull," which affectionately stayed with him throughout his life. Following graduation from Yale in 1950 with a degree in economics and sociology, he entered Harvard Business School, graduating in 1952. While at Harvard he married his beloved wife of 62 years in June, 1951. After Harvard, Nadherny commenced his business career with The Cabot Corporation eventually settling in Wellesley, MA and had three sons (Chris, Steve, and Jeff) and two daughters (Wendy and Sandy). He was a very devoted father who loved his family and made it a priority throughout his life. In 1964 Ferd took a leave of absence from Cabot to further serve his country, joining the Lyndon Johnson administration in Washington, DC to help organize the Office of Economic Opportunity (The War on Poverty). He and the family returned to Chicago (Winnetka, Il) in 1966 where he held executive positions in several businesses before discovering his calling, executive search, that would become a passion for the next 25 years. He joined Russell Reynolds Associates in 1974 to start the firm's Chicago office, only the fourth office in the company. By the time he retired from the firm in 1996 it had grown to 30 worldwide offices, a number of which he helped open. Continuing to serve clients he became President of Russell Reynolds in 1980 and Vice Chairman in 1988 always working out of Chicago. Known as a consummate professional whose integrity, enthusiasm and respect for others were hallmarks, he built and left a legacy in Chicago and more broadly across the firm, and industry. Others trusted him with their lives. Ferd was recognized as an engaging leader who built teams and was genuinely excited by the successes of others. He had a never ending quest for quality, professionalism, and a willingness to listen to others. His honesty was surpassed only by his work ethic. Nadherny was a great believer in education and giving back to his community, serving as a Board Director for Leadership Greater Chicago, and Leadership for Quality Education. He also became a life Trustee of the Golden Apple Foundation, and life Member of the Advisory Council for Kellogg Graduate School of Business. Over the years, he stayed close to his alma mater, chairing three successful 1950 class reunion alumni drives. An avid golfer, he became a member of Old Elm Country Club in Highland Park, Il, the Country Club of Florida in Boynton Beach where he resided winters with his wife. A special interest of Ferd's in later years were the Achievement Centers for Children and Families in Delray, FL whose mission is to nurture safe environments for those children at greatest risk and helping families to break the cycle of poverty. He cared about making a difference. In his final five years, beset by congestive heart failure and advanced peripheral neuropathy, he continued to exhibit optimism, courage and faith. He is remembered for living life fully, being a role model, caring, his complete integrity, humility, the twinkle in his blue eyes, and the inviting smile with which he greeted his family and many dear friends. He is survived by his devoted wife, his five children, eleven grandchildren, a great-grandson, and sister Marjory. Those wishing to make a donation in Ferd Nadherny's name may contribute to the Robert Gardner Anderson Scholarship Fund, at Yale University, Office of Development, P.O. Box 2038, New Haven, CT 06521; or Achievement Centers at 555 N.W. 4th Street, Delray Beach, FL 33444.

HEADLINE: Back Home A Pontiff Is Honored, If Not by All

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; William Neuman, Emily Schmall and Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES -- Pope Francis was celebrated here on Thursday by faithful congregants and priests in some of this capital city's vast slums as he started his papacy on an austere note, shunning the throne reserved for him at the Vatican, but the praise was tempered by criticism of him for his hard-line conservative views on a range of issues, including gay rights and artistic expression.
The streets of Buenos Aires, where Francis, formerly Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was archbishop until Wednesday, captured the sense of ambivalence over the first Argentine to be named to head the Vatican. Thousands flooded into parts of the city, snarling traffic and bellowing into loudspeakers -- not to champion their new pope but to protest for increases in salaries and antipoverty benefits in a country with galloping inflation. 
At the Metropolitan Cathedral here, a steady but far from overwhelming stream of the devout and curious filed inside, where Jos de San Martn, a leader in the independence struggle against Spain, is entombed. At the entrance, some stopped before a computer-printed photograph of Francis under the words ''Habemus Papam,'' Latin for ''We have a pope.''
''We've sold almost nothing,'' said Daniel Martnez, 50, who was selling buttons with the new pontiff's picture displayed on a jersey of Argentina's national soccer team. ''If Argentina had won the World Cup, the plaza would be full. Since it's the ascension of the pope, people take it more calmly.''
Gay rights groups were far from calm in their reaction to Francis, with one organization, the Argentine Federation of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transsexuals, pointing out that he had described a plan to legalize same-sex marriage as a ''plan of the devil.'' The group called his selection as pope a ''radicalization of the Vatican's position against recognizing diverse families.''
Similarly, Len Ferrari, one of Argentina's most prominent conceptual artists, called the selection of Francis as pope a ''horror'' in an interview with the Brazilian newspaper Folha de So Paulo. In the 1990s, Francis clashed with Mr. Ferrari over an exposition of his work that included a piece depicting Jesus crucified on a United States Air Force fighter jet.
Elsewhere, however, parishioners who said their lives were changed by Francis spoke warmly of his selection. In a parish called Virgin of the Miracles of Caacup, in an area of slums in southern Buenos Aires with uncompleted brick houses along potholed alleys, a 13-year-old boy, Walter Nuez, said he was proud to know Francis.
''He would come on some Sundays and look after me,'' said Mr. Nuez, who at age 2 was adopted into a family of nine when his mother died. At age 8, he was baptized by Francis. ''He was a common man,'' he said. ''He was like all of us.''
Indeed, Francis is well known throughout Buenos Aires for his crusading work among the poor and vulnerable. The Rev. Jos Juan Cervantes, 42, said Francis began an initiative in 2008 to assist victims of human trafficking, insisting on being called Father Jorge when he came to the crime-ridden district of Constitucin each year to celebrate Mass in an open-air plaza.
One of the most biting reactions to Francis came in a statement from the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the association of women whose children were disappeared during Argentina's military dictatorship, from 1976 to 1983. The group contrasted Francis, who has long been criticized for not confronting the dictatorship, with the 150 or so other priests who were killed during the so-called Dirty War.
''About this pope they named, we have only to say, 'Amen,' '' Hebe de Bonafini, the group's president and a longstanding critic of the incoming pope, said in a statement steeped in irony.

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Artist and Visionary: William Matthew Prior Revealed' (through May 26) William Matthew Prior (1806-1873), the subject of this fascinating exhibition, painted portraits in the ''American primitive'' mode. His paintings of solemn, pie-faced tots, stiffly posed yet animated by some inner mystery, are especially compelling. But he also had the chops to paint like a well-trained academician. He was an abolitionist too. Some of his best portraits are of black people. He was also into spiritualism, and he was a savvy entrepreneur. He was, altogether, a most remarkable character. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Life, Death and Transformation in the Americas' (continuing) For generations, one of the first things visitors to Brooklyn Museum encountered was the Hall of the Americas, the two-story rotunda right off the main lobby. And when you were in it, you knew you were home. A few years ago during renovations, the museum put the Americas material in storage, but now it's back in new galleries on the fifth floor. The look is very different -- ultraminimalist Arctic white and sky blue -- but the 102 objects, from a collection that is a jewel in Brooklyn's crown, are utterly gripping. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Made from folded, twisted and linked liquor-bottle caps, El Anatsui's wall hangings are the rare large-scale works that don't make you feel small. Only after you have marveled at their intricacy and versatility does the vastness hit you. All along the nearly 33-foot-long expanse of the gloriously resplendent ''Earth's Skin'' (2009), for instance, are folds and puckers and dents and gaps and little spikes of copper wire, details that pull you in close right away and keep you there. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
The Frick Collection: 'Piero della Francesca in America' (through May 19) Reuniting six panels from an altarpiece by Piero, this ravishing show approximates an intimate quattrocento chapel in the Frick's grand Oval Room. At the center of the installation is a seventh painting, the Clark Art Institute's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels,'' which comes from a different altarpiece in the painter's hometown, Sansepolcro, and exemplifies Piero's uncanny orchestration of figures, architecture and religious symbolism. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Gutai: Splendid Playground' (through May 8) The first large, in-depth examination of Japan's best-known postwar art movement is a mind-shifting event that brings together all the mediums it encompassed, brilliantly interwoven. The eccentrically made paintings suggest that Japan produced Abstract Expressionism's strongest second generation, the artists who most convincingly and directly extended Pollock's innovative drip technique. But the show reveals little-known precedents for Happenings, Minimalism and various strains of Post-Minimalism. It should permanently dislodge any notion of postwar modernism as a strictly Western phenomenon. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Zarina: Paper Like Skin' (through April 21) ''Paper is an organic material, almost like human skin,'' the artist Zarina Hashmi has said. In her exhibition at the Guggenheim, it's that and more: paper is sculpture, poetry, currency and, above all, a kind of permanent home for a nomadic spirit. Her art speaks poignantly, though sometimes opaquely, of relocation and exile; works like the 2001 woodcut ''Dividing Line'' reference the violent 1947 partition of India and Pakistan, while ''Ten Thousand Things,'' a set of small paper collages recreating works from her oeuvre, nods to Duchamp's museum-in-a-suitcase. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423 3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia' (through May 22) American museums are increasingly collecting contemporary art from outside the Western Hemisphere, and the Guggenheim, supported by the financial corporation UBS is leading the pack. This inaugural show in the acquisitions campaign highlights work from South and Southeast Asia. Certain artists -- like Amar Kanwar, from India, and Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, from Thailand -- have international reputations. Others, like the sculptor Tang Da Wu, from Singapore, and the painter Aung Myint, Myanmar, both born in 1940s, are less familiar. Nearly all the work of the roughly two dozen artists refers in partisan, political and personal ways to specific histories. The inclusion of those histories in our art museums is long, long overdue. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
Jewish Museum: 'Sharon Lockhart/Noa Eshkol' (through March 24) Sharon Lockhart's film installation is based on the dances by Noa Eshkol (1924-2007), a little-known (in this country) Israeli choreographer who, along with the architect Avraham Wachman, developed a system that uses numbers and symbols to record body movement. Ms. Lockhart's photographs are of spherical models designed by Ms. Eshkol and Mr. Wachman; ephemera include actual notation, posters announcing Ms. Eshkol's performances and historical photographs. Textile works on display upstairs were made by Ms. Eshkol later in her life. The total functions as a new project by Ms. Lockhart and as a two-person exhibition, a combination of homage and appropriation that both recuperates a ''forgotten'' artist and respectfully presents her work and ideas, while simultaneously mining them to create a new body of artwork. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity (through May 27) The title may suggest a double-dose of pandering, but the show itself is a stunning combination of great paintings, ravishing gowns, historical clarity and pitch-perfect contextualizing. Demonstrating how the Impressionists and more conservative painters alike used the latest fashions to define their sitters as real people, it builds fascinating webs of new information and viewpoints around some of the best-known, most beloved paintings of all time, quite a few of which don't often travel to this country. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Path of Nature: French Paintings from the Wheelock Whitney Collection, 1785-1850' (through April 21) ''Sparkle with repose'' was the effect the British artist John Constable said he was after in his landscapes. His French contemporaries had the same idea. Today, Constable's a star. But Len Pallire? Adrien Dauzats? Alexandre-Hyacinthe Dunouy? Only wonkish scholars are likely to know their names. Lucky for them, and for us, that one of those scholars is Whitney Wheelock III, who has a passion for French art from the years between neo-classicism and Romanticism, and a special love for gleaming little oil sketches done out of doors. In 2003 he gave his pictures to the Met, where 50 of them, along with some exquisitely funky genre paintings, make up this small gem of a show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
MoMA PS1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Jeff Elrod: Nobody Sees Like Us' (through April 1) Using a title that gives anyone involved with art something to live up to, this computer-prone painter abandons his characteristic off-kilter geometries for four allover paintings of soft, smoky wafts of green, brown or gray whose fuzzy, camouflagelike patterns refuse to come into focus. Installed one to a wall in a small, pristinely white gallery, they form an environment whose visual cross-fire makes the act of seeing thrillingly visceral. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Huma Bhabha: Unnatural Histories' (through April 1) In this midcareer survey, long-enduring forms from the ancient world lend some gravity to the throwaway materials that are now commonplace in contemporary sculpture. You could also say that the precariousness of recent assemblage and installation art haunts Ms. Bhabha's monstrous, totemic figures, which are typically made of Styrofoam, clay, rubber, wood scraps and wire mesh; either way, the juxtaposition is arresting. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: Tender Love Among the Junk' (through April 1) Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt makes luminous art out of trash: candy wrappers, cling wrap, reflective plastics, aluminum foil, plastic bottles, beer cans and too many other kinds of cheap refuse to list. As this four-decade retrospective reveals, his devotion to his materials and hobbylike processes has yielded an oeuvre of transcending beauty, eroticized religiosity and poignant autobiography. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Drawing Surrealism' (through April 21) This sensational show of 165 works by 70 artists from 15 countries traces the movement from its early automatist stirrings to the doorstep of Abstract Expressionism. Expanding the field of players with numerous new names, it also has a wonderful clarity, organized according to the techniques that the Surrealists commandeered (collage and photography), breathed life into (frottage, decalcomania and exquisite corpse) and frequently crossbred. It may be among the best encapsulations of Surrealism you will ever see. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Degas, Miss La La and the Cirque Fernando' (through May 12) Viewers catching their first glimpse of ''Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando'' will tend to agree with an early Degas biographer who called the painting ''one of his most surprising canvases.'' But after a close look at this curious 1879 picture of an aerialist hanging from a rope by her teeth (on loan from the National Gallery in London, and displayed with related studies, sketchbooks, circus programs and other ephemera), they will recognize Degas's skeptical eye and classical perspective on modern entertainment. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Artist's Choice: Trisha Donnelly' (through April 8) The 10th artist invited to select an exhibition from the Modern's collection does the series proud. Installed in three far-flung galleries within the museum's vaunted painting and sculpture collection, her effort disturbs the march of masterworks by concentrating on photographs, drawings and other works on paper as well as several kinds of design. At every turn it asks what is art, who is an artist and what makes for greatness? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (through April 15) The pursuit of the holy grail of early modernism at its most feverish is presented as a multiple-medium, multinational effort in this dizzying, magisterial cornucopia. The 350-plus works by 84 artists encompass painting, sculpture, music, poetry, dance, film and photography; alternate between the tentative and the prescient; and capture something of both the terrors and thrills of the project, with clusters of paintings by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian among the high points. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Projects 99: Meiro Koizumi' (through May 6) It would be hard to find another work of contemporary art that protests war with such soulful grace as Meiro Koizumi's ''Defect in Vision'' (2011), the main attraction of this small show. This 12-minute, black-and-white video dramatizes a final conversation between a kamikaze pilot and his wife, both of whom are blind, as they eat together in a small, old-world-style dining room. It is a riveting meditation on the doomed, myth-saturated mind of Japan's warrior class in the last days of World War II. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.

Neue Galerie: 'German Expressionism 1900-1930: Masterpieces From the Neue Galerie Collection' (through April 22) German Expressionism was a messy, complicated movement, with numerous stylistic and philosophical variations. It's not easily corralled into a tidy overview, despite the best efforts of the Neue Galerie in this collection show. The installation sorts everything into two groups, using the rubrics of ''primitivism'' and ''modernity.'' ''Primitivism'' seems to mean the gallery of jarringly bright, vigorously brushy paintings by members of the Brcke and the Blaue Reiter; under ''modernity'' are Neue Sachlichkeit portraits by Otto Dix, George Grosz, Christian Schad and others, made with caustic humor and an eye for the grotesque. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' (through May 26) History is written by the winners, which in contemporary art usually means the market. It's often also written by people who weren't on the scene and have to take the winners' word for what happened and what mattered. Such is the case with this retrospective show that too often favors the currently best-selling survivors of a fraught era over many now less well-known on-the-ground players. There's good art here, but the spirit of a furiously skeptical utopian moment -- very high, very low -- rarely breaks through the institutional nostalgia. And the chance to probe some market myths -- exactly how political was that 1993 ''political'' Whitney Biennial? -- is lost. Like all surveys of the immediate past, ''NYC 1993'' will get everyone kvetching, and it's a must-see, if only to find ways to bring the story into the present differently. Nari Ward's 1993 installation ''Amazing Grace'' in the New Museum's next-door space is for the ages. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through March 31) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org; folkartmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sinister Pop' and 'Dark and Deadpan: Pop in TV and the Movies' (through March 31) The dark and truculent mood of this collection show is conversant with recent presentations of Warhol's death-and-disaster paintings, but the curators make plenty of room for other artists (including photographers). The point is not to cast a pall over Pop as we know it; it's to find common ground between the winking consumerism of early-1960s art and the antiwar, anti-corporate sentiment of work made later in the decade and into the 1970s. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Blues for Smoke' (through April 28) As a musical category blues is hard to pin down, and this show makes the job harder, which seems to be its point. It's saying: blues isn't a thing; it's a set of feelings, a state of mind, maybe a state of grace. In origin, it's African-American, developing with gospel and jazz, and folding into R&B, funk and hip-hop. But it has long since become a transethnic, transcultural phenomenon bigger than music, an enveloping aesthetic that includes art. And when you have art by the likes of Zoe Leonard, Kerry James Marshall, Rachel Harrison, Martin Wong, William Pope.L, Alma Thomas, Wu Tsang and David Hammons, you cannot go wrong. Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum: 'Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective' (through June 2) The American artist DeFeo, who died in 1989 at 60, is famous for a single work, a gargantuan painting -- nearly 12 feet tall -- called ''The Rose,'' which she labored on exhaustingly for eight years, even after it had been extracted out of her San Francisco studio with a forklift. In the absence of other evidence, many people tend to see the piece as the sum of her accomplishment, but to this view the Whitney's tenderly shaped and visually absorbing survey says: No. There's more, and different. ''The Rose'' may have been the pivot point of her career -- DeFeo herself said as much -- but streams of inventive, if less spectacular work, work flowed toward it and from it.

Galleries: Uptown
Yishai Jusidman: 'Prussian Blue -- Memory After Representation' (through March 23) These well-made, photo-based paintings render various gas chambers built at Nazi concentration camps in shades of Prussian blue. They exemplify the kind of obvious, emotionally manipulative work that functions more as an editorial than as art; seems generated by little personal necessity; borrows liberally from other artists and ubiquitous tropes; and tends to clog far too many overly earnest international exhibitions. Their perfection as symptoms of some of the least interesting tendencies of our time makes them worth seeing. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 249-8950, as-coa.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Miroslaw Balka: 'The Order of Things' (through March 30) The single rousingly portentous sculpture here involves black liquid continually gushing from suspended, industrial-size hoses into a pair of giant bins made of rusty steel plate. Since its title refers to a book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, you know that big ideas are afoot. Maybe it is an allegory of the mindlessly self-perpetuating machinery driving modern civilization. Something like that. Gladstone, 530 West 21st Street, (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Jean-Michel Basquiat' (through April 6) It is not true that only the good die young, but Jean-Michel Basquiat did at 27 in 1988. He was not only good; at his best he was one of the most original artists of his generation. If that sounds like an extravagant claim, have a look at the high-quality selection of 59 of his bristling, faux-primitive paintings in this show. There is not a lot of art from the '80s that feels this alive today. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Johnson)
Alighiero Boetti: 'La Forza del Centro' (through March 23) This splendid show presents some of the most intensely eye-catching of all Conceptual artworks: numerous examples of the vivid embroidered arazzi -- word squares -- that Boetti commissioned from Afghani embroiderers in an attempt to collapse time, space and cultural difference. The grid, blocky letters, radiant colors (chosen by the embroiderers) and Persian calligraphy provide the structure within which the artist and his collaborators find an inspiring variety of hue, meaning and form. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com. (Smith)
Damien Hirst: 'The Spot Woodcuts' (through March 23) If anyone has a hankering for more of the British bad boy's spot paintings -- anyone? -- this sweet little show of 41 woodcuts from 2011-12 may suffice. Made with wood cylinders, inked with color and fastened into a matrix, they have a modesty and sparkle quite different from their canvas cousins, as does this tiny gallery from the Gagosian franchise. And you can see the whole show from the street. Carolina Nitsch Project Room, 534 West 22nd Street, (212) 645-2030, carolinanitsch.com. (Smith)
Ragnar Kjartansson: 'The Visitors' (through March 23) Bonhomie and nihilism go hand in hand in ''The Visitors,'' a recent video installation by this talented Icelandic performance artist. Divided among nine channels, it shows Mr. Kjartansson and eight friends making music at the endearingly scruffy mansion Rokeby Farm, in the Hudson Valley. Despite its vaguely melancholy refrain, repeated over the course of an hour, the piece evolves into a mellow jam session that's almost indistinguishable from its charmingly run-down setting. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100 luhringaugustine.com. (Rosenberg)
Anthony McCall: 'Face to Face' (through March 23) ''Face to Face'' updates a series of ''solid light'' films for which the British artist became known in the 1970s. In a dark room, two projectors cast simple, slowly morphing compositions of bright white lines on two suspended screens. Ambient haze from a fog machine gives the projected rays a spectral, crystalline solidity, as if they were made of diaphanous fabric. Downstairs in the gallery a video installation called ''Circulation Figures'' captures the narcissism of mass-mediated culture and society. Sean Kelly Gallery, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 239-1181, skny.com. (Johnson)
'Rptition II' (through March 23) Perhaps the French title accounts for meditative mood of this beautifully installed show of mostly Minimalist sculpture. The idea of repetition has different results in the fluorescent tubes of Dan Flavin's corner pieces; Jennifer Bartlett's early gridded dot-painting; the moisture bubbles inside Hans Haacke's coy ''Condensation Cube''; and Douglas Huebler's banded S-curve ''Truro Series #1.'' Unusual works by Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Joel Shapiro and Sol LeWitt round out the bill. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Dieter Roth. Bjrn Roth (through April 13) Concentrating on the collaborations of the Swiss-German maverick Dieter Roth (1930-98) and his son Bjorn, this sprawling show adds a veneer of class to the inauguration of Chelsea's latest oversize trophy gallery. Numerous large, messy works noisily navigate the border between art and life. But the best does so quietly: the 128-monitor video piece ''Solo Scenes'' simply records the elder Roth living out life in his studio-home in Basel.

&#x2605; 'Frozen Lakes' (through March 24) The 1977 ''Pictures'' show at Artists Space caught a trend in the bud, with work based on images pulled, with cool detachment, from films, television and magazines. ''Frozen Lakes'' is ''Pictures'' updated for the digital age. Pop culture, drama and coolness are still in play, but the source for much of the imagery is now the Internet. And the emphasis is less on where the images come from than on where they're going and how: everywhere, in continuous data streams. Among the several interesting young artists, Ed Atkins, Charlotte Prodger and James Richards are standouts. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org.

'Beat Memories: The Photographs of Allen Ginsberg' (through April 6) During two periods in his life -- from the early 1950s to about 1964 and from the early '80s until his death in 1997 -- the poet Allen Ginsberg made photographs and added handwritten captions. Images of his now famous pals, including the writers Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and Gregory Corso, as well as Neal Cassady, their logorrheic muse, make this show required viewing for Beat fans.

'I Killed My Father, I Ate Human Flesh, I Quiver With Joy: An Obsession With Pier Paolo Pasolini' (through March 23) It's been a good season for Pasolini. A MoMA film retrospective in December coincided with an out-of-the-blue show of his little-seen portrait paintings at Location One in SoHo. Now, as a kicker, Allegra LaViola delivers a group tribute to an artist, poet and radical populist who was allergic to authority, wore his homosexuality like a badge, made work that was hellish and heavenly, and died a violent death at 53.

&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

Out of Town
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh, Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Portland Museum of Art: 'Lois Dodd: Catching the Light' (through April 7) This modest, but revelatory exhibition pays overdue tribute to an artist who has spent some 60 years quietly painting her immediate surroundings with an insistent, sometimes daring economy and a startling range of brushwork and styles, from nearly trompe-l'eoil to nearly abstract. A wonderful understanding of color and light provide some of the through lines, as does an attraction to nature, homey architecture and windows, and a conviction that pictorial space is one of painting's central materials and great mysteries. Seven Congress Square, (207) 775-6148, portlandmuseum.org. (Smith)
Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through April 28) On the surface, this probing, perspective-altering exhibition, one of many events commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, looks straightforward, even ordinary. We know most of the paintings and photographs on sight; they're classics. What we know less well is their meaning within the context of the nation's single greatest internal catastrophe, and that's what the show is about. It travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art this spring, running from May 21 to Sept. 2. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos. Eighth and F Streets NW, Washington, (202) 633-1000, americanart.si.edu. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

&#x2605; 'Christopher Crozier' (closes on Saturday) In the deft, subtle, emblematic drawings and prints that make up his New York gallery solo, ''In Development,'' the Trinidadian artist Christopher Crozier draws on images from his home city, Port of Spain, presenting it as a place that lives in a troubled past and present. References to colonialism and street crime float against openwork decorative patterns based on the ubiquitous concrete ''breeze bricks'' that let sea winds flow through houses in the island's burgeoning suburbs. And against the relentless tide of new building, a lone tree stands firm. David Krut Projects, 526 West 26th Street, No. 816, Chelsea, (212) 255-3094, davidkrut.com. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Walt Kuhn: 'American Modern' (closes on Saturday) The 100th anniversary of the Armory Show has occasioned a fresh look at Walt Kuhn, an organizer of the 1913 show whose own paintings have been somewhat marginalized. It includes several large-scale figure paintings on loan from museums and is accompanied by a full catalog. ''Sleeping Girl,'' a portrait of an exhausted dancer slumped over her dressing table (from the Ogunquit Museum of American Art), adds a starkly outlined, Matisse-like body to a head we recognize from Brancusi's ''Sleeping Muse.'' Here too are later paintings of entertainers, dancers and clowns, the sort of popular, down-to-earth subject matter that Kuhn liked to call ''buckeye'' and others have seen as kitsch. DC Moore, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 247-2111, dcmooregallery.com. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Matisse: In Search of True Painting' (closes on Sunday) This stunning exhibition skims across the great French modernist's long, productive career with a mere 49 stellar, often pivotal paintings arranged in pairs or groups according to subject. Examining his penchant for working in series and copying his own canvases, they shed new light on the arduous evolution of Matisse's seemingly effortless art, forming one of the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions about the artist, or painting in general, that you may ever see. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
MoMA PS1: 'Cyprien Gaillard: The Crystal World' (closes on Monday) Romantic ennui suffuses the films of this French artist, whose ''Desniansky Raion,'' on view in this show, was one of the hits of the New Museum's ''Younger Than Jesus'' exhibition in 2009. He is a canny player with postmodern aesthetics, semiotics and technology, but a pessimist about human civilization. The main event here is ''Artefacts,'' a montage of scenes shot by Mr. Gaillard using his iPhone in the Babylon province of Iraq and at the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. It is a stylishly bleak meditation on empire, entropy and archaeology. (On Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m., Mr. Gaillard will participate in a discussion that is being presented as part of MoMA PS1's Sunday Sessions series.) 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
Larry Poons: 'New Paintings' (closes on Saturday) Half of a two-gallery show is better than none in the case of this maverick formalist's recent efforts. Four paintings left up past the original closing date attest to his latest version of ''allover'' surface compositions, painted one relatively free-standing stroke at a time using myriad colors. You expect to see nymphs and satyrs, or maybe Vuillard's mother, to emerge from the turbulent thickets, but the curling, leaping marks remain their elaborately allusive selves, at once finicky and free and altogether engrossing. Danese, 525-531 West 26th Street, fourth floor, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227, danese.com. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Boehner Stands Firm On Spending and Taxes

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Speaker John A. Boehner said Thursday that election losses last November would not deter his party from pressing its vision of reducing the size of government and turning government health care programs largely over to the private sector -- with no more tax increases.
In an interview, Mr. Boehner said that candidates and personalities -- not Republican proposals on Medicare and spending cuts -- accounted for the party's defeats, taking a hard line on further budget talks even as Senate Republicans met with President Obama in a search for common ground.
''There are a lot of things that decide an election, especially the two candidates that you have, the personalities that they have, positions they have taken,'' he said.
''There are a lot of factors that went into that election,'' he added. ''I don't know that that's the issue. Eighty percent of the American people think that Washington has a spending problem.'' 
The speaker's tough stance on differences with the president came as Mr. Obama pursued his outreach to Congressional Republicans, this time in the Senate. For almost an hour and a half, the president and Senate Republicans jousted cordially on entitlement spending, the Keystone XL pipeline, the White House's role on immigration proposals and whether an overhaul of the tax code should generate more revenues through higher taxes or only economic growth.
Neither side offered concrete movement toward the other, but the president and Senate Republicans agreed they had a narrow window -- perhaps through July -- to reach an accord, and both sides agreed to try.
''I specifically said, to get to a big deal you have to work with us. You have to grind it out with us until we get there. You can't break off and say, 'Oh, Congress has to do it,' '' said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, who added that Republicans and the president agreed the window would most likely close by July. That is when Republicans could pick a fight over the debt ceiling and when Mr. Obama said the politics of the midterm elections would begin to take hold.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, also struck a conciliatory note in an interview, saying she was open to examining a change in the way the government calculates inflation to slow the growth of Social Security and other benefit programs, while slowly boosting tax revenues.
That tone contrasted sharply with the direction House Republicans are taking. Although Mr. Boehner expressed some hope that the divided Congress could reach a deficit accord, he gave little indication that Mr. Obama's overtures to House Republicans had yielded tangible movement.
Mr. Boehner also put the failure of his private budget talks with the president squarely on the White House's shoulders, saying that avenue toward agreement was now closed.
''I gave the president my bottom line, and he didn't budge off it,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''We offered to continue to have the talks. It was the White House who said, 'Well, there isn't really any reason to.' ''
The House budget, which will come for a vote in the next week, seeks to bring taxes and spending into balance within 10 years, largely by rolling back key measures from the president's first term. It would repeal his health insurance exchanges and expansion of Medicaid, but retain cuts to Medicare that the Republican presidential ticket, Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, spent months denouncing.
It would maintain the level of taxation secured by increases on the wealthy in the January deal to resolve the so-called fiscal cliff. But it also says the top tax rate should fall to 25 percent from 39.6 percent, with the cost offset by eliminating undisclosed tax deductions, credits and loopholes. And it assumes the repeal of Mr. Obama's Wall Street regulatory bill. Medicaid, food stamps and other programs for the poor would be cut significantly, part of $4.6 trillion in cuts through 2023.
''The budget is an opportunity to lay out your priorities, what your party believes in, and that's exactly what our budget does,'' Mr. Boehner said.
It was not clear, however, how those priorities are to be meshed with a Senate Democratic budget that would expand spending on infrastructure, raise taxes and still end up with a budget deficit of $566 billion at the end of the 10-year window.
''His budget was roundly defeated last November,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said of the Republican plan, drafted by Mr. Ryan. ''I can't imagine why they don't get a new dance step here.''
Ms. Pelosi did suggest that there was some Democratic latitude on the biggest issue for Republicans: changes to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. She repeated her resolute opposition to raising the Medicare eligibility age. But she said she would look at changing the way the government calculates inflation, while raising tax revenue over time. ''I want a debate in our caucus,'' she said. ''There are views, some of them on the progressive side of the spectrum, who think that this can be done without hurting the poor or the very elderly.''
Mr. Obama assured Senate Republicans that a decision on the Keystone pipeline would come ''within months, not years,'' senators said, offering criticism that environmentalists had overstated its potential impact. They discussed at length whether a tax code overhaul would provide the economic boost the president needs to jump-start tax receipts -- with overall tax increases.
The president offered lavish praise for his 2008 rival, Senator John McCain from Arizona, on the 40th anniversary of Mr. McCain's release from a Vietnamese prisoner of war camp, a moment that drew warm applause.
Mr. Obama told the gathering that they received him more warmly than their House counterparts did. ''He mentioned -- well, joked -- about it being a more genteel environment,'' said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona.
But Democratic olive branches are going to require a reciprocal gesture from the Republicans, the president told them, and Mr. Boehner made no such offer.
In a meeting later with House Democrats, Mr. Obama acknowledged the realities of a divided government, saying, ''We're obviously going to have to talk about some things that we don't particularly like,'' according to Representative Peter Welch of Vermont. ''It was a dose of reality,'' Mr. Welch said, adding that he reassured them, ''We're not going to chase a bad deal.''
Mr. Boehner said Republicans had already allowed $650 billion in new taxes and would not agree to more. Nonetheless, he expressed guarded optimism that the House and Senate could eventually come together. ''Maybe something comes out of it,'' he said. ''Hope springs eternal.''

HEADLINE: Study Shows Increase In Mothers Who Say They Want Full-Time Work

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
A Pew Research Center report released Thursday found that nearly one in three Americans mothers last year said they would prefer a full-time job, up from one in five in 2007. The lead researcher, Kim Parker, cited the 2007-9 recession as the likely factor, adding that fewer women said they wanted to work full time before the downturn. Pew's findings are based in part on its survey of 2,511 adults nationwide in late 2012. About half of women who struggled financially said working full time was ideal, compared with about 31 percent of those who said they live comfortably, the report said.

HEADLINE: Upstate Man Who Fatally Shot 4 Dies in Standoff; Motive Remains Unclear

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY and MARC SANTORA; Jesse McKinley reported from Albany, and Marc Santora from New York. Jamie Larson contributed reporting from Herkimer, N.Y., and Mohawk, N.Y.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The last 24 hours of Kurt R. Myers's life were punctuated by barrages of bullets.
The first two came on Wednesday morning when Mr. Myers, a gray-bearded 64-year-old armed with a shotgun, walked into two businesses in the neighboring upstate towns of Herkimer and Mohawk and shot six people, seemingly at random. Four died, and two others were seriously injured. In the final fusillade the next morning, Mr. Myers was shot and killed by a team of state and federal officers who had tracked him to an abandoned bar on Herkimer's main thoroughfare.
But very little was clear on Thursday about Mr. Myers's motivation for the attack or his life before it. His presence in the two towns where he killed was described as shadowy and somewhat antisocial, but with few interactions with law enforcement, except for a 1973 arrest for drunken driving, or other signs of trouble.
''He was apparently a loner,'' the State Police superintendent, Joseph D'Amico, said. ''He didn't have a lot of contact with his family.'' 
Mr. D'Amico added that officials had interviewed relatives and neighbors but that ''nobody could offer any explanation.''
Carolyn Tooke, a former landlady of Mr. Myers, said he largely kept to himself during the decade-long period he was her tenant.
''He was very quiet,'' Ms. Tooke said. ''And I know people say that about shooters, but that's what he was like.''
As a younger man, Mr. Myers took a job operating machines at the Waterbury Felt mill, which is in Oriskany, about 20 miles west of Herkimer in the Mohawk River Valley. A former mill colleague, Steve Copperwheat, told The Associated Press that Mr. Myers had been ''very distant'' during a recent chance encounter.
''The whole conversation was really spooky,'' Mr. Copperwheat said.
Mr. Myers was believed to be unemployed at the time of the shooting, Mr. D'Amico said, and to live alone in a small apartment at the rear of a brick building in Mohawk. He left no note there or anywhere else explaining his actions, Mr. D'Amico said.
Niki Day, 28, a bartender at the Side Street bar, near Mr. Myers's home, said he was an occasional daytime visitor there, drinking light beer, sitting alone and humming loudly to the music. His one upsetting quirk, she said, was a kind of vocal tic where he would speak in a singsong manner, before chirping ''Pretty girl'' at Ms. Day.
''It was a little weird,'' she said.
Mr. D'Amico said that he had no information on Mr. Myers's mental health history, but that he was apparently cogent enough to avoid several attempts to force him from his hide-out in the darkened, debris-strewn bar, shielding himself from tear gas in a small back room.
He did not make any effort to flee, Mr. D'Amico said, and after a frigid overnight standoff, officials said that they had decided to move in on Thursday morning.
Jack L. Keller, a state trooper, said Mr. Myers was armed with the same shotgun he used on Wednesday. And when SWAT and F.B.I. officers burst into the room, Mr. Myers opened fire, killing an F.B.I. dog, Ape, before being killed by officers. No other weapons were recovered.
The mayhem in Mohawk and Herkimer came as the issue of gun violence percolates nationally, after the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., as well as in New York State, where a Christmastime attack in another upstate community, Webster, left two firefighters dead.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who signed a gun-control bill in January that expanded a ban on assault weapons and limited high-capacity ammunition magazines, was on site in Herkimer shortly after the attacks on Wednesday and later offered condolences.
''It is now time for mourning those who we lost in this senseless act of violence,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Thursday.
At a news conference shortly after the raid, Mr. D'Amico said that it did not appear that the weapon Mr. Myers used was registered with the state, but that the current law did not require such a registration because it was a shotgun. This part of central New York is considered gun-friendly; the Remington Arms Company is nearby, in Ilion.
Like the attack in Webster, in which the gunman set a fire to lure law enforcement into an ambush, Mr. Myers also set his home ablaze. In Mr. Myers's case, however, he drove to a local barbershop in Mohawk, where he shot four people. They included John Seymour, a longtime fixture in the community, who is expected to survive.
Richard Monahan, of the Mohawk American Legion post, said Mr. Seymour was active in the town, sometimes working as a volunteer D.J. at community events. Another acquaintance of Mr. Seymour, Ernestine Keeler, of Mohawk, said she could not imagine that the attack was motivated by a grudge of any sort.
''I never heard him say a bad word about anyone,'' Ms. Keeler said of Mr. Seymour.
Minutes after the barbershop shooting, Mr. Myers moved to a car service center in Herkimer, where he killed two men, including a veteran of the state corrections department. But Mr. D'Amico said there did not immediately appear to be a connection between law enforcement and the attack.
''We think they were unprovoked and random,'' he said of the shootings.
The Herkimer police chief, Joseph Malone, said that the fast-unfolding violence, and a gunman on the loose, had ''overwhelmed instantly'' his small village department, and required ''a small army'' of state and other law enforcement help.
The chaos had its denouement in a three-story building on Main Street in Herkimer, where Mr. Myers had abandoned his car and found his way into the defunct tavern called Glory Days. Mr. D'Amico said he had no idea why Mr. Myers had chosen that location for his last stand.
On Thursday afternoon, broken glass and wood littered the sidewalk in front of Glory Days. Across the river in Mohawk, meanwhile, a dozen people sat at the American Legion hall digesting the events of the last two days. Leo Kinville, 64, former mayor of Mohawk, said he knew several of the men who were shot and was still in shock.
''You couldn't believe this would happen here,'' he said.
Other residents said they were simply glad that Mr. Myers's 24 hours of terror had ended, though with bloodshed.
''It's devastating, it's fearful, and thank goodness they got him,'' said Ms. Tooke, his former landlady. ''You don't like to think of anyone you know being a murderer.''

HEADLINE: Divisions in G.O.P. Are Laid Bare on First Day of Conservative Conference

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
OXON HILL, Md. -- The largest annual gathering of Republican activists began here Thursday with appearances by rival presidential hopefuls offering their party starkly different paths back to prominence -- and diagnoses of what ails it -- after last fall's demoralizing losses.
''We don't need any new ideas,'' Senator Marco Rubio of Florida told a room packed with cheering grass-roots activists, anticipating what he predicted would be liberal critiques of his remarks. ''The idea is called America, and it still works.'' 
Speaking immediately after him, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky declared, ''The G.O.P. of old has grown stale and moss-covered.'' A ''new G.O.P.,'' he said, ''will need to embrace liberty in both the economic and the personal sphere.''
The yearly assembly of the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, is a showcase of the Republican Party's top presidential prospects, whose reception before a crowd of critical, future primary voters and volunteers is watched carefully by party leaders, donors and news media handicappers.
The conclave, held by the American Conservative Union, is typically at its least consequential four years before the next presidential campaign. But this year it has taken on more significance as Republicans undertake examinations of how to improve their prospects in 2014 and 2016 and activists seek new reasons for optimism at the start of President Obama's second term.
''Where I live it's a pretty conservative area,'' said Janet Crow, a Tea Party activist from Conway, Ark. ''And we are concerned about the future of where the country's going.''
Antipathy for Mr. Obama and his agenda appeared to be a baseline requirement for entree to the speakers' list at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center here.
Two Republican governors were left off the guest list after perceived ideological breaches: Chris Christie of New Jersey, who drew conservative ire for embracing Mr. Obama after Hurricane Sandy and recently accepted federal money for an extension of Medicaid, and Bob McDonnell of Virginia, a star of last year's gathering who recently backed a road improvement program that included tax increases.
Al Cardenas, the Conservative Union president, told reporters that organizers concluded that Mr. Christie had not earned a spot in the ''all star'' program because of ''decisions he made,'' but that he could be invited next year. Mr. Cardenas dismissed the notion that Mr. McDonnell's absence was based on ideological considerations.
Mr. Paul and Mr. Rubio, the most anticipated speakers on Thursday, displayed differences as bare as those within the party at large. Mr. Rubio called for a reassertion of the traditional, Reagan-era values of limited government at home while Mr. Paul called for a more libertarian approach that would shrink America's role in the world.
Mr. Rubio, whose Cuban-American heritage is a perceived strength after the party's huge losses last year among Hispanic voters, did not dwell on his proposals to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, which include a path to citizenship for those here illegally. (The crowd's reaction to the general notion of a road to citizenship for illegal immigrants seemed to range from lukewarm to hostile.)
Instead, Mr. Rubio offered a new defense of the party's longstanding strain of social conservatism, saying that ''just because I believe states should have the right to define marriage in a traditional way does not make me a bigot.''
In contrast, Mr. Paul gave a nod to easing penalties for illegal drug use, which is anathema to many traditional, law-and-order Republicans but is popular among younger voters the party has struggled to reach.
''Ask the Facebook generation whether we should put a kid in jail for the nonviolent crime of drug use and you'll hear a resounding 'No,' '' said Mr. Paul, who arrived on the stage to Metallica's ''Enter Sandman,'' adding a sense of youth to his appearance (although the song is more than 20 years old).
He appeared to take a jab at the Republicans' 2008 presidential nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who had indirectly referred to Mr. Paul and his like-minded colleagues as ''wacko birds'' for their filibuster against Mr. Obama's C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan.
After Mr. Paul said the party had become ''stale and moss-covered,'' he added archly, ''I don't think we need to name any names, do we?''

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Lawyer Is Named to Rescue Detroit From Fiscal Disaster

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting from Detroit, and Steven Yaccino from Chicago.

 BODY:
A veteran lawyer who once worked on Chrysler's bankruptcy has been handed what may prove to be his toughest case yet: to bring Detroit back from the edge of financial collapse.
Michigan officials on Thursday appointed the lawyer, Kevyn Orr, a partner in the Jones Day law firm, as an emergency manager to oversee operations in Detroit, one of the largest cities to ever receive such intervention.
''This is the Olympics of restructuring,'' Mr. Orr said during a news conference in Detroit as he stood near Gov. Rick Snyder, who chose him, and Mayor Dave Bing, who, like all city officials in such situations, will be forced to cede significant powers to Mr. Orr under the state's plan to save the city. 
Mr. Orr described Detroit's problems, which include annual cash shortages, about $14 billion in long-term liabilities, and complaints by residents that broken streetlights are not replaced and that the police do not respond to calls -- as ''very challenging.'' But he also struck an upbeat tone, saying that he hopes to someday reflect back on having participated in one of the nation's ''greatest turnarounds.''
Oversight boards and receivers have for decades been assigned to help shore up some of the nation's most financially troubled cities, and more than 20 state emergency managers have been assigned in Michigan over the last quarter century. But the challenges -- political, racial and economic -- of running a city like Detroit are immense. Its problems, arising in part by the decline of the American auto industry and the resulting loss of more than half of Detroit's population, have been decades in the making. But an emergency manager could get as little as 18 months to fix them.
''I think it'd be like a double root canal,'' Pat O'Keefe, a Detroit-area financial consultant who has dealt with municipal turnarounds, said of the assignment.
Under a revised state law governing emergency managers that will go into effect on March 28, the same week that Mr. Orr is to begin his job, he will be granted sweeping powers to remake the city's financial plan, change labor contracts and sell city assets. He will make $275,000 a year, nearly all of it paid by the state, and may choose to hire staff to be paid for by the city. Many of his decisions will trump those of elected officials, although some leaders -- most notably Mr. Bing -- have indicated a willingness to collaborate with Mr. Orr.
Despite Mr. Orr's legal background, he said he hoped the city would not ultimately need to file for bankruptcy. Municipal bankruptcies are rare, but it was lost on no one that the state had selected an expert in bankruptcy law for Detroit, as opposed to a financial accountant, former city manager or elected official. Under Michigan law, a city can file for bankruptcy only under certain conditions, including if an emergency manager has attempted other measures and concluded that such a move is needed.
For now, Mr. Orr said he was hopeful that he could move quickly, perhaps faster than expected. Solutions, he said, can come ''as quickly as anybody is ready to make a deal.''
Mr. Orr's appointment, which had been many months in the making, drew mixed and sometimes muted reactions in Detroit. The City Council, which had contested the governor's decision to bring in an emergency manager, decided in a closed-door session on Thursday not to pursue its challenge further, said Charles Pugh, the council's president, though he added that legal challenges by other groups remained possible.
Mr. Orr was praised for his experience with financially troubled businesses and for overseeing bankruptcies and guiding restructurings. He also has worked at federal agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
He was also part of a legal team involved in bankruptcy proceedings on behalf of Chrysler in 2009, and he pointed to the resurgence of American automakers as a good omen for Detroit. He said he was resigning his post at Jones Day, where he was recently named to lead the firm's new Miami office.
Mr. Orr, 54, who received his law degree from the University of Michigan and has served as chairman of his law firm's diversity task force, is black -- a fact that some in Detroit, whose population is nearly 83 percent black, said was likely to temper the racial tension that many anticipated after Mr. Snyder declared the financial emergency.
Outside the building where Mr. Orr was being introduced, a group of protesters chanted and marched in the cold, one carrying a sign in the shape of a coffin that read: ''RIP They Are Killing Detroit Over Our Dead Bodies.''
Critics have said that the state's intervention is an undemocratic seizure of power. ''Fundamentally, this is unconstitutional,'' said Josh Mack, a retiree who was among the protesters.
But Mayor Bing, who had contended that the city did not require an outside manager but accepted that Mr. Orr's appointment had grown inevitable, said residents were no longer particularly interested in who was in charge.
''I don't think that they care at this point who the mayor is or who the City Council is,'' Mr. Bing said on Thursday. ''They want things fixed.''
Diane Markus, a Detroit resident who works as a receptionist, briefly watched the protests. ''The City Council had a long time to do something, but what did they do?'' she said. ''I mean, I don't like this, but maybe something good will come out if it.''

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims at a 5-Year Low

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans who filed new claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week for a third consecutive week. The figure came in below the expectations of analysts and was the latest indication that the labor market recovery was gaining traction. 
Other data on Thursday showed that an increase in the cost of gasoline last month pushed up producer prices, but a lack of broad price pressures gives the Federal Reserve scope to maintain its easy monetary policy.
The report on jobless claims added to a range of data -- in areas like retail sales, manufacturing and employment -- that suggested higher taxes were having a limited impact on the economy.
''The recent labor market data signal at least steady, and potentially improving, job growth so far in 2013 despite the implementation of various forms of fiscal tightening,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 last week, the Labor Department said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected first-time applications to rise to 350,000.
The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of trends in the labor market, fell to a five-year low.
While the signs of strength in the jobs market could intensify an already lively debate at the Fed on the future course of monetary policy, economists said the central bank was unlikely to scale back its monetary stimulus.
The Fed's policy makers meet next week to assess the economy and are widely expected to keep buying $85 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities a month in an effort to spur even stronger economic growth. They have said the Fed would keep buying bonds until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.
A second report from the Labor Department offered little reason to worry about an uptick in inflation, with wholesale food prices almost reversing January's increase and the cost of automobiles rising only marginally.
But gasoline prices jumped 7.2 percent last month, enough to push the Producer Price Index up a relatively steep 0.7 percent after a 0.2 percent advance in January. In the 12 months through February, the index -- prices received by farms, factories and refineries -- rose 1.7 percent, the fastest rise since October and up from a 1.4 percent gain the prior month.
Underlying inflation pressures remained contained, however, with wholesale prices excluding volatile food and energy costs rising 0.2 percent after a similar increase in January. In the 12 months through February, this so-called core producer price index was up 1.7 percent, the smallest rise since January 2011.
Separately, the United States current account deficit narrowed in the fourth quarter, aided by an increase in services exports and more income earned abroad, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. It said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, fell to $110.4 billion, from an upwardly revised $112.4 billion in the third quarter.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the fourth-quarter current account deficit to widen to $112.8 billion from a previously reported $107.5 billion for the third quarter.

HEADLINE: New York's Education Deficit

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state legislative leaders are hammering out the $142 billion state budget for the 2013-14 fiscal year, which must be approved by April 1. It is crucial that more financing be allocated to public schools, both in upstate areas and in New York City. 
Many poorer school districts, especially those upstate, are suffering from financial problems created by the property tax cap that was championed by Mr. Cuomo and imposed by Albany lawmakers in 2011. The problem in New York City, which has no tax cap, is different. Mr. Cuomo and legislators threatened to cut at least $240 million in state aid to the city because Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the teachers' union failed to produce a new evaluation system for teachers by a January deadline. Surely, he must realize that hurting the schools will not lead to better outcomes for children, which is the purpose of creating rigorous teacher evaluation systems.
Smaller districts are in great need of more state aid. As predicted, the state law that caps the annual increase in property taxes at 2 percent or the inflation rate, unless 60 percent of the voters agree to more, has hit hardest on some of the poorest school districts. The current formula for allotting school aid is skewed to help districts of politically powerful legislators; it should be changed to spread more money to impoverished areas. Ultimately, lawmakers will also have to find a better source of revenue for schools than property taxes.
In a recent lawsuit, the New York State United Teachers and parents from several school districts offer some alarming details. Some districts have cut science and social studies teachers, dropped advanced placement classes and eliminated summer school programs. The Elmira City School District -- where more than half of its 7,000 students are eligible for free and reduced-price lunches -- failed to get 60 percent of voters to agree to a bigger tax increase. As a result of the vote and the loss of state aid, school leaders had to cut 126 of 1,220 positions, including 10 foreign language teachers and 12 reading teachers.
In negotiations over the state budget, lawmakers will have to deal with many important priorities, including a higher minimum wage for workers and more state aid for struggling cities and towns. Depriving poor communities and New York City of education funds would be particularly counterproductive.

HEADLINE: Hoping to Save Bees, Europe Is to Vote on a Pesticide Ban

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Will Brussels try to give bees a break?
In a case closely watched on both sides of the Atlantic, European officials plan to vote Friday on a proposal to sharply restrict the use of pesticides that had been implicated in the decline of global bee populations.
The vote in Brussels, by officials from all 27 European Union member states, follows a January report from the European Food Safety Authority recommending that none of the chemicals of a class known as neonicotinoids should be used on crops that are attractive to honeybees, because of the risk the insects would be poisoned.
Although even some bee scientists say the evidence is inconclusive, the European Commission, the Union's administrative arm, has embraced the food safety authority's findings. The proposal calls for a two-year prohibition of neonicotinoid use on the flowering crops that lure bees, as well as the seeds of such crops.
That would mean, for example, that farmers could no longer use the products on the colorful fields of rapeseed, or canola, that stretch across huge areas of Europea's agricultural heartlands. 
''The Commission has come to the conclusion that a high risk for bees cannot be excluded except by imposing further restrictions,'' the draft proposal says.
Companies that produce neonicotinoid-based pesticides, including the German giant Bayer CropScience and Syngenta, the big Swiss biochemical company, have lobbied strenuously against the moratorium. Monsanto incorporates the chemical into some of the seeds it produces; in the United States, neonicotinoids are heavily used on the country's huge corn crop.
The European proposal would need the backing of a so-called qualified majority of member states to become law, a system that assigns greater voting weight to larger countries like Germany, which is said to be reluctant to back the measure.
Uses of the chemicals that would be allowed under the moratorium would be restricted to professional growers, eliminating the danger that home gardeners would unwittingly wreak havoc on bee colonies. At the end of the two years, the results would be reviewed for further action.
E.U. nations already have the authority to restrict neonicotinoids. Initial approval for chemicals is granted by Brussels, but responsibility for approving the commercial products that contain them rests with member states. As a result various nations, including France and Italy, already restrict their use. Germany moved to restrict the use of some products after one such pesticide was blamed for millions of bee deaths in the Rhine Valley.
According to U.N. studies, bee populations -- including honeybees, bumblebees and solitary wild bees -- are dying in Europe, North America and around the world, with a significant upturn in mortality over the last decade. The exact reasons for the decline are unknown, but the implications are disturbing because the insects are essential for feeding the planet. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization says that bees pollinate 71 of the 100 crops that provide 90 percent of the world's food.
Peter Neumann, a biology professor who studies bee health at the University of Bern, Switzerland, said the extent of the bee die-off varied across Europe, but that in Switzerland, 50 percent of colonies were lost in the winter of 2011-12, compared with about 10 percent in a normal year.
And yet, ''the role of the neonicotinoids is really hard to pin down,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''It's hard to believe that they're not contributing to the problem, but we really have no data.''
In the United States, studies by the Agriculture Department's Bee Research Laboratory show colonies declining by as much as 30 percent annually over the last five or six years. As a result, about two-thirds of all the remaining honeybees in the country are needed in California each spring just to pollinate the state's almond crop.
Bayer CropScience and Syngenta emphasize the lack of scientific certainty that the use of their chemicals is responsible for bee deaths.
''We share the concerns surrounding bee health,'' said Utz Klages, a spokesman for Bayer CropScience. But, he added, ''any disproportionate action would jeopardize the competitiveness of European agriculture and finally lead to higher costs for food, feed, fiber and renewable raw materials and have an enormous economic impact throughout the whole food chain.''
His company and Syngenta say the proposed restrictions would bring the loss of 50,000 jobs and billions of dollars in costs to European farmers and companies.
Syngenta, in a statement last month, called on the European Commission to retract its proposal. The food safety authority's study, Syngenta said, was ''fundamentally flawed'' because it was based ''on unrealistic and excessive seed planting rates between two and four times higher than would be used under modern agricultural practice.''
Whatever might be killing off the bees, there is no doubt about the lethality for insects of neonicotinoids, which are also used in forestry and tree nurseries -- even in flea collars for pets. Once plants or seeds are treated with the chemical, it permeates their tissues; it then attacks the nervous system of any bug feeding on a leaf or root, or a bee that collects nectar or pollen.
Even if a bee does not receive enough of the poison to kill it, there is a fear that ''sublethal'' doses it carries back to the hive may be weakening already-stressed colonies. Two studies reported last year in the journal Science suggested that low levels of neonicotinoids from a common pesticide can have significant effects on bee colonies.
But pesticides are just one of several threats to bees, along with mites and viruses, environmental changes and poor nutrition. Those factors may work individually or in combination to weaken colonies and kill bees.
Paul de Zylva, an environmental campaigner in London with Friends of the Earth, said that while the pesticide makers ''adamantly deny'' that their products are affecting bee health, the range of the testing they had carried out was too narrow to be conclusive. Those studies, he said, looked only at possible effects on honeybees and not the effects that ''sublethal'' doses might be having in the hive, including on larvae.
He noted that in its January report, the European Food Safety Authority said it was unable to reach any conclusions in a number of areas ''due to shortcomings in the available data.''
''How can they know if it's safe?'' Mr. de Zylva asked.
Noa Simon, a veterinary scientist who acts as a technical adviser to the European Beekeeping Coordination, an industry group, argues that the chemicals should be banned for at least five years to provide time for further studies.
''A two-year ban isn't enough,'' Ms. Simon said. The food safety authority has indicated the risks, she said, ''but there are a lot of information gaps that need to be filled. And these chemicals are persistent, once they're introduced into the soil they're still going to be around a year later. This isn't being taken into account.''
That mirrors criticism in the United States, where the chemicals are used on virtually all of the country's corn crop.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency backed the chemical industry last year in rejecting a petition from honeybee keepers who argued that one neonicotinoid should be withdrawn from the market on the grounds that the studies on which approval was based were inadequate. But it said additional research was needed.
The E.P.A. did not respond to requests for comment.
But even some bee scientists are ambivalent about the proposed moratorium in Europe.
''If you want those perfect European apples, with no marks or bugs on them, I'm afraid farmers will have to spray something,'' Mr. Neumann said, ''and many of the older pesticides are even worse than the neonicotinoids.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Younger Generations Lag Parents in Wealth-Building

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Pearl Brady has a stable job with good benefits and holds two degrees, a bachelor's and a master's. But despite her best efforts, she has no savings, and worries that it will be years before she manages to start putting away money for a house, children and eventually retirement.
''I'm in that extremely nervous category,'' said Ms. Brady, 28, a Brooklynite who works for a union. ''I know how much money I'm going to be making for the near term. I hope in my 30s and 40s to be able to save, but I have no idea how. It's scary.''
Ms. Brady has plenty of company. A new study from the Urban Institute finds that Ms. Brady and her peers up to roughly age 40 have accrued less wealth than their parents did at the same age, even as the average wealth of Americans has doubled over the last quarter-century. 
Because wealth compounds over long periods of time -- a dollar saved 10 years ago is worth much more than a dollar saved today -- young adults probably face less secure futures for decades down the road, and even shakier retirements.
''In this country, the expectation is that every generation does better than the previous generation,'' said Caroline Ratcliffe, an author of the study. ''This is no longer the case. This generation might have less.'' The authors said the situation facing young Americans might be unprecedented.
A broad range of economic factors has conspired to suppress wealth-building for younger American workers; the trend predates the Great Recession. Younger Americans are facing stagnant pay -- the median income, when adjusted for inflation, has declined since its 1999 peak -- as well as a housing collapse and soaring student loan debt.
In interviews, a half-dozen young adults -- men and women, with families and single, in a broad range of industries -- described economic conditions that left them just barely keeping their heads above water.
Ms. Brady, for instance, earns about $1,800 a month in take-home pay. But she paid for her undergraduate and graduate education in part with loans, which cost her about $400 a month. She also is trying to pay down her credit card debt, which requires about $500 a month. After food, rent and living expenses, there is little left over.
Looking forward, she said, it seemed hard to imagine building a nest egg. ''Realistically, my income will go up, but not at a rate that's going to match my expenses,'' Ms. Brady said. ''I feel like every step forward I take, it's three steps back.''
Chuck Ross, 31, has a master's in economics and at one point built up a $12,000 nest egg from investing. But he lives in Wichita, Kan., where jobs in his field are few. He works at a large chain restaurant and is struggling with $40,000 in student loans. ''My dad works for himself,'' he said. ''He's always joking about how he'll work until he dies. We laugh, but for me, that's becoming more and more of a thought.''
Others said they had put their money into a home only to fall into foreclosure, or were struggling to pay for child care.
Strong and sustained job and wage growth would cure many of the ills facing younger workers, experts said. But their delayed or diminished wealth accumulation might still have a lasting impact on their finances.
''It's a little bit of a tipping-point moment,'' said Signe-Mary McKernan, an author of the study from the Urban Institute, a nonprofit Washington research institution. ''If we don't address it today, they might never catch up.''
For instance, the researchers said, if a person delayed the purchase of a home to age 40 instead of buying at age 30, that might result in a $42,000 loss in home equity by the time she reaches 60, given trends in wealth accumulation over the past few decades.
The Urban Institute study is one of many to show something of a perfect storm of economic trends battering younger workers. One is the collapse of the housing bubble. Young people who bought homes as prices started to decline in 2006 are often underwater on their mortgages today. But now that prices have fallen sharply and interest rates are remarkably low, many other young adults are locked out of the market because credit standards are tougher.
A second major trend is the rise of student loan debt, which has continued to grow through the recession, sometimes saddling students with burdens that extend into six figures and might take decades to pay down. A study of Federal Reserve data by the Pew Research Center found that 40 percent of relatively young households had outstanding student debt as of 2010, up from 34 percent in 2007. The median balance among all households with student loan debt was more than $13,000.
''I just don't think about it,'' said Mr. Ross, of his student loans. ''I push the thoughts out of my mind, and when I do think about it now and then I kind of just think that maybe I'll have to work indefinitely. And I hope I can find a career that will allow my body to do that.''
Finally, and perhaps most important, younger workers have faced a brutal job market in the last half-decade. The unemployment rate is 7.8 percent for workers between the ages of 25 and 34; it hovered over 10 percent for more than a year during the recession and early stages of the recovery. For workers between the ages of 45 and 54, the unemployment rate is 5.5 percent, and it peaked at 8 percent in 2010.
Those who held on to their jobs are often worse off. Wages, adjusted for inflation, have stagnated for a broad swath of workers for over a decade. For millions of workers, wages have actually declined through the recession and the sluggish recovery.
With the wage and jobs picture bleak, and fixed pensions largely gone from the private sector, the answer to the conundrum of shoring up savings for younger workers might lie in new government policies, the Urban Institute scholars said. They suggested encouraging retirement accounts by making them automatic unless an employee opted out, or modifying the home mortgage interest deduction to push more money toward homeownership for lower-income workers.
For now, millions of younger workers are on their own. ''We both had vanilla lower-middle-to-middle-class lifestyles,'' said Christopher Greer, a 32-year-old who works in astronomy and lives in Arizona, referring to himself and his girlfriend. ''I'm not sure how that's going to play out for us.''

In contrast, the average person of 56 to 64 in 2010 had more than twice the wealth that someone the same age would have had 30 years ago. (Source: The Urban Institute) (B8)

HEADLINE: The Long Shadow of Budget Cuts on U.S. Science Investment

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Political deadlock over the budget threatens basic research on energy frontiers. 

 BODY:
 11:44 a.m. | Chart Updated | 
John Broder has reported that President Obama will today try to push forward with a State of the Union pledge: 
With few options available for financing his clean-energy ambitions, President Obama on Friday will propose diverting $2 billion in revenue from federal oil and gas leases over the next decade to pay for research on advanced vehicles, White House officials said. [Read the rest]
The article notes this is seen by the White House as a way to sustain energy science and technology development even as the automatic spending cuts kick in under what's being called sequestration - a euphemism for forced cuts in all programs because of political deadlock over changes in taxes and entitlements.
The president is scheduled to announce the financing plan at the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, which received money in early stages of the stimulus spending during the recession for research aimed at improving vehicle batteries.
The laboratory's director, Eric D. Isaacs, co-authored an article in The Atlantic this week warning that the cuts would cancel all new research efforts at the lab for two years or more.
The piece includes this sobering line: 
Less than one percent of the federal budget goes to fund basic science research - $30.2 billion out of the total of $3.8 trillion President Obama requested in fiscal year 2012. By slashing that fraction even further, the government will achieve short-term savings in millions this year, but the resulting gaps in the innovation pipeline could cost billions of dollars and hurt the national economy for decades to come.
For much more, read "Eroding Our Foundation: Sequestration, R&D, Innovation and U.S. Economic Growth," by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.
It was clear long ago that the pulse of stimulus spending devoted to research was a blip. [See "Short-Termism and Energy Revolutions."] It's clearer than ever now. America's decades-long bi-partisan slumber party on basic research in sciences related to energy continues.
This is what that slumber party looks like as of the 2013 budget:

10:40 a.m. | Update
In an e-mail, Roger A. Pielke, Jr., of the University of Colorado pointed me to his critique of "R and D mythology," repeated in The Atlantic piece cited above, on the connection between research spending and economic growth.

HEADLINE: Live Blog: Senate Panel on JPMorgan's Trading Loss

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: A Senate subcommittee questioned bank executives and regulators in a hearing today. 

 BODY:
 JPMorgan Chase ignored internal controls and manipulated documents as the nation's biggest bank racked up trading losses last year, while its influential chief executive, Jamie Dimon, briefly withheld some information from regulators, a new Senate report says.
The findings by Senate investigators shed new light on the $6.2 billion trading blunder, which has claimed the jobs of some top executives and prompted investigations by authorities. The 300-page report, released Thursday, will escalate the debate in Washington over regulating Wall Street.
A Senate subcommittee questioned bank executives and regulators in a hearing today. DealBook is live-blogged the hearing. 
 1:26 P.M. | JPMorgan Executives Are Excused 
Nearly four hours after the hearing began, the JPMorgan executives are excused from the hearing. Mr. Levin thanks them for coming without needing a subpoena. 
His parting words still suggest troubles with what happened at the firm during the trading incidents, though the senator notes that bank executives have testified today that they are trying to take steps to fix that.
Mr. Levin takes a five-minute break before moving onto testimony from the comptroller's office.
Our live blogging will conclude now. DealBook will have more analysis from our reporters in Washington and New York shortly.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 1:22 P.M. | Questions About E-Mail 
Mr. Levin engages Mr. Weiland, the former chief risk officer for the C.I.O. unit, about e-mails that a JPMorgan employee who helped craft the new risk models had sent. Mr. Weiland says that the employee was too caught up at times in the mathematics of the risk modeling and not paying attention to bigger issues.
Mr. Levin notes that Mr. Weiland had held a discussion with the employee over the phone, rather than over e-mail. Mr. Weiland says that he wanted to better convey a message to the employee. But the senator thinks there was an effort to avoid a document trail.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 1:21 P.M. | A Better Way to Calculate Bank Risk 
Mr. Levin asks a question of Michael Cavanagh that has deep relevance today as banks move into the Basel III regulatory regime, which makes heavy use of models to calculate risk-weighted assets (and thus capital). The fear right now is that banks are tweaking their models to lower risk weighted assets, to lighten capital charges. Mr. Levin just asked if it's appropriate to adjust models to reduce risk-weighted assets, something that occurred at JPMorgan as the credit bets soured. "It can be appropriate," said Mr. Cavanagh, currently co-chief executive of JPMorgan's investment bank. He qualified that by saying any such moves would have to be done with transparency and with the correct controls. 
Hearing this, one has to wonder how much risk-weighted assets at JPMorgan are reduced in this fashion today.
- Peter Eavis 
 1:15 P.M. | Behind JPMorgan's Big Credit Bet 
Mr. Levin is alleging there were many inaccuracies in Douglas Brainstein's explanation of the big credit bets on an April 13th, 2012, public conference call. Here's the part of the call he is focusing on:
On April 13th, 2012, Mr. Braunstein said: 
The result of all of that is we also need to manage the stress loss associated with that portfolio and - so we have put on positions to manage for a significant stress event in credit. We've had that position on for many years, and the activities that have been reported in the paper are basically part of managing that stress loss position, which we moderate and change over time, depending upon our views as to what the risks are for our stress loss from credit.
All of those decisions are made on a very long-term basis. They're done to keep the company effectively balanced from a risk standpoint. We are very comfortable with our positions as they are held today. And I would add that all of those positions are fully transparent to the regulators. They review them, have access to them at any point in time, get the information on those positions on a regular and recurring basis as part of our normalized reporting. And all of those positions are put on pursuant to the risk management at the firm-wide level.
Mr Levin has so far gotten Mr. Braunstein to concede that not all the positions were long-term and the senator has raised doubts about whether the positions were "pursuant to the risk management at the firm-wide level." But Mr. Levin has gained a significant concession from Mr. Braunstein on whether regulators were getting information on the bets "on a regular and recurring basis." After tense back and forth, Mr. Braunstein said, "They did not get the detailed positions regularly." To which, Mr. Levin replied, "I'll settle for that."
- Peter Eavis 
 1:02 P.M. | 'You Think That's a Balanced Presentation?' 
Mr. Levin continues to hammer away at what one of the crucial elements of the "whale" saga: what Mr. Braunstein said during the April 13 call. His line of questioning turns to what should have been disclosed to investors then.
"Should investors have known during that call that the status of the S.C.P. was not that great?" Mr. Levin asks, referring to the synthetic credit portfolio that was at the heart of the chief investment officer's trades. 
"You give this very glowing call, it's been approved by central, it's gone through risk managers," he adds, "instead of telling them what you knew, which is that the S.C.P. had been losing money and violating risk limits."
Mr. Braunstein responds that based on what he knew at the time, it was the most accurate depiction.
That seems to infuriate the senator. "You thought that was a balanced presentation?" he asks.
Mr. Braunstein reiterates that it was "accurate." The senator replies that it wasn't, based on the information available at the time.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 12:48 P.M. | 'Calming the Seas' 
In a hearing full of testy exchanges, the dialogue between Mr. Levin and Mr. Braunstein is shaping up to be the toughest so far. 
Mr. Braunstein reiterates that the statements he made on April 13 represented his best effort, based on the information he had at the time, to report on the positions at the time. Hindsight showed that JPMorgan executives misunderstood the implications of the trades.
Mr. Levin is distinctly unimpressed, saying that he has a hard time "believing that those statements were meant to do anything but calm the seas." 
Plenty of information existed at the time that showed that, contrary to Mr. Braunstein's assertions on the April 13 call, the trades weren't serving as protection, but as "tactical" short-term investments. And the size of trades tripled over those three months in 2012.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 12:37 P.M. | Why Were Investors Left Unaware? 
Through pounding executives, for now, about the valuation of the trades, Mr. Levin turns to the statements made to investors during an April 13 earnings call. Mr. Levin points to an e-mail that Mr. Hogan sent two days before the earnings call to Mr. Braunstein and other top executives, including Mr. Dimon. In that e-mail, Mr. Hogan warns that the chief investment unit needs to be overhauled "to control what is currently going on in CIO."
Mr. Levin asks Mr. Braunstein whether he disclosed that particular concern to investors. The answer, Mr. Braunstein says, was no.
Questioning Mr. Braunstein about statements made to investors that the positions were made with the blessing of risk managers, Mr. Levin pounds the desk in front of him.
Mr. Levin continues to push Mr. Braunstein about the accuracy of his statements.
According to Mr. Levin, the risk managers at the bank, in contrast to Mr. Braunstein's statement in April, were not fully aware of the risky bets when they were placed.
Mr. Braunstein sticks with the same defense. At the time he made the statement, Mr. Braunstein argues he was conveying accurate information.
Mr. Braunstein, on the earnings call in April, said that the comptroller got information "on those positions" as part of a normalized reporting practice. 
Mr. Levin keeps repeating his question. He pummels Mr. Braunstein, arguing that the comptroller, in fact, did not get regular information about those positions. Once Mr. Braunstein says that the regulators didn't routinely get granular information about the actual positions, Mr. Levin pares back his questions slightly. Mr. Levin exclaims "finally" when Mr. Braunstein acknowledges that the regulators didn't actually get detailed information about the positions.
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 12:25 P.M. | Levin Continues to Push Bank Executives 
Continuing to push on the valuation of the trades, Mr. Levin refers to a recorded conversation between Ms. Drew and Javier Martin-Artajo. In that conversation that occurred in April 2012, Ms. Drew, the transcripts show, told Mr. Martin-Artajo: "It's absolutely fine to stay conservative, but it would be helpful, if appropriate, to get, to start getting a little bit of that mark back."
Mr. Levin seizes on that conversation as evidence that Ms. Drew encouraged Mr. Martin-Artajo to tweak the valuing of the positions.
Ms. Drew defends her guidance, arguing that she was only suggesting to the manager in London that he modify the trades based on reliable data.
Mr. Levin seems to love the word "tweak."
Mr. Levin takes particular aim at Mr. Cavanagh, returning at intervals to ask him why this pricing practice was allowed. To curb the temptation to "tweak" prices, Mr. Levin says banks should hire an independent auditor to do the valuation.
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 12:15 P.M. | 'How Do You Possibly Justify Your Process?' 
Mr. Levin says that for the bank, the understatement of traders' losses helped reduce the red ink on the trades.
Mr. Levin confronts Mr. Braunstein, asking whether it's appropriate and common practice for JPMorgan to value its trades aggressively to minimize losses for the bank.
Mr. Braunstein tells Mr. Levin that the bank does not manipulate its valuation models to favor the bank.
Growing more incensed, Mr. Levin asks Mr. Cavanagh: "How do you possibly justify your process?"
Mr. Cavanagh explains that the bank was dealing with a marketplace that was roiled by news reports about the botched bets. Still, he says that the marking of the trades was fair.
Mr. Levin asks whether it was "a coincidence" that the way the trades were valued shifted to reduce the losses "at the time that the losses were piling up." Mr. Levin asks the question in several permutations, prodding Mr. Cavanagh to answer the question.
Mr. Cavanagh said that the change in marking the trades shifted in January 2012.
Mr. Levin reminds Mr. Cavanagh that he is under oath.
He revises his position and says that now he knows that improper marking did occur, especially in March 2012.
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 12:03 P.M. | Levin on How Traders Hid Their Losses 
After peppering the executives with questions about why the bank continued to keep regulators in the dark, Mr. Levin embarks on a discussion about how traders in the chief investment office disguised losses on their trades.
Mr. Levin cites JPMorgan's own assessment on March 30, 2012, that the chief investment office's methods of valuing the trades "needs improvement."
Driving home the idea that traders were "pressured" to diminish losses on their trades, Mr. Levin refers to a junior trader in London, Julien Grout, who, at one point, kept a spreadsheet that tracked the difference between his valuations and the midpoint.
Mr. Levin asks whether it is "common" for JPMorgan to change its pricing practices when losses "start to pile up."
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 11:55 A.M. | Levin Challenges Braunstein 
Mr. Levin challenges Mr. Braunstein, just as he pushed back against Ms. Drew. He wants to know why the losses provided by Mr. Braunstein to examiners at the comptroller's office failed to capture the full extent of the losses on the soured trades.
Mr. Braunstein says he was "certain" that he provided accurate information. He says "the math might work out for you," referring to the losses reported to the comptroller. He questions though whether the correct information was, in fact, handed over to the bank's main regulator.
Mr. Levin then continues to question Ms. Drew about why the chief investment office did not provide the same profit and loss statements as the rest of the bank. Ms. Drew responds that her chief financial officer, to the best of her knowledge, did provide daily reports.
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 11:52 A.M. | Dimon Withheld Data From Regulator 
Jamie Dimon temporarily withheld crucial data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a bank regulator, as the bank's trading problems grew. Douglas Braunstein, then chief financial officer, and party to that decision, says he wasn't sure that if JPMorgan was required to send that data to regulators. "Senator, the report in question, I am not certain, I am not aware, if it was a report required to be sent to regulators," Mr. Braunstein tells the senators.

 11:50 A.M. | Revisiting That Fateful Analyst Call 
Mr. McCain brings up the infamous call that JPMorgan executives held with analysts in mid-April last year, during which Mr. Braunstein said that he was "very comfortable" with the size of the chief investment office's trades. 
During the hearing, Mr. Braunstein says, "Based on the benefit of hindsight, the bank and I were both misinformed and incorrect when I said I was very comfortable." That was based on the information he had at the time - belied by subsequent information that came to light.
Mr. McCain asks whether anyone was held accountable. Mr. Braunstein replies that several employees were fired, and that compensation was clawed back or reduced.
After questioning from the senator, Mr. Braunstein says that his pay was cut by more than 50 percent, to $5 million in 2012 from $9.5 million the previous year.

 11:43 A.M. | A Dispute Over a Report to Regulators 
Mr. Levin becomes fired up over an exchange with Ms. Drew over the amount of a trading loss that was reported to the comptroller's office. The senator asks her why bank officials reported on April 16 that a trading loss was about $580 million - despite an internal report that put the number at $1.2 billion.
Ms. Drew responds, "To the best of my knowledge, the O.C.C. was given daily reports of the C.I.O.'s mark-to-market activities."
That throws Mr. Levin off, and the senator says he doesn't think that's true. Before he switches off to Mr. McCain, Ms. Drew reiterates that her assertion was made "to the best of her knowledge."
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 11:37 A.M. | JPMorgan's Former Finance Chief in the Hot Seat 
After a brief break, the hearing returns with Mike Cavanagh, a co-head of JPMorgan's investment bank, and Douglas Braunstein, the chief financial officer at the time of the trades.
Mr. Braunstein took some pointed questions from Mr. Levin. One was for how long had JPMorgan not reported data to the comptroller's office. Another was why.
Mr. Braunstein, who is now a vice chairman at JPMorgan, said that the bank had stopped sending data for about two weeks because "a number of regulators had had breaches in some of the data we had shared with them." Some data had been mistakenly lost.
Mr. Levin asks whether Mr. Braunstein had informed comptroller officials of that. The reply is yes. But the senator presses and asks if the officials were upset.
"I don't recall the specifics of the conversation," Mr. Braunstein says, twice.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 11:34 A.M. | Value-at-Risk Changes 
The witnesses are asked about the January 2012 value-at-risk model change. This crucial switch effectively allowed the investment office to keep making its huge bets. 
Mr. Levin asks Mr. Bacon what his thoughts are on a risk model change that allows risk levels to drop by half overnight. Mr. Bacon responds, "I think it's something that would require a lot of inquiry and investigation." 
Ms. Drew says the problems with the model were "very disappointing."
- Peter Eavis 
 11:12 A.M. | Flaws in Creating the New Risk Model 
One of the big problems for Mr. Levin was that when JPMorgan finally updated its risk limit model - known in banking as "value at risk," or VaR - the new system was deeply flawed. There was little testing of the data, and it was largely dependent on manual entry of data every night.
And yet the VaR model showed that JPMorgan's risk had been cut drastically.
"You have a new Var, which cuts the VaR in half, and then boom, suddenly there's no breach," Mr. Levin says.
Mr. Bacon says that such a phenomenon "requires a lot of inquiry and explanation." For her part, Ms. Drew says she was "disappointed" that the model, created by highly knowledgeable people with doctoral degrees, was so lacking.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 11:03 A.M. | Outdated Risk Limits 
Mr. Levin turns his attention to JPMorgan's outdated risk limits, which hadn't been updated since 2009. [Mr. Weiland concedes the matter.] The senator notes that the comptroller's rules require that banks' limits be updated annually.
Mr. Weiland says JPMorgan had been in the middle of a limit re-evaluation, though the senator asks incredulously, "For three years?" He responded, no, since the middle of 2011. "The change in the limit just did not take priority at the time," Mr. Weiland says.
That doesn't sit well with Mr. Levin, who fixes on the issue of JPMorgan regularly breaking outdated risk limits for 70 straight days, "despite O.C.C. regulation, which you ignored." He asks Ms. Drew if she knew that was the case, which she says she did.
"Why didn't you fix it?" he asks. 
Ms. Drew responds that she was told that the limits were outdated and were in the process of being fixed.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 10:55 A.M. | A Jump in Breaches 
Mr. Levin focuses on a series of risk-limit breaches at JPMorgan over several months in 2011 and April 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the senator notes, there were six breaches. In the first quarter of 2012, that number jumped to 170. And, he continues, in April alone, there were 160 breaches.
Mr. Levin asks Mr. Weiland whether the huge jump in breaches is worrying.
The former JPMorgan executive says that yes, it's "a worrisome pattern." But he adds that breaches and risk metrics can happen because the market moves away from a trading position. And by April, the JPMorgan team was in "crisis mode."
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 10:45 A.M. | The Mystery of the Growing Assets 
The line of questioning switches to Mr. McCain, who spends time asking how the chief investment office's assets ended up growing, not shrinking as JPMorgan had indicated to the comptroller's office.
Ms. Drew says that the plan signed off on by senior management was to reduce risk-weighted assets over all of 2012. "But things went terribly wrong," she says. "The very large purchases that were made in March were not brought to my attention in time."
The senator asks whether it was her responsibility to accurately report the bank's plans to the comptroller.
"It was always my responsibility to be transparent," Ms. Drew replies, "But it was not my responsibility to report to the O.C.C."
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 10:44 A.M. | Risk Officer on Risk Metric 
Peter Weiland, once a senior risk officer in the investment office, in March 2012 trashed in an e-mail a crucial risk reading that raised red flags about the investment office's trades. Mr. Levin asks Mr. Weiland whether he now thinks that risk metric was in fact right. "Yes, I acknowledge now, with all the information, that was correct."
Here's what Mr. Weiland wrote in that e-mail, to a trader, last year, "We got some CRM numbers and they look like garbage as far as I can tell, 2- 3x what we saw before."
- Peter Eavis 
 10:33 A.M. | Returning to 'Too Big to Fail' 
Mr. Johnson, who was elected to the Senate as a politician associated with the Tea Party, spends his limited time at the hearing focusing on the issue of 'too big to fail.' He asks Mr. Bacon whether JPMorgan suffered from "a pervasive attitude" that the bank was too big to fail. 
And then he asks whether Dodd-Frank, the most sweeping changes to financial regulation in years, had ended "too big to fail." Mr. Bacon responds that he thinks the law has "the potential" to end the problem.
Mr. Johnson finishes with a warning that the problem is alive and kicking. "The fact that we're still having this hearing indicates that we haven't ended 'too big to fail,'" he said. "The goal of this Congress should be to get the American people off the hooks of the banks."
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 10:32 A.M. | "Who Was in Charge of Sending Them?" 
Mr. Levin focuses on why JPMorgan did not send critical reports from the chief investment office to the Office of the Comptroller of Currency for four months in 2012 - at the same time that the size of the trades were swelling.
He poses the question to Ms. Drew, who responds that she doesn't know whether they had been sent. In a defensive move, she adds, "If I had known, I would have said that was a wrong thing to do."
Mr. Levin presses for a name, but neither Ms. Drew nor Peter Weiland, who was in charge of risk management at the chief investment office, has one. Mr. Weiland says that the responsibility likely lay in the "finance function" - almost certainly meaning the chief financial officer, who was Douglas Braunstein at the time.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 10:22 A.M. | The Questioning Begins 
Mr. Levin leads off the questioning, asking Ms. Drew about the nature of the chief investment office's trades at the beginning of the Whale run-up. He asks her if many of the trades were short term.
Ms. Drew argued that the core trading position, "a short high-yield position," was meant to be long term and had been held for many years. 
But the senator presses forward and asks if many of the positions were purchased in a quarter. She concedes the point.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 10:16 A.M. | The Importance of Being Too Big to Fail 
Two Republican members of the Senate subcommittee, Mr. McCain and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, argue that JPMorgan's high-handed and dismissive attitude toward regulators highlight a troubling issue: the firm believing it could act with impunity. 
"This bank appears to have entertained, even embraced, the idea that it was too big to fail," Mr. McCain says. He adds that it is the Senate's job to remind financial institutions of their obligation to the general public. 
His colleague chimes in, saying, "JPMorgan appears to have developed its business model around the fact that it's too big to fail."
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 10:17 A.M. | Bank's Chief Risk Offer Explains His Role 
After Ms. Drew, Ashley Bacon, the acting chief risk officer of JPMorgan, begins his testimony. Mr. Bacon explains that he was brought in last April to investigate the reasons behind the losses.
Peter Weiland begins his own testimony, explaining that he is here to provide greater clarity on what happened at the chief investment office.
His opening statement ends almost as soon as it starts.
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 10:12 A.M. | Drew Says Her Resignation Decision Was 'Devastating' 
Ina Drew begins testifying. 
She starts by outlining her 30-year career at JPMorgan. The length of her tenure at the bank helps provide context, illuminating the numerous instances where Ms. Drew helped the bank escape losses.
Ms. Drew describes her decision to resign as "devastating."
Ms. Drew says that she relied on assurances of people who worked for her in the chief investment office. She says that her ability to curtail risk-taking and stem losses was undermined by those traders who misvalued their trades and flawed risk metrics.
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 10:04 A.M. | McCain Takes Aim at Regulators 
"These trades were not conducted by a group of rogue traders," Mr. McCain says. He then continues to detail how the problems that led to the disastrous trades extended beyond the traders making the large wagers in the London office of the chief investment office.
"The bank's primary regulator, the O.C.C., failed to take action," Mr. McCain says. The regulators don't escape criticism at the hearing. Mr. McCain says the regulators were "asleep."
Even though Mr. Dimon is not testifying at Thursday's hearing, Mr. McCain continually singles him out. Much of the criticism is focused around Mr. Dimon's assurances on April 13 that concerns about the trades were "a complete tempest in a teapot."
Mr. McCain asks whether JPMorgan expects the taxpayers to bail them out again. It's worth noting, though, that JPMorgan, unlike many of its rivals, emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed.
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 9:58 A.M. | Too Little Transparency at JPMorgan 
JPMorgan, Mr. Levin claims, "dodged" regulatory oversight. Mr. Levin says that JPMorgan was "too busy betting on derivatives to issue the loans needed to speed economic recovery."
Compared with its large bank rivals, Mr. Levin says, JPMorgan has the lowest "loan to deposit" ratio.
Mr. Levin uses the JPMorgan trading losses to illustrate the pressing need for stricter rules that rein in risky trading.
As a policy recommendation, Mr. Levin said that federal regulators should demand better disclosure when banks tweak their risk metrics.
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 9:52 A.M. | Levin Calls Out JPMorgan's Absent Chief Executive 
Mr. Levin faults the bank's traders for what he says are deliberate attempts to play down and disguise the losses on the trades.
In the scathing report issued by the Senate subcommittee on Thursday, investigators said that JPMorgan managers "pressured" traders to underreport losses by $660 million.
Jamie Dimon, the bank's chief executive, is called out by Mr. Levin for personally approving a temporary increase in risk limits that enabled the traders to continue making outsize wagers.
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 9:47 A.M. | How a Sleepy Operation Grew into a Profit Center 
Mr. Levin cites a "massive portfolio riddled with risk," a "runaway train of derivatives trading" and regulators who failed to act. Together, he says, these facts resemble what happened in the financial crisis.
Mr. Levin positions the hearing Friday as an opportunity to explore "the hidden world of high-stakes derivatives trading by big banks." He accuses JPMorgan of misleading and mischaracterizing the "nature of the whale trades."
JPMorgan's chief investment office, which manages excess deposits for the bank, was once a relatively unknown unit in the bank.
Mr. Levin points out the exponential growth of the portfolio in the chief investment office. "In just a few months during 2011," he says, the credit portfolio grew from "a net notional size of $4 billion to $51 billion."
- Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
 9:38 A.M. | Levin Takes Aim at Derivatives Trading 
Friday's hearing is the first public appearance for Ina Drew after the top executive resigned as head of the chief investment office shortly after the trading losses were announced in May.
Senator Carl Levin began by praising his "longtime friend," Senator John McCain. 
At the outset, Mr. Levin took direct aim at derivatives trading. "In April 2012, Americans were confronted with a story of Wall Street excess," he said.

HEADLINE: SAC Capital to Pay $616 Million in Insider Trading Cases

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Two affiliates of the giant hedge fund have settled insider trading cases with the S.E.C., for $616 million, in what the agency said was the biggest ever settlement for such cases. 

 BODY:
 10:58 p.m. | Updated 
The government's multiyear campaign to ferret out insider trading on Wall Street has yielded multiple prosecutions of former employees of SAC Capital Advisors, the giant hedge fund owned by the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen.
On Friday, federal authorities took aim at the fund itself.
In what officials are calling the largest-ever settlement of an insider trading action, SAC agreed to pay securities regulators about $602 million to resolve a civil lawsuit related to improper trading at the fund.
The landmark penalty exceeds, at least before adjustment for inflation, the fines meted out in the 1980s-era scandals involving Ivan F. Boesky and Michael R. Milken, records at the time. It also underscores SAC's central role in the government's recent push to prosecute illegal conduct on trading desks and in executive suites, an effort that has yielded about 180 civil actions and more than 75 criminal prosecutions. 
SAC also agreed Friday to pay $14 million to resolve its role in an insider trading ring that illegally traded technology stocks including Dell.
"These settlements call for the imposition of historic penalties," said George S. Canellos, the Securities and Exchange Commission's acting enforcement director.
Mr. Canellos said the resolutions did not prevent the future filing of additional charges against any person, specifically citing Mr. Cohen, who was not named as a defendant in the civil actions on Friday. Mr. Cohen has not been charged with any wrongdoing and has told his clients that he believes he has behaved properly.
In the bigger case, the agency said an SAC unit would forfeit $602 million to settle claims that it sold nearly $1 billion in shares of two pharmaceutical companies after a former portfolio manager at the fund received secret information from a doctor about problems with a new drug for Alzheimer's disease.
For SAC, which is based in Stamford, Conn., manages $15 billion and holds one of the best investment records on Wall Street, the settlements, while another blow to its reputation, resolve a matter that caused some of its investors to withdraw their money. Investors became skittish last fall after regulators warned SAC that they planned to sue the fund.
"These settlements are a substantial step toward resolving all outstanding regulatory matters and allow the firm to move forward," said Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC.
The settlements still need to be approved by Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan, the presiding judge in the case. As part of its agreement with regulators, SAC neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. That entrenched S.E.C. practice - permitting defendants to settle civil claims without acknowledging wrongdoing - has come under increased scrutiny by the courts, a trend that legal experts say could lead the judge to question the settlement.
The cases brought on Friday echo earlier criminal charges against SAC employees. In December, prosecutors indicted Mathew Martoma, a former SAC portfolio manager at the center of the questionable drug-stock trades tied to a new Alzheimer's drug. And Jon Horvath, a former SAC analyst, pleaded guilty last year to participating in the Dell insider trading ring. In its legal filing on Friday, the S.E.C. said Mr. Horvath had leaked secret information to two colleagues; previously, the commission said that only one former SAC employee had received tips.
A lawyer for Mr. Martoma said SAC's resolution of the two lawsuits had no bearing on his client, who has denied the charges.
"SAC's business decision to settle with the S.E.C. in no way changes the fact that Mathew Martoma is an innocent man," said Charles A. Stillman, the lawyer. "We will never give up our fight for his vindication."
On a conference call with reporters, government officials bragged that the $616 million amount dwarfed other prominent insider trading settlements. Raj Rajaratnam, a former hedge fund manager convicted in 2011, paid $156 million in combined criminal and civil penalties. Mr. Boesky, a central figure in the 1980s trading scandals, paid $100 million then.
The sum also exceeds the amounts of older enforcement actions, including a $550 million settlement with Goldman Sachs in 2010 related to fraud accusations tied to the sale of mortgage investments, and a $400 million settlement with Mr. Milken, the junk bond financier, in 1990.
The larger of the two cases settled on Friday was based on powerful evidence against Mr. Martoma, the former SAC portfolio manager. The government said Mr. Martoma had caused SAC to sell nearly $1 billion in shares of Elan and Wyeth because he obtained secret information from a doctor about clinical trials for a drug being developed by the companies. Prosecutors have secured the testimony of the doctor who reportedly leaked Mr. Martoma the drug trial data.
In bringing the criminal charge against Mr. Martoma, prosecutors appeared to be moving closer to building a case against Mr. Cohen. The complaint noted that Mr. Cohen had a 20-minute phone call with Mr. Martoma the night before SAC began dumping its holdings. Prosecutors, though, have not claimed that Mr. Cohen knew that Mr. Martoma had confidential data about the drug's prospects.
The F.B.I. has tried unsuccessfully several times to persuade Mr. Martoma to plead guilty and cooperate against Mr. Cohen.
While the $602 million settlement in the Martoma case is a prodigious sum, it is considerably less than the maximum that the S.E.C. could have extracted. The agreement required SAC to pay about $275 million, an amount representing disgorged illegal gains, as well as $52 million in interest. In addition, SAC agreed to pay a $275 million penalty, an amount equal to the illicit gains. Under the securities laws, however, the S.E.C. could have secured a penalty of three times that amount, or $825 million.
The forfeited money will come from SAC, meaning that the firm will write the government a check. SAC's investors will not pay anything or absorb any losses. The $616 million will go into a general revenue fund of the United States Treasury.
Representing SAC in its talks with the S.E.C. were Martin Klotz of Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Daniel J. Kramer of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison.
While the resolution of these two cases provides a measure of relief to SAC and its clients, the hedge fund's legal problems have already damaged its business. Though SAC has returned about 30 percent annually to its investors over the last two decades - a virtually peerless track record - many of its clients have parted ways with the fund.
Last month, SAC investors asked to withdraw $1.7 billion, more than a quarter of the $6 billion that the fund manages for outside clients. The balance of SAC's $15 billion belongs to Mr. Cohen and his employees. The next regularly scheduled deadline for SAC clients to ask for their money back is mid-May.
In calls with concerned clients, SAC has highlighted its stepped-up efforts in building its legal staff and compliance procedures - an initiative that Mr. Gasthalter reiterated Friday. "We are committed to continuing to maintain a first-rate compliance effort woven into the fabric of the firm."
On a conference call discussing the case, Mr. Canellos was asked whether the S.E.C. felt that SAC was committed to keeping a strong culture of compliance.
"I sure hope they are," Mr. Canellos said.
An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the amount of the settlement because rounded numbers were added. Adding the exact numbers and then rounding, the total is $616 million, not $614 million.

HEADLINE: An Owner Rethinks How He Spends His Marketing Dollars

BYLINE: MELINDA F. EMERSON


HIGHLIGHT: Jeff Chinman says he has three top priorities now: Update his Web site, create a blog and start using local online market ads. 

 BODY:
Back in January, Jeff Chinman, president of Broadway Kitchens and Baths, which remodels kitchens and bathrooms in Manhattan, Northern New Jersey, and Stamford, Conn., left a comment on this blog.
In the comment, he wrote that he was now on his third or fourth revamp of his Web site, that he had a Facebook page and was trying to figure out how to integrate Twitter and Facebook. He went on to ask whether he was really getting business in return for his efforts or whether he was just bothering his "little bubble of friends and acquaintances." He said that his big question for 2013 was where he should invest his marketing dollars: Should he stick with radio and print or try harder with social media and Google AdWords? 
Confused about where to start and whom to hire to assist him, Mr. Chinman posted his comment asking for advice. After speaking with him about his 18-year-old business, I wrote a blog post that talked about his frustrations. I suggested that he update his Web site, find a way to collect e-mail addresses, start blogging and get his 10-person sales team to start tracking where their leads come from. Many commenters also chimed in with suggestions that he investigate Pinterest and Tumblr, use better quality photography to highlight his kitchens, reach back to happy customers for testimonials, address some negative reviews on Google+, and do more face-to-face networking.
I recently checked back with Mr. Chinman to see what he thought of the suggestions and how things were progressing.
 Q. 
 Was the information helpful? 
 A. 
I thought your advice was right on target, and I have three top priorities now: One, launch new WordPress Web site. Two, create a blog. Three, use local online market ads.
 Q. 
 What did you think of the advice your received in the comments section? 
 A. 
I love the advice from Thomas Forgione that taking advice this way is "dangerous and usually results in poor marketing decisions" - you get what you pay for. Most of the comments confirmed what you said and where I was going, but in addition, there were a few other ideas that I thought need more exploring, such as incorporating YouTube, tracking leads by installing a tracking code, and injecting some personality into the photos to create a connection like Men's Warehouse.
 Q. 
 Did any of the information surprise you? 
 A. 
I was not really surprised, but I thought it was interesting that someone said I should actually remove my Facebook pages.
 Q. 
 Have you implemented anything yet that was suggested in the post? 
 A. 
I am hoping to launch my new Web site by April 1.
 Q. 
 Are you planning on cutting back or increasing any of your print or radio advertising? 
 A. 
I am cutting back my print advertising to focus on local Google target marketing.
 Q. 
 Are you planning to add any new staff or consultants? 
 A. 
I received about three or four solicitations for Internet marketing. Most are offering the same old "optimize my Web site, and they will get me No. 1 in Google searches." Been there, heard that before.
 Q. 
 How has business been lately? 
 A. 
Business has been improved starting the second or third week in January. I think it's market driven. Since the 2008 recession, I think this is the year that people will spend again. Added to that is the built-up demand from people who put off their renovation, because of fear.

 BODY:
Welcome to another week of our Common Core Practice series, which we do in collaboration with a ninth-grade humanities class in New Jersey. 
This week: students write six-word stories about athletes; argue their points of view about the difference between bullying and drama; and summarize an article about potable water shortages in a part of India that sees more than 12 times as much rainfall as Seattle.

Op-Ed: "Defining Bullying Down"
Common Core Standards: RI1, RI2, RI3, RI6, RI10, W1, W9, W10, RH4
 Emily Bazelon, the author of "Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy," writes that the misdiagnosis of bullying is making the real but limited problem seem impossible to solve. Adults are quick to label conflicts between teenagers as bullying. But when everything is labeled as bullying, are we doing a disservice to victims? 
Ms. Bazelon discusses the need to shift the social norm so that bullying moves from being shrugged off to being treated as unacceptable. But she says we can't do that if we believe, and tell our children, that bullying is everywhere.
 Your Task: Is there a difference between drama and bullying in schools? Using at least one quotation from the article, create a response to Emily Bazelon explaining your viewpoint.
 Before you do the task, you might... 

        
Determine the viewpoint of the author. Does she think bullying is being handled correctly by adults?
        
Think of your own experiences. Do you see more drama or bullying in your school? What do you think separates the two?
        
Be sure to properly introduce the quotation you are using in your argument. Who is the speaker and what makes him or her a credible source?

HEADLINE: Fuel Economy: Small Decline in 2011 and a Probable Climb in 2012, E.P.A. Says

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The E.P.A. fuel economy and emissions numbers for 2012 are preliminary, and based on sales estimates provided to the agency by automakers. 

 BODY:
An Environmental Protection Agency report issued on Friday offers a mixed picture of fleetwide fuel economy in the United States. It documents a minor decline in the 2011 model year to 22.4 miles per gallon, but projects "significant gains" to 23.8 m.p.g. for 2012, a 1.4 m.p.g. improvement over one year. The report said that the 2012 numbers, if confirmed, "would be all-time records and amongst the largest annual improvements since 1975."
The fuel economy and emissions numbers for 2012 are preliminary, and based on sales estimates provided to the agency by automakers. The actual fuel economy decline from the 2010 to 2011 model years was just 0.2 mpg, the E.P.A. said. Also in 2011, fleetwide average carbon dioxide emissions for personal vehicles increased to 398 grams per mile, up from 394 grams per mile in 2010. Carbon emissions are expected to decline to 374 grams per mile in 2012, based on projections. 
The E.P.A. said that one factor leading to the fuel economy decline in 2011 was the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency in Japan, which interrupted the flow of both new cars and parts to the American market. According to the report, the E.P.A. estimates that fleetwide fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions in model year 2011 would have been the same or "slightly better" than 2010 if Japanese manufacturers had not been constrained. Under those assumptions, the projected 2012 fuel economy improvement would also be "somewhat smaller."
Some critics seized on the 2011 fuel economy decline, not the projected increase for 2012. Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, said in an e-mailed statement: "After improving for six years, average gas mileage of all cars and trucks sold here faltered in 2011. We went into reverse because General Motors and Chrysler failed to improve fuel mileage. That had an impact when sales of more efficient Toyota and Honda vehicles dropped due to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami."
The E.P.A. report says that 2011 Toyota and Honda production fell by more than 500,000 vehicles compared to 2010. "Yet in 2011 those two automakers still delivered vehicles that averaged 3.4 m.p.g. better than those of General Motors, the U.S. sales leader," Mr. Becker said. According to the report, G.M.'s overall 2011 fuel economy was 20.7 m.p.g., and that of Honda and Toyota both 24.1 m.p.g. 
The industry sees an overall positive picture. Gloria Bergquist, a vice president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents 12 carmakers, said in a telephone interview: "All of our members are working very hard to improve fuel economy, and the good news is that it's continuing to increase. We have challenging new fuel economy standards we need to meet. There's no technology left on the shelf - it's already on dealership lots."
The report says that the widespread adoption of new technologies is helping improve fuel economy. These include variable valve timing, gasoline direct injection, the use of turbochargers and superchargers, and cylinder deactivation. Direct injection, the report said, has grown from "essentially zero" in model year 2007 to a projected 24 percent of the market in model year 2012.
David Friedman, deputy director of the Clean Vehicles Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, sees both sides. "Today's report shows the great strides automakers have made to deliver a better kind of car for the American people in 2012," he said in a statement. "But it also shows just how far they have to go. The decline of average fuel economy in model year 2011 highlights how much consumers had relied upon only a few automakers for many fuel-efficient vehicles."
The E.P.A. said that consumers have twice as many diesel and hybrid choices as they did five years ago. The number of available cars with 30 m.p.g. combined or higher grew sixfold in the same period, the agency said.

HEADLINE: What Hospitals Charge the Uninsured

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Why not link the prices that hospitals can charge the uninsured to the prices Medicare pays? an economist asks. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
Steven Brill's expos on hospital pricing in Time magazine predictably provoked from the American Hospital Association a statement seeking to correct the impression left by Mr. Brill that the United States hospital industry is hugely profitable.
In this regard, the association can cite not only its own regularly published data, but also data from the independent and authoritative Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or Medpac, established by Congress to advise it on paying the providers of health care for treating Medicare patients.

As shown by Chart 6-19 of Medpac's report from June 2012, "Health Care Spending and the Medicare Program," the average profit margin (defined as net profit divided by total revenue) for the hospital industry over all is not extraordinarily high, although for a largely nonprofit sector I would rate it more than adequate. 
But in each year there is a large variance about that year's average shown in Chart 6-19, with about 25 to 30 percent of hospitals reportedly operating in the red and many others earning margins below the averages.
The hospital association also correctly points out that under the pervasive price discrimination that is the hallmark of American health care, the profit margin a hospital earns is the product of a complicated financial juggling act among its mix of payers. 
Payers with market muscle - for example, the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs - can get away with paying prices below what it costs to treat patients (see, for example, Figure 3-5 and Table 3-4 in Chapter 3 of Medpac's March 2012 report). 
With few exceptions, private insurers tend to be relatively weak when bargaining with hospitals, so that hospitals can extract from them prices substantially in excess of the full cost of treating privately insured patients, with profit margins sometimes in excess of 20 percent. 
Finally, uninsured patients - also called "self-pay" patients - have effectively no market power at all vis--vis hospitals, especially when they are seriously ill and in acute need of care. Therefore, in principle, they can be charged the highly inflated list prices in the hospitals' chargemasters, an industry term for the large list of all charges for services and materials. These prices tend to be more than twice as high as those paid by private insurers.
To be sure, if uninsured patients are poor in income and assets, they usually are granted steep discounts off the list prices in the chargemaster. On the other hand, if uninsured patients are suspected of having good incomes and assets, then some hospitals bill them the full list prices in the chargemaster and hound them for these prices, often through bill collectors and even the courts. 
It is noteworthy that in its critique of Mr. Brill's work, the association statement is completely silent on this central issue of his report. A fair question one may ask leaders of the industry is this:
Even if one grants that American hospitals must juggle their financing in the midst of a sea of price discrimination, should uninsured, sick, middle-class Americans serve as the proper tax base from which to recoup the negative margins imposed on them by some payers, notably by public payers?
My answer is "No," and I am proud to say that when luck put in my way an opportunity to act on that view, I did.
In the fall of 2007, Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey appointed me as chairman of his New Jersey Commission on Rationalizing Health Care Resources. On a ride to the airport at that time I learned that the driver and his family did not have health insurance. The driver's 3-year-old boy had had pus coming out of a swollen eye the week before, and the bill for one test and the prescription of a cream at the emergency room of the local hospital came to more than $1,000. 
By circuitous routes I managed to get that bill reduced to $80; but I did not leave it at that. As chairman of the commission, I put hospital pricing for the uninsured on the commission's agenda. 
After some deliberation, the commission recommended initially that the New Jersey government limit the maximum prices that hospitals can charge an uninsured state resident to what private insurers pay for the services in question. But because the price of any given service paid hospitals or doctors by a private insurer in New Jersey can vary by a factor of three or more across the state (see Chapter 6 of the commission's final report), the commission eventually recommended as a more practical approach to peg the maximum allowable prices charged uninsured state residents to what Medicare pays (see Chapter 11 of the report). 
Five months after the commission filed its final report, Governor Corzine introduced and New Jersey's State Assembly passed Assembly Bill No. 2609. It limits the maximum allowable price that can be charged to uninsured New Jersey residents with incomes up to 500 percent of the federal poverty level to what Medicare pays plus 15 percent, terms the governor's office had negotiated with New Jersey's hospital industry.
I wouldn't be surprised if the New Jersey hospital industry was cross at me and the commission for our role in the passage of Assembly Bill 2609. The commission took the view that it helped protect the industry's image from some of its members' worst instincts. 
In that spirit, I invite the American Hospital Association to join me in urging federal lawmakers to pass a similar law for the nation. Evidently the mere guidelines on hospital pricing that the association published in 2004 have not been enough.
Indeed, in 2009 I had urged the designers of the Affordable Care Act to include such a provision in their bill - alas, to no avail. Courage to impose it on the industry had long been depleted.

One person was killed in a shooting before 8:00 Thursday night in Fort Wayne, Ind. Demarcus Adams, 23, was in a vehicle parked on the southeast side when another vehicle pulled up next to him and someone fired multiple shots. A woman at the scene, Denise Trigg, said the victim was her son, and that he died in her arms. Trigg also said Adams was shot near the same area last month.
WANE
A triple shooting left one person dead and one in the hospital late Tuesday in Albuquerque, N.M. On a residential street near the Winrock Mall, a bloodied man began banging on doors around 11:30 p.m., asking neighbors to call the police. Police followed the victim's trail of blood to a home, where they found a man shot to death in the kitchen. More blood led detectives to a nearby parking lot, where they found a woman in a car with another person bleeding. Police said they had few answers as to what led to the gunfire.
KOAT
A 17-year-old male in New Haven, Conn., accidentally discharged a gun Tuesday, shooting himself in the penis. The gun was in the man's pants. He ran into a nearby school, where someone called 911. "We see that the vast majority of groin shots are accidental discharges," a police spokesman said.
New Haven Register
A teen is dead following a shooting in the basement of a home in Galesburg, Ill., early Thursday. Isaiah Stevenson, 18, died as a result of a single gunshot. Police charged 20-year-old Cody Delacruz, who lived at the home, with manslaughter in connection with the shooting.

HEADLINE: NBC Executive and Leno Said to Have Clashed Over Jokes

BYLINE: BILL CARTER


HIGHLIGHT: Three executives close to the situation said that NBC&#8217;s entertainment chief had taken offense to jokes that Jay Leno made last month about NBC&#8217;s ratings struggles 

 BODY:
NBC has aggressively denied recent reports that it plans to replace Jay Leno soon as host of "The Tonight Show," but the network's top entertainment executive, Robert Greenblatt, recently stirred up a bit of a feud with the late-night star over jokes about the network.
Three executives close to the situation reported this week that Mr. Greenblatt had taken offense to monologue jokes Mr. Leno made last month in the wake of news stories about NBC's ratings struggles and how the network had fallen into fifth place in the sweeps month of February - behind the Spanish-language network Univision. 
Specifically, on the night of Feb. 28, Mr. Leno referenced the news about NBC's falling into fifth place by telling a series of jokes:
"For the first time in history NBC is going to finish fifth in the ratings period," Mr. Leno said. "We are behind the Spanish-language network Univision - or as we call it here in Los Angeles: Cinco de Ratings." He added a series of rapid-fire jokes about how bad off NBC is including: "It's so bad, 'The Biggest Loser' isn't just a TV show anymore; it's our new motto." And: "It's so bad, NBC called Manti Te'o and asked him to bring in some imaginary viewers."
Mr. Greenblatt, who has the main responsibility for the network's prime-time ratings, fired off an e-mail to Mr. Leno, according to those who were aware of the events, and complained. The executives who know about the conflict all asked not to be identified because of their ongoing dealings with NBC.
After the first e-mail from Mr. Greenblatt, two of the executives who know what transpired reported,there was an exchange of pointed e-mails between Mr. Leno and Mr. Greenblatt. 
One of the executives who saw the exchange said that Mr. Leno was taken by surprise by Mr. Greenblatt's comments and strongly defended himself, citing the fact that late-night stars poking fun "at their masters," as the executive said, is in the long tradition of late-night comedy. Every late-night star, going back at least as far as Johnny Carson, has taken shots at network fortunes within the nightly monologue.
A representative for Mr. Leno said the comedian would not comment on the situation. Mr. Greenblatt was in meetings and was not reachable Friday night, a spokesman said. 
This moment of conflict between Mr. Leno and NBC's management preceded recent reports - denied categorically by NBC executives - that the network was preparing to make a change, moving out Mr. Leno and bringing in Jimmy Fallon, the star of its 12:35 program "Late Night."
The rationale cited for the change was concern that ABC's late-night star, Jimmy Kimmel, who was recently moved to go head to head with Mr. Leno, was staking a claim to the younger viewers that are of most economic value in late-night television.
So far, Mr. Leno has continued to win consistently in almost every rating category, including among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, the chief target for late-night advertisers. Mr. Kimmel won his first week against Mr. Leno in that category, but Mr. Leno has won every week since.
NBC has not provided much help. The network's ratings in prime time have hit record lows in the past two months. NBC now regularly finishes first in the ratings in only three places: the evening newscasts, "Saturday Night Live" and Mr. Leno's "Tonight" show.

HEADLINE: Among G.O.P. Voters, Little Support for Same-Sex Marriage

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: An increasing number of high-profile Republicans, like Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, have recently announced support for same-sex marriage. But polling of rank-and-file Republicans shows they are still largely opposed. 

 BODY:
The decision by the Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, to announce his support for same-sex marriage may come to be seen as a watershed moment for gay rights advocates. Mr. Portman's announcement, which he said he made in part because his son is gay, has so far yielded relatively little pushback from Republicans on blogs and social media, or from other Republican office-holders. Instead, gay rights advocates are increasingly finding support from influential Republicans. 
But the rank and file of the Republican Party may be different, and the polling suggests that they have largely not changed their views on same-sex marriage.
According to Pew Research polls conducted each year, support for same-sex marriage has increased to 62 percent from 43 percent among Democrats since 2001. Among independent voters, support has risen to 52 percent from 43 percent over the same period. However, only 25 percent of Republican voters supported same-sex marriage in Pew's poll last year, barely changed from 21 percent in 2001.
Polling subsamples of voting groups like Republicans can entail high margins of error, but the Pew poll is largely consistent with other recent surveys.
According to an average of seven recent surveys on same-sex marriage, as shown in the chart above, only 26 percent of Republicans support same-sex marriage rights as compared with 54 percent of independents and 66 percent of Democrats. Attitudes among Republican voters may shift on the issue by 2016, particularly if more respected conservatives like Mr. Portman announce their support for same-sex marriage, but it is less than clear that his position will reflect a broadly acceptable viewpoint among Republican primary and caucus voters by that time.

HEADLINE: The Winter of the Monarch

BYLINE: By LINCOLN P. BROWER and HOMERO ARIDJIS. 
Lincoln P. Brower is a professor of zoology at the University of Florida and a professor of biology at Sweet Briar College. Homero Aridjis, a former Mexican ambassador, is the author of the poetry collection ''A Time of Angels.''

 BODY:
IN the village of Contepec, in Michoacn, a few hours northwest of Mexico City, every winter day, rivers of orange and black butterflies would stream through the streets in search of water, swooping down from the Oyamel fir forest on Altamirano Hill. One of us, Homero, grew up with the monarch butterflies. The other, Lincoln, saw them for the first time in 1977, also in Michoacn, on a mountain called Sierra Chincua, where the branches of hundreds of fir trees were covered with butterflies that exploded into glorious flight when warmed by the sun.
Today the winter monarch colonies, which are found west of Mexico City, in an area of about 60 miles by 60 miles, are a pitiful remnant of their former splendor. The aggregate area covered by the colonies dwindled from an average of 22 acres between 1994 and 2003 to 12 acres between 2003 and 2012. This year's area, which was reported on Wednesday, hit a record low of 2.9 acres. 
Reasons for the decline are multiple, including: out-of-control ecotourism, extreme weather and diversion of water. Two threats loom above all others: the destruction of breeding habitat in the United States because of the widespread use of powerful herbicides and genetically engineered crops, and illegal logging in Mexico's high-elevation Oyamel fir forests.
Deforestation has always been a dark shadow lurking in these beautiful mountains, and it has never been adequately dealt with by the Mexican government. In the 1980s, horrified television viewers watched footage of loggers armed with chain saws felling trees covered with butterflies and log-laden trucks crushing butterflies as they drove down the mountains. That led to the establishment, in 1986, of the Monarch Butterfly Special Biosphere Reserve, within which logging was outlawed. But still it continued.
In recent years, news releases from Mexico based on aerial imagery have claimed that illegal logging inside the reserve has been reduced to virtually zero. But these reports are incomplete and misleading, as they measure only visible deforestation in the core zone of the reserve, about a fourth of the protected 217-square-mile area. Forest loss in the surrounding areas is not reported, nor is the magnitude of local logging, in which individual trees are removed from the core area. This ''selective cutting'' is not visible in the aerial imagery, and yet it alters the forest microclimate and increases monarch butterflies' risks of starving and freezing.
Ecotourism is presenting an additional threat to the butterflies as its popularity increases. As regular visitors to the monarch colonies, we have seen the conditions in these areas deteriorate, for butterflies and tourists. Along the heavily used trails that lead to the colonies in Piedra Herrada and Sierra Chincua, extensive areas of vegetation have been killed. Excessive dust, which now rises into the air with each step, is hazardous to the butterflies because it clogs their respiratory orifices. When we visited the Piedra Herrada site this February, along with former President Jimmy Carter, a welcome sign on the trail leading to the butterflies read, ''No more than 20 people in the Sanctuary.'' And yet we counted 24 tourist buses in the parking lot.
So what can be done? Ecotourism is an important part of the local economy, but we must make sure that its costs in habitat degradation and increased butterfly mortality don't kill the goose that lays the golden egg. The Mexican government has made strides in reducing much -- but not all -- illegal logging, and needs to do more. The United States, for its part, should re-examine the extent to which industrialized herbicide-based agriculture is destroying the flora in the Midwestern United States that monarchs depend on in the spring and summer. In addition to all of this, we simply need better data on the butterflies.
Measuring the size, location and survival rate of each colony that winters in Mexico is the responsibility of World Wildlife Fund Mexico and the staff of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve. Sites are measured in December, and the total areas in each of the major locations are reported, usually in February or March. But, although W.W.F. Mexico has more specific data, the published reports are not detailed enough to allow scientists to review the status of individual colonies or to evaluate the butterflies' survival in relation to forest condition. W.W.F. Mexico must release data on where the butterflies roost each year, whether each colony is increasing or decreasing in size, and what the mortality rates are at each site.
If some are doing better than others, we must learn why. If, as we fear, all are diminishing, then we should ask why the current management plans, both in Mexico and in the United States, are failing.
We are fortunate to have experienced the magnificent overwintering phenomenon over more than three decades. We hope that better stewardship will allow the monarch butterflies to continue to festoon the Oyamel forests of Mexico for generations to come.

HEADLINE: Arizona Border Quiets After Gains in Security

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON; Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
NOGALES, Ariz. -- Flying low along the Mexican line in a Black Hawk helicopter, the United States Border Patrol officer saw surveillance towers rising above the cactus. He saw his agents' white and green trucks moving among the mesquite, scouting for illegal crossers.
Far overhead, a remotely guided drone beamed images of the terrain to an intelligence center in Tucson. Pilots cruised in reconnaissance planes carrying radars and infrared cameras that could distinguish a migrant with a backpack from a wild animal from many miles away.
Sabri Dikman, the patrol's executive officer for this region, liked what he saw -- and what he did not see. If any illegal migrants were trying to make their way into the United States, he said, the chances were very good that agents would find and detain them.
''We know what we're dealing with and where we are dealing with it,'' Mr. Dikman said. ''In some manner we have the capacity to observe every part of the border of Arizona.'' 
As Congress debates a broad overhaul of the immigration laws, including a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, skeptical lawmakers are asking if the Southwest border is secure enough to withstand any new wave of illegal crossings that might be spurred by a legalization program, or by new growth in the American economy.
Officers who guard the line say the border is more secure in most places than they have ever known it. They say they are in a strong position to hold off an illegal surge, and to show why they point to Arizona, once the busiest and most contentious border battlefront. To the east, in Texas, agents are still struggling to stop persistent migrants in hundreds of miles of varying and penetrable terrain. But in Arizona, every available measure shows steep declines in the number of people making it across, figures that border agents say demonstrate what they can accomplish.
In Congress, many Republicans recall that an amnesty in 1986, which was supposed to solve illegal migration, was followed by an even larger unauthorized influx. A bipartisan group in the Senate is working on a proposal that would require measurable gains in border security before immigrants would be allowed to proceed onto a path to full citizenship.
But to border officials here, Congress seems to be behind the times, failing to notice that they have already made many of the enforcement advances that lawmakers are seeking. Since 2005, the number of patrol agents in the Southwest has nearly doubled, to more than 18,000. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, has built its air wing to more than 260 aircraft. It acquired an array of technology, including ground sensors and aerial detection devices developed by the Defense Department in Iraq and Afghanistan, and created a military-style command structure with expanded intelligence operations to coordinate agents on the ground.
While tightening the border, officials also created a system of penalties for those who get past it, making it far more likely that migrants who were caught would be jailed, prosecuted as criminals, or expelled from the country far from the place where they tried to enter.
Border officers, once a beleaguered force overwhelmed by illegal flows, have acquired a bit of swagger.
''It's all of these things coming together that have really given us the capability to bring the border to a level of security that is, in my opinion, unprecedented,'' said David V. Aguilar, the agency's commissioner, who will retire this month after 34 years on the borders. ''We haven't seen this lack of activity in 25, 30 years,'' he said.
In Arizona in 2005, more than 577,000 apprehensions were made of migrants crossing illegally, a surge that sparked a political furor in the state. Border officials declared that they would make a ''last stand'' here.
Last year in Arizona, the apprehensions (an imperfect but still useful indicator of unauthorized flows) dropped to 126,500, a 78 percent decline from 2005, a sharper decrease than seen elsewhere along the border. The recession in this country and drug-trafficking violence in Mexico also contributed to the falloff, here and along the length of the border. But in 2005, about half of all apprehensions in the Southwest were made in Arizona. Today, it is closer to one-third, with the largest share now shifted to Texas.
Mr. Dikman remembers the bad old days, when the agents' rule of thumb was to open a formal deportation only after an illegal crosser had been caught and expelled to Mexico 18 times.
Now, Customs and Border Protection is adjusting its strategies to the reality of greatly reduced numbers, but more troublesome adversaries.
Jeffrey Self, the commander of the agency's Joint Field Command for Arizona, based in Tucson, said migrants rarely try to cross these days without hiring a coyote, or smuggler, and those guides are generally linked to narcotics organizations in Mexico.
''It's pretty much all organized smuggling at this point and it's pretty much all controlled by the transnational criminal organizations that operate over there,'' Mr. Self said.
Border officials worry there may not be much more they can do with enforcement alone to further reduce illegal crossings and sharpen the focus of their operations on criminal threats, without other changes in the immigration equation.
''If this country has a continued demand for labor by way of our market economy,'' said Mr. Aguilar, the commissioner, ''you have a baseline draw for illegal immigrants.''
He said if Washington created more legal channels for migrants who want to come to this country primarily to work, it could significantly cut the numbers of people trying to pass illegally, freeing border officers to pursue traffickers and other criminals.
''Now that would be a tremendous force multiplier,'' Mr. Aguilar said. Lawmakers are considering proposals for some form of temporary guest worker program, and also measures to give legal status particularly to migrant farmworkers.
Officials said border gains could also be affected if Congress imposed deep budget cuts. Last week Mr. Aguilar announced the beginning of 14-day furloughs for his agency's employees under the sequester.
Twin Cities
Here in Nogales, a laid-back border town that surrounds the largest port of entry in Arizona, Border Patrol vehicles drive freely along the dirt road along an 18-foot barrier of metal poles that divides the American city from its Mexican twin, also called Nogales. Until recently, agents had to keep a distance. But Leslie Lawson, the top Border Patrol agent in Nogales, Ariz., said the barrier was an example of a small tweak that made a big difference.
A lower fence built in the 1990s had been covered with mats to prevent Mexicans from seeing through. Smugglers would send people or narcotics over the fence, then hurl rocks at agents from hills on the Mexican side while the migrants slipped away into nearby gulches. In 2011, Ms. Lawson's sector had more rock assaults on agents than any other in the country -- 170 in all.
Last year three miles of the old fence was replaced with the poles, set just far enough apart to see through. Agents can spot migrants before they approach it. Rock assaults are down 60 percent.
''Every day the smugglers will change their tactics,'' Ms. Lawson said. ''They are always watching us. So we are always changing our tactics.''
With tighter security along the line, more undocumented foreigners are trying to come through the border station. But recent changes have made it more difficult for smugglers to pass their clients with forged papers. Instead, officials said, smugglers rent out valid United States documents, and encourage their clients to make themselves look as much as possible like the people in the photographs.
One day in late February, an elderly Mexican woman and a Mexican farmworker were stopped at the Nogales crossing after they presented documents that were legitimate but did not belong to them.
A sharp-eyed customs inspector at the pedestrian walkway also singled out an 18-year-old Mexican girl who had a valid border crossing card but also a nervous twitch. A pat-down revealed that the teenager, Selena Andrea Perez Cruz, had stashed nearly a pound of heroin in her bra.
Ms. Perez Cruz was turned over to federal authorities in Arizona for narcotics prosecution. But officers were not done with the other Mexicans either. Part of the Customs and Border Protection strategy is to ensure that almost all migrants who are detained face a penalty on this side before being deported -- what officers call their consequence delivery system. Commander Self said some penalty was applied to at least 90 percent of illegal migrants apprehended at the state's border.
In a holding cell, the Mexican grandmother, who said she had hoped to reunite with relatives in Arizona, was formally booked. Her record would remain in federal databases after she was expelled. If she was ever caught trying to enter the United States illegally again, she could face felony charges and months, if not years, in prison.
Other forlorn Mexicans stopped in Arizona were waiting to be deported through a transfer program, another one of the consequences. They would be taken by bus three days east and expelled at Del Rio, Tex.
Officers use the transfers ''to break that smuggling cycle, to separate the smuggled aliens from the smugglers and the guides,'' Commander Self explained.
Some migrants detained in Nogales would be turned over, under a consequence program called Operation Streamline, for criminal prosecution. In Yuma, which has applied the program for six years to virtually every illegal crosser, the fast-track cases have clogged the federal courts and drawn a host of complaints from legal rights groups.
But their impact is unmistakable. In 2005, more than 138,000 apprehensions were recorded in Yuma. By last year, the number had decreased to 6,500, a decline of 95 percent. Since authorities began to apply the consequence system five years ago across the southwest border, the numbers of deportees who try to cross again within a year has consistently declined.
Measures of Change
One defender in Nogales of the border agency's progress is the mayor, Arturo Garino. He says his city has become one of the safest in Arizona, with one murder in the past six years.
''We used to have street chases all the time,'' he said in an interview in City Hall. ''Now all those things are gone, something you don't even hear about.'' He said lawmakers in distant Washington should concentrate on fixing the immigration system.
''I don't care how many more Border Patrol you have,'' Mr. Garino said. ''You can't secure this border any more than it is right now, and that is a fact. Do we want to line them up, hand in hand, all the way to Texas?''
Beyond urban areas, however, control is spottier. Ranchers close to the border report that they often see migrants on their property, and they do not feel safe.
But added staff and technology have greatly expanded what Customs and Border Protection officers call their situational awareness. On a wall of video screens in his command center in Tucson, Commander Self can summon aerial images of vast swaths of borderland. Thousands of agents are patrolling in vehicles, on all-terrain vehicles and on horseback. When incidents arise, the closest ones can be quickly dispatched.
But greater efficiency has exacted a human toll. Migrants have been pushed ever farther toward the rock faces and remote valleys of the border's most deadly landscape. Migrants pay smugglers higher fees, but with security tight, the coyotes no longer feel any obligation to finish the job of guiding them to the United States.
According to data compiled by The Arizona Daily Star, last year 172 bodies were found in the state's border desert.
In late February, on a mountain flank west of the border outpost of Sasabe, 19 migrants tried to slip past the Border Patrol's deployment. A rare blizzard had brought a biting freeze, frosting the saguaro cactuses with snow. With only light jackets and plastic ponchos, the men, from Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala, spent three nights in the cold while their hired coyotes searched for an opening between agents on horseback and surveillance planes overhead.
On the fourth morning, inside United States territory, the men arose to discover that their guides had fled.
Utterly lost, they chose to turn back. After another six hours wandering through cactus brush into Mexico, they happened upon a Mexican government rescue group. The men were mute with hunger and thirst.
After a gulp of water, Helio Len Reyes, 31, a Mexican from the state of Guerrero, began to cry. The cold, he said in Spanish, ''was too much to bear.'' His feet were still stiff with cramps, and his money was lost to the smugglers.
Mr. Len said he had hoped to make it to New York, where a brother lives. But he decided on that day that his trip to the United States was over. He would go back to his wife and children. ''This is too complicated,'' he said.

The truth is that many of these loans should not be made because the student cannot afford to repay them. Over 12 percent of student loans are in default and 44 percent (!) are in deferment. We as taxpayers will end up paying this burden. Anyone remember what happened to Fannie/Freddie? A 3.4 percent interest rate, or even 6.8 percent, is too low considering many of these loans will never be paid. 
-- ZK, San Diego
Rates for graduate loans are already at 6.8 percent. I'm in an international graduate program and lots of foreign students have expressed astonishment at the high costs of receiving an education in the United States. It's particularly sad because we were one of the first nations to offer free public education at the end of the 19th century. We have strayed far from our original values.
-- Katie, Paris
Last week in her Your Money column, Tara Siegel Bernard wrote about the many financial decisions facing new parents. Readers wrote in to share their thoughts. Here is a sampling.
We got life insurance, disability insurance and a long-term care plan. We are VERY grateful that we did all three; the kids are still minors and we've used them all. We made wills. For the guardian, we couldn't decide among our various siblings so instead we wrote that we wanted our parents to select from among our siblings, depending on whose circumstances would work best to be guardians. Thank goodness, we haven't needed the guardians yet! We did set up a trust for the life insurance, and the trustees are not the guardians. Different people we love and trust have different strengths. -- Citizen, Maryland
We crossed our fingers and hoped for the best. Five years later and we're all doing just fine.
-- Lonnie Feldman, Brooklyn
We prepared by looking at our finances and realizing we couldn't afford a baby. We're both college-educated, recently debt-free full-time workers since we graduated in our early 20s. We're doing O.K. financially without children, but we couldn't make ends meet on one salary and can't afford day care, let alone the other expenses. I'm 38 now, but even if we cut every luxury and saved every extra dime, we still couldn't afford to start a family by the time I turn 40. So that pretty much settled it. It's a little heartbreaking, but we can't afford to have children. I think we're pretty lucky just to have health insurance right now. -- Leah, New York

HEADLINE: Student Loans: Rate at Issue

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
It's March, and it's dj vu all over again as students and consumer advocates try to raise awareness of a coming increase in interest rates on some federal student loans. 
On July 1, just like last year, rates on subsidized loans made to low- and moderate-income undergraduates under the federal Stafford program are scheduled to double. Again, like last year, the rate is set to rise to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent for new loans made after June 30.
In case you've forgotten, here's a recap. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 reduced rates on subsidized Stafford loans over four academic years, to the current 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent. But the rates are scheduled to bounce back up, unless Congress acts to extend the current rate.
Last year, Congress extended the lower rates for one year. So, here we are again.
On Wednesday, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce will debate the costs and benefits of the federal student loan program, including student loan interest rates.
The debate comes as growing student debt, which has reached $1 trillion, has become a concern for policy makers and regulators.
''Congress must not double the rate,'' said Ethan Senack, higher education advocate with the United States Public Interest Research Group. The group and student leaders are calling on Congress make the rate reduction permanent. The group estimated that the lower rates this academic year saved nearly 8 million students about $1,000 each on their loan costs.
Do you depend on subsidized Stafford loans? How would the rate increase affect you?

HEADLINE: Seen From Greece, Great Depression Looks Good

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
FIVE years into the Great Depression, one out of five workers in the United States was unemployed. The economy was nearly 20 percent smaller in 1934 than it had been at the peak, in 1929.
The Greeks can only wish they had it so good.
The Greek government this week released its estimate of economic output in the fourth quarter of last year, and also published its unemployment report. 
For the year as a whole, the Greek economy, measured in 2005 euros, fell to 168.5 billion euros, down 6.4 percent from the previous year. That was a little better than the 7.1 percent decline in 2011. The last time the Greek economy was smaller than in 2012 was in 2001. The cumulative decline since 2007 was 20.1 percent.
In December, the unemployment rate was 26.4 percent, and that figure actually looked a little encouraging because it was lower than the 26.6 percent reported for November. Not since May 2008, when the rate fell half a percentage point to 7.3 percent, had there been a single month when the unemployment rate was reported to have fallen.
The accompanying charts compare the changes in gross domestic product and unemployment in the United States during the five years after 1929 with the changes in Greece during the five years after 2007.
There is reason to take all the numbers with a grain of salt. The American figures were estimated after the fact, by the government for G.D.P. and by the National Bureau of Economic Research for unemployment. For G.D.P., only annual changes were estimated.
The Hellenic Statistics Authority, Greece's compiler of official numbers, has a history of deception -- the country lied to get into the euro zone -- and it now cannot apply seasonal adjustments to its quarterly G.D.P. estimates. As a result, the figures shown in the charts are calculated by adding up the four quarters of each year. But European officials now vouch for the quality of Greek figures.
Perhaps the most telling difference between the course of the two economies comes in government consumption spending -- basically spending that is not for investment, as in building roads or bombers. In the United States, that spending was growing even under President Herbert Hoover and helped to cushion the economy's fall. In Greece, required by Europe to follow a course of harsh austerity, that spending has fallen rapidly, even if it has not declined as rapidly as some Europeans want.
By the fifth year of the Depression, personal consumption spending had begun to recover in the United States. In Greece last year, it fell 9.1 percent, more than in any other year of the downturn.
Greece publishes monthly overall unemployment figures, but provides details only on a quarterly basis. The charts show the trends of joblessness by sex and age group through the third quarter of last year, the most recent available. Women are more likely to be unemployed in every age group shown, and older workers are far less likely to be jobless than younger ones. Even the groups that look good by comparison are doing poorly. Among men age 45 to 64, nearly one in six is out of work. Among men 30 to 44, the figure is one in five.
Rates for teenagers and people over 65 are not shown, since few of them are in the labor force. The picture is glum for those teenagers who do want jobs. The male unemployment rate is 52 percent, and the rate for women is 81.5 percent. Most of those over 65 who say they want to work do have jobs, but the proportion of such people in the labor force has been falling in recent years.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: After Five Years: when the Great Recession began five years ago, there were fears it could turn into a new Great Depression. That did not happen--except in Greece. This week Greece reported that its real gross domestic product fell for the fifth consecutive year, leaving the 2012 Greek economy 20 percent smaller than it was in 2007. The charts contrast the past five years in Greece with the same period after 1929 in the United States. All figures are adjusted for inflation. The economic numbers show the total change for each year compared with the base year.

HEADLINE: New Premier in China Faces Test on Economy

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's new prime minister, Li Keqiang, entered the job on Friday inheriting a wobbling economy that could distract his government from its bold vows to clean up pollution and harness expanding towns and cities as an engine for growth.
Mr. Li is the latest Communist Party leader whose promotion to a top government post was confirmed by the National People's Congress, the party-run Parliament that is finishing a transfer of elite power that was started at a party meeting in November. He succeeds Wen Jiabao in a position that entails steering the economy and government operations through the State Council, or cabinet. 
On Thursday, the nearly 3,000 compliant Parliament delegates installed the party chief, Xi Jinping, as president, and on Saturday they will appoint deputy prime ministers, ministers and other senior officials.
Mr. Li, 57, has already laid out a vision of economic uplift driven by urbanization. He gained a doctorate in economics from Peking University, where he wrote about narrowing the urban-rural gulf. In the months leading up to his elevation as prime minister, he has said that faster and sounder expansion of towns and cities will be a priority, and he told Parliament delegates that absorbing rural migrants into urban areas would require more spending.
''Meshing together urban and rural development means we must speed up social improvements, with a focus on welfare and livelihood needs,'' Mr. Li said last week, according to the news agency Xinhua. ''Government work and fiscal outlays must continue to be tilted toward livelihood needs,'' he added, naming education, health care and housing as among the spending priorities.
Yet Mr. Li inherits economic hazards that could preoccupy his government and deter bold policy moves. The hazards include an overheated property market that has defied government measures intended to tame price increases and make housing more affordable, worries about debts run up by local governments, and cautious lower-income consumers who remain reluctant to spend at the level many economists say is needed for healthy growth over the long term.
''I do think that there are some signs that, first of all, they recognize this is a new world, and the market economy or liberalization has given great successes but also great vulnerabilities,'' said Yukon Huang, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington who studies the Chinese economy.
Mr. Li and his cohort believe that China ''needs a growth driver in the next 5, 10, 15 years, because it can't rely upon exports again and can't rely on investment expansion for the sake of investment expansion,'' Mr. Huang said.
Last year, China's economy grew by 7.8 percent, compared with a year earlier, the slowest pace since 1999. The property market has been a driver of that growth, but a recent sharp rise in prices has kindled jitters about a potential bubble. On March 1, Mr. Wen's State Council took a parting jab at the sector, demanding that local governments enforce an earlier rule imposing a 20 percent tax on profits when people sell secondary homes.
Votes by the National People's Congress are a predictable ritual, with party officials exercising discipline behind the scenes to ensure that there are no upsets, but there were pinpricks of dissent. On Thursday, one delegate voted against Mr. Xi to succeed Hu Jintao as president, and three abstained. Mr. Li attracted three ''no'' votes and six abstentions among the 2,949 votes counted as valid. The secret electronic ballot makes it impossible to publicly identify the dissenters, despite the avid curiosity voiced by some Chinese online.
Another prominent economic decision maker in the new government will be the incoming deputy prime minister Wang Yang, a former party secretary of Guangdong Province in southern China who cast himself as a reformer willing to challenge entrenched privilege.
Lou Jiwei, the chairman and chief executive of the China Investment Corporation, a sovereign wealth fund, appears likely to become finance minister. He will oversee thorny issues like revamping taxation and dealing with debt-saddled local governments that complain of having too many spending burdens.
However, the likely retention of Zhou Xiaochuan as the leader of the People's Bank of China, or central bank, reflects the anxieties weighing on the new leadership, analysts say. Mr. Zhou was dropped from the party's Central Committee -- a council of senior officials -- in November, and he is 65, an age when retirement becomes likely for officials of his rank. But he appears likely to keep his job for now.
''I think that is an indication that they haven't built up any successor,'' said Joerg Wuttke, a former president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. ''They don't trust anybody else, maybe, to deal with a potential financial crisis.''
''They need an experienced old hand, and they can't let him go,'' he said.
Mr. Li grew up in rural Anhui Province and worked for years on one of the impoverished farm communes that Mao Zedong believed could deliver communist equality and bountiful harvests. In late 1977, he won a place in the prestigious Peking University, where he studied law before moving on to economics, and he retains a bookish demeanor and a confident grasp of English. Like his mentor, Mr. Hu, he made his start up the leadership ladder in the Communist Party's Youth League.
Mr. Wen left office dogged by unwelcome attention on his family, which was the subject of a report by The New York Times into its wealth, and lamenting that he ''fell short in some tasks'' to improve people's lives. Mr. Li and his colleagues appear eager to avoid being tainted with the same accusations of frustrated promises, said Damien Ma, a researcher at the Paulson Institute, a center in Chicago focused on China-United States relations.
''They've got to show that they're willing to act,'' Mr. Ma said. ''Before they felt that they could defer reforms, and they did.''
Mr. Li is scheduled to give his first news conference as prime minister on Sunday, after the end of the parliamentary session.

HEADLINE: On Western Lands, A Free-Market Path

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
REDSTONE, Colo. -- Deep in the jagged heart of central Colorado lies one of the world's most beautiful backyards: a rugged and wild quilt of national forest where elk roam and bobcats hunt. It is public land, and as the song says, made for you and me. But the rights to drill it for oil and gas belong to private companies.
Stories of fiercely loved lands like this one often chart a predictable path. Residents opposed to drilling lodge protests with the government, and when that fails, they head to court. But recently, environmental advocates have begun banding together with ranchers, hunters and rich landowners with a novel tactic to preserve the landscapes of the West: they buy out their opponents. 
For years, conservation groups across the country have hammered out deals to preserve private ranches and old homesteads as parks and open space, rather than see them sold off to become mini-malls or subdivisions. But the federal government is the biggest landlord in the West, and one cannot simply buy a forest or mountain to keep it from being drilled.
Instead, conservation groups are trying to buy the mineral leases that oil and gas companies purchase from the federal government at regular energy auctions, sometimes for as little as $2 an acre. Conservation groups pay the companies a premium to buy up the leases. Then elected officials draw up laws to ensure that nobody else will be able to drill there in the future. And the land is forever enshrined as open country, locking away whatever resources may lie beneath.
The groups have had some early successes. Along the Montana-Canada border, conservationists raised $10 million in a deal with Canadian officials to persuade companies to abandon their rights to mine for coal and gold along the North Fork of the Flathead River, which flows to Glacier National Park. Oil companies on the American side of the border also gave up additional drilling claims.
In Wyoming, the Trust for Public Land and groups of fishermen, steelworkers and others raised $8.75 million to buy out the oil and gas leases on 58,000 acres of forests and mountains. They held benefit concerts, auctioned a guitar signed by Johnny Depp and brought in $100 donations from people across Wyoming and the country. Mostly, their effort leaned on the largess of benefactors like Hansjrg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire who gave $4.25 million.
''It is a template of how to do this,'' said Chris Deming, who managed the buyouts for the Trust for Public Land. ''We were able to take a very businesslike approach. That's key.''
But here in the Elk Mountains of Colorado, the free-market path has been as twisting and as unpredictable as a hike into the harshest wilderness.
For five years, few people, if any, who hiked and hunted and fished and cycled around the 220,000 acres of rumpled national forest known as the Thompson Divide knew it had been auctioned off for energy development. After 61 leases were auctioned in 2003, nothing really happened. Ranchers led their cows to summer pastures on the land. Guides led hunters into the mountains, toward herds of migrating elk and deer. The companies did not survey the land, build roads, file for drilling permits or take any other steps that usually draw a region's attention.
Around 2008, environmental lawyers and activists discovered the land had been opened to energy development. Residents quickly knitted together a coalition of liberal and conservative local governments, ranchers, hunters, anglers and environmentalists to devise a way to prevent the drilling.
''It would absolutely devastate us,'' said Bill Fales, a rancher whose 200 head of cattle spend their summers munching grass on the forest lands that are now open for drilling.
So the residents cobbled together promises of money from local landowners, the cattle association and others, and they made their offer to the oil and gas companies. They would pay $2.5 million to buy the leases, the same per-acre price that the energy producers paid at auction.
''We want to reimburse industry. We want to make them whole,'' said Zane Kessler, the executive director of the Thompson Divide Coalition, which is leading the efforts.
Of the eight companies with major stakes in the land, only three responded, and they said no, Mr. Kessler said. SG Interests, a company based in Houston, has filed six drilling permits on the land, and said that the $2.5 million offer did not represent the true value of the gas locked in the layers of shale beneath the ground.
''This is a business for us,'' Eric Sanford, the company's Colorado operations and land manager, told a meeting of community members recently. ''We plan on doing it productively and economically.''
The companies have not made formal counteroffers, Mr. Kessler said, but some have suggested that the gas underneath the land could be worth $1 billion. Now, even as the companies make preparations to drill, they have said they are still willing to negotiate.
Like the conservation efforts in Wyoming, reaching a deal would require additional help from Washington. Because federal land can be auctioned off again if an energy lease expires, advocates need legislation to permanently protect the land from future drilling, and to ensure that the rights they hope to buy would forever stay in their hands. Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, has drafted such a law, but has not yet introduced it.
As both sides skirmish, the 10-year life span of many of the gas leases is nearing an end.
Nineteen of the leases are set to expire on May 31, with others running out in July and August. The companies holding the leases have asked the government for more time, but after nearly a decade, some residents hope that the federal Bureau of Land Management will simply let them lapse. At the second presidential debate, President Obama said that energy companies hoping to drill on public lands had to ''use it or lose it,'' and residents have said it is time to turn the land back over to the public.
Mr. Kessler is still holding out hope for a permanent deal.
''The coalition is willing to raise whatever is necessary is possible to buy these leases out,'' he said. ''We're in the 11th hour. These leases expire in two or three months. Our offer is still on the table.''

HEADLINE: Economy Rolls Along, Despite Cuts And Taxes

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The American economy appears to be bucking the headwinds from Washington, buoyed by healthy business activity and resilient consumers.
The latest evidence came on Friday with a better-than-expected report on industrial production, led by a jump in the automobile sector. It follows bullish indicators earlier in the week, including a drop in new unemployment claims and strong retail sales.
The data has surprised economists like Ethan Harris of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who on Friday revised upward the company's prediction for growth in the first quarter to 3 percent from an earlier estimate of 2 percent. 
Many experts had been looking for more of a drag from the restoration of full Social Security taxes in January and the automatic, across-the-board cuts in federal spending that began March 1, a process known as sequestration.
''It feels like the economy has some momentum and is in a little bit better shape to handle the sequester,'' Mr. Harris said. While higher taxes and lower federal spending are a ''speed bump,'' he said, ''the economy has better shock absorbers.''
Industrial production jumped 0.7 percent in February, the biggest gain in three months, the Federal Reserve said. Economists had been expecting a 0.4 percent rise.
Factory production and hiring are being bolstered in part by a rebound in China, which is driving output and exports among many major corporations, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors.
The Chinese economy, the world's second-largest, slowed last summer and fall but regained momentum in recent months. To be sure, there are still reasons to be cautious, particularly in spring and early summer, when the combined force of Washington's fiscal restraint is expected to have its biggest impact.
Gasoline prices have also been rising. Higher gas prices helped lift consumer prices by 0.7 percent in February, although the less volatile core reading that is closely followed by the Fed was up just 0.2 percent, according to other data released Friday by the Labor Department.
The jump in payroll taxes and gas prices is squeezing lower-income consumers in particular, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG.
Big-ticket items like homes and cars continue to sell well, but otherwise-strong retail sales data out earlier this week showed that spending at restaurants declined for the second month in a row.
''People who can't afford it aren't going out as much to eat,'' Mr. Blitz said.
Consumer confidence is also shaky. The preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan reading for March showed an unexpected drop Friday, dropping to 71.8, from 77.6 in February, its lowest level since December 2011. But so far consumers have not markedly changed their spending habits; retail sales data on Wednesday was better than had been expected.
The improved retail spending over all was the ''clincher'' in Mr. Harris's decision to raise his forecast for growth.
Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, said that the wariness of consumers in the new survey ''may simply be a vote of no confidence in the government and the problems in Washington. It may not be represented in what consumers do.''
According to Mr. Gault, the most important factor underlying the economy's recent strength is an improving housing sector -- a trend that may be further confirmed next week when Februrary statistics are released on housing starts and home sales.
Not only do consumers feel more confident about spending when home values are rising, Mr. Gault said, but growth in the housing sector also results in greater demand for goods like furniture, carpeting and other furnishings.
There are suggestions of that kind of trickle-down in other recent economic reports. Of the 236,000 jobs the government reported as being created in February, 48,000 were in the construction sector. Similarly, building supplies were among the strongest components in the most recent report on retail sales.
''Housing helps everything,'' said Mr. Gault, who also lifted his estimates for growth in the first quarter.
Like Mr. Harris and several other economic forecasters, he also foresees a temporary slowdown in the second quarter when the worst fallout from the sequester and the higher taxes is expected to show up in the economy's Geiger counters.
Despite the more robust indicators in recent weeks, the Fed is expected to maintain its efforts to keep interest rates ultralow and pump tens of billions of dollars into the economy each month, a policy known as quantitative easing. The majority of Fed officials have said they would not consider a shift in policy as long as unemployment was above 6.5 percent. Fed policy makers are to meet Tuesday and Wednesday.
While unemployment has come down slowly from its recent high of 10 percent, economists say the Fed's easy money policy has been integral to keeping the economy moving, as well as lifting the stock market to new highs. The Fed is pumping $85 billion into the financial system each month -- about what the sequester will drain from the economy between now and Sept. 30, said Maury Harris, chief United States economist at UBS.
The money created by the Fed's policies is slowly filtering its way through the economy as banks ease lending standards and increase some lines of credit.
''It's not as quick as everyone hoped, but the money is being deployed,'' said Mr. Harris. ''It has a lot of knock-on effects.''

HEADLINE: Ethanol Surplus May Lift Gas Prices

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A glut of ethanol in the gasoline supply is threatening to push up prices at the pump and may have exacerbated the growing cost gap between regular gasoline and premium, some oil experts say.
Refiners have been trading so-called ethanol credits furiously in an effort to meet federal environmental mandates, helping to significantly push up the cost of those credits -- a jump to more than $1 from a few pennies in the last several days, and drivers are feeling the effects, experts say.
Prices for premium gas are now about 30.2 cents over the price of regular, according to Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey. That is up from 24.1 cents in 2010 and 18.2 cents in 2000. Any increases could affect about a third of this year's car models, because premium fuel is required or recommended for them, according to Edmunds.com. 
Experts disagree on the reasons for a widening gap between the costs of regular and premium gas. Reasons for the ethanol surplus are even more broadly in dispute, between producers and the oil companies. Gas companies are required under federal law to blend a certain number of gallons of ethanol into the fuel. But refiners argue that some cannot reach that requirement because they are nearing or at the so-called blend wall, the maximum percentage of ethanol in gasoline that most gas stations can handle, 10 percent. They also note that is the maximum level recommended by auto manufacturers for most cars.
Refiners blame Congress, arguing that the ethanol quota was set at a time when gasoline demand was expected to rise steadily. Instead, demand has declined, and refiners, obligated to blend more ethanol than they can actually use, have resorted to buying a lot of ethanol credits, known as renewable identification numbers (or RINs), to meet the mandated levels.
Ms. Lundberg described this as ''buying forgiveness from the government.'' The credits' popularity has driven up the price nearly tenfold since January.
On the other side of the debate are the ethanol producers, who say prices are pushed lower because their product is cheaper than gasoline. This is true on a gallon-per-gallon basis, although ethanol provides less energy per gallon.
The argument over ethanol and gas prices highlights the politics of the Renewable Fuel Standard, set by a 2007 law. The ethanol lobby accuses the oil companies of ratcheting up the demand for fuel credits as a way of applying pressure on lawmakers to reduce the alternative fuel mandates. Congress could change the rules, or the Environmental Protection Agency, which set up the electronic marketplace where ethanol credits are traded, could adjust them.
The ethanol credits, like some other kinds of environmental credits, can be banked as well as bought and sold. Some companies have a surplus. But those without them have rushed into a market that is thinly traded, driving the spike in prices, according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade association.
''The market's broken, because the Renewable Fuel Standard has been broken since the day it was enacted,'' said Charles T. Drevna, president of the group. The refiners rely on a certain amount of ethanol as a way to increase octane, but they have been fighting the standard since it was created, partly because it requires them to use advanced biofuels that are not actually in commercial production.
Oil refiners also warn that higher prices for the credits will encourage fraud, something the ethanol trading system has encountered in the past.
There are two ways the ethanol credit issue could drive gas prices higher. Mr. Drevna said that refiners would probably seek to recover the cost of the credits, which were a mere seven cents or so at the beginning of this year, in the prices they charge. And Eric G. Lee, an analyst at Citi Research, said that some refiners might seek to avoid the ethanol requirement by exporting their gas, which could tighten supplies in the United States.
According to Mr. Lee, large refiners spent $100 million to $300 million each for credits in 2012, when prices were about 4 cents. ''At $1 a gallon levels, the numbers become astronomical very quickly,'' he said Wednesday.
But at the Renewable Fuels Association, Bob Dinneen, the president, said that the refiners were the sellers of the credits as well as the buyers, so that it was a flow of money among the oil companies. Ethanol companies make the fuel, he said, and sell it to refiners, who either use it themselves to meet their obligations, or use it but spin off the credit for sale to someone else.
''When I see volatility like that in any market, it's not market fundamentals at work, it's probably something else all together,'' he said. ''It's more like the oil companies trying to create a little hysteria to support the notion that the Renewable Fuel Standard is broken, but I think it's working just fine.''
He said oil companies should be investing in stations so that they can sell e85, the blend that is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gas, which millions of ''flex fuel'' cars can use, or e15, the 15 percent blend. The E.P.A. has approved e15 for most cars but the manufacturers advise against using it, and most service stations would need substantial investments in new equipment to sell it.
Using ethanol once was a cheap way to increase octane to make premium fuel, said an oil expert, Lawrence J. Goldstein, of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, because it has an octane of 113. But refiners have reached the limit of the amount they can blend, he said.
In addition, he said, an increase in American oil production, mostly from shale, allows refiners to use domestic crude instead of imported crude, but some of the new domestic supply has fewer high-octane ingredients than the African crudes it is replacing. And some refiners may increase their exports of gas in response to high credit prices, experts said. If the gasoline is exported, it does not have to meet the American ethanol requirement.
The long-term outlook for premium fuel is uncertain. Auto companies can build cars that get more miles per gallon if they use high-octane fuel, and the auto companies have agreed to double the average fuel economy of their cars and light trucks by 2025.
At Edmunds.com, analyst Bill Visnic said the demand for premium would be higher except that carmakers had learned to use an alternate technology, direct injection of fuel, combined with turbocharging, to get higher mileage.
But the number of cars that use high-octane fuel is substantial.
Michael Webber, of the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas at Austin, said he asked his students how many of them drove cars that needed premium fuel. ''Out of 100 people, 10 hands went up,'' he said. These were probably not mostly luxury cars, he said. ''Grad students normally aren't rich,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Populations Of U.S. Fish Rebound

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
Many commercial fishing stocks off the United States coast that were depleted by decades of overfishing are returning to abundance, thanks largely to a 1996 law that effectively ordered limits on catches until the fish populations had rebounded, a newly released analysis of federal data on fish populations states. 
The analysis, by the Natural Resources Defense Council, concludes that 21 of 44 species that it studied have met rebuilding targets and 7 others have made significant progress, increasing their populations by at least 25 percent.
Sixteen have made less or no progress, the report stated, including 10 species off the New England coast, most of them popular bottom-dwelling fish like cod and flounder. In half of those cases, the fish populations had grown by more than 25 percent but were still being overfished.
All have been managed under the 1996 law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which sets a 10-year target for rebuilding each species.
Brad Sewell, a lawyer for the resources group and the main author of the analysis, said the uptick in fish populations was especially impressive in light of what he called a dismal record in most other parts of the world.
''When you look at the population trajectories of dozens and dozens of stocks, you see '96 as a real watershed,'' he said. ''You see this cause and effect between implementing the law and the upward population trajectory.''
The report noted that between 2008 and 2010, the average revenues from catches of the 28 fish that made the most rebuilding progress had jumped 54 percent, allowing for inflation, from the start of their rebuilding.
The report's calculations are based entirely on annual reports on fish stocks issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service. The service has labeled 124 species overfished, but the report focused on 44 for which there were enough data to draw conclusions on their rebuilding progress.
Mid-Atlantic fish stocks reported the most progress; all seven species examined had met population targets, including bluefish, black sea bass and summer flounder. Many New England stocks also recovered fully, including sea scallops, haddock, monkfish and yellowtail flounder.
But many other New England fish were recovering more slowly, mostly because of overfishing and environmental problems, Mr. Sewell said. Until recently, he said, New England regulators had set targets only for total catches instead of setting strict quotas under which any excess catch would be deducted from the following year's quota.
Six of the eight species that made the least progress are off New England, including Atlantic cod, winter flounder and ocean pout. And even some species making slightly better progress, like the slow-growing Atlantic halibut, could take decades to rebuild, he said.
''They were the size of small boats, and they virtually went extinct,'' he said. ''They're coming back. But it will be a long haul.''

HEADLINE: Ford Chief Benefits From Auto Comeback

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
The turnaround of the American auto industry is paying off for senior management, particularly at the Ford Motor Company, even with a 29 percent reduction in compensation for its chief executive.
Ford said on Friday that it paid Alan R. Mulally, the chief executive, about $21 million last year, and paid $14.8 million to its executive chairman, William C. Ford Jr.
Mr. Mulally's bonuses dropped to $4 million, from $5.4 million in 2011, with a steep drop in his stock awards and other compensation to about $15 million last year, from about $22 million the year before. Those reductions were based on the company's falling short of overall performance targets, especially cash flow goals. 
Despite the decrease, he remains among the highest-paid auto executives in the world, earning at least $20 million for a third consecutive year for his role in streamlining the nation's second-largest carmaker and returning it to consistent profitability.
Over all, the company earned $5.67 billion in profits last year, a 5 percent drop from 2011 excluding one-time valuation changes.
Its profits were hurt last year by big losses in the troubled European market, but Ford continued to post record pretax profits in its core North American market. The company also was returned to investment grade by ratings agencies, and it reinstated its dividend.
Mr. Mulally, who is 67, was recruited to Ford in 2006 just as the Detroit automakers were tumbling into a financial crisis that would force the company's two main rivals, General Motors and Chrysler, to seek government bailouts and file for bankruptcy.
Ford survived without federal help and has thrived since, posting pretax profits for 14 consecutive quarters through the end of 2012, while improving revenue and market share.
G.M., the largest American car company, paid Daniel Akerson, its chairman and chief executive, about $11 million last year.
The company has not yet revealed its compensation data for 2012, but last month submitted documents to Congress that said it was proposing to pay Mr. Akerson $11.1 million this year.
G.M. said that figure was the same level as Mr. Akerson received in 2012, making his compensation among the highest for seven bailed-out companies that remain under pay restrictions imposed by the Treasury Department.
Chrysler's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, received $1.2 million in compensation in 2012. That does not include his pay as chief executive of Chrysler's parent company, the Italian automaker Fiat.
The pay levels at G.M. and Ford far exceed what the companies were paying their executives a few years ago, when the automakers were losing billions of dollars, shutting factories and eliminating thousands of hourly and salaried jobs.
In 2005, for example, Mr. Ford, who then served as chief executive and chairman of Ford, agreed to take no compensation until the company became profitable again.
He then recruited Mr. Mulally from the aircraft company Boeing, a move that started Ford's revival.
Since joining Ford, Mr. Mulally has earned more than $160 million in compensation. He also has been given stock awards totaling about $126 million, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg News Service.
''We believe our 2012 performance clearly shows our management team performed exceedingly well in a difficult environment,'' Ford said in a statement.
Mr. Mulally has indicated that he will retire from Ford by 2014. The odds-on choice to succeed him is Mark Fields, who was promoted to chief operating officer in December after leading the company's Americas division for several years.
Mr. Fields earned about $8.6 million in total compensation from Ford in 2012, a slight increase from the previous year.
The healthy pay packages come as Ford and other automakers anticipate another strong year in the revitalized American car market.
Sales of all new vehicles have risen 8 percent through February, compared with the same period a year ago. The industry is on track to sell more than 15 million new cars and trucks in 2013 -- the first time that level has been reached since 2007.
While Ford's executives are enjoying the rewards of the company's comeback, so are its workers.
Because of its hefty earnings last year in North America, Ford will pay an average of $8,300 in profit-sharing checks to each of its 45,000 union workers in the United States.

HEADLINE: Right to Lawyer Can Be Empty Promise for Poor

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
ADEL, Ga. -- Billy Jerome Presley spent 17 months in a Georgia jail because he did not have $2,700 for a child support payment. He had no prior jail record but also no lawyer. In Baltimore last fall, Carl Hymes, 21, was arrested on charges of shining a laser into the eyes of a police officer. Bail was set at $75,000. He had no arrest record but also no lawyer. In West Orange, N.J., last summer, Walter Bloss, 89, was served with an eviction notice from the rent-controlled apartment he had lived in for 43 years after a dispute with his landlord. He had gone to court without a lawyer.
Fifty years ago, on March 18, 1963, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that those accused of a crime have a constitutional right to a lawyer whether or not they can afford one. But as legal officials observe the anniversary of what is widely considered one of the most significant judicial declarations of equality under law, many say that the promise inherent in the Gideon ruling remains unfulfilled because so many legal needs still go unmet. 
Civil matters -- including legal issues like home foreclosure, job loss, spousal abuse and parental custody -- were not covered by the decision. Today, many states and counties do not offer lawyers to the poor in major civil disputes, and in some criminal ones as well. Those states that do are finding that more people than ever are qualifying for such help, making it impossible to keep up with the need. The result is that even at a time when many law school graduates are without work, many Americans are without lawyers.
The Legal Services Corporation, the Congressionally financed organization that provides lawyers to the poor in civil matters, says there are more than 60 million Americans -- 35 percent more than in 2005 -- who qualify for its services. But it calculates that 80 percent of the legal needs of the poor go unmet. In state after state, according to a survey of trial judges, more people are now representing themselves in court and they are failing to present necessary evidence, committing procedural errors and poorly examining witnesses, all while new lawyers remain unemployed.
''Some of our most essential rights -- those involving our families, our homes, our livelihoods -- are the least protected,'' Chief Justice Wallace B. Jefferson of the Texas Supreme Court, said in a recent speech at New York University. He noted that a family of four earning $30,000 annually does not qualify for legal aid in many states.
James J. Sandman, president of the Legal Services Corporation, said, ''Most Americans don't realize that you can have your home taken away, your children taken away and you can be a victim of domestic violence but you have no constitutional right to a lawyer to protect you.''
According to the World Justice Project, a nonprofit group promoting the rule of law that got its start through the American Bar Association, the United States ranks 66th out of 98 countries in access to and affordability of civil legal services.
''In most countries, equality before the law means equality between those of high and low income,'' remarked Earl Johnson Jr., a retired justice of the California Court of Appeal. ''In this country for some reason we are concerned more with individuals versus government.''
With law school graduates hurting for work, it may appear that there is a glut of lawyers. But many experts say that is a misunderstanding.
''We don't have an excess of lawyers,'' said Martin Guggenheim, a law professor at New York University. ''What we have is a miserable fit. In many areas like family and housing law, there is simply no private bar to go to. You couldn't find a lawyer to help you even if you had the money because there isn't a dime to be made in those cases.''
Even in situations where an individual is up against a state prosecutor and jail may result, not every jurisdiction provides lawyers to the defendants. In Georgia, those charged with failing to pay child support face a prosecutor and jail but are not supplied with a lawyer.
Mr. Presley lost his job in the recession and fell way behind on support payments for his four children. In 2011, he was jailed after a court proceeding without a lawyer in which he said he could not pay what he owed. He was brought back to court, shackled, every month or two. Each time, he said he still could not pay. Each time, he was sent back.
A year later, he contacted a public defender who handles only criminal cases but who sent his case to the Southern Center for Human Rights. Atteeyah Hollie, a lawyer there, got him released that same day, helped him find work and set up a payment plan.
An important service lawyers can provide defendants like Mr. Presley is knowledge of what courts want -- receipts of medical treatment, evidence of a job search, bank account statements. On their own, many people misstep when facing a judge.
In Adel, Ga., a town of 5,000, child support court meets monthly. On a recent morning, a dozen men in shackles and jail uniforms faced Chuck Reddick, a state prosecutor, on their second or third round in court.
''In most cases, they simply can't pay,'' said John P. Daughtrey, who was sheriff here until losing an election in November. ''An attorney could explain to the judge why jail is not the solution and how to fix it. As a sheriff, I want criminals in my jail, not a debtor's prison.''
Mr. Reddick and Judge Carson Dane Perkins of Cook County Superior Court in Adel both said they would welcome lawyers for defendants because it would make the process clearer and smoother.
''If we could extend the right to a lawyer to civil procedures where you face a loss of liberty, that would be good,'' Judge Perkins said. ''Lawyers can get affidavits from employers and help make cases for those who can't pay.''
The Southern Center for Human Rights has filed a class-action suit seeking a guarantee of a lawyer for such cases in Georgia. Sarah Geraghty, a lawyer there, said the center had received thousands of calls from Georgians facing child support hearings. Among them was Russell Davis, a Navy veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder who was jailed three times and lost his apartment and car while in jail.
Georgia also offers a case study on the mismatch between lawyers and clients at a time when each needs the other. According to the Legal Services Corporation, 70 percent of the state's lawyers are in the Atlanta area, while 70 percent of the poor live outside it. There are six counties without a lawyer and dozens with only two or three.
Mr. Bloss, who faced eviction in New Jersey, went to legal services, which won for him the right to stay in his apartment while his case is under appeal.
In Baltimore, where Mr. Hymes was accused of shining a laser at a police officer and assigned bail of $75,000, first bail hearings do not include a lawyer. Tens of thousands are brought through Central Booking every year, facing a commissioner through a glass partition, who determines whether to release the detainee on his own recognizance or assign bail and at what level.
''For the poor, bail is a jail sentence,'' said Douglas L. Colbert, a law professor at the University of Maryland. A study he conducted on 4,000 bail cases of nonviolent offenders found that two and a half times as many detainees were released on their own recognizance and bail was set at a far more affordable level if a lawyer was at the hearing.
Mr. Hymes was relatively lucky. When he eventually faced a judge with the help of a public defender, bail was slashed to $200 cash. It took his family a few weeks to pay. A student of Mr. Colbert's, Iten Naguib, acted as an intermediary.
''If there had been an attorney involved at the initial stages,'' Ms. Naguib said, ''Mr. Hymes would likely have been released much earlier.''

HEADLINE: The Euro Zone and the Global Crisis

BYLINE: By JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET

 BODY:
BERLIN -- The epicenter of the worst global financial crisis since World War II, located in the United States since 2007, crossed the Atlantic at the beginning of 2010. As Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told me at that time: ''Now it is your turn.''
Three years down the road, four questions should be raised: Are we witnessing a ''European'' crisis or a global crisis? Why did the epicenter of the sovereign debt crisis of advanced economies move to Europe? What should the Europeans do in the short run? And what should they do in the long term? 
One: We are observing a global crisis of the advanced economies -- not only a European crisis. Some have argued that the subprime crisis and post-Lehman Brothers developments were an American crisis. We learned the hard way that the financial crisis was global, even if its epicenter was in the United States. Now that the nature of the financial crisis has directly challenged sovereign signatures (that is to say a treasury's credit worthiness), it is still global -- but the epicenter of sovereign tensions is in the euro zone.
Two: The euro zone is indeed at the epicenter of sovereign risk tensions because its specific economic and fiscal governance has revealed four major weaknesses. First, the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact -- which was the core of fiscal governance and the quid pro quo for the absence of a federal state in the euro area -- were not respected. Second, there was no established surveillance of the evolution of national competitiveness, and of national external imbalances. Third, there was no banking union. Fourth, there was no stabilization mechanism to cope with dramatic financial circumstances.
Three: Since 2010, the Europeans have advanced toward a better understanding of their own situation and a proper diagnosis of what should be done. They have decided to correct the four major weaknesses listed above and to embark on reinforced economic financial and fiscal governance -- a strongly reinforced Stability and Growth Pact with the solid foundation of the ''fiscal compact''; a new pillar for monitoring imbalances and competitiveness, which is now called the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP); a banking union; and the European Stability Mechanism to make crisis management more effective.
This new concept of reinforced financial, economic and fiscal governance -- together with the renewed strategic political commitment of all European governments to preserve the integrity of the euro area; the resolute and courageous adjustment pursued by the countries with imbalances; and the determination of the European Central Bank to preserve the transmission of its monetary policy -- explain the remarkable alleviation of the tensions over the past eight months.
Confidence is returning and paving the way for growth and job creation. But many challenges are still there. Whatever has been decided should be implemented resolutely, comprehensively and swiftly by governments.
This is no time for complacency. We should never forget that the growth potential of Europe depends on the enhancement of education, creativity, innovation and research and development. This, with the indispensable structural reforms, was part of the Lisbon agenda, and it is part of the ''2020'' endeavor. It should be at the top of all priorities.
The stability and prosperity of the euro area itself -- those already in it and those preparing to be -- depends on the success of this endeavor in the European Union as a whole.
Four: ''Political union'' is often presented as the culminating and final stage of European Union. The paradox is that a lot of political union is already being implemented -- the decisions made recently to reinforce fiscal economic and financial governance are significantly fostering political union. The crucial issue is that it should be accompanied by comprehensive, effective and fully legitimate democratic control.
Innovative proposals are being made, in particular by the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy; the president of the European Commission, Jos Manuel Barroso; academics and many others. All must pass the litmus test of the following four principles: full democratic accountability, effectiveness, fairness and subsidiarity -- that is to say, putting at the level of Europe what can be solved only at that level.
I am convinced that new, innovative ideas could meet the four principles. A common factor would be a significant reinforcement of the powers of the European Parliament, in liaison with national parliaments where and when necessary, as foreseen in the Fiscal Compact. The next election of the European Parliament in June 2014 will be of extreme importance.
The future of credible European governance is among the topics being discussed this weekend at a meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Berlin.
Jean Monnet, the chief architect of European unity, famously said that he did not know what the Europe of tomorrow would be because today's changes would bring unexpected evolutions. We see now that past and present changes are paving the way for major steps in Europe's unification process -- including a full and necessary democratic accountability of a political union.
Jean-Claude Trichet, former president of the European Central Bank, is the European chairman of the Trilateral Commission.

HEADLINE: Japan Seeks to Join Pacific Trade Negotiations

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan will seek to join negotiations for a wide-ranging, multilateral free trade pact with the United States and other Pacific nations, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday, giving heft to trade talks that could now encompass two-fifths of the world economy but also bringing on board a country with special demands and reservations that some participants fear will delay a final agreement.
In an impassioned televised address, Mr. Abe portrayed the proposed pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as Japan's ''last chance'' to remain an economic leader in Asia and to shape the economic future in the fast-growing region.
''Japan must remain at the center of the Asian-Pacific century,'' Mr. Abe said. ''The emerging economies of Asia are also opening up their economies.'' 
''If Japan alone continues to look inward, we will have no hope for growth,'' he added. ''This is our last chance. If we don't seize it, Japan will be left out.''
For the United States, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has become a major part of President Barack Obama's promise to increase U.S. exports, as well as the vehicle for his so-called pivot of U.S. foreign policy toward Asia.
The prospect that Japan would join the talks comes as the United States is about to embark on similar negotiations with the European Union. If all the talks prove successful, the result would be a significant reduction in trade barriers among the richest nations in the world.
The talks with Europe, endorsed by President Obama, have broad support from business groups on both sides of the Atlantic, but could still fail because so many special interests will be affected. The negotiations could start as early as May, with the goal of eliminating tariffs and, perhaps more importantly, harmonizing regulatory standards for products like drugs and cars.
In Japan, Mr. Abe is taking a big political risk in embracing the free trade talks, given the strong opposition of the farm lobby and other powerful interest groups. The largest agricultural cooperative in Japan has actively campaigned against opening up trade, saying it would decimate farms in the country, a plea that has resonated among the wider public. Within his own Liberal Democratic Party, a majority of lawmakers depend on the rural vote and object to the free trade deal.
Mr. Abe is betting, however, that his strong popularity ratings will help him ride out the furor. He will face his first test at the polls this summer, when national elections for Parliament's upper house are due.
''I promise to take the best path forward for Japan's national interest,'' he said. ''I will protect what we must protect, and demand what we must demand.''
To soften the blow of a more open economy, Mr. Abe has secured vague support from the United States that some Japanese agricultural products -- like rice, which is protected by a 778 percent tariff -- would be exempt from the free trade negotiations.
But insisting on these ''sacred cows'' could hurt Japan's hand in negotiations elsewhere, especially in gaining further access to foreign markets for its manufacturers, which account for three- quarters of the country's exports. Some participating countries worry that Japanese demands will slow the talks.
The lead negotiator for Singapore, Ng Bee Kim, said at the latest round of Trans-Pacific Partnership talks during the past week that Japan would be allowed to participate only if existing members agreed it could ''keep up the good momentum'' at the talks.
It is unclear how much Mr. Abe is willing to commit to other structural changes that the pact might demand of the Japanese economy.
Japanese levies, which average 6.5 percent for its trading partners on most goods, are in line with those set by other industrialized nations. The exception is agricultural produce, on which Japan slaps an average 25 percent tariff.
But the partnership seeks not only to eliminate tariffs, but also to do away with other barriers to foreign trade, like cumbersome regulations -- for which Japan is notorious -- in fields including retailing, health and autos, that shut out foreign competitors.
Proponents of free trade say such overhauls could transform the Japanese economy for the better, making insular industries more competitive. Joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership would expand the Japanese economy by at least 3.2 trillion, or $33 billion -- about 0.66 percent -- the government estimated Friday.
Mr. Abe has made such structural overhauls one of the three pillars of his strategy to get Japan growing again, together with an aggressive monetary policy and government spending to beat a long-deflationary economy.
''Increased trade is probably Japan's best bet in getting out of its current economic doldrums,'' said Noah Smith, an assistant professor of finance and economics at Stony Brook University in New York. ''If Abe can actually push this through, this will be his economic legacy, and it will be a positive legacy.''
But agricultural cooperatives in Japan have teamed up with other interest groups to present the partnership as a threat to the Japanese lifestyle. A nationwide association of doctors opposes the pact, arguing that it will force Japan to open up its state-controlled health sector to American-style health insurance and erode its universal insurance system.
''In America, the first thing they ask you in hospital is, 'What insurance plan are you on?''' warned a full-page advertisement placed in major newspapers Friday by the Tokyo Medical Association.
With its origins in a 2006 trade pact between Singapore, New Zealand, Chile and Brunei, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has grown into a major free trade initiative that accounts for almost 40 percent of the world's gross domestic product -- a larger share of the global economy than the European Union.
Participating nations aim to sign a comprehensive pact that covers not just trade in goods and services, but also foreign investment, government procurement, intellectual property rights, and environmental and labor protections.
Such a pact would be a big step forward for free trade at a time when global trade negotiations have stalled, giving way to bilateral and regional talks, of which the Trans-Pacific Partnership is shaping up to be the largest.
For Japan, the agreement would be a way to catch up with burgeoning rivals like South Korea, which has signed free trade agreements with the United States and the European Union and has opened free trade talks with China. Japan has no trade agreements with such major trading partners, except for a recent pact with India.
Tokyo also sees a lead role in the pact as a way of returning to the center stage after being eclipsed in the region by the rise of China, which many in Tokyo see as jeopardizing Japan's economic interests, and security. And Tokyo worries that unless it joins the partnership talks now, it will have less say later, as rules and conditions are decided.
China, which is also pursuing bilateral and multilateral trade agreements in the region, is unlikely to join the partnership soon, because of the various concessions on state-owned enterprises, intellectual property and labor that the pact would require. That has in effect made the partnership a vehicle of sorts for the United States, and now Japan, to counter Chinese influence.
The pact which would also amount to a de facto U.S.-Japanese free trade agreement, could force Washington and Tokyo to address longstanding trade quarrels that have marred otherwise close economic ties between the world's largest and third-largest economies. China is now the second largest.
Many of the issues that have made a U.S.-Japanese agreement elusive could again prove tricky for both sides to resolve in a broader pact. U.S. carmakers oppose Japan's participation in the talks unless Japan commits to changing what the Big Three in Detroit charge are unfair domestic regulations that shut foreign carmakers out of the Japanese market.
''Japan has shown no willingness to change their unfair trade practices, and without significant reform, we remain concerned about inviting their negotiators to join the talks,'' Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said in a statement last month. ''We are dedicated to free trade, but it should be fair trade too.''
Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

HEADLINE: Moscato Finds a New Following

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
CANELLI, ITALY -- On a cold morning in February, the dormant vines that surround this city in Piedmont were coated with ice, thanks to a freezing fog that was reluctantly yielding to the rising sun. The air on the hilltops above the mist seemed to crackle with energy. My boots sank into a muddy vineyard as I gazed at the snow-covered Alps on the horizon.
I've been thinking of that morning while working my way through a selection of Moscato d'Asti, the wine that is made in Canelli and other nearby towns and villages. Moscato at its best is irresistibly sweet. But there is a bracing freshness, too, as there was that day in the Piedmont.
At a time when complaints abound that wines from all over the world are growing more alike, Moscato d'Asti is something of an anomaly. It is low in alcohol, sweet and slightly fizzy -- hardly the qualities most wine drinkers or critics seem to be looking for these days. A few years ago, Moscato d'Asti seemed to be headed for the curiosity shop. 
But then a surprising thing happened. Moscato d'Asti was discovered by hip-hop artists. Sales of Moscato surged. Imitators sprang up around the globe, trying -- mostly unsuccessfully -- to match the signature taste of the Piemontese original.
By some tellings, the origin of the hip-hop crowd's embrace of Moscato began after a falling-out with another effervescent wine, Champagne.
Rappers had a special fondness for Cristal, the prestige cuve of the Champagne house Louis Roederer. But, in 2006, the rapper Jay-Z initiated a boycott of Cristal after a comment by the managing director Roederer, Frederic Rouzaud, quoted in the Economist. Asked whether an association with a ''bling lifestyle'' could hurt the Cristal brand, Mr. Rouzaud said: ''That's a good question, but what can we do? We can't forbid people from buying it.''
Soon, Moscato was being served at parties in New York and Los Angeles, and the wine was name-dropped in rap songs. In ''Do It Now,'' for example, the rapper Drake calls for a ''glass of Moscato for the girl who's a student and her friend who's a model.''
Never mind that Moscato and Champagne have nothing in common aside from the bubbles -- and even those are different. Moscato is only slightly fizzy; the pressure in the bottles is so low that ordinary corks suffice. Its bubblier cousin, with a more dubious reputation, is Asti Spumante.
Meanwhile, with as little as 5 percent alcohol, Moscato d'Asti packs roughly the same punch as beer; Champagne contains around 12 percent, and many other wines now top 15 percent. And while most Champagne is dry, or something close to dry, Moscato is sweet, as sweet as many other wines that have unfairly been consigned to dessert-wine purgatory.
While it is pleasing to see an underappreciated wine style get a deserved bit of attention, the response of the global wine trade to the Moscato phenomenon has been less commendable. While Moscato used to be made mostly in the hills around Asti, sources proliferated as the industry scrambled to capitalize on the new interest. Suddenly there was Moscato from California, from Australia, from Argentina, from South Africa -- you name it.
A lot of the new Moscato tastes nothing like the original. Indeed, it tastes the way you might expect a sweet, slightly fizzy wine that's low in alcohol -- and usually cheap -- to taste. That winter morning in Piedmont? Nowhere in sight, or in the bottle.
Makers of the original Moscato -- Moscato d'Asti, that is -- grumble that they have hardly benefited from the bubble. Most consumers seem perfectly happy with the cheaper alternatives.
''It's a huge debacle,'' said Alessandro Boido of Ca d'Gal, a Moscato producer in Santo Stefano Belbo, near Canelli. ''Moscato has exploded in America, but which Moscato? Not Moscato d'Asti. Why are people willing to spend $100 on a bottle of red wine, but they refuse to spend $40 on a bottle of Moscato?''
The upside to the fame, however, is that Moscato is no longer just a curiosity, or worse, a joke. Moscato d'Asti has begun to appear on the wine lists of Michelin-starred restaurants. Even a few of my favorite wine shops in Paris, a difficult market for Italian wine, have begun to carry Moscato d'Asti.
To get a closer look at the real Moscato, I visited two of the best producers in the area around Canelli, Ca d'Gal and Bera Vittorio e Figli. Forget about industrial-scale winemaking and global supply chains. These are small, family-owned outfits, with only a handful of hectares of vineyards to each of their names.
While a lot of the Moscato on the market is of seemingly indeterminate origin, those from Bera and Ca d'Gal are very much ''terroir'' wines. Mr. Boido has one plot of 55-year-old vines in a south-facing vineyard consisting of blue tufa soil. The grapes, from a special clone of the moscato variety -- known as muscat or moscatel elsewhere -- ripen fully, which is necessary to make a Moscato with character and complexity. But they also retain ample acidity, providing freshness to balance the sugar.
''People used to harvest grapes that were yellow like polenta,'' Mr. Boido said, referring to the golden, corn meal-based staple food of northern Italy. ''Then they started cutting corners, harvesting them half-green.''
While most Moscato is drunk within a few years, or even months, of the harvest, Mr. Boido pulled a few old bottles from his cellar to demonstrate the aging potential of his Vigna Vecchia, or old vine, cuve.
Granted, we're not necessarily talking about decades of age here, but wines like Mr. Boido's 2007 and 2008 Vigna Vecchia showed a fascinating evolution, the '07 displaying interesting menthol notes, while the '08 was developing hints of petroleum, like an old German Riesling. (Trust me, this is a good thing.)
''For many people, Moscato is a big glass of sugar,'' Mr. Boido said. ''That was never the goal for me.''
From their hilltop perch outside Canelli, Alessandra and Gianluigi Bera also overlook some special vineyards. Like Mr. Boido, they say they aim to harvest very ripe fruit. They, too, take steps to limit yields in their vineyards, reducing the quantity of the harvest but increasing the quality of what remains.
The Beras say they are the only Moscato d'Asti producers who have embraced so-called natural winemaking methods -- that is, restricting the use of sulfur dioxide, a preservative, as well as other additives that are widely found in wine. They are darlings of the Slow Food movement, the Italian organization that celebrates food and drink produced in time-honored, time-consuming and sustainable ways.
Bera's Moscato certainly shows great purity and complex flavors. While some people might consider Moscato a simple wine, best served as an aperitif or as an after-dinner get-rid-of-the-guests ploy, I would have no hesitation serving Bera's Moscato d'Asti at the table. Why not, for example, with a bagna cauda, the traditional Piemontese sauce made from anchovies, olive oil and garlic and used for dipping vegetables.
''We don't make Barolo or Barbaresco here,'' Ms. Bera said, referring to two famous reds that are also produced in the hills of Piedmont. ''So we decided to make the best Moscato we could possibly make.''

HEADLINE: Big Hedge Fund Pays $616 Million In Trading Cases

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
10:58 p.m. | Updated
The government's multiyear campaign to ferret out insider trading on Wall Street has yielded multiple prosecutions of former employees of SAC Capital Advisors, the giant hedge fund owned by the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen.
On Friday, federal authorities took aim at the fund itself.
In what officials are calling the largest-ever settlement of an insider trading action, SAC agreed to pay securities regulators about $602 million to resolve a civil lawsuit related to improper trading at the fund.
The landmark penalty exceeds, at least before adjustment for inflation, the fines meted out in the 1980s-era scandals involving Ivan F. Boesky and Michael R. Milken, records at the time. It also underscores SAC's central role in the government's recent push to prosecute illegal conduct on trading desks and in executive suites, an effort that has yielded about 180 civil actions and more than 75 criminal prosecutions. 
SAC also agreed Friday to pay $14 million to resolve its role in an insider trading ring that illegally traded technology stocks including Dell.
''These settlements call for the imposition of historic penalties,'' said George S. Canellos, the Securities and Exchange Commission's acting enforcement director.
Mr. Canellos said the resolutions did not prevent the future filing of additional charges against any person, specifically citing Mr. Cohen, who was not named as a defendant in the civil actions on Friday. Mr. Cohen has not been charged with any wrongdoing and has told his clients that he believes he has behaved properly.
In the bigger case, the agency said an SAC unit would forfeit $602 million to settle claims that it sold nearly $1 billion in shares of two pharmaceutical companies after a former portfolio manager at the fund received secret information from a doctor about problems with a new drug for Alzheimer's disease.
For SAC, which is based in Stamford, Conn., manages $15 billion and holds one of the best investment records on Wall Street, the settlements, while another blow to its reputation, resolve a matter that caused some of its investors to withdraw their money. Investors became skittish last fall after regulators warned SAC that they planned to sue the fund.
''These settlements are a substantial step toward resolving all outstanding regulatory matters and allow the firm to move forward,'' said Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC.
The settlements still need to be approved by Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan, the presiding judge in the case. As part of its agreement with regulators, SAC neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. That entrenched S.E.C. practice -- permitting defendants to settle civil claims without acknowledging wrongdoing -- has come under increased scrutiny by the courts, a trend that legal experts say could lead the judge to question the settlement.
The cases brought on Friday echo earlier criminal charges against SAC employees. In December, prosecutors indicted Mathew Martoma, a former SAC portfolio manager at the center of the questionable drug-stock trades tied to a new Alzheimer's drug. And Jon Horvath, a former SAC analyst, pleaded guilty last year to participating in the Dell insider trading ring. In its legal filing on Friday, the S.E.C. said Mr. Horvath had leaked secret information to two colleagues; previously, the commission said that only one former SAC employee had received tips.
A lawyer for Mr. Martoma said SAC's resolution of the two lawsuits had no bearing on his client, who has denied the charges.
''SAC's business decision to settle with the S.E.C. in no way changes the fact that Mathew Martoma is an innocent man,'' said Charles A. Stillman, the lawyer. ''We will never give up our fight for his vindication.''
On a conference call with reporters, government officials bragged that the $616 million amount dwarfed other prominent insider trading settlements. Raj Rajaratnam, a former hedge fund manager convicted in 2011, paid $156 million in combined criminal and civil penalties. Mr. Boesky, a central figure in the 1980s trading scandals, paid $100 million then.
The sum also exceeds the amounts of older enforcement actions, including a $550 million settlement with Goldman Sachs in 2010 related to fraud accusations tied to the sale of mortgage investments, and a $400 million settlement with Mr. Milken, the junk bond financier, in 1990.
The larger of the two cases settled on Friday was based on powerful evidence against Mr. Martoma, the former SAC portfolio manager. The government said Mr. Martoma had caused SAC to sell nearly $1 billion in shares of Elan and Wyeth because he obtained secret information from a doctor about clinical trials for a drug being developed by the companies. Prosecutors have secured the testimony of the doctor who reportedly leaked Mr. Martoma the drug trial data.
In bringing the criminal charge against Mr. Martoma, prosecutors appeared to be moving closer to building a case against Mr. Cohen. The complaint noted that Mr. Cohen had a 20-minute phone call with Mr. Martoma the night before SAC began dumping its holdings. Prosecutors, though, have not claimed that Mr. Cohen knew that Mr. Martoma had confidential data about the drug's prospects.
The F.B.I. has tried unsuccessfully several times to persuade Mr. Martoma to plead guilty and cooperate against Mr. Cohen.
While the $602 million settlement in the Martoma case is a prodigious sum, it is considerably less than the maximum that the S.E.C. could have extracted. The agreement required SAC to pay about $275 million, an amount representing disgorged illegal gains, as well as $52 million in interest. In addition, SAC agreed to pay a $275 million penalty, an amount equal to the illicit gains. Under the securities laws, however, the S.E.C. could have secured a penalty of three times that amount, or $825 million.
The forfeited money will come from SAC, meaning that the firm will write the government a check. SAC's investors will not pay anything or absorb any losses. The $616 million will go into a general revenue fund of the United States Treasury.
Representing SAC in its talks with the S.E.C. were Martin Klotz of Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Daniel J. Kramer of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison.
While the resolution of these two cases provides a measure of relief to SAC and its clients, the hedge fund's legal problems have already damaged its business. Though SAC has returned about 30 percent annually to its investors over the last two decades -- a virtually peerless track record -- many of its clients have parted ways with the fund.
Last month, SAC investors asked to withdraw $1.7 billion, more than a quarter of the $6 billion that the fund manages for outside clients. The balance of SAC's $15 billion belongs to Mr. Cohen and his employees. The next regularly scheduled deadline for SAC clients to ask for their money back is mid-May.
In calls with concerned clients, SAC has highlighted its stepped-up efforts in building its legal staff and compliance procedures -- an initiative that Mr. Gasthalter reiterated Friday. ''We are committed to continuing to maintain a first-rate compliance effort woven into the fabric of the firm.''
On a conference call discussing the case, Mr. Canellos was asked whether the S.E.C. felt that SAC was committed to keeping a strong culture of compliance.
''I sure hope they are,'' Mr. Canellos said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.N. Official Says U.S. Drones Breach Pakistan's Sovereignty

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -- The United States has violated Pakistan's sovereignty and disrupted life in the country's tribal areas with drone strikes in its counterterrorism operations near the border with Afghanistan, a United Nations human rights investigator said Friday. 
The investigator, Ben Emmerson, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, visited Pakistan this week as part of his investigation into the civilian impact of the use of drones and other forms of targeted killings.
The drone campaign ''involves the use of force on the territory of another state without its consent and is therefore a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty,'' Mr. Emmerson said in a statement issued by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva.
The United Nations Human Rights Council asked Mr. Emmerson to start an investigation of the drone attacks after requests by countries that include Pakistan, Russia and China.
Mr. Emmerson said in January that he would investigate 25 drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories. He is expected to present his final report to the United Nations General Assembly in October.
Washington had little to say about Mr. Emmerson's statement. ''We've seen his press release,'' said a State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland. ''I'm obviously not going to speak about classified information here. We have a strong ongoing counterterrorism dialogue with Pakistan, and that will continue.''
Mr. Emmerson said the Pashtun tribes of northwestern Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, a largely lawless region bordering Afghanistan, had suffered greatly as a result of the counterterrorism operations.
''These proud and independent people have been self-governing for generations, and have a rich tribal history that has been too little understood in the West,'' he said. ''Their tribal structures have been broken down by the military campaign'' and, in particular, ''by the use of drones.''
The tribal areas have never been fully integrated into Pakistan's administrative, economic or judicial system. They are dominated by ethnic Pashtun tribes, some of which have sheltered and supported militants over decades of conflict in Afghanistan.
Clearing out militant border sanctuaries is a crucial part of Washington's plan to bring stability to Afghanistan, particularly as the United States prepares to end its combat mission in 2014.
''It is time for the international community to heed the concerns of Pakistan, and give the next democratically elected government of Pakistan the space, support and assistance it needs to deliver a lasting peace on its own territory without forcible military interference by other states,'' Mr. Emmerson said.
Civilian casualties from drone strikes have angered local populations and created tensions in the United States' relationship with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Washington has sought to portray the civilian casualties as minimal, but groups collecting data on the attacks say they have killed hundreds of civilians.

HEADLINE: Israelis Form Government Days Before Obama Visit

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Political leaders on Friday signed agreements to form a new Israeli government that would almost certainly complicate the prospect of jump-starting a moribund peace process, focus attention on the economy and widen the rift between the ultra-Orthodox and more secular communities.
The deal was signed just days before President Obama was to visit Israel, helping shore up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's diminished political standing but putting in place a government that could aggravate tense relations between Israel and the United States on the issue of settlements. 
After weeks of tough negotiations, Naftali Bennett, a former leader in the settler community, and Yair Lapid, the founder of a new party focused on domestic affairs, on Friday agreed to join Mr. Netanyahu's coalition, giving Israel a new government just ahead of Saturday's deadline.
Mr. Bennett and Mr. Lapid abandoned their demand to be named deputy prime ministers, which had delayed the expected signing on Thursday. A spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party said the prime minister had decided not to have any deputy or vice prime ministers in his third term.
''We will work together in the new government cooperating for all the citizens of Israel,'' Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. ''We will work toward strengthening Israel's security and improving quality of life of Israeli citizens.''
The new government, with a 68-seat majority in the 120-member Parliament and a 22-minister cabinet, is only the third since 1977 not to include Israel's ultra-Orthodox parties, which have vowed a vigorous opposition. It is made up of five factions with somewhat contradictory positions on critical questions, including the Palestinian conflict.
Mr. Bennett's right-leaning Jewish Home Party, popular with religious settlers, advocated annexing large sections of the West Bank during its campaign. Mr. Lapid's largely secular, centrist Yesh Atid Party and Tzipi Livni's center-left Hatnua support the establishment of a Palestinian state in that territory and call for a quick return to negotiations.
Mr. Netanyahu officially backs a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but his partner in the Jan. 22 elections, Avigdor Lieberman of the ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu Party, has been among the harshest critics of President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority.
Given those differences, the new government is expected to focus on domestic concerns, including integrating the ultra-Orthodox into the military and the work force and in education and housing.
''We promised during the elections to take care of the cost of living, to increase economic competitiveness and to return the Jewish spirit to the state -- and now we have got the tools for this,'' Mr. Bennett, who will serve as minister of economics and trade, said in a statement. ''This is the government of big opportunity -- and we will not miss it. Next week we start working -- all of us together.''
Mr. Lapid, who will be finance minister, wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night that he took that post despite the looming $10 billion budget deficit because he could not ''escape the conclusion that in any other post I'd be making things easier for myself.''
''I went into the election with the slogan 'Where's the money?' as the representative of the Israeli middle class, and that's a statement that obligates me,'' Mr. Lapid said.

HEADLINE: Japan Moves to Enter Talks on Pacific Trade

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan will seek to join negotiations for a free-trade pact with the United States and other Pacific nations, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday, giving heft to talks that could encompass two-fifths of the world economy but also adding a country with demands and reservations that some participants fear will delay an agreement.
In an impassioned televised address, Mr. Abe portrayed the pact, called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as Japan's last chance to remain an economic power in Asia and shape the region's future. 
''Japan must remain at the center of the Asian-Pacific century,'' Mr. Abe said. ''If Japan alone continues to look inward, we will have no hope for growth. This is our last chance. If we don't seize it, Japan will be left out.''
With strong opposition from Japan's farming lobby and other powerful groups, Mr. Abe is taking a big political risk in embracing the free-trade talks. Japan's largest agricultural cooperative has campaigned against trade liberalization. It says such a change would devastate the nation's farms, a plea that has resonated in the wider public. A majority of the lawmakers in his own Liberal Democratic Party depend on the rural vote and object to the free-trade deal.
Mr. Abe is betting, however, that his strong popularity will help him ride out the furor. He will face his first test at the polls this summer, when national elections for Parliament's upper house are scheduled.
''I promise to take the best path forward for Japan's national interest,'' he said. ''I will protect what we must protect and demand what we must demand.''
To soften the blow of a more open economy, Mr. Abe has secured vague support from the United States that some Japanese agricultural products -- like rice, which is protected by a 778 percent tariff -- would be exempt from the free-trade negotiations.
But insisting on these exceptions could hurt Japan's hand in negotiations elsewhere, especially in talks to gain further access to foreign markets for its manufacturers, which account for three-quarters of the country's exports. And some participating countries worry that Japanese demands will slow the talks.
The lead negotiator for Singapore, Ng Bee Kim, said last week that Japan would be permitted to participate only if existing members agreed that it could ''keep up the good momentum'' at the talks.
It is unclear to what extent Mr. Abe is willing to commit to other structural changes that the pact might demand of Japan's economy.
Japan's levies, which average 6.5 percent for its trading partners on most goods, are in line with those set by other industrialized nations. The exception is agricultural produce, on which Japan applies an average tariff of 25 percent.
The partnership seeks not only to eliminate tariffs but also to do away with other barriers to foreign trade, like cumbersome regulations -- for which Japan is notorious -- in retail, health, automobiles and other fields that shut out foreign competitors.
Proponents of free trade say such overhauls could transform the Japanese economy for the better, making insular industries more competitive. Joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership would expand the Japanese economy by at least $33 billion -- nearly 0.7 percent -- the government estimated.
Mr. Abe has made such structural changes one of the three pillars of his strategy to help Japan's economy grow again, along with an aggressive monetary policy and government spending to beat long-term deflation.
''Increased trade is probably Japan's best bet in getting out of its current economic doldrums,'' said Noah Smith, an assistant professor of finance and economics at Stony Brook University. ''If Abe can actually push this through, this will be his economic legacy, and it will be a positive legacy.''
But Japan's agricultural cooperatives have joined with other interest groups to portray the partnership as a threat to the Japanese lifestyle. A nationwide association of doctors opposes the pact, arguing that it will force Japan to open its state-controlled health industry to American-style health insurance, eroding its universal insurance system.
''In America, the first thing they ask you in the hospital is, 'What insurance plan are you on?' '' warned a full-page ad placed in major newspapers on Friday by the Tokyo Medical Association.
With its origins in a 2006 trade pact among Singapore, New Zealand, Chile and Brunei, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has grown into a major free-trade initiative that accounts for almost 40 percent of the world's gross domestic product -- a larger share of the global economy than the European Union.
Participating nations aim to sign a comprehensive pact that covers not just trade in goods and services but also foreign investment, government procurement, intellectual property rights and environmental and labor protections.
For Japan, the agreement would be a way to catch up with rivals like South Korea, which has signed free-trade agreements with the United States and the European Union and has opened free-trade talks with China. Japan has no trade agreements with such major trading partners except for a recent pact with India.
Japan also sees a leadership role in the partnership as a way to return to center stage after being eclipsed in the region by the rise of China, which many in Tokyo view as jeopardizing Japan's economic interests and security. China, which is pursuing its own bilateral and multilateral trade agreements in the region, is unlikely to join the agreement soon because of the concessions on state-owned enterprises, intellectual property and labor that the pact would require. That has, in effect, made the partnership a vehicle of sorts for the United States, and now Japan, to counter China's influence.
For the United States, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has become a major part of President Obama's promise to increase American exports, as well as the vehicle for his so-called pivot of American foreign policy toward Asia.
Still, many of the issues that have made an American-Japanese agreement elusive could again prove tricky for both sides to resolve in a broader pact. American automakers oppose Japan's participation in the talks unless Japan commits to changing what the Big Three in Detroit say are unfair domestic regulations that shut foreign carmakers out of the Japanese market.

HEADLINE: I Was a Teenage Mother

BYLINE: By GLORIA MALONE. 
Gloria Malone, a senior at Baruch College, is the author of the blog Teen Mom NYC.

 BODY:
''EVERYTHING'S going to be O.K., mamita,'' my mother said, before walking into her bedroom and crying her eyes out.
I was 15, and I was pregnant.
Today I have a 6-year-old daughter, and I'm not a teenager anymore. But I can't help but be affected by New York City's controversial new anti-teenage pregnancy campaign. The posters, which appear on subways, walls and buses, feature toddlers in states of despair or discontent because they were born to teenage mothers. One ad shows a crying child with the text ''I'm twice as likely not to graduate high school because you had me as a teen.'' Many posters ask: ''Think being a teen parent won't cost you?''
Some people argue that these ads are a fresh approach to dealing with the problem of teenage pregnancy. But I can tell you that there's nothing innovative about them. All they do is take the insults and stereotypes directed at teenage parents every day, and post them up around the city. 
At 15, I was a good student and determined to apply to college. But after I had my daughter, my high school guidance counselor refused to see me and help me with my applications. She never expected me to graduate. Most people, even within my family, assumed I wouldn't amount to anything and would be dependent on government assistance for the rest of my life.
But I wanted to be someone my daughter could be proud of. So every day, I woke up before the sun, drove my daughter's father to work, my daughter to day care, and still managed to be in class at 7:50 a.m. before the bell rang. I also worked 35 hours a week at a cellphone store. I would leave school early through a co-op program that allowed graduating seniors to work and go to school at the same time. After getting out of work I would pick my daughter up from day care and go home. I was always tired, but more than anything I was determined.
I also had a few people who encouraged me not to listen to the stereotypes. People like my chorus teacher, who allowed me to show up a few minutes late to class, so I could pump breast milk first; my economics teacher, who congratulated me on having a healthy child and reminded me that he was proud of me for not giving up; and the nurse at my daughter's doctor's office, who told me I was doing a great job and to keep it up.
These bits of encouragement are what kept me going. Thanks to them, I graduated with honors and went on to community college. Today I am a student, an advocate for young parents and, above all, a proud mom.
The blame, shame and stereotypes expressed by so many others simply told me to give up. Stereotypes and blame do not stop teenagers from engaging in unprotected sex or discourage teenage pregnancy. They simply keep teenage parents from seeking the help and support they need. The only tools that have been proven to prevent teenage pregnancy are comprehensive sex education, birth control and abstinence.
These ads do not explain why New York City, which thankfully makes birth control accessible to youth, has only recently begun requiring that comprehensive sex education be taught in all its public schools. Nor do they offer teenage parents any support for how to get out of poverty and provide their children with a more stable upbringing. Until that happens, there will always be teenage pregnancy and teenage parents.
The least we can do is let them ride public transportation in peace.

HEADLINE: Dow Ends 10-Day Climb As JPMorgan Leads Dip

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The major stock indexes slipped on Friday, ending the Dow Jones industrial average's longest winning streak since 1996 and leaving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index just below its 2007 high. 
A decline in shares of JPMorgan Chase after the bank was hit by a one-two punch of bad news weighed on the market.
The Dow snapped its 10-day winning streak, when it racked up a series of nominal highs, which are unadjusted for inflation. Stocks have rallied since the start of the year on signs of an improving economy and support for the recovery from the Federal Reserve.
On Thursday, the S.& P. 500 ended within 2 points of the closing price of 1,565.15 it hit in October 2007. On Friday, the benchmark index ended the session about 5 points away. For the week, the S.& P. 500 rose 0.6 percent. It is up 9.43 percent this year.
Investors could use the pause to consolidate bets before pushing the market higher again, said Clayton M. Albright III, director of asset allocation at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors in Wilmington, Del.
''I don't think that one or two days' movement is really going to change the underlying momentum of this market, which I still think is pretty strong at this point,'' Mr. Albright said.
JPMorgan Chase was the biggest drag on the S.& P. 500 and one of the biggest weights on the Dow, falling 98 cents, or 1.92 percent, to $50.02.
The Fed told JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs that they must fix flaws in how they determine capital payouts to shareholders, though the central bank still approved their plans for share buybacks and dividends.
A Senate report made public Thursday after the markets had closed also contended that JPMorgan had ignored risks, misled investors, fought with regulators and tried to work around rules as it dealt with mushrooming losses in a derivatives portfolio. A former top JPMorgan official told lawmakers on Friday that she was not to blame for the losses.
Goldman shares, however, recovered from early weakness to gain 82 cents, or 0.53 percent, to $154.84. Shares of rival Bank of America rose 3.8 percent, to $12.57.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 25.03 points, or 0.17 percent, to 14,514.11. The S.& P. 500 lost 2.53 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,560.70. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 9.86 points, or 0.30 percent, to 3,249.07.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.14 percent. The Dow is up 10.76 percent this year and the Nasdaq is up 7.6 percent.
Supporting the Nasdaq, shares of Apple rose 2.58 percent, to $443.66.
Data from the Lipper service of Thomson Reuters showed investors poured $11.26 billion of new cash into stock funds in the latest week, the most since January.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, to 100 3/32, and its yield fell to 1.99 percent, from 2.04 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Expanding Missile Defenses On Pacific Coast

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER, DAVID E. SANGER and MARTIN FACKLER; Thom Shanker and David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Martin Fackler from Seoul, South Korea. Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting from Seoul, and William J. Broad from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon will spend $1 billion to deploy additional ballistic missile interceptors along the Pacific Coast to counter the growing reach of North Korea's weapons, a decision accelerated by Pyongyang's recent belligerence and indications that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is resisting China's efforts to restrain him.
The new deployments, announced by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Friday, will increase the number of ground-based interceptors in California and Alaska to 44 from 30 by 2017.
The missiles have a mixed record in testing, hitting dummy targets just 50 percent of the time, but officials said Friday's announcement was intended not merely to present a credible deterrence to the North's limited intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal. They said it is also meant to show South Korea and Japan that the United States is willing to commit resources to deterring the North and, at the same time, warn Beijing that it must restrain its ally or face an expanding American military focus on Asia. 
''There's been a quickening pace of provocations,'' said one senior administration official, describing actions and words from North Korea and its new leader, Mr. Kim. ''But the real accelerant was the fact that the North Koreans seemed more unmoored from their Chinese handlers than even we had feared.''
Although American and South Korean intelligence officials doubt the North is close to being able to follow through on a nuclear strike, or that it would even try, given its almost certain destruction, analysts say the country's aggressive behavior is an important and worrying sign of changing calculations in the North.
In interviews over recent days, Obama administration officials described internal debates at the White House and the Pentagon about how strongly to react to the recent provocations. It is a delicate balance, they said, of defending against real potential threats while avoiding giving the North Koreans what one official called ''the satisfaction of seeming to make the rest of the world jumpy.''
In announcing the deployments at a Pentagon news conference, Mr. Hagel cited North Korea's third test of nuclear weapons technology last month, the successful test of a long-range missile that sent a satellite into space, and the discovery that a new generation of mobile missiles appeared closer to development.
''We will strengthen our homeland defense, maintain our commitments to our allies and partners, and make clear to the world that the United States stands firm against aggression,'' Mr. Hagel said.
All 14 of the new interceptors will be placed in silos at Fort Greely, Alaska, where 26 interceptors are already deployed. Four others are at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
North Korea has always been an unpredictable, provocative dictatorship. But even by its own standards, the isolated Communist regime's recent decision to nullify a wartime cease-fire and weeks of increasingly hyperbolic warnings, including of a pre-emptive nuclear strike, appear to have crossed new and dangerous lines.
Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also spoke at the Pentagon on Friday and described how the United States was deliberately building a two-tiered system of deterrence against North Korea.
The United States will ''put the mechanics in place to deny any potential North Korean objectives to launch a missile to the United States, but also to impose costs upon them if they do,'' Admiral Winnefeld said.
In an unusually pointed warning to the new North Korean leader, Admiral Winnefeld added, ''We believe that this young lad ought to be deterred by that -- and if he's not, we'll be ready.''
The arguments for bolstering the limited missile defense were symbolic of the larger problem.
The antimissile systems are considered less than reliable, and some administration officials were reluctant to pour additional resources into deploying more of the existing technology.
But in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gen. C. Robert Kehler, the commander of the United States Strategic Command, made clear they serve a larger purpose. ''Deterring North Korea from acting irrationally is our No. 1 priority,'' he said. He acknowledged that there were doubts that the 30 existing antimissile systems would be sufficient, and added that an additional site in the United States, on the East Coast, may be needed to deter Iran.
But the new deployment is also intended to send a signal to China, which tried but failed to block the more recent nuclear test, to rein in the North. ''We want to make it clear that there's a price to be paid for letting the North Koreans stay on the current path,'' a senior official said Friday.
The North's new leader, some analysts say, is intensifying the threats because he has failed to get the Obama administration and its South Korean allies to return to an established pattern in which the North provoked and the allies followed with much-needed economic aid in return for Pyongyang's promises to finally halt its nuclear weapons program.
But a growing number of experts believe North Korea also views its recent advances in missile and nuclear technology as game changers that will allow it to build the nuclear arsenal it desperately wants, both as a deterrent against better-armed enemies and a cudgel to extract more concessions and possibly even international recognition.
''Developing nuclear weapons gives North Korea a chance to turn the tables in one stroke,'' said Cheong Seong-chang, an expert on North Korea at the Sejong Institute. ''They can get around the weakness of their economy and their outdated conventional weapons.''
The short-term risk, analysts say, is that the North's chest-thumping will lead to another round of limited conventional military skirmishes with the South that could get out of control and, in the worst case, draw in the United States. With a new leader in South Korea under political pressure to stand up to her country's longtime enemy, the risks are especially high.
The main newspaper of North Korea's ruling party, Rodong Sinmun, recently gave the North's own explanation for its actions. ''Let the American imperialists and their followers know!'' the paper said. ''We are not a pushover like Iraq or Libya.''
Some missile-defense experts express deep skepticism about the capability of the ground-based interceptors deployed in California and Alaska.
''It remains unclear whether these ground-based interceptors can work effectively, and they should be subjected to much more rigorous field testing before taxpayer resources are spent on a system that is ineffective,'' said Tom Z. Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group here.
James N. Miller, the Pentagon's under secretary for policy, said the new missiles would have to show success before they would be deployed. ''We will continue to stick with our 'fly before we buy' approach,'' Mr. Miller said, citing a successful test as recently as Jan. 26. George Lewis, an antimissile missile expert at Cornell University, said 15 flight tests of the defensive system have tried to hit targets, and only eight have succeeded.
The Defense Department's interceptors in California and Alaska are to blunt a long-range missile threat from North Korea. The United States also deploys Patriot Advanced Capability batteries in South Korea for defense of targets there, and the South fields an older model of the Patriot.
Japan is developing its own layered missile-defense system, which includes Aegis warships and Patriot systems as well.
The United States deploys one advanced TPY-2 missile-defense tracking radar in Japan to enhance early warning across the region and toward the West Coast, and it has reached agreement to deploy a second.
And the Navy also recently bolstered its deployment of ballistic missile defense warships in waters off the Korean Peninsula, although the vessels were sent as part of an exercise even before the increase in caustic language from the North. As part of the Foal Eagle military exercise with South Korea, the Navy has four Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers in the region.

HEADLINE: U.S. Embassy Criticizes Pardons In Nigerian Corruption Cases

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

 BODY:
ABUJA, Nigeria -- Convictions for corruption by top officials in Nigeria are so rare that they are treated as national milestones. So when the government rolled back one of the most prominent of them this week, the shock was commensurate.
On Friday, the United States fueled a growing fracas over the pardoning of Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, the former governor of one of the country's oil-laden southern states, who was convicted in 2007 after jumping bail in London and sneaking back to Nigeria dressed as a woman. His antics were so extreme that even in a place of many obviously ill-gotten gains, he managed to raise eyebrows. 
The United States Embassy here said in a Twitter post that it was ''deeply disappointed'' over the ''recent pardons of corrupt officials,'' a declaration picked up quickly and gleefully by Nigerian news media on Friday. ''We see this as a setback in the fight against corruption,'' the embassy said on Twitter.
Civil society groups in Nigeria have erupted in outrage at the pardon of Mr. Alamieyeseigha under President Goodluck Jonathan, who once served as his deputy in Bayelsa State. The man who prosecuted the former governor called it a ''terrible development'' and an ominous portent for any hope of good government in Nigeria.
''It's very, very significant, in a negative way,'' said Nuhu Ribadu, the former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, himself deposed in 2008 and subjected to death threats after going after another powerful governor.
Mr. Ribadu once estimated that between independence and the end of military rule in 1999, Nigeria had lost more than $380 billion to corruption and mismanagement. In recent years, tens of billions of dollars have been siphoned from a federal oil revenues account, with virtually no accounting for it.
''Corruption is our main problem in Nigeria,'' Mr. Ribadu said in a phone interview here in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, on Friday. ''We don't need this kind of negative signal. This is a tragedy.''
Cash in the form of sweet crude oil shoots out of the ground in Bayelsa, and Mr. Alamieyeseigha liberally helped himself to it. According to the country's few anticorruption campaigners, he embezzled about $55 million in public funds and acquired real estate all over the world. His luck ran out when the London police found more than $1 million in cash at his home there. Dressed in drag, he escaped back to Bayelsa to the surprise of his fellow citizens.
But then, almost as surprisingly, he was pursued by the Nigerian authorities, specifically Mr. Ribadu's commission. His state legislature impeached him, and in 2007 Mr. Alamieyeseigha pleaded guilty to failing to declare his assets, and front companies he controlled were convicted of money laundering. He was sentenced to two years in prison but released the next day for time served. Still, he was the first governor ever to have been convicted.
But his political rehabilitation, at least in ruling party circles, was swift. A mere 10 months after his conviction, senior officials in the governing People's Democratic Party campaigned alongside him at a rally in Bayelsa, including Mr. Jonathan, who was then the vice president. Both Mr. Jonathan and Mr. Alamieyeseigha are members of the Ijaw ethnic group.
On Tuesday, the senior officials, including retired chief justices, that make up Nigeria's Council of State approved the pardon for Mr. Alamieyeseigha. Mr. Jonathan's administration has been defending it since then; a spokesman for the president, Doyin Okupe, was quoted in the Nigerian news media as telling incredulous reporters on Thursday that Mr. Alamieyeseigha had ''impacted positively on the overall economy of the nation.''
Mr. Ribadu responded angrily: ''That's laughable. How can you say that about someone who stole public money? It's totally wrong; it can't be right. It's totally the opposite.''
For Mr. Okupe, ''there are things that have to be done, that are done in the interest of the nation,'' as he said on a television news show full of angry commentary, broadcast Friday night.
Mr. Ribadu retorted: ''This is going to do a great deal of damage.''

HEADLINE: A Real Carbon Solution

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
Charles M. Blow is off today.

 BODY:
Sometime this summer, in Odessa, Tex., the Summit Power Group plans to break ground on a $2.5 billion coal gasification power plant. Summit has named this the Texas Clean Energy Project. With good reason.
Part of the promise of this power plant is its use of gasified coal; because the gasification process doesn't burn the coal, it makes for far cleaner energy than a traditional coal-fired plant.
But another reason this plant -- and a handful of similar plants -- has such enormous potential is that it will capture some 90 percent of the facility's already reduced carbon emissions. Some of those carbon emissions will be used to make fertilizer. The rest will be sold to the oil industry, which will push it into the ground, as part of a process called enhanced oil recovery. 
Let us count the potential benefits if plants like this became commonplace. Currently, some 40 percent of carbon emissions come from power plants. The carbon-capture process Summit will employ ''is the only technology that can reduce CO2 emissions from existing, stationary sources by up to 90 percent,'' said Judi Greenwald of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. To put it another way, this technology could be a climate-saver.
Second: Environmentalists could call off their war against the coal industry, thus saving tens of thousands of jobs, as climate-destroying coal-fired plants were replaced by clean coal gasification plants. Third: Gas-fired power plants, which already emit 50 percent less carbon than coal-fired plants, could become even cleaner if they included the carbon-capture technology. Fourth: Using carbon emissions to recover previously ungettable oil has the potential to unlock vast untapped American reserves. Last year, ExxonMobil reported that enhanced oil recovery would allow it to extend the life of a single oil field in West Texas by 20 years.
Fifth: China. Too often, American environmentalists ignore the reality that the Chinese are far more concerned with economic growth than climate change. (And who can blame them? All they want is what we already have.) The Chinese are relentlessly building coal-fired power plants, which Western environmentalists couldn't stop even if they tried. But if power plants like Summit's -- which will turn CO2 into profitable products -- were to gain momentum, that would likely catch China's attention. A reduction of carbon emissions from Chinese power plants would do far more to help reverse climate change than -- dare I say it? -- blocking the Keystone XL oil pipeline.
The Summit executive most closely associated with the Texas Clean Energy Project is Laura Miller. Her environmental credentials are unimpeachable. As the mayor of Dallas in 2006, Miller founded the Texas Clean Air Cities Coalition to fight a plan by TXU Energy, a big power company, to build 11 new coal-fired plants. During a trip to Europe, she saw both coal gasification and carbon-capture technologies being used. When she left the mayor's office, she signed up with Summit and became a passionate advocate of the Odessa plant. Eric Redman, the president and chief executive of Summit Power, describes her as ''the public face of the project.'' (As a young man, by the way, Redman wrote one of the classic works about Congress, ''The Dance of Legislation.'' It's still worth reading.)
So who could possibly be against coal gasification and carbon capture? Ratepayers, for one, mainly because carbon-capture technology is so expensive. In 2011, American Electric Power, or A.E.P., canceled a big carbon-capture project, in part because it was clear that state regulators were not going to allow the company to pass on the additional costs to its customers.
To help make the project economically viable, the Texas Clean Energy Project is getting a $450 million grant from the Department of Energy. (Absurdly, the Internal Revenue Service is requiring Summit to pay taxes on the federal grant, which means that a third of it will go right back to the government.) But if the plant proves successful -- as I believe it will -- and others replicate it, the costs will inevitably come down, and federal help won't likely be needed.
And the other opponent? None other than Bill McKibben, Mr. ''Stop Keystone'' himself. When I e-mailed him to ask whether he supported carbon-capture for enhanced oil recovery, he replied that if carbon were sent back into the ground ''the worst possible thing to do with it is to get more oil above ground.'' He continued, ''It's time to keep oil in the earth, not to mention gas and coal.''
To me, at least, his answer suggests that his crusade has blinded him to the real problem. The enemy is not fossil fuels; it is the damage that is done because of the way we use fossil fuels. If we can find a way to create clean energy from fossil fuels, then they can become (as they used to say) part of the solution instead of part of the problem.
Thankfully, Laura Miller and Eric Redman understand that, even if Bill McKibben doesn't.

HEADLINE: Road Runners Facing Difficulty Months After Marathon Uproar

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and ANDREW W. LEHREN; Mary Pilon contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The furor over New York Road Runners' handling of its marathon last year has died down, but questions about the group's future persist, including whether its dominance has started to erode because of rival race organizers and disaffected runners.
Some of the group's local races have had a striking decline in finishers compared with numbers from a year ago. Critics of Road Runners say this indicates that runners are heading elsewhere.
In November, Road Runners was widely criticized for insisting that the New York City Marathon would take place despite the effects of Hurricane Sandy. Then the group abruptly canceled the race two days before it was scheduled to be run, angering many participants.
Since then, Mary Wittenberg, the organization's chief executive, has tried to repair its image and finances. She negotiated an insurance settlement that allowed Road Runners to take the extraordinary step of offering refunds to entrants in November's race. She has also re-emphasized the group's charitable efforts to try to rebuild its brand in the city and among runners, who were sharply divided by the decision to cancel the marathon. 
''All the marathon did was stress, keep doing what we do, having an impact on the community and the runners,'' said Wittenberg, who called the last several months a period of ''great clarity.''
''When you think of the marathon, it was a city in pain,'' she added. ''It was what it was, and on we go.''
But on the eve of the New York City Half, a half-marathon scheduled for Sunday that is the group's first major road race since the marathon, Road Runners has more hurdles to clear. The number of finishers in at least five races since the marathon has fallen compared with the prior year's results.
The number of finishers at the Joe Kleinerman 10K Classic, run in Central Park in January, plunged 41 percent. The Al Gordon Classic, a four-mile race at Prospect Park in February, had a 19 percent decrease. The number of finishers, a gauge for the number of entrants, declined by lesser amounts in other races. Other popular events, like the New York City Half and Coogan's March, have sold out this year.
Gaining a spot in Road Runners' best-known race, the New York City Marathon, will be particularly tough because of the fallout from Hurricane Sandy.
After the cancellation of November's race, the group offered each entrant a refund or a guaranteed entry to a future race. About half of the roughly 60,000 entrants asked for refunds, Wittenberg said. But of the 30,000 who chose a guaranteed spot, 20,000 opted to run in this year's marathon, an influx that is certain to crowd out other runners in the already competitive lottery. Of the remaining 10,000 or so runners who have a guaranteed entry, about 6,000 chose the 2014 marathon, while the remainder opted for a spot in the 2015 marathon or Sunday's half-marathon.
To accommodate the flood of new entries, Road Runners capped the number of runners who can qualify by meeting a time standard in a non-Road Runners event, and they will be chosen by lottery. ''I just about kill myself, but I do it,'' a runner named DH said on letsrun.com, an online forum, referring to the time standards he has met in the past. ''Now they're telling me even that's not good enough, and I'll have to go through a random drawing to get in.''
The impact of the guaranteed entries will become clearer next month, when registration opens for this year's marathon. But longtime club members and others active in New York running said that despite lingering skepticism about the group, disaffected runners would ultimately be replaced by others.
''The people who are annoyed or angered will flow away,'' said Bill du Pont Staab Jr., president of the West Side Runners Club. ''The discontent is serious, really, but runners want to run, and they are the only game in town.''
Staab and other active runners, though, said more athletes are discovering smaller races that are easier to enter and have personalized services similar to what Road Runners offered in the past. Runners have complained that the quality of the food, medals and T-shirts at Road Runners races has diminished in recent years as the races have grown.
Races put on by the Competitor Group, which runs the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon Series, and NYCRuns, an organizer of boutique races, have received high marks from runners, who have cited smaller crowds and better bagels, hot cocoa, T-shirts and other amenities.
''What draws people to us is they like what we're doing,'' said Steve Lastoe, the founder and race director of NYCRuns, which organized about 40 races last year, none of which had more than about 1,500 entrants. ''What we aspire to do is to provide the technical quality of a New York Road Runner event combined with the community feel of a local race.''
Beyond the races, broader questions remain about the effect of last year's marathon on the Road Runners brand. The Dutch bank ING is in the last year of its title sponsorship of the race, and Road Runners has been exploring alternatives if ING does not renew its deal. It is unclear, though, whether a new company would pay as much as ING did.
In a statement, ING said that ''given our long and positive relationship with the race, we're interested in keeping the dialogue open with N.Y.R.R.''
There are other complications. Ann Wells Crandall, Road Runners' longtime chief of marketing strategy, left the group shortly after the marathon was canceled. Richard Finn, the group's spokesman for 14 years, will leave at the end of the month.
Next year, Road Runners will also lose one of its biggest supporters when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg leaves office. Although police fees for traffic control increased during his administration, Bloomberg eagerly promoted the race as a way to boost fitness, tourism and economic development. Several candidates for mayor, including Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, opposed the running of the marathon last fall.
Wittenberg said she was confident that Bloomberg's replacement would support the marathon just as enthusiastically. But she has had to repair relationships with other politicians who lashed out at the marathon in November. Wittenberg recently met with James P. Molinaro, the Staten Island borough president, who is counting on Road Runners to put on a race on the island this summer to raise money for storm relief.
''Nothing is permanent in life,'' he said, referring to his marathon opposition. ''I believe, let's move on. As far as I am concerned, it's gone.''
Wittenberg, though, remains something of a lightning rod among runners, though far less so than in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, when some runners wrote online that she should step down. The number of comments on Facebook sites like ''Mary Wittenberg Should Resign'' declined in the weeks after Road Runners' announcement that it would offer refunds. (Some runners, though, are still frustrated that they have to pay new fees to re-enter this year's race.)
Other race organizers and running club stalwarts said Wittenberg dealt with the crisis as well as could be expected. The board of Road Runners has also stood behind her efforts to refocus on the club's broader mission.
''Part of the rap is that people just think of us as a big business, but we're much more than a big business,'' said Norman Goluskin, a board member at Road Runners who has been active in programs to promote running among schoolchildren. ''We haven't done a good enough job letting people know what we do for social good. It's kind of like we're talking to ourselves.''

HEADLINE: Obama Seeks to Use Oil and Gas Money to Develop Alternative Fuel Cars

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
ARGONNE, Ill. -- Warning that the United States risks falling behind in the international race to develop alternative energy, President Obama on Friday proposed diverting $2 billion in revenue from federal oil and gas royalties over the next decade to pay for research on advanced vehicles.
Mr. Obama toured a vehicle research facility at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago and then spoke to employees about his plan, first proposed in his State of the Union address last month, to use oil and gas money to find ways to replace hydrocarbons as the primary fuel for cars, trucks and buses. 
The president said the nation was experiencing one of its regular spikes in gasoline prices, in effect a tax on every American household.
''The only way to really break this cycle of spiking gas prices, the only way to break that cycle for good, is to shift our cars entirely -- our cars and trucks -- off oil,'' the president said. ''It's not just about saving money. It's also about saving the environment. But it's also about our national security.''
''It's not a Democratic idea or a Republican idea,'' he added. ''It's just a smart idea.''
Perched on a platform behind Mr. Obama as he spoke were three alternative fuel vehicles now for sale in the United States: a Chevrolet Volt and a Ford C-Max Energi, both plug-in electric hybrids, and a Honda Civic outfitted to run on natural gas.
He spoke inside a building housing a giant X-ray chamber known as the Advanced Photon Source, described by Argonne officials as the brightest source of X-rays in the Western Hemisphere. The facility allows scientists to explore materials on a nanoscale and to study ways to improve engine combustion.
The idea of devoting some oil and gas royalties for alternative energy research has some support from both parties and from business leaders, but it is likely to encounter strong resistance from Congressional Republicans, who have been critical of Mr. Obama's spending on nontraditional vehicle technologies. The White House says that the money will come from growth in royalties from leases on offshore oil and gas fields over the next decade, and that it represents a tiny fraction of the overall federal research and development budget.
Mr. Obama said he was seeking to build as broad an energy portfolio as possible for the country, with expanded oil and gas development; favorable tax treatment for nonpolluting sources like wind, solar and geothermal energy; loan guarantees for new nuclear plants; increased emphasis on energy efficiency; and research into long-term alternatives to fossil fuels.
Mr. Obama has given up on moving comprehensive climate change legislation through Congress and has ruled out a carbon tax as a way to finance the development of alternative energy sources, so he is pursuing smaller projects that do not require new sources of revenue. The Energy Security Trust, as he calls his proposal to shift oil and gas royalties to alternative energy research, is one of those projects.
The money will support research on a range of cleaner means of powering vehicles, the White House said, including electricity, biofuels, fuel cells and produced natural gas.
The president's proposal to add $200 million a year to the research budget of the Energy Department's office of renewable energy would represent about a 10 percent increase in the office's overall spending, or 25 percent of its spending on transportation research, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.
But David Friedman, the group's deputy director for clean vehicles, said the plan could have the unintended effect of increasing pressure on the administration to open new public lands and waters to stepped-up drilling to ensure the revenues for the program.
He noted that Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, had proposed a similar mechanism for financing alternative energy research, but had explicitly tied it to new drilling, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The president has vowed to make addressing climate change a priority in his second term, but he has provided only scant details on how he intends to act. The White House gave a hint of the breadth of his ambition in its annual Economic Report of the President, issued on Friday.
''Policies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases include market-based policies; encouraging energy efficiency; direct regulation; encouraging fuel switching to reduced-emissions fuels; and supporting the development and widespread adoption of zero-emissions energy sources such as wind and solar,'' the report says. ''And, as the country reduces emissions along this path, it also needs to prepare for the climate change that is occurring and will continue to occur. Together these policies pave the way toward a sustainable energy future.''
Also on Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency released its annual survey of the fuel efficiency of cars and light trucks sold in the United States. The agency found that the 2012 domestic fleet was the cleanest and most fuel-efficient ever, with an overall average of 23.8 miles per gallon. Under regulations issued last year, that number is expected to double by 2025.
Argonne National Laboratory, which has done groundbreaking research in vehicle battery technology that has helped jump-start the electric car industry in the United States, received a significant amount of Mr. Obama's stimulus money. But it is now facing reductions under the mandatory budget cuts known as sequestration. The laboratory's director, Eric D. Isaacs, who led the president on his tour, warned this week that the spending cuts would have a devastating impact on scientific innovation now and far into the future.
In an article in The Atlantic written with the directors of two other Energy Department labs, Dr. Isaacs said that the cuts would force all new programs and research initiatives to be canceled, probably for at least two years.
''This sudden halt on new starts will freeze American science in place while the rest of the world races forward, and it will knock a generation of young scientists off their stride, ultimately costing billions of dollars in missed future opportunities,'' Dr. Isaacs wrote.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Finally Take a Stand

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
It's been four years since the Democrats who control the Senate produced a budget. That has meant four missed opportunities to demonstrate what they stand for, in hard numbers and clear spending priorities. On Wednesday, the chamber's leaders stiffened their spines and issued a 2014 budget. If the result isn't quite a courageous resistance to political winds, it at least makes most of the right choices and is a solid rebuttal to the heartless collection of obsolete dogmas that is the House budget. 
The plan, assembled by Senator Patty Murray of Washington, would raise nearly a $1 trillion in new revenue over a decade by eliminating tax loopholes and breaks that benefit wealthy taxpayers and corporations. It recommends either limiting the overall itemized deductions of the top 2 percent of taxpayers or eliminating individual loopholes like the favorable tax rates given to hedge-fund managers. Corporations would no longer be able to avoid taxation by hiding money overseas.
At the same time, this budget cuts an equal amount of spending, $975 billion, in a way that avoids the reckless damage to vital programs and to the poor in the budget favored by the House. Nearly a third of the reductions come from new efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid, building on the reforms in the Affordable Care Act. The rest comes from defense cuts after American troops withdraw from Afghanistan, along with cuts to wasteful programs like agriculture supports.
These cuts and revenue increases would replace the arbitrary reductions of the sequester, which does not distinguish between good and bad programs or pay attention to the heavy damage it would inflict on the economy, destroying up to a million jobs.
Ms. Murray's plan, recognizing that government has to play a role in accelerating the recovery, would devote $100 billion to new job-creating investments: $50 billion for transportation projects, $10 billion for fixing dams and ports, $20 billion for repairing schools and $10 billion for an infrastructure bank for big projects.
The proposal could have gone further. Under pressure from the false Washington ''consensus'' that the deficit is an immediate problem, the plan fails to spend enough on education or even on President Obama's proposal for universal preschool. Unlike the budget from the Congressional Progressive Caucus, it does not call for higher tax rates on the rich, or for a bigger estate tax, or for taxing capital gains as ordinary income.
But it rejects the hard-right insistence that the budget must be balanced in the short term, the destructive goal of Paul Ryan's House version. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted on Friday, Mr. Ryan's budget gets at least two-thirds of its $5 trillion in nondefense cuts from programs that benefit low- and moderate-income people. While providing the rich with a tax cut, it would cut trillions from Medicaid, food stamps, school lunches, nutrition aid and Pell Grants.
The Senate now needs to make a strong defense of the principles it has, at last, put on paper.

HEADLINE: Gouging the Poor in New York

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has warned debt collectors that they could face legal sanctions if they try to collect predatory loans that violate the state's usury law, which prohibits loans with interest rates above 25 percent. The governor needs to take an equally forceful stand against pending bills that would encourage predatory lending by allowing check-cashing stores to enter the lending business and exempting them from the usury law. 
Payday lenders prosper by turning what are supposed to be two-week transactions into long-term debt, which can carry rates of 500 percent or more if borrowers take months to pay off. In 1976, New York made it a felony to make these kinds of loans.
The sponsors of the bills on check-cashing stores have tried to make them seem innocuous. But an analysis by the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project finds that even the most affordable loan offered under the Assembly bill would entail an interest rate of nearly 50 percent, if proposed fees are taken into account.
Supporters of the exemption portray it as a boon to poor communities that lack access to banking and credit. Poor neighborhoods, however, already pay too much for financial services. Beyond that, if New York gives check cashers an exemption to issue loans that exceed the current 25 percent limit, lobbyists will eventually seek similar exemptions for other financial institutions.
Public interest groups have spoken out against the bills. They include the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, which says it extended $43 million in assistance last year to more than 61,000 servicemen and women, many of whom had been trapped with high-interest loans they could not afford. The check-cashing-store exemption, it says, ''would be harmful to active and retired Sailors, Marines, and their families residing in New York and struggling to make ends meet in this difficult economy.''
The answer to the problem is not to gouge these communities but to bring legitimate financial services to neighborhoods that need them.

HEADLINE: Boom Over, St. Patrick's Isle Is Slithering Again

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
BALLIVOR, Ireland -- Legend has it that St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland. The economic crisis has brought some of them back.
During the Celtic Tiger boom, snakes became a popular pet among the Irish nouveaux riches, status symbols in a country famous for its lack of indigenous serpents. But after the bubble burst, many snake owners could no longer afford the cost of food, heating and shelter, or they left the country for work elsewhere. Some left their snakes behind or turned them loose in the countryside, leading to some startling encounters.
A California king snake was found late last year in a vacant store in Dublin, a 15-foot python turned up in a garden in Mullingar, a corn snake was found in a trash bin in Clondalkin in South Dublin, and an aggressive rat snake was kept in a shed in County Meath, northwest of Dublin, an area dotted with sprawling houses built during the boom. 
''The recession is the thing that's absolutely causing this,'' said Kevin Cunningham, a 37-year-old animal lover who started the National Exotic Animal Sanctuary after he left his job at a Dublin nightclub. He has transformed an old single-room schoolhouse near Ballivor, a hamlet in the Meath countryside, into a reptile sanctuary.
''It was about status,'' Mr. Cunningham said as he waved to a four-foot red iguana that was found under a sink in an abandoned house in Dublin. ''During the boom, people treated these animals as conversation starters.''
Animals have always been abandoned in greater numbers in times of famine, economic hardship and mass emigration in Ireland, but in the past that usually meant farm animals. The Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was taking in five or six emaciated horses a week as recently as 2010. Now, though, snakes are more common among the foundlings, including a python named Basie that someone dropped by the side of a road.
''In the Tiger economy,'' said P. J. Doyle, a reptile expert, ''young people could pay 600 quid for a snake'' and the necessary equipment -- about $700 to $1,000 during much of the boom. But these days, he said, some owners ''just drive up and throw them somewhere.''
Mr. Doyle, a hulking man with weathered skin and a gap between his teeth, helped the cruelty prevention society brace for an influx of reptiles around, of all dates, St. Patrick's Day, when the warmer spring weather means that the coldblooded snakes will be more active and more likely to show themselves.
''We always get a bump in calls around Paddy's Day,'' Gillian Bird, the education officer at the society, said as she pet Carl, a green iguana from South America that she named after a colleague's boyfriend.
Irish legend holds that the country has no native snakes because St. Patrick banished them in the fifth century. But science says the country was snake-free long before Patrick's time. When the glaciers of the most recent ice age retreated from the British Isles more than 10,000 years ago, Ireland was already separated from the rest of Europe by open sea, an isolated ecosystem with a damp, chilly climate that is hostile to almost all reptiles, other than a common lizard.
Most of the recent snake sightings have occurred in the counties around Dublin, where the newly prosperous congregated in the country's boom years. The government does not require owners to register pet reptiles, so there are no official statistics on the total number of snakes present in the country.
''If you buy a dog, you need a license, but if you buy a snake, you don't,'' said Brendan Ryan, a director of the Irish Pest Control Association.
Like the country's housing boom and subsequent bust, the snake influx can partly be traced to European integration. In the years when Ireland stood somewhat apart from the broader European economy, it had strict regulations on the types of plants and animals that could be imported, but now Ireland's standards match the more relaxed rules of other member states of the European Union.
''We've got no regulation whatsoever covering exotics,'' said James Hennessy, zoo director and founder of Reptile Village Conservation Zoo in County Kilkenny. ''Once it's in Europe legally and coming from other European states, you can pick up whatever you want.''
Reptile Village is often called upon to rescue animals, including a crocodile that had been bought online and then abandoned in a Dublin apartment and a six-foot boa constrictor that had taken up residence under a skylight in an attic in County Meath. ''His name's Sammy, and he's brilliant,'' Mr. Hennessy said of the snake.
A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said Ireland adheres to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. But the convention does not prohibit trade in venomous snakes, which, while still rare here, can legally be bought in Ireland. That presents a scary proposition in a country with almost no antivenin stocks.
''You have to ask yourself why it's permissible to have these animals in the country,'' Mr. Ryan said.
Though a few loose rattlesnakes, cobras and vipers have been reported, most of the released snakes are not venomous and pose little or no hazard to humans. That does not always make them a welcome sight, though. ''We have it deep inbred in us that they're evil and nasty and tempted Eve and were led out of Ireland,'' said Mr. Cunningham, the animal sanctuary founder.
He said one six-foot snake ended up with him recently after its owner lost his job and had to move in with his parents: ''Being a good Irish mother, she said, 'Of course I'll take you back home -- but I'm not taking your boa constrictor.' ''

HIGHLIGHT: Pope Francis&#8217;s past; snakes as Irish economic barometer; treason accusation in Russia; and Bolshoi director recovers. 

 BODY:
 NEWS Reacting with unusual swiftness, the Vatican on Friday rejected any suggestion that Pope Francis of Argentina was implicated in his country's so-called Dirty War during the 1970s, tackling the issue just two days after the pontiff's election. On a day when Francis delivered a warm address to his cardinals and continued to project humility, the Vatican seemed intent on quickly putting to rest questions about the pope's past, dismissing them as opportunistic defamations from anticlerical leftists. Dan Wakin reports from Rome. 
Legend has it that St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland. The economic crisis has brought some of them back. During the Celtic Tiger boom, snakes became a popular pet among the Irish nouveau riche. But after the bubble burst, many owners abandoned the pets they could no longer afford, and as a result, many snakes have been abandoned or dispersed into the wild. Amy Chozick reports from Ballivor, Ireland.
In a striking move to purge the Russian Parliament of even the faintest of contrarian voices, legislative leaders on Friday accused an opposition lawmaker of treason and demanded an ethics investigation, saying that the legislator had used a visit to Washington this month to urge the United States to meddle in Russia's internal affairs. David Herszhenhorn reports from Moscow.
Sergei Filin, the Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director, said he was on the way to a "full recovery" almost two months after he was severely burned during an acid attack in Moscow. At a news conference in Germany, where he has been undergoing treatment, Mr. Filin said he would return to his position and played down the intrigues that have engulfed the theater in the weeks since sulfuric acid was flung in his face and eyes.Melissa Eddy reports from Aachen, Germany.
 ARTS The European Fine Art Fair, which opened Friday in its 26th edition and runs through March 24, is the last encyclopedic training ground available in a world where art for sale is vanishing. More than 700 stands, spread out in the MECC fair and conference center, cut across space and time. Even if circumscribed to Europe, the broad span is astonishing. Souren Melikian reports from Maastricht, the Netherlands.
 SPORTS What first looked to be a thrilling down-to-the-wire finale this weekend in alpine ski racing will mostly be a victory salute for Marcel Hirscher, the 24-year-old Austrian who will receive his second consecutive large crystal globe as overall World Cup champion after the season-ending slalom Sunday. Hirscher entered the weekend technical races at the World Cup finals with a 149-point advantage over his nearest challenger, Aksel Lund Svindal. That margin became insurmountable when the Norwegian announced that he would forgo the slalom after cancellation of downhill and super-G races Wednesday and Thursday because of adverse weather conditions.Brian Pinelli reports from Lenzerheide, Switzerland.

HEADLINE: Murmurs About Political Outsider at Conservative Gathering

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: A new face generated curiosity and unexpected 2016 speculation at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday: Ben Carson, the celebrated neurosurgeon. 

 BODY:
OXON HILL, Md. - A new face generated curiosity and unexpected 2016 speculation at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday: Ben Carson, the celebrated neurosurgeon.
Mr. Carson's pitch is part revenge of the nerds, part rebellion against political correctness and part history lesson, with some Biblical references and a rags-to-riches story mixed in. 
In the space of just over a month, Mr. Carson has gone from being an apolitical doctor known for separating conjoined twins to an entrant in the conservatives' 2016 presidential straw poll. At the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 7, Mr. Carson surprised many in the audience by criticizing President Obama's tax and health care policies while calling for reduction of the federal debt, all while the president sat feet away at the head table.
At the conference on Saturday, Mr. Carson used brain anatomy to explain the human capacity to plan ahead, quoted Jesus, and told his story of growing up poor in Detroit with a single mother who made him read. He rejected the notion that he should talk about race because he is black, again noting that all brains look the same.
"When did we reach a point when you have to have a certain philosophy because of the color of your skin?" he said.
Mr. Carson advocates a flat tax, saying he finds the idea of letting those with less income pay a proportionally smaller tax bill "very offensive, having grown up poor. What you're saying is I, the superior and elite one, will take care of you."
He has also said that health savings accounts, combined with catastrophic health insurance, would be a better solution to rising health care costs.
Already a seasoned member of the lecture circuit, Mr. Carson uses comedy to showcase his intellectual credentials. He mocked critics of his policy prescriptions who might say, "He's a neurosurgeon, so he couldn't know anything about economics."
After a beat, he added, "It's not brain surgery."
He announced on Saturday that he intends to retire from medicine later this year to focus on his education scholarship program.
"Once we get that taken care of, who knows what I'll do," said Mr. Carson, 61, to cheers from the crowd.
After his speech, Mr. Carson's name could be heard in murmurs in the hallways of the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, on the Potomac riverfront just outside Washington. Eric Ekman, who traveled from Sandy Hook, Conn., to attend the conference, said he had never heard of Mr. Carson until Saturday's speech. But he immediately bought Mr. Carson's new book, "America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great," and was eager to learn more.
Already, Mr. Ekman was impressed that Mr. Carson "made a scholarship fund so he could encourage students as opposed to athletes." That was in contrast, Mr. Ekman said, to politicians who join government to try to shrink it, without offering private alternatives.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths CAULO, JAMES E.

 BODY:
CAULO--James E.,Died peacefully on March 3, 2013 at his home in Hingham, MA. He was 96. Through a combination of self-determination and good fortune, Mr. Caulo overcame his humble beginnings and limited formal education to create a rich and satisfying life for himself and his family. James Edward Caulo was born on August 16, 1916 in Brooklyn, NY to Edward V. Caulo and Mary Maynard. His early years were spent in the care of his grandparents, Rocco and Antonina Caulo, Italian immigrants who spoke little English. 
They raised Mr. Caulo, his older sister, Vera and other family members in a small apartment in Brooklyn. A product of both the public school system and the streets of New York, Mr. Caulo came of age during the Great Depression. He dropped out of high school at age fifteen to deliver sandwiches to businesses in Manhattan. Later Mr. Caulo studied accounting as a non-matriculating student at NYU, which led to employment at Schaefer Brewery in Brooklyn in 1947. Mr. Caulo enjoyed a prosperous 20 year career at Schaefer, being promoted to Comptroller of its Brooklyn operations. After leaving Schaefer, Mr. Caulo was named Vice President at Becton-Dickinson where he was involved in a variety of finance-related roles, including numerous corporate acquisitions during the 1970s. In retirement, Mr. Caulo continued to apply his business experience by volunteering at American Women for Economic Development (AWED), mentoring aspiring entrepreneurs. In 1948, Mr. Caulo met Frances J. Smith, a nurse working at Post-Graduate Hospital in Manhattan. After a brief courtship, the couple was married in April 1949 and moved to northern New Jersey where they established and maintained a loving partnership that lasted for nearly 64 years. Along the way, they raised five children while living in Hillsdale and Franklin Lakes. A voracious reader, Mr. Caulo absorbed and mastered topics as broad as classic literature, history, current events, religion, opera, and sports. On any given day, he could quote the price of gold on the commodities market and also recall the featured performers from various opening night productions at the Metropolitan Opera. He welcomed and delighted in any opportunity to engage in a lively discussion on current affairs with family and friends, at the dinner table or beyond, with or without a glass of wine. He also was an avid gardener and tennis player. In addition to his wife, Frances, Mr. Caulo is survived by their five children: Susan (and Dr. John) Purcell of Cambridge MA; Nina Caulo Feirman of Redwood City, CA; John (and Debra) Caulo of Burlington, VT; Ellen Caulo of Arlington, MA and Peter (and Betsey) Caulo of Amherst, NH as well as ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild. A celebration of Jim's life for family and friends will be held on a later date. The family would also like to acknowledge the loving care Jim was provided in his final months by private caregivers and the Norwell VNA & Hospice. A donation in Jim's name can be made to the Norwell VNA & Hospice, 120 Longwater Drive, Norwell, MA 02061 (www.nvna.org).

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths NADHERNY, FERDINAND

 BODY:
NADHERNY--Ferdinand, 86, passed away on March 12, 2013. Born December 12, 1926 in Berwyn, Il to Fred and Martha Nadherny. He attended Jefferson Grade School before entering Morton East High School outside of Chicago. At Morton, he was an honor student and played three varsity sports, receiving All State recognition as fullback his senior year. Ferd was later recognized as one of the four most distinguished graduates of Morton East in the last century. 
He graduated from Morton in 1945 and joined the Navy. Following his discharge from the Navy he attended Yale University on the G.I. Bill, having been introduced to the school by Robert Anderson. Ferd later established a scholarship in the name of Anderson for scholar athletes from the Chicago area. At Yale he majored in economics and earned eight varsity letters in the late 1940's in football and basketball, receiving All America Honorable Mention recognition for his exploits on the gridiron as a hard running fullback. These exploits earned him the nickname, Ferdinand the Bull," which affectionately stayed with him throughout his life. Following graduation from Yale in 1950 with a degree in economics and sociology, he entered Harvard Business School, graduating in 1952. While at Harvard he married his beloved wife of 62 years in June, 1951. After Harvard, Nadherny commenced his business career with The Cabot Corporation eventually settling in Wellesley, MA and had three sons (Chris, Steve, and Jeff) and two daughters (Wendy and Sandy). He was a very devoted father who loved his family and made it a priority throughout his life. In 1964 Ferd took a leave of absence from Cabot to further serve his country, joining the Lyndon Johnson administration in Washington, DC to help organize the Office of Economic Opportunity (The War on Poverty). He and the family returned to Chicago (Winnetka, Il) in 1966 where he held executive positions in several businesses before discovering his calling, executive search, that would become a passion for the next 25 years. He joined Russell Reynolds Associates in 1974 to start the firm's Chicago office, only the fourth office in the company. By the time he retired from the firm in 1996 it had grown to 30 worldwide offices, a number of which he helped open. Continuing to serve clients he became President of Russell Reynolds in 1980 and Vice Chairman in 1988 always working out of Chicago. Known as a consummate professional whose integrity, enthusiasm and respect for others were hallmarks, he built and left a legacy in Chicago and more broadly across the firm, and industry. Others trusted him with their lives. Ferd was recognized as an engaging leader who built teams and was genuinely excited by the successes of others. He had a never ending quest for quality, professionalism, and a willingness to listen to others. His honesty was surpassed only by his work ethic. Nadherny was a great believer in education and giving back to his community, serving as a Board Director for Leadership Greater Chicago, and Leadership for Quality Education. He also became a life Trustee of the Golden Apple Foundation, and life Member of the Advisory Council for Kellogg Graduate School of Business. Over the years, he stayed close to his alma mater, chairing three successful 1950 class reunion alumni drives. An avid golfer, he became a member of Old Elm Country Club in Highland Park, Il, the Country Club of Florida in Boynton Beach where he resided winters with his wife. A special interest of Ferd's in later years were the Achievement Centers for Children and Families in Delray, FL whose mission is to nurture safe environments for those children at greatest risk and helping families to break the cycle of poverty. He cared about making a difference. In his final five years, beset by congestive heart failure and advanced peripheral neuropathy, he continued to exhibit optimism, courage and faith. He is remembered for living life fully, being a role model, caring, his complete integrity, humility, the twinkle in his blue eyes, and the inviting smile with which he greeted his family and many dear friends. He is survived by his devoted wife, his five children, eleven grandchildren, a great-grandson, and sister Marjory. Those wishing to make a donation in Ferd Nadherny's name may contribute to the Robert Gardner Anderson Scholarship Fund, at Yale University, Office of Development, P.O. Box 2038, New Haven, CT 06521; or Achievement Centers at 555 N.W. 4th Street, Delray Beach, FL 33444.

HEADLINE: Ram Dashboards Cracking

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
When Joe Longo bought a new 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 he figured, even with a heavy-duty pickup, normal wear and tear would cause some parts to fail. But something happened that he had never imagined.
About three years ago, he saw a crack on the dashboard and figured it was a freak occurrence. ''The last thing I ever thought would go bad on a vehicle would be the dashboard,'' said Mr. Longo of Norwalk, Conn. ''I was pretty ticked off. I thought that maybe something fell on it.''
Then he searched the Internet and found other reports of disintegrating dashes. And it seemed that Chrysler was often refusing to pay for repairs. 
Mr. Longo is one of about 150 owners who have filed Ram dashboard complaints with the Center for Auto Safety.
Michael Wickenden, who operates the site CarComplaints.com, which tracks owners' gripes about their cars, called the Ram dashboards ''definitely one of the top problems right now, mainly in model years from 1999 to 2003, all across the Dodge Ram model line from the 1500 all the way up to the 3500.''
Mr. Wickenden said he had received almost 1,700 complaints for the 1998-2007 model years, with the heaviest concentration in 2003 models. He said some people reported cracks, while others said chunks of their dashboards had fallen off.
In an e-mail, a Chrysler spokeswoman, Ann Smith, wrote that the automaker was ''aware of some dashboard complaints that are generally isolated to older vehicles outside of the warranty period.''
She added, ''There are a variety of environmental factors which may impact the long-term performance of the dashboard, but it is difficult to identify common factors on 10-year-old vehicles.''
A review of files on the Web site of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found about 200 complaints from owners of 2003 models alone. One owner wrote: ''The entire dashboard was separated from the vehicle, causing the wires to shorten. As a result, the horn and exterior lighting failed intermittently. The air bag was also exposed.''
Another owner described driving with the windows down and having ''part of the cracked dashboard to fly up and hit my face.'' The writer added that ''it caused me to lose control for a second.''
Other Ram owners described jagged and sharp plastic edges and wondered what might happen in a crash.
Allan Kam, a safety consultant in Bethesda, Md., who was once the senior enforcement lawyer for the traffic safety administration, said the summaries suggested conditions that should be investigated as a possible safety issue.
Another former agency official, Michael Brownlee, who had headed the office of defect investigations and was associate administrator for enforcement when he retired in 1997, said an agency review was warranted by the reports of flying debris, sharp edges and concerns about whether an air bag might properly deploy.
A N.H.T.S.A. spokeswoman, Karen Aldana, said the agency ''is aware of the condition and is reviewing consumer complaints'' but ''sees no basis on which to open a safety defect investigation.'' She added, ''As always, we will continue to monitor the issue.''
There is a precedent for a dash-related recall, said Clarence Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group. In 1977, Ford recalled 252,000 of its 1975-77 Econoline vans because the plastic on the dash could fracture if struck and the sharp pieces ''could contribute to occupant injury.''
Mr. Ditlow said the situation with Rams was worse, because the dashboards were already broken.
Mr. Wickenden of CarComplaints.com said the agency's failure to require a recall was a sore point with owners. ''A lot of people are frustrated because they feel it is a safety issue because of the jagged edges,'' he said.
Ms. Smith of Chrysler said there wasn't a safety problem because ''2003-4 trucks have been on the road for a long time with a lot of customers and a lot of miles.'' She added, ''We don't have any injury claims.''
Many owners also complained that Chrysler wouldn't repair the dashes, even under warranty, calling it a cosmetic issue. ''When I think of a cosmetic problem, I think of something like the color of the paint,'' Mr. Kam said.
Ms. Smith said ''the manufacturer's warranty would have covered cracked dashboard repairs for the original owner.'' She said claims for out-of-warranty repairs were reviewed on a case-by-case basis ''with the goal of satisfying the customer.''

HEADLINE: Booking a Hotel in Asia? How to Plan

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
When planning a trip to Japan and Hong Kong with my boyfriend last winter -- my first trip to Asia -- I made what you might call rookie mistakes.
I waited until the last minute -- three weeks before our trip -- to book our hotels. I didn't realize our visit to Kyoto coincided with peak cherry blossom viewing and a school holiday (I found what appeared to be the only available room in the city). And in Tokyo, I overlooked room dimensions as I was making reservations (in one hotel, the bed took up nearly all the floor space).
On the plus side, I chose our locations wisely, in prime neighborhoods close to transit hubs. And we spent less than I expected: an average of $200 a night.
Still, booking accommodations in Asia can be more complicated than choosing a hotel in Europe or the United States, because of language barriers and the unfamiliarity of many travelers with the hotels that pop up in search engines. So here's some advice based on what I learned, and tips from savvy expats who help Westerners plan trips to Asia. 
Know What's Out There
Asia has a range of hotels -- from small family-run guesthouses to local and global chains. While there are some notable boutique options -- including the design-centric Claska Hotel in Tokyo and the modernistic Mira in Hong Kong -- chains tend to dominate the market, a situation that many travelers will welcome. For instance, if you want to use or earn reward points from companies like Marriott or Starwood, you might prefer sticking with your member brand; it may also be easier to ask questions about reservations by calling a United States-based phone number.
Cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong are known for luxury hotels, among them the Peninsula, Ritz-Carlton, Mandarin Oriental and Shangri-La. But more affordable brands have also expanded into Asia, particularly China, which experienced a hotel boom before the 2008 Olympics that has not let up.
The roundup of worldwide hotel openings compiled by HotelChatter.com, which tracks trends, lists roughly 50 hotels due to open in China this year. Mark Johnson, HotelChatter's founder, noted that many of them are midpriced brands owned by Sheraton, Starwood, Marriott, InterContinental and Hilton. For instance, Hotel Indigo, owned by the InterContinental Hotels Group, opened its first Asia property in Shanghai in 2010, with rates around $250 a night, and plans another opening in Hong Kong in April.
Know Where to Book
Sites like HotelChatter and TabletHotels.com are useful for researching higher-end hotels, but for a wider view, Agoda.com is one of the leading sites for Asia. I used Agoda, which is owned by Priceline, to book several of our hotels, including the Bishop Lei in Hong Kong and Hotel Sunroute Plaza in Tokyo -- chosen mostly for their proximity to friends we were visiting. Another good option is Booking.com.
Both sites pinpoint each hotel on a city map, making it easy to judge how close you are to popular sites and transportation hubs, which is important if you plan to take a train from the airport to the city. Mr. Johnson said he once stayed at the W in Hong Kong and loved being able to take a train directly from the airport to the hotel, whereas in Shanghai he ended up in a newer neighborhood that involved taking transportation to get to places.
''You really have to do your research and figure out where it is you want to be,'' he advised.
There are also sites that focus on alternative accommodations, like JapaneseGuestHouses.com, a guide to Japan's ryokan, traditional inns where guests sleep on futons on tatami-mat floors. Ryokan range from luxury properties to budget options that feel more like hostels. We stayed at two: Ryokan Rikiya, a bare-bones place in the prime temple-filled Higashiyama neighborhood of Kyoto, and Takaragawa Onsen Osenkaku, a riverside hot springs ryokan two hours from Tokyo -- a great overnight escape that cost $214 total, including meals.
Chris Rowthorn, lead author of the Lonely Planet Japan guidebook, said staying in a ryokan is ''a must-do experience in Japan,'' and I agree: the ritual of the baths and a traditional kaiseki dinner wearing yukata robes was a highlight of our trip. Mr. Rowthorn's blog, InsideKyoto.com, also recommends vacation rental homes in Kyoto -- a trend that is slowly catching on in Japan.
Given the challenges of traveling in some parts of Asia, you may want to use a travel agent to book your trip, including outings, since even taking a taxi can be an adventure.
''In Chinese cities, most taxi drivers don't speak English,'' said David Allardice, owner of Eastern Journeys, a travel agency in Hong Kong that specializes in China. He also recommends planning much further ahead than I did.
''The spring and fall, when the weather is best, is always going to be peak season,'' he said. ''If there's something you specifically want, it's worth booking four months out.''
Avoid Surprises on Arrival
I was surprised that some hotels listed on Agoda.com present room choices based on size, in square meters -- in Tokyo, an ''economy double'' (15.8 square meters, about 170 square feet) we booked turned out to be claustrophobic. For most hotels, including chains, a ''double'' room generally means one double bed (queen-size beds are less common). Make sure you choose a nonsmoking room if that's important, but you may find smokers in the lobby or down the hall.
Hotels with small rooms designed for business travelers often offer the best deals. In Tokyo, we stayed at what's known as a ''business hotel,'' which Mr. Rowthorn described as compact and clean but ''not necessarily a place you'd look forward to going back to at the end of the day and lounging.'' That description is spot on, but you can't beat the price: we paid about $150 a night, including tax and free Wi-Fi, and would have paid less if we had booked further in advance. Toyoko Inn (toyoko-inn.com) and Tokyu Hotels (tokyuhotelsjapan.com) are popular business hotel chains, with locations all over Japan.
Our hotels all offered free Wi-Fi, which worked well, but my aunt spent three weeks in China last fall and had difficulty getting reliable Internet, especially with enough bandwidth to make phone calls using Skype.
She also found that many of the hotels did not have staff members on duty who spoke English, resulting in some practical frustrations and a funny incident when she tried to teach a cook at the breakfast buffet how to fry an egg ''over easy.'' (Apparently, her gesture looked more like flipping pizza dough, with messy results.)
At our hotels there wasn't always someone on duty who spoke English, so do not count on having an English-speaking staff member 24/7, especially if you are staying at a less pricey hotel.
''As you go down the price scale, language really is one of the major issues,'' Mr. Allardice said.
According to Smith Travel Research, rates for the higher-end hotels Westerners typically stay at averaged around $285 a night in Tokyo and Hong Kong last year, and about $170 a night in Shanghai and Beijing. That matches what Mr. Allardice estimates his clients spend to enter the five-star spectrum. If you can afford $500 a night, he said, ''You're going to be enveloped in a world of luxury.''
I'm saving up for that experience next time.

HEADLINE: More Country, Less Congestion

BYLINE: By AILEEN JACOBSON

 BODY:
Roseanne O'Farrell can watch hawks through her windows. ''A red-tailed hawk just flew into a tree in my backyard,'' she said. ''He's very still, and then he will swoop down. We have a pair that nest in the hollow behind us. It's so great.''
When Ms. O'Farrell and her family moved into the Village of Oyster Bay Cove 10 years ago, they weren't expecting hawks. Or rabbits, foxes, deer and even the occasional wild turkey. All they sought, she said, was ''a little more nature, a little less congestion'' than they had in the Bethpage home on a main road that her husband, Peter, bought before they married. ''When we had a son, it was time to start looking.''
In 2003 they paid $1.6 million for a six-bedroom colonial with five full and two half baths on almost three acres, which gave them enough flat land for a pool and badminton courts. For her son, Liam, on his first birthday, they brought in ponies for the party. 
''My husband built a tree house for his birthday two years ago, when he was turning 8,'' she said. Along with their daughter, Lily, 5, they ride bicycles; their dog, a Weimaraner, keeps pace.
They wanted to be near beaches, of which there are several in the area. Ms. O'Farrell also likes the fact that her home lies between the hamlet of Oyster Bay and the larger commercial area of Huntington.
Although the purchase price was considered a steal at the time, the house was recently assessed at $1.45 million, which she sees as a reflection of the economy. She was not concerned about public schools, opting for private school, as many of her neighbors do. The children attend the East Woods School, minutes away.
Mr. O'Farrell can drive to the Bronx construction business he owns with his siblings in as little as 25 minutes, she said. The commute is faster than the one he had from Bethpage, because nearby Route 25A offers ''a straight line'' to work. Every October after the hamlet's Oyster Festival, she said, she invites some 60 friends in for a chowder festival. This summer she plans to host a large family reunion.
The features that drew the O'Farrell family attract many prospective buyers, said Debra Russell, an agent in the Cold Spring Harbor office of Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty. ''You're so close to the water, but you're also close to New York City, and you have a town there -- the hamlet -- but you still have a great deal of privacy.''
There are buyers from New York City seeking a country life and Long Island residents looking to step up, she said. Some ''will start using it as a weekend house and gradually make the move to full time.''
Rosemary Bourne, the mayor, made the transition to full-time resident about 10 years ago, she said, after retiring from her Manhattan job as a pension fund manager. ''This house had been my mother's,'' she said. ''She bought it in 1967. My whole family lived here at one time.''
An older brother still lives in the Cove, as the village is often called. She lives with her three Norfolk Terriers on a property abutting a bird sanctuary named after Theodore Roosevelt, who lived next door in Cove Neck. ''It's a wonderful place if you're an outdoorsy type of person,'' she said. ''Those of us who live here think it's like dying and going to heaven.''
What You'll Find
Irregularly shaped and covering 4.3 square miles, the village stretches from the cove off Oyster Bay Harbor after which it is named south to Syosset. About 30 miles from Manhattan, it has no commercial area. To its west is the historic hamlet of Oyster Bay and to the east the quiet village of Laurel Hollow. Also to the north is the village of Cove Neck, where Sagamore Hill, Theodore Roosevelt's home from 1885 until his death in 1919, is now a national historic site. Oyster Bay Cove has its own Roosevelt-related spots. The 12-acre Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary and Audubon Center was established 90 years ago. Next to it is Youngs Cemetery, where the 26th president and his second wife, Edith Kermit Roosevelt, are buried.
The village has retained a country feel, with large expanses of trees and shrubbery only occasionally interrupted by houses, which range from historic colonials to modern mansions. Zoning laws require a minimum of two acres, with a few exceptions. Many properties border the 197-acre Tiffany Creek Preserve, made up of three former estates bought by Nassau County in 1992.
Census data from 2010 put the population just shy of 2,200, of whom 88.8 percent are white, 8.5 percent of Asian heritage and 1.6 percent African-American. The average annual household income for 2007 through 2011 was $399,065.
What You'll Pay
The 41 properties recently listed on mlsli.com ranged from a four-bedroom ranch on 2.15 acres for $675,000, to a seven-bedroom colonial on 4.01 acres for $5.495 million. In recent years, the average sale price has been dropping while more properties have been selling, said Ms. Russell of Daniel Gale Sotheby's. In 2011, 18 houses sold, at an average of $1.43 million; last year 23 sold, at an average of $1.23 million. Ms. Russell said six were now in contract. The average time on he market was 189 days in 2011, 199 in 2012.
What to Do
Mary Beth Donohue, who has lived in a historic 1830s Greek Revival house on five acres for the last 20 years with her husband and two sons, says her family likes to use their kayaks, which they launch from the village beach at the end of Landing Road. They also visit shops and restaurants in Oyster Bay, including favorites like Wild Honey, Jack Halyards and Canterbury Ales. She walks her Havanese dog in her neighborhood or takes him to Sagamore Hill, where they can follow a trail to a beach on Cold Spring Harbor.
Boat owners often use the Oyster Bay Marine Center or the Sagamore Yacht Club. The nonprofit WaterFront Center, in the same area, provides sailing and marine science lessons.
The Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Park and Beach, a Town of Oyster Bay facility in the hamlet, is the busiest beach in the area, said Joseph Mimmo, an associate broker with Laffey Fine Homes. ''It's popular for families. They have softball, lacrosse and soccer fields,'' he said.
The Commute
Driving to Manhattan takes about 40 minutes without traffic. Many commuters prefer the Long Island Rail Road Syosset station over the Oyster Bay one, which is on a slower line. The ride from Syosset takes as little as 47 minutes, the one to or from Oyster Bay a minimum hour and 14 minutes. Both have the same fares, a monthly ticket at $276 and a one-way peak at $12.50. Ms. O'Farrell notes that the Oyster Bay ride has its charms: ''It feels like you're in the English countryside.''
The Schools
Three districts draw students from Oyster Bay Cove, depending on home location. The Oyster Bay-East Norwich Central School District has 1,668 students, about 10 percent of them from Oyster Bay Cove. SAT averages last year were 535 in reading, 552 in math and 536 in writing, versus 483, 500 and 475 statewide. The Syosset Central School District has 6,502 students, of whom 87 have Oyster Bay or Oyster Bay Cove addresses. SAT averages there were 556, 604 and 572.
The Cold Spring Harbor Central School District has only a handful of Oyster Bay Cove students among its total 1,944 enrollment. Its 2012 SAT averages were 597, 614 and 599. Some residents send their children to private schools including the East Woods School, on 46 acres within the village. It runs through Grade 8.
The History
Roosevelts are prominent in the area's history. Elizabeth Roosevelt, a granddaughter of W. Emlen Roosevelt (who donated the land for the bird sanctuary in honor of his cousin Theodore), said that most had died or moved away. ''I'm the last one left,'' she said.
The village gained notoriety in 1955, when Ann Woodward shot and killed her millionaire husband, William Woodward Jr., at their home on Berry Hill Road, saying she had mistaken him for a prowler. A grand jury exonerated her, but she continued to be the object of suspicion. She committed suicide in 1975.

HEADLINE: Saving on Title Insurance

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
Borrowers don't often pay much attention to the title insurance required by their mortgage lender -- until they see the sizable charge for it on their list of closing costs.
Ostensibly, that premium (and sometimes assorted fees) reflects the cost of guaranteeing the borrower clear ownership of a property. Title agents search public records for tax liens and any other outstanding claims that need to be resolved, and then insure the borrower and the lender against claims that might have gone undetected.
Title insurance rates vary considerably by state. In New York, insurers belong to a rating bureau that submits a rate schedule for state approval. Depending on the value of the property, costs can easily run into the thousands. On a $500,000 home with a $400,000 mortgage, for example, the premium in the New York City area would be $2,666, according to Rafael Castellanos, the managing partner of Expert Title Insurance Agency in Manhattan. ''It's a bargain in the end given the protection title insurance provides,'' he said. 
Yet for years, a debate has raged as to whether premiums are too high, competition too constrained, and the insurers too closely intertwined with the mortgage and real estate professionals who send business their way. Some states have looked into the arrangements between title insurers and referral sources, including New York. In 2006, two title insurers that account for half the New York market -- the Fidelity National Title Group and First American -- agreed to 15 percent rate reductions to settle state allegations of illegal referral payments and rebates.
Another investigation may be afoot. Mr. Castellanos and two other industry executives said the state Department of Financial Services sent subpoenas to a number of title companies. A department spokesman would not comment on the claim.
Borrowers typically rely on their mortgage broker or real estate agent to select a title agent for them, but Mr. Castellanos says they are better off making the selection themselves. He advises borrowers to ask a real estate lawyer to recommend an independent title company, and to avoid title agencies that have a business affiliation with the real estate agency or lender recommending them.
One insurer is offering a more transparent option. Entitle Direct in Stamford, Conn., offers premium rates up to 35 percent below the going rates in the 40 states in which it operates. (These rates are not available in New Jersey.) According to the company's founder, Timothy M. Dwyer, Entitle is able to offer reduced rates by marketing directly to consumers and eliminating the use of title agents, who typically receive a hefty split of the insurance premium for their services. ''The national average commission is 80 percent of the premium,'' he said. ''We do not have that expense. We contract out to a third-party partner that provides us with the title search product.''
Founded in 2009, the company has grown slowly. Entitle's sales account for only 0.1 percent of the total national premium, said Birny Birnbaum, the executive director of the Center for Economic Justice, a consumer advocacy group. He attributed the slow growth to ''the limited price competition in title insurance markets and the strength of the institutional arrangements between title insurers and those able to steer title business -- lenders, developers, Realtors, builders.''
In Connecticut, where only lawyers can act as title insurance agents, ''very few attorneys will close with Entitle, or sell very hard against it, because they're not making the premium,'' said Scott Penner, a lawyer in Milford. ''Or they will increase their attorney fee, and that offsets the savings.''

HEADLINE: A Chase Car to Lure Private Eyes Out of Retirement

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
When I think of people who'd fall hard for the Chrysler 300 SRT8, names come to mind: Kojak, Mannix, Rockford, Starsky and Hutch.
Trivia lovers will note that the private detective Jim Rockford was a Firebird man, and that Starsky and Hutch favored a white-striped Ford Torino. And it's the 300's sister car, the Dodge Charger, that's been recruited for actual police work.
But on the gritty streets of Brooklyn and New Jersey, the broad-shouldered Chrysler always seemed a step away -- specifically, a step on the gas pedal -- from a tire-burning cop-show chase. Or, alternately, a video game appealing to characters on either side of the law. 
And there is nothing virtual about Chrysler's new Performance Pages, which engages drivers in real-life competition. Displayed on the 8.4-inch UConnect infotainment screen in the center of the dash, this computer animates and records this Chrysler's feats of acceleration, braking and handling. My best score was a fleet 4.8-second run from 0 to 60 miles per hour, accomplished without the aid of the electronic launch control, which is standard on this 2013 model, though I didn't engage it.
The 300's name can be traced to the C-300 of 1955, the first American sedan whose V-8 engine produced 300 horsepower. The father of that car was Virgil Exner, the industrial designer and lover of tailfins. But the modern 300 can claim two daddies: the car is perhaps the most successful melding to emerge from the shortlived union of Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz, and it is still genetically related to the Mercedes E-Class. The 300's combination of American street style and German breeding made it a cultural and showroom hit.
Now, a reworked line of 300s help to carry the torch for the post-bankruptcy Chrysler controlled by Fiat. The 300 is one of several models whose cabins suggest that Chrysler -- after decades of cheap-plastic eyesores -- is finally turning the corner with competitive, attractive interiors. A touch of Italy never hurts: the car I tested was outfitted with $2,500 worth of Poltrona Frau leather on its upper doors, instrument panel and center console.
Even without the fancy Italian hides, the handsome cabin breathes new life into a big sedan that feels more rewarding than pedestrian front-drive cars like the Toyota Avalon and Ford Taurus. It helps that the 300, like the Mercedes, was designed as a rear-drive car despite an all-wheel-drive option (though not for the SRT8).
For most 300 buyers, the combination of a new 8-speed automatic and a Pentastar V-6, with 292 horses and a highway economy rating of 31 m.p.g., is the smart app. A 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 raises the horsepower to 363 -- and surely that's enough, right?
But no, say the muscle heads at Chrysler. The engineers of the SRT division, which produces the Viper sports car and high-performance versions of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger -- have created a small batch of SRT8s. The tuner edition of the 300 adds a raging bull of a Hemi, with 6.4 liters, 470 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque, coupled to a 5-speed automatic.
The SRT's interior features real carbon-fiber trim and a heated, chrome-spoke, flat-bottom steering wheel with paddle shifters. For $1,995 you can add a 900-watt 19-speaker Harman Kardon audio system. Also available is a two-tone interior with red leather seats, faux-suede inserts and heated cushions for the front and rear.
The Performance Pages readouts add a range of analog-style engine and transmission gauges. One vivid screen animates real-time horsepower and torque output. Another highlights the g-forces affecting the car -- in acceleration, braking and cornering. I kept finding excuses to goose the Chrysler, just to watch the horsepower gauge explode from roughly three horsepower -- the Hemi's output at idle -- to 400 and beyond. Just remember to keep one eye on the blurry road ahead; the car runs a quarter-mile in roughly 12.7 seconds. Top speed is said to be 175 m.p.h.
The SRT's reworked body looks ready for undercover duty. The car is half an inch lower than a standard 300, with dual four-inch exhaust outlets and 20-inch wheels. The SRT's approach to performance is as subtle as a blackjack to the skull.
But while the Hemi provides the blunt force and basso soundtrack of a big-block Motown V-8 -- with equally oversized, track-worthy Brembo brakes -- the Chrysler tempers that force to become a surprisingly comfortable, compliant daily driver. The Hemi can shut down 4 cylinders to save fuel, though it remains thirsty, with an E.P.A. mileage rating of 14/23 m.p.g., drawing a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.
The adaptive suspension now features three selectable modes. The stiffest Track setting commands the transmission to hold gears at high revs while the driver manually controls the shift paddles or console stick. Yet that 5-speed transmission remains the weak link, especially in light of the 8 speeds in other verisons of the 300.
The SRT8's starting price of $49,990 can seem iffy at first, and more so after options. (My test car checked in at $57,750.) The closest comparison for the Chrysler may be Cadillac's CTS-V, a 556-horsepower beast available as a sedan, coupe or wagon. But even that formidable Caddy costs about $15,000 more than the 300.
Still, smaller German supersedans like the Mercedes E63 AMG and BMW M5 cost $100,000 and more.
With its accurate but relatively light steering, the Chrysler isn't as precise, agile or luxurious as the Mercedes or BMW. But on the mean streets, it gets the job done in remarkably similar fashion. The Chrysler delivers 90 percent of the German cars' performance for barely half their price. And I'll swear this on a stack of Gutenbergs: the Chrysler is more fun and more visceral than BMW's flawed new M5, though not as sensational as the Mercedes.
And if valet attendants don't respond as quickly to the Chrysler, you can always try flashing a badge.

HEADLINE: Does Affirmative Action Do What It Should?

BYLINE: By DAN SLATER. 
A lawyer and the author of ''Love in the Time of Algorithms: What Technology Does to Meeting and Mating.''

 BODY:
WHAT'S more important to how your life turns out: the prestige of the school you attend or how much you learn while you're there? Does the answer to this question change if you are the recipient of affirmative action?
From school admissions to hiring, affirmative action policies attempt to compensate for this country's brutal history of racial discrimination by giving some minority applicants a leg up. This spring the Supreme Court will decide the latest affirmative action case, weighing in on the issue for the first time in 10 years.
The last time around, in 2003, the court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action plan. A divided court ruled, 5 to 4, that ''student body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions.'' Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said, ''We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.'' 
In the intervening period, scholars have been looking more closely at how affirmative action works in practice. Based on how they interpret the data that have been collected, some of these scholars have come to believe that affirmative action doesn't always help the students it's supposed to. Why? Because some minority students who get into a top school with the help of affirmative action might actually be better served by attending a less elite institution to which they could gain admission with less of a boost or no boost at all.
The idea that affirmative action might harm its intended beneficiaries was suggested as early as the 1960s, when affirmative action, a phrase introduced by the Kennedy administration, began to take hold as government and corporate policy. One long-simmering objection to affirmative action was articulated publicly by Clarence Thomas years before he joined the Supreme Court in 1991. Mr. Thomas, who has opposed affirmative action even while conceding that he benefited from it, told a reporter for The New York Times in 1982 that affirmative action placed students in programs above their abilities. Mr. Thomas, who was then the 34-year-old chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, didn't deny the crisis in minority employment. But he blamed a failed education system rather than discrimination in admissions. ''I watched the operation of such affirmative action policies when I was in college,'' he said, ''and I watched the destruction of many kids as a result.''
Scholars began referring to this theory as ''mismatch.'' It's the idea that affirmative action can harm those it's supposed to help by placing them at schools in which they fall below the median level of ability and therefore have a tough time. As a consequence, the argument goes, these students suffer learningwise and, later, careerwise. To be clear, mismatch theory does not allege that minority students should not attend elite universities. Far from it. But it does say that students -- minority or otherwise -- do not automatically benefit from attending a school that they enter with academic qualifications well below the median level of their classmates.
The mismatch theory, if true, would affect many kids. According to a 2009 book, ''No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal: Race and Class in Elite College Admission and Campus Life,'' by Thomas J. Espenshade and Alexandria Walton Radford, a black student with an otherwise similar application to a white student receives the equivalent of a 310-point bump in SAT scores.
Mismatch theory attracted little attention until 2005, when a law professor at U.C.L.A., Richard H. Sander, published a provocative article in the Stanford Law Review, which focused on how affirmative action affected law students. Mr. Sander claimed that ''a student who gains special admission to a more elite school on partly nonacademic grounds is likely to struggle more'' and contended that ''if the struggling leads to lower grades and less learning, then a variety of bad outcomes may result: higher attrition rates, lower pass rates on the bar, problems in the job market. The question is how large these effects are, and whether their consequences outweigh the benefits of greater prestige.''
In other words, do the benefits of the connections made at, say, U.C.L.A. School of Law, and the weight U.C.L.A. carries in the job market, outweigh the cost of struggling academically there? Based on his reading of the data, Mr. Sander concluded that they did not.
Law school, as it turns out, is a somewhat natural, though imperfect, environment for studying mismatch effects. Law students have their knowledge tested in a fairly uniform way, first on the LSAT and then again, after graduation, on a state licensing exam, the bar.
MUCH of the squabble over mismatch centers on differing interpretations of the Bar Passage Study. The B.P.S. was commissioned by the Law School Admission Council in 1989 to determine whether blacks and Hispanics had disproportionately poor bar-passage rates. In 1991, more than 27,000 incoming law students -- about 2,000 of them black -- completed questionnaires for the B.P.S. and gave permission to track their performance in law school and later on the bar.
Among other things, the questionnaire asked students (a) whether they got into their first-choice law school, (b) if so, whether they enrolled at their first choice, and (c) if not, why not.
Data showed that 689 of the approximately 2,000 black applicants got into their first-choice law school. About three-quarters of those 689 matriculated at their first choice. The remaining quarter opted instead for their second-choice school, often for financial or geographic reasons. So, of the 689 black applicants who got into their first choice, 512 went, and the rest, 177, attended their second choice, presumably a less prestigious institution.
This data presented a plausible opportunity to gauge mismatch. The fact that 689 black students got into their first-choice law school meant that all 689 were similar in at least that one regard (though possibly dissimilar in many other ways). If mismatch theory held any water, then the 177 students who voluntarily opted for their second-choice school -- and were therefore theoretically better ''matched'' -- could be expected, on average, to have better outcomes on the bar exam than their peers who chose the more elite school. Mr. Sander's analysis of the B.P.S. data found that 21 percent of the black students who went to their second-choice schools failed the bar on their first attempt, compared with 34 percent of those who went to their first choice.
The experiment is far from ideal. Mismatch opponents argue that there are many unobservable differences between second-choice and first-choice students and that those differences, because they're unknown, cannot be accounted for in a formula. In the case of the B.P.S. data, maybe the second-choice students tended to have undergraduate majors that made them particularly well suited to flourish in the classroom and on the bar, regardless of which law school they attended. ''All this work on mismatch assumes you know enough to write an algebraic expression that captures what's really going on,'' says Richard A. Berk, a professor of criminology and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Here, there's so much we don't know. Besides, the LSAT is a very imperfect measure of performance in law school and thereafter, as is the bar exam.''
Daniel E. Ho, a law professor at Stanford, also disputes the mismatch hypothesis. In a response to Mr. Sander's 2005 law review article, Mr. Ho wrote in the Yale Law Journal that ''black law students who are similarly qualified when applying to law school perform equally well on the bar irrespective of what tier school they attend.''
Political changes in the '90s created another opportunity to study mismatch. In 1996, California voters passed Prop 209, a ban on affirmative action. Critics of Prop 209 expected black and Hispanic enrollment at top University of California schools, like U.C.L.A. and Berkeley, to plummet -- and it did, for a while. But these schools eventually saw increases in minority enrollment, particularly among Hispanics, as sophisticated new outreach programs kicked in. Enrollment has not, however, gotten back to pre-Prop 209 levels.
Recently, economists from Duke studied the effects of Prop 209, comparing undergraduate graduation rates for blacks, Hispanics and American Indians before and after the ban. In a paper being considered for publication by The Quarterly Journal of Economics, the Duke economists conclude that mismatch effects are strongest for students in so-called STEM majors -- science, technology, engineering and math. These subjects proceed in a more regimented way than the humanities, with each topic and class building on what came before. If you don't properly learn one concept, it's easier to get knocked off track.
The Duke economists say that lower-ranked schools in the University of California system are better at graduating minority students in STEM majors. For example, they conclude that had the bottom third of minority students at Berkeley who hoped to graduate with a STEM major gone to Santa Cruz instead, they would have been almost twice as likely to earn such a degree.
''Prior to California's ban on affirmative action,'' Peter Arcidiacono, one of the study's authors, told me, ''what Berkeley did well was switch relatively ill-prepared minority students out of the sciences and into majors where credentials are relatively less important.''
SOON the Supreme Court will decide Fisher v. University of Texas. The case is complex, but essentially boils down to a young woman's claim that U.T. violated the Constitution's equal protection clause by denying her admission because she is white. The justices, save perhaps Clarence Thomas, are unlikely to address mismatch in their opinions. But the court could force schools to be more transparent about the racial preferences they use in admissions, and even to track the consequences for their students. For now, social scientists debate what can be gleaned from flawed data sets. They continue to argue over whether mismatch even exists and the extent of the harm it causes if it does. This raises another question: Do some of the more concrete if intangible benefits of affirmative action, like prestige and the superior connections one makes attending a fancier school, outweigh the potential cost? If affirmative-action admits are less likely to pass the bar after going to a certain type of school, or less likely to follow through with their field of choice, then the cost is potentially considerable. But are we really going to tell a kid embarking on adult life that he's better off attending a less prestigious school?
''The real question is what we want affirmative action to achieve,'' says Richard Brooks, a law professor at Yale. ''Are we trying to maximize diversity? Engagement in the classroom? Whatever it is, I don't think the purpose of affirmative action is for everyone to have average grades.'' Mr. Brooks believes that mismatch exists. But he rejects the idea that it's as insidious as others claim and says that some mismatch might even be a good thing. Striving alongside people more capable than we are is a key ingredient for growth of all kinds.
In the Fisher case, Messrs. Brooks, Berk and Ho signed a friend-of-the-court brief disputing a brief on mismatch that was co-written by Mr. Sander and the legal journalist Stuart Taylor Jr. Messrs. Sander and Taylor also wrote a book together that was published last fall, ''Mismatch: How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It's Intended to Help, and Why Universities Won't Admit it.''
''Mismatch angers affirmative-action supporters because it quantifies a downside without weighing it against potential upsides,'' says Theodore Eisenberg, a law professor at Cornell, ''such as the benefit of a diverse classroom, and the reality that some people who do attend better schools because of affirmative action are more successful in life as a result and help other minorities thrive.'' Mr. Eisenberg is on the board of The Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, which in June is publishing a paper by E. Douglass Williams, an economist at Sewanee: The University of the South, that appears to corroborate Mr. Sander's ''first-choice/second-choice'' analysis of the B.P.S. data.
In essence, affirmative action is about how to fairly distribute opportunity after our long history of racial discrimination. Whether it ''works'' is as much an issue for school administrators as for policy makers. That is, before we tell a student to choose School B over School A, it's worth asking what schools can do to improve the experiences of students, particularly those pursuing STEM majors, who arrive less well prepared.
The upside of affirmative action might be harder to quantify. But part of the problem with the current affirmative action regime is how its supporters define the goal, what the Supreme Court calls the ''compelling state interest'': classroom diversity. Meanwhile, little regard is given to the actual forms of adversity that disadvantaged students of all races must overcome. If affirmative action continues -- either until Justice O'Connor's 2028 horizon or beyond -- then the results from California and the Bar Passage Study suggest it's worth a closer, numbers-based look at the consequences, for everyone.

HEADLINE: In Obesity Fight, Poverty Is Patient Zero

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Under the category ''Summer Rentals That Have Gone Terribly Wrong,'' there are perhaps few parallels to the experience of Charles Henry Warren, a Manhattan banker who, in 1906, took a house in Oyster Bay on Long Island's North Shore. By the end of the season, Mr. Warren's young daughter had developed typhoid. She was soon followed in illness by Mr. Warren's wife, a second daughter, two maids and a gardener. At the time, typhoid, a bacterial illness spread through contaminated food and water, was largely a disease of the urban poor. The property's owner, George Thompson, concerned that the house, on which he relied for rental income, would become associated with tenement filth in the minds of wealthy New Yorkers, invited a sanitary engineer to determine the source of the outbreak. 
What the medical investigator, George Soper, discovered was that the Warrens' cook, Mary Mallon, an Irish immigrant, had left an imprint of malady in other quarters of upper-class Manhattan and its summer enclaves. Typhoid, he wrote, had erupted in every household in which Mallon had worked over the previous decade. An asymptomatic carrier of the disease, Ms. Mallon would be known to history as Typhoid Mary and spend most of the remainder of her life quarantined on North Brother Island in the East River, having failed to abide by a promise to cease working in the city's kitchens.
The events supply the narrative of ''Fever,'' a new novel by Mary Beth Keane, which arrives at a time when we are once again debating the parameters of public health policy's encroachments on our behaviors. Last week, a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan used the words ''arbitrary and capricious'' in striking down the Bloomberg administration's efforts to limit the size of sugary drinks (which pertained to certain sweetened beverages but not others, and some retail environments but not all). The phrase, though, could have been similarly applied a century ago to the city's treatment of Ms. Mallon, given that officials were not in the habit of isolating other healthy carriers whom they had identified as ignoring ordinances against the spread of the disease.
Sequestering Ms. Mallon was not the only possible solution to her defiance. As the medical historian Judith Walzer Leavitt has argued, the city might have helped provide her with the kind of long-term employment that would have given her a salary commensurate with what she was earning preparing meals for the well-off. But it didn't. Health officials were presumably most unnerved by the fact that Ms. Mallon was transporting an illness of the steerage classes uptown.
Then as now, economic disparity was, in many cases, driving disparate demographic patterns of disease. (Just to be clear, typhoid, though communicable, was not a greater threat to public health than obesity is today. In the early 20th century, there were about 3,000 to 4,000 new cases a year in New York, approximately 10 percent of them resulting in fatalities. Last fall, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said 6,000 New Yorkers a year died from obesity.) Obesity and its related illnesses, as we know, disproportionately affect low-income communities. In Brooklyn, for instance, the rate of heart-attack hospitalizations among adults 35 and older in East New York is nearly twice the rate in wealthier Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope.
The larger issue, though -- larger than the matter of how much more time we should spend trying to ensure that no child ever grows up with a memory of a 32-ounce Sprite -- is the recognition of poverty itself as a public health problem. The poor are more likely to live with asthma, depression, gun violence and pests (and the chemical pesticides used to eliminate them). The articulated goal should not simply be to create a population of poor people who are thin, but to create a population of poor people who are less poor. In 2010, the poverty rate in the city remained what it was 10 years earlier, 21 percent.
Late-19th- and early-20th-century public health initiatives, like urging immigrant mothers to breast-feed, might reek of nanny-state paternalism, but they occurred during a high moment of social, labor, political and scientific reform, the rise of the settlement movement, the writings of Jacob Riis. Great and systematic attention was paid to the lives and environments of those struggling in the lowest orders.
It is hard not to wonder whether Mr. Bloomberg's soda limit initiative might have garnered more enthusiasm (though obviously not from the soft-drink industry, whose ad campaigns against it imagine democracy imperiled at the threat of less Pepsi) if it had been delivered within the context of a more consistent and compassionate message about the city's commitment to the underserved. If it had come from a mayor who, when responding to news of the city's rising homelessness rate, did not quickly blame the fact that city shelters must accommodate all comers, as he did recently, saying, ''You can arrive in your private jet at Kennedy Airport, take a private limousine and go straight to the shelter system and walk in the door and we've got to give you shelter.''
Pellegrino government would hardly seem to be enough.

HEADLINE: Building a Movie Language in Layers

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
''I won't always give satisfying answers,'' the filmmaker Shane Carruth said, by way of warning, in an interview in early January. The premiere of his long-awaited second feature, ''Upstream Color,'' at the Sundance Film Festival was weeks away at the time. He was finishing the sound mix and working out the details of a self-distribution plan. But the greatest source of anxiety was the prospect of having to talk about his movie.
''I hate even the idea of a synopsis,'' Mr. Carruth said. ''When stories are really working, when you're providing subtextual exploration and things that are deeply layered, you're obligated to not say things out loud.'' 
Subtexts and layers abound in his new film, which combines elements of an abduction plot, a love story and a cosmic science experiment. ''Upstream Color'' trended heavily on Twitter when Sundance announced its lineup, and the anticipation has much to do with the cult status of Mr. Carruth's first feature, ''Primer,'' the Dramatic Grand Jury Prize winner at that festival in 2004.
Mr. Carruth, 40, a former engineer and self-taught filmmaker, made ''Primer,'' a deadpan time-travel fantasy, for a reported $7,000, taking on the roles of director, writer, producer, actor, cinematographer, editor and composer. A feat of DIY enterprise and polymathic ingenuity, the film lent itself to repeat viewings and endless theorizing about its laws of physics and metaphysics, which ensured a robust afterlife in home video and on message boards.
On the phone recently Mr. Carruth said that the response to ''Upstream Color,'' which screens at the New Directors/New Films series this month before opening on April 5, has been overwhelmingly positive. But what irks him is the suggestion that the film, like ''Primer,'' is a puzzle movie in need of solving. ''It's funny that some of the early reviews used words like opaque and obscure,'' he said. ''And then they list the plot, beat by beat, and pretty much nail it. You're sort of like, well, what was so opaque then?''
While the plot elements are not hard to glean, many of them boggle the mind. A young woman named Kris (Amy Seimetz) ingests a hypnotic drug that leaves a gap in her memory and a worm in her body, which is extracted in a surgical procedure that involves transferring the parasite to a pig. She becomes involved with Jeff (Mr. Carruth), who may have undergone a similar trauma. Odd as it is, their plight -- as the film suggests with repeated cutaways to orchid harvesters and pig pens, not to mention ample quotations from Thoreau's ''Walden'' -- exists within a larger cycle of nature.
More than any of these curious details, the most provocative aspect of ''Upstream Color'' is the way it unfolds, as a skein of associations and in a barrage of fragmentary images and clipped conversations. Increasingly prone to slippage and ellipsis the film builds to a wordless finale in which, as Mr. Carruth put it, ''everything deteriorates into the ether.''
''I believe that it's trying something new in terms of film language,'' said Mr. Carruth, who in conversation projects a quiet self-assurance.
Even more than ''Primer,'' which plunged characters and viewers into a seductive haze of confusion, ''Upstream Color'' is a movie about the limits of knowledge that doubles as an experiment in inference. ''It's about people building their own narratives when they don't have anything to hold on to,'' Mr. Carruth said. ''They're accumulating their identities out of whatever they find around them.''
An open-ended fable whose protagonists are buffeted by forces they neither control nor comprehend, ''Upstream Color'' has a pronounced metaphorical aspect. ''You could do the same story about any number of things where people are being affected by outside factors that they can't quite speak to,'' Mr. Carruth said. ''The end result is the same, whether you're talking about religious or cosmic or political beliefs, or being affected by a chemical or by a relationship.''
Mr. Carruth took on almost as many roles as on ''Primer'' and is also overseeing the marketing and distribution. He assumed near-total control again not just for economic reasons but also because of ''the hope that there would be something gained from these things all coming from the same mind,'' he said.
He cast his co-star, Ms. Seimetz, an actress and filmmaker, on the basis of her feature directing debut, ''Sun Don't Shine'' (set to open in May), convinced that she could tune in to his wavelength. ''She's a storyteller,'' Mr. Carruth said. ''I knew she would get it.''
Ms. Seimetz, who sees ''Upstream Color'' as ''a movie about deep emotional loss,'' said that she and Mr. Carruth ''clicked on a filmmaking level.'' She added, ''I think you can only make a film like this with a kindred spirit.''
Mr. Carruth's next project, ''The Modern Ocean,'' which he hopes to shoot this year, was conceived as a romance between an oceanographer and the daughter of a shipping magnate but has now ''morphed into this other massive thing that is impossibly tragic,'' he said. ''I'm really curious about how far it can be pushed.''
By ''it,'' he explained, he means a more exploratory approach to narrative, which he has found in movies as different as Paul Thomas Anderson's ''Punch-Drunk Love'' and Steven Soderbergh's ''Solaris.''
While others succumb to gimmickry and doomsaying, Mr. Carruth remains a believer in the untapped potential of cinema. ''Everybody's saying we've got to go 3-D or virtual reality or choose your own adventure,'' he said. ''But there are other ways forward. I don't think we're done with film by a long shot.''

HEADLINE: China Names New Team to Secure Its Place in Asia and Face U.S. Competition

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's new foreign policy team, announced at a news conference on Saturday, includes officials whose records suggest the government will concentrate on consolidating what it considers the country's rightful place at the center of Asia, even as the Obama administration says it will deploy more military power in the region.
The team includes a new chief diplomat who has often pushed a hard line against the United States and a new foreign minister whose focus has been on Japan, Taiwan and North Korea.
The lineup of officials, announced with a raft of cabinet ministers for the new government led by President Xi Jinping, lacks the power and influence of China's military. But the officials will be at the front line of managing Beijing's side of the escalating competition in Asia between China and the United States, and carrying out the policy decisions of Mr. Xi, who is already showing greater interest, and a tougher edge, in foreign affairs than his predecessor, Hu Jintao, did. 
The White House said last week that despite cuts in military spending, it would pursue its ''strategic pivot'' to Asia, a policy that is interpreted in China as containment of its economic and military gains.
The departing foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, will step up to state councilor, making him the nation's chief diplomat and the most senior official that American officials will deal with on a frequent basis, according to the announcement at the Great Hall of the People, where the National People's Congress is coming to a close.
As foreign minister, Mr. Yang often pushed a hard line on policy toward the United States. And on the eve of his new appointment, he suggested that Washington should play a lesser role in discussions among nations in the Asia-Pacific region.
''Asia-Pacific issues should be discussed and dealt with by the countries of the region themselves,'' he said at a news conference on March 9, a reference that was interpreted by Asian diplomats as meaning that the United States should stay out.
The new foreign minister is Wang Yi, a diplomat experienced in Asian affairs who was China's ambassador to Japan from 2004 to 2007. Mr. Wang, until recently in charge of the Taiwan portfolio, does not have much experience with the United States, but American officials know him from his role in leading six-party talks on North Korea during the administration of President George W. Bush.
The negotiations, led by China, were intended to end North Korea's nuclear program, and sometimes Mr. Wang showed his exasperation with the North, American officials said. The talks collapsed in 2008.
''Wang Yi is of the school that does not see China's future on the Korean Peninsula yoked to North Korea,'' said Victor D. Cha, a former director of Asian affairs for the National Security Council in the Bush administration, who participated in the talks.
The new ambassador to the United States will be Cui Tiankai, a genial diplomat, well versed in American affairs and a graduate of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.
Although Mr. Cui's appointment was not announced at the news conference on Saturday, he will be heading to Washington to take up his new position at the Chinese Embassy in the next several weeks, according to Chinese and American officials. He will arrive at a time of reduced expectations in Washington about the relationship with China.
The Obama administration is confronting China over cyberespionage in what many believe could become a watershed issue between the two countries. President Obama's national security adviser demanded in a speech last week that the Chinese government stop the widespread theft of data from American computer networks.
''Cui is very good to have at the center of U.S.-China relations,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''That's not because he's pro-U.S. but because he's a subtle and wide-ranging thinker. He represents China's interests and then understands what might be accomplished.''
On a trip to Washington this year to prepare for his post, Mr. Cui met with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and with Henry A. Kissinger, an indication of his familiarity with the senior ranks of American foreign policy making. At Hopkins in 1986, he studied under A. Doak Barnett, a leading scholar on China who urged President Richard M. Nixon to open relations with Beijing.
A former ambassador to Japan from 2007 to 2009, when China-Japan relations were relatively warm, Mr. Cui also knows how to play hardball. The current standoff between China and Japan over the sovereignty of islands in the East China Sea could be managed if Japan simply realized the new dynamic with China, he said.
''The fundamental problem is whether Japan can accept China's expanding strength,'' he told reporters on March 6 at a session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
In a signal of Beijing's increased emphasis on diplomacy in Asia, the Foreign Ministry last week appointed, for the first time, a special envoy on Asian affairs, Wang Yingfan. Mr. Wang, a former vice foreign minister, will concentrate on relations with Myanmar, a once-solid friend of China.
Beijing now faces hostility from protesters in Myanmar over large-scale infrastructure and mining projects there, and also faces intense competition from the United States as the Obama administration has embraced the politician Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and opened relations with the government.
China's enormous economic power in the region was highlighted last week when Mr. Yang, the departing foreign minister, said China's trade with Asia had reached $1.2 trillion last year, outstripping China's total trade with the United States and Europe. That puts China roughly neck and neck with the United States in trade with the region, according to Gregory Poling, a research associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Despite the new team -- actually, the rearrangement of familiar faces -- China's foreign policy still lacks senior direction at the top of the Communist Party, said Jin Canrong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Renmin University. He said that foreign affairs remained secondary to domestic affairs.
A plan to appoint a Politburo member, Wang Huning, a longtime adviser to former President Hu, as the top foreign policy official has apparently been dropped, Mr. Jin said. In that capacity, Mr. Wang would have coordinated policies from the different arms of the Chinese government -- the military, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the clandestine services -- much as the national security adviser does for the American president.
''There's no figure in the Politburo handling foreign policy,'' Mr. Jin said, ''and that's a big problem.''
It is possible that the new vice president, Li Yuanchao, will play a role in foreign policy, Mr. Jin said. But Mr. Li, who was most recently the head of the all-powerful party organization department, has little experience in foreign affairs, he said.

HEADLINE: Better Colleges Failing to Lure Talented Poor

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Most low-income students who have top test scores and grades do not even apply to the nation's best colleges, according to a new analysis of every high school student who took the SAT in a recent year.
The pattern contributes to widening economic inequality and low levels of mobility in this country, economists say, because college graduates earn so much more on average than nongraduates do. Low-income students who excel in high school often do not graduate from the less selective colleges they attend.
Only 34 percent of high-achieving high school seniors in the bottom fourth of income distribution attended any one of the country's 238 most selective colleges, according to the analysis, conducted by Caroline M. Hoxby of Stanford and Christopher Avery of Harvard, two longtime education researchers. Among top students in the highest income quartile, that figure was 78 percent.
The findings underscore that elite public and private colleges, despite a stated desire to recruit an economically diverse group of students, have largely failed to do so. 
Many top low-income students instead attend community colleges or four-year institutions closer to their homes, the study found. The students often are unaware of the amount of financial aid available or simply do not consider a top college because they have never met someone who attended one, according to the study's authors, other experts and high school guidance counselors.
''A lot of low-income and middle-income students have the inclination to stay local, at known colleges, which is understandable when you think about it,'' said George Moran, a guidance counselor at Central Magnet High School in Bridgeport, Conn. ''They didn't have any other examples, any models -- who's ever heard of Bowdoin College?''
Whatever the reasons, the choice frequently has major consequences. The colleges that most low-income students attend have fewer resources and lower graduation rates than selective colleges, and many students who attend a local college do not graduate. Those who do graduate can miss out on the career opportunities that top colleges offer.
The new study is beginning to receive attention among scholars and college officials because it is more comprehensive than other research on college choices. The study suggests that the problems, and the opportunities, for low-income students are larger than previously thought.
''It's pretty close to unimpeachable -- they're drawing on a national sample,'' said Tom Parker, the dean of admissions at Amherst College, which has aggressively recruited poor and middle-class students in recent years. That so many high-achieving, lower-income students exist ''is a very important realization,'' Mr. Parker said, and he suggested that colleges should become more creative in persuading them to apply.
Top low-income students in the nation's 15 largest metropolitan areas do often apply to selective colleges, according to the study, which was based on test scores, self-reported data, and census and other data for the high school class of 2008. But such students from smaller metropolitan areas -- like Bridgeport; Memphis; Sacramento; Toledo, Ohio; and Tulsa, Okla. -- and rural areas typically do not.
These students, Ms. Hoxby said, ''lack exposure to people who say there is a difference among colleges.''
Elite colleges may soon face more pressure to recruit poor and middle-class students, if the Supreme Court restricts race-based affirmative action. A ruling in the case, involving the University of Texas, is expected sometime before late June.
Colleges currently give little or no advantage in the admissions process to low-income students, compared with more affluent students of the same race, other research has found. A broad ruling against the University of Texas affirmative action program could cause colleges to take into account various socioeconomic measures, including income, neighborhood and family composition. Such a step would require an increase in these colleges' financial aid spending but would help them enroll significant numbers of minority students.
Among high-achieving, low-income students, 6 percent were black, 8 percent Latino, 15 percent Asian-American and 69 percent white, the study found.
''If there are changes to how we define diversity,'' said Greg W. Roberts, the dean of admission at the University of Virginia, referring to the court case, ''then I expect schools will really work hard at identifying low-income students.''
Ms. Hoxby and Mr. Avery, both economists, compared the current approach of colleges to looking under a streetlight for a lost key. The institutions continue to focus their recruiting efforts on a small subset of high schools in cities like Boston, New York and Los Angeles that have strong low-income students.
The researchers defined high-achieving students as those very likely to gain admission to a selective college, which translated into roughly the top 4 percent nationwide. Students needed to have at least an A-minus average and a score in the top 10 percent among students who took the SAT or the ACT.
Of these high achievers, 34 percent came from families in the top fourth of earners, 27 percent from the second fourth, 22 percent from the third fourth and 17 percent from the bottom fourth. (The researchers based the income cutoffs on the population of families with a high school senior living at home, with $41,472 being the dividing line for the bottom quartile and $120,776 for the top.)
Winona Leon, a sophomore at the University of Southern California who grew up in West Texas, said she was not surprised by the study's results. Ms. Leon was the valedictorian of her 17-member senior class in the ranch town of Fort Davis, where Advanced Placement classes and SAT preparation were rare.
''It was really on ourselves to create those resources,'' she said.
She first assumed that faraway colleges would be too expensive, given their high list prices and the cost of plane tickets home. But after receiving a mailing from QuestBridge, an outreach program for low-income students, she came to realize that a top college might offer her enough financial aid to make it less expensive than a state university in Texas.
On average, private colleges and top state universities are substantially more expensive than community colleges, even with financial aid. But some colleges, especially the most selective, offer enough aid to close or eliminate the gap for low-income students.
If they make it to top colleges, high-achieving, low-income students tend to thrive there, the paper found. Based on the most recent data, 89 percent of such students at selective colleges had graduated or were on pace to do so, compared with only 50 percent of top low-income students at nonselective colleges.
The study will be published in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.
The authors emphasized that their data did not prove that students not applying to top colleges would apply and excel if colleges recruited them more heavily. Ms. Hoxby and Sarah Turner, a University of Virginia professor, are conducting follow-up research in which they perform random trials to evaluate which recruiting techniques work and how the students subsequently do.
For colleges, the potential recruiting techniques include mailed brochures, phone calls, e-mail, social media and outreach from alumni. Another recent study, cited in the Hoxby-Avery paper, suggests that very selective colleges have at least one graduate in the ''vast majority of U.S. counties.''

HEADLINE: Days of Promise Fade for Ethanol

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON and MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
MACON, Mo. -- Five years ago, rural America was giddy for ethanol.
Backed by government subsidies and mandates, hundreds of ethanol plants rose among the golden fields of the Corn Belt, bringing jobs and business to small towns, providing farmers with a new market for their crops and generating billions of dollars in revenue for the producers of this corn-based fuel blend.
Those days of promise and prosperity are vanishing.
Nearly 10 percent of the nation's ethanol plants have stopped production over the past year, in part because the drought that has ravaged much of the nation's crops pushed commodity prices so high that ethanol has become too expensive to produce. 
A dip in gasoline consumption has compounded the industry's problem by reducing the demand for ethanol.
The situation has left the fate of dozens of ethanol plants hanging in the balance and has unsettled communities that once prospered from this biofuel.
''It's a more somber mood,'' said Todd Sneller, the administrator of the Nebraska Ethanol Board. ''The growth opportunity that existed some years ago is still out there in theory, but the reality that it's going to take an awful lot of time, money and political battles to realize that opportunity'' is causing consternation.
Thousands of barrels of ethanol now sit in storage because there is not enough gasoline in the market to blend it with -- and blends calling for a higher percentage of ethanol have yet to catch on widely in the marketplace. Advanced biofuels from waste like corn stalks and wood chips have also yet to reach commercial-level production as some had predicted they would by now.
Referring to the plants that have been idled, Eric Lee, a commodities expert at Citibank, said: ''Is that going to be temporary or permanent? It's hard to say.''
Not only do the plants employ residents of these small communities, but they also provide a market for farmers to sell their crops and buy grain to feed their livestock. They attract a steady flow of trucks whose drivers use truck stops and patronize other local businesses. Contractors visiting the plants stay in local hotels. And the plants hold large accounts with local banks.
''It's been quite an ordeal, honestly,'' Mayor Christopher Jackson of Walhalla, N.D., said of the closing of an Archer Daniels Midland ethanol plant there last April.
About a dozen families who had moved to Walhalla, a town of about 1,000, to work at the plant have left, he said. Many of the 61 people who worked there have since found new jobs, but the salary and benefits are not nearly as good, he said. Mr. Jackson manages his family's bar in town, and he said Friday end-of-week gatherings did not happen as much because people had less to spend.
''It's been hard on every business up and down Main Street,'' he said. ''I don't know that people realized how big of an impact that plant closing had on the community. Now we're a year into it; everybody's feeling the pinch.''
Congress set out to create an ethanol industry that would produce enough to make up 10 percent of every gallon of gas pumped into a car, but the lawmakers assumed that demand for fuel would grow. Instead, it has shrunk to 8.7 million barrels a day from 9.7 million in 2007, said Larry Goldstein, an economist and a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation. And with corporate average fuel economy rules now in place to double the number of miles that the average car gets per gallon by 2025, ''you know we're on a trend,'' he added.
As the gasoline market got smaller, so did the amount of ethanol it could absorb, because most service stations are set up to sell fuel with an ethanol content of only up to 10 percent. Owners' manuals of most cars call for fuel blends of no more than 10 percent ethanol. The industry calls this the ''blend wall,'' and it has won Environmental Protection Agency approval for some cars to run on blends of up to 15 percent, but thus far that fuel has not caught on with consumers.
Millions of cars are ''flex-fuel vehicles'' and can run on blends of up to 85 percent, known as e85, but that fuel is not popular and is not even widely offered outside a few corn-producing states.
But the ethanol producers were encouraged to build because the federal government had mandated that refiners use their product, and it established a tax credit of 45 cents per gallon of ethanol. The tax credit was allowed to expire on Dec. 31, 2011, but not before it had stimulated construction of ethanol plants.
The value of ethanol has also sagged. Its price is created in part by the price of the gasoline it displaces, and gasoline prices have been relatively modest for the past few months.
Mr. Sneller and others in the industry remain optimistic that technological innovations and sound public policy will keep the industry afloat.
Indeed, people here in Macon, in northeastern Missouri, are not as grim about the future of their plant, which is operated and partly owned by POET, an ethanol producer with more than two dozen plants nationwide. The plant has vowed to reopen, and it has retained all 44 of its employees to do maintenance work as it undergoes more than $13 million worth of renovations that it hopes will make it more efficient and able to produce ethanol more cost-effectively.
Signs of transition are evident at the plant. The growling factory motors, pumps and boilers are silent. But a sweet, acidic smell lingers, and signs of construction are everywhere: skid loaders sitting on fresh dirt, wooden planks cut for frames and dusty corners sectioned off with orange cones.
The plant, which President Obama visited three years ago, is adding equipment to allow it to produce corn oil that will provide additional income. It is also instituting technology that can produce ethanol without having to use heat, a move that will save on energy costs.
With the new technology, operators hope they will produce an extra three-tenths of a gallon of ethanol per bushel of corn.
Residents also understand why the plant halted operations.
The drought was particularly brutal here last year, leaving farmers with little to no corn. Don Mutter, who farms in nearby Cairo, said he produced about 25,000 bushels of corn last year, just 5.5 percent of his usual yield. Without corn nearby to purchase, the plant had to spend extra to haul it in from elsewhere. For several months it was operating at a loss. It ceased operations at the end of January.
''We are going to start back up, this year most likely,'' said Steve Burnett, who has been the manager since the plant opened in 2000.
For the people around here, ethanol is invaluable. The plant had been buying 16.5 million bushels of corn per year and producing 46 million gallons of ethanol.
Before the plant opened, Mr. Mutter, one of more than 300 investors in a company that owns a majority of the plant, used to sow about 300 acres of corn each year. Now he plants 2,500 acres. His investment in the plant has paid off fivefold, he said. His farming business grew so much that he was able to buy seven semis and start a trucking company.
''It was the greatest thing for around here,'' he said of the plant.

HEADLINE: It's Lose-Lose vs. Win-Win-Win-Win-Win

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
ONE of my favorite quotes about the state of U.S. politics was offered a couple years ago by Gerald Seib, a Wall Street Journal columnist, when he observed that ''America and its political leaders, after two decades of failing to come together to solve big problems, seem to have lost faith in their ability to do so. A political system that expects failure doesn't try very hard to produce anything else.'' That's us today -- our entire political system is guilty of the ''soft bigotry of low expectations'' for ourselves.
I raise this now because it strikes me as crazy that one of the obvious solutions to our budget, energy and environmental problems -- the one that would be the least painful and have the best long-term impact (a carbon tax) -- is off the table. Meanwhile, the solution that is as dumb as the day is long -- a budget sequester that slashes spending indiscriminately -- is on the table. 
Shrinking the tax deduction for charity is on the table. Shrinking Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid for the poor are on the table. But a carbon tax that could close the deficit and clean the air, weaken petro-dictators, strengthen the dollar, drive clean-tech innovation and still leave some money to lower corporate and income taxes is off the table. So the solutions that are lose-lose and divisive are on the table, while the solution that is win-win-win-win-win -- and has both liberal and conservative supporters -- is off the table.
Writing in this newspaper in support of a carbon tax back in 2007, N. Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist, who was a senior adviser to President George W. Bush and to Mitt Romney, argued that ''the idea of using taxes to fix problems, rather than merely raise government revenue, has a long history. The British economist Arthur Pigou advocated such corrective taxes to deal with pollution in the early 20th century. In his honor, economics textbooks now call them 'Pigovian taxes.' Using a Pigovian tax to address global warming is also an old idea. It was proposed as far back as 1992 by Martin S. Feldstein on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal. ... Those vying for elected office, however, are reluctant to sign on to this agenda. Their political consultants are no fans of taxes, Pigovian or otherwise. Republican consultants advise using the word 'tax' only if followed immediately by the word 'cut.' Democratic consultants recommend the word 'tax' be followed by 'on the rich.' ''
Yes, to win passage of any carbon tax, Republicans would insist that it be revenue neutral -- to be offset entirely by cuts in corporate taxes and taxes on personal income. But maybe they could be persuaded otherwise. In an ideal world, you would have 45 percent go to pay down the deficit so that we don't have to cut entitlements as much -- appealing to liberals and greens -- and have 45 percent go to reducing corporate and income taxes -- to encourage work and investment and appeal to conservatives. The remaining 10 percent could be rebated to low-income households for whom such a tax would be a burden.
According to the Center for Climate and Electricity Policy at the nonpartisan Resources for the Future, a tax of $25 per ton of carbon-dioxide emitted -- through the combustion of fossil fuels used in electricity production, commercial and residential heating and transportation -- ''would raise approximately $125 billion annually.'' This $125 billion ''could allow federal personal income tax reductions of about 15 percent or corporate income tax reductions of about 70 percent, if all carbon tax revenues were used to replace current tax revenues. Alternatively, the federal deficit could be reduced by approximately $1.25 trillion over 10 years'' -- roughly what we are trying to do through the foolish sequester. Such a tax would add about 21 cents per gallon of gasoline and about 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity. It could be phased in gradually as the economy improves.
Experts believe that the mere signal of a carbon tax would get companies to become more energy efficient. And that's the point. As part of any grand bargain -- which will have to include spending cuts and tax increases -- introducing a carbon tax into the mix makes all kinds of options easier and smarter.
Alas, right now both sides are trying to inflict maximum pain on the other, rather than framing the debate as: ''Here's the world we're living in; here's what we need to thrive; and, if we cut and tax here, we can invest in these 21st-century growth engines over here.'' Our goal is not to balance the budget. It's to make America great.
SO how come the best ideas are off the table? (Blessedly, Representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat of California, is now working to get some kind of carbon tax on the table.) Several reasons, argues Adam Garfinkle, editor of The American Interest and author of a smart new e-book, ''Broken: American Political Dysfunction and What to Do About It.''
First, because our democracy today is perverted more than ever by deep-pocketed lobbies and oligopolies. So, ''in order to get and stay elected today, you have to raise huge sums of money from corporations, wealthy individuals and dues-laden unions,'' Garfinkle notes, and all that money leads to ''twisted decision-making at the high-politics level'' and ''regulatory capture'' at the bureaucratic-administrative level. The fossil fuel, auto and power companies have bought a lot of politicians to block a carbon tax.
The only way around them, argues Garfinkle, would be for leaders to galvanize the public, but that requires building ''governing coalitions'' in the center rather than ''political coalitions'' that can get you elected but little else after that. Obama is belatedly trying to do that; the Republican Party hasn't even tried. ''This is what real leaders do,'' said Garfinkle. ''They change the conversation.'' They don't just read the polls; they shape the polls.
But we can't put this all on lobbyists. It's also our generation. ''We're the most self-indulgent generation in American history,'' argues Garfinkle, always demanding more services than we're ready to pay for. ''Too many of us want to be unbound by broader social obligations, but the network of those obligations creates the moral ballast that makes good governance possible.''
As Nathan Gardels and Nicolas Berggruen note in their insightful book, ''Intelligent Governance for the 21st Century: A Middle Way Between West and East,'' we prefer a ''Diet Coke culture -- sweetness without calories, consumption without savings and safety nets without taxes.'' No wonder anything hard or smart is off the table. We pushed it there.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan's Follies, For All To See

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
BE afraid.
That's the takeaway for both investors and taxpayers in the 307-page Senate report detailing last year's $6.2 billion trading fiasco at JPMorgan Chase. The financial system, thanks to dissembling traders and bumbling regulators, is at greater risk than you know.
After bailing out the nation's banking system in 2008, taxpayers and investors have been assured that such a crisis will not happen again. The Dodd-Frank legislation was supposed to make our system safe from the kinds of reckless banking activities that brought the economy to its knees.
The Senate report disproves this premise with vigor.
Its pages of e-mails, testimony, telephone transcripts and analysis show that traders in the bank's chief investment office hid money-losing derivatives positions, if only temporarily; that risk limits created by the bank to protect itself were exceeded routinely; that risk models were changed to minimize losses; that bank executives misled investors and the public; and that regulations are only as good as the regulators enforcing them. 
Remember that this is a report examining JPMorgan Chase, the bank that enjoys the best reputation among its peers. One can only wonder: if JPMorgan Chase traders think nothing of misrepresenting the value of their trades to minimize losses, what are the financial world's lesser players up to?
Unfortunately, that is not something investors are likely to learn until it is too late and a wrong-way bet blows up an institution's balance sheet.
Before delving into the report and its findings, let's congratulate the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led by Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat. This is the second time in recent history that this subcommittee and its staff have served the public by illuminating the dark corners of the financial world -- the first being the riveting hearings and reports on the causes of the 2008 financial crisis, which dove deep on Washington Mutual, Goldman Sachs and the credit ratings agencies.
The hearings on Friday were equally compelling, with Mr. Levin and John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is the subcommittee's ranking minority member, subjecting current and former JPMorgan executives, including Ina Drew, the former head of the chief investment office, to penetrating and pointed questions.
''Besides the traders who mismarked the book, who should be held accountable for breaching JPMorgan's own internal risk limits and adjusting its risk models?'' Mr. McCain asked of Douglas L. Braunstein, vice chairman at the bank. After Mr. Braunstein cited the significant reductions in compensation of JPMorgan executives as one measure of accountability, Mr. McCain replied: ''It's hard for me to accept that serious responsibility was assumed by the top management of JPMorgan especially in light of e-mails that say that these decisions were, according to Ms. Drew, fully discussed and vetted by the top management of JPMorgan.''
Hoping to understand JPMorgan's practice of relaxing its valuation method on the troubled investment portfolio, Mr. Levin asked of Mr. Braunstein: ''Is it common for JPMorgan to change its pricing practices when losses start to pile up in order to minimize the losses?''
After a bit of back and forth, Mr. Braunstein said: ''No, that is not acceptable practice.''
Not acceptable, perhaps, but that is what occurred, as the Senate report shows. Normal practice at the bank and across the industry is to value these kinds of derivatives at the midpoint between the bid and offer prices available in the market. But in early 2012, as it became apparent that JPMorgan's big trades at the chief investment office were going bad, the bank began valuing the portfolio well outside the midpoint. This reduced its losses.
For example, in January 2012, the portfolio valuations hewed closely to the midpoint on all but 2 of the 18 measures, the Senate investigators found. A month later, 5 of the 18 valuation measures deviated from the midpoint. In March, however, all 18 deviated, and 16 were at the outer bounds of price ranges. In every case, the prices used by the bank understated its losses.
While these valuation shifts were taking place in the chief investment office, JPMorgan's investment bank officials continued to mark their identical positions using the midpoint value.
RISK limits, intended to protect the bank from losses, were also routinely breached at JPMorgan Chase, the report found. From late 2011 to the first quarter of 2012, Senate investigators saw a huge jump in the number of risk-limit breaches -- to more than 170, from 6. Then, in April 2012 alone, risk limits were exceeded 160 times.
''Should someone have investigated the risky trading activities that triggered all these breaches?'' Mr. Levin asked. Yes, but no one did, the report concluded. The risk limits were either ignored or modified to make the portfolio look better.
JPMorgan Chase has repeatedly said it made mistakes and has changed its policies.
The Senate report also raises questions about the rigor with which JPMorgan conducted its own investigation into the trading loss. That report was published in January.
Mr. Levin cited the internal report's failings in his questioning of Michael Cavanagh, a task force member and co-C.E.O. of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank. ''You just told us that shifting pricing practices to minimize losses is not acceptable,'' Mr. Levin said. ''Did you say that in your report? Did you say that's what happened?''
''I don't believe we called that out in the report,'' Mr. Cavanagh answered.
The report recommends what regulators should do to prevent similar events at other banks. It suggests that regulators should be on the lookout for manipulation of an institution's risk models and should encourage banks to use independent pricing services to ensure the integrity of valuations.
But the true value in this Senate investigation is its spotlight on the ability of bank executives to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and yet survive internal valuation reviews. This ''shows how imprecise, undisciplined, and open to manipulation the current process is for valuing credit derivatives,'' the report said.
JPMorgan, don't forget, is the largest derivatives dealer in the world. Trillions of dollars in such instruments sit on its and other big banks' balance sheets. The ease with which the bank hid losses and fiddled with valuations should be a major concern to investors.
As for taxpayers, the Senate report clearly indicates that JPMorgan Chase is too big to regulate. The report found that the bank failed to provide crucial portfolio data to its regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and that those regulators did not investigate questionable trading at the bank. The overseers accepted the bank's assurances that nothing was amiss.
We already know that banks of JPMorgan's size are also too big to be allowed to fail and too big to prosecute. Such banks are too big to regulate and apparently too big to manage. So how much more evidence do we need that banks like JPMorgan are simply too big a risk for taxpayers to bear?

HEADLINE: New Pope Puts Spotlight on Jesuits, an Influential Yet Self-Effacing Order

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
ROME -- Men who join the Jesuits, the Roman Catholic Church's largest religious order, take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, and promise never to take any high office in the church.
So while other priests were climbing the ladder of the church's hierarchy, the Jesuits directed their considerable energies into spreading the Catholic faith in new frontiers. They have planted the church in places like India, Japan, Canada and Latin America. They work with the poor in shantytowns and AIDS clinics. They publish magazines, paint, write music and stage plays.
And, what they are perhaps best known for, they run academically rigorous schools and universities around the world -- which in the United States include Georgetown, Boston College, Fordham and the various Loyolas. Secular professions are filled with high achievers educated at Jesuit institutions. 
Now, for the first time in the church's history, a Jesuit has been elected pontiff. Pope Francis, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, an Argentine of Italian origin, has already set a new tone for the papacy. He is the first to take the name Francis, in homage to Francis of Assisi, who abandoned comfort to join beggars. In keeping with the Jesuit ideal to live simply, Francis in his first days as pope dressed in a plain white cassock. He opted to ride in a minibus with his fellow cardinals rather than a private Vatican car. And on Saturday, he suggested a humble course for the church as a whole.
''How I would like a poor church,'' he said, one that was ''for the poor.''
Given the Jesuits' watchword to find God ''in all things,'' some are hoping that the leadership of a Jesuit pope will allow the church to engage more openly and fearlessly with the world, to project the church's message in new ways and to emphasize service to, and solidarity with, the poor. With an outsider now at the helm, they hope Francis will be able to shake up the culture of the Vatican.
If so, his papacy could become a contrast to that of his predecessor, Benedict XVI, a quiet German scholar and former doctrinal enforcer for the church, who at times seemed to accept the prospect of a church dwindling in the future to a faithful remnant of the most devout, hunkered down in the catacombs. Benedict became the first pope in 600 years to resign when he stepped down last month.
But it is still too early to tell what is at the top of the agenda for Francis, who at 76 is only two years younger than Benedict when he was elected. The church is struggling in Europe and even in some parts of Latin America. He is assuming control of a Vatican that has been racked in recent years by missteps and scandals that peaked when the personal papers of Benedict were stolen by his butler and published in an affair known as VatiLeaks.
Going into the conclave, many cardinals spoke of the need to reform the Vatican: both to address the mismanagement, and also to make it more responsive and accessible to the world's bishops.
The Rev. James Martin, an editor at the Jesuit magazine America based in New York City and author of ''The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything,'' said, ''They wanted someone who can make the tough decisions, and the fact that he is a member of a religious order may have given him a certain aura of independence.''
Throughout its history, the church when in need of reform has turned to religious orders for popes -- though never before a Jesuit.
The Society of Jesus, as the order is called, was founded in the 16th century by Ignatius of Loyola, a Spanish knight who experienced a religious conversion while recovering from the wounds of battle. There are now about 17,000 Jesuits around the world, and while their ranks are declining in Europe and the United States, they are growing in places like Vietnam, India and Latin America.
The Jesuits are distinguished by their vow to obey the pope and to serve where he commands. The Rev. Antonio Spadaro, editor of La Civilt Cattolica, a Jesuit journal in Rome, said in an interview that before the papal conclave, journalists were asking him whether Cardinal Bergoglio could be pope.
''And I said, 'Not at all, because he's a Jesuit,' '' Father Spadaro said in an interview in his office on Friday. ''We are used to serving a pope, not to be a pope.''
The Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Jesuit who serves as the Vatican spokesman, said that when he saw Cardinal Bergoglio emerge on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica as the new pope, ''I was dumbfounded.''
The selection has thrilled many Jesuits, but dismayed others. Shaped by their experiences with the poor and powerless, many Jesuits lean liberal, politically and theologically, and are more concerned with social and economic justice than with matters of doctrinal purity. Jesuits were in the forefront of the movement known as liberation theology, which encouraged the oppressed to unite along class lines and seek change.
However, Francis, when he was head of the Jesuits in Argentina in the 1970s, was opposed to liberation theology, seeing it as too influenced by Marxist politics. The future pope came down hard on Jesuits in his province who were liberation theology proponents and left it badly divided, according to those who study the order and some members who did not want to be identified because he is now pope.
He was made a bishop and a cardinal by John Paul II. Jesuits may become bishops, but must have the approval of their superior, because the founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius, lamented the clerical careerism of his age. Jesuits are aware that their first pope will bring new attention and scrutiny to their order, and while they are excited, they are also wary. ''It's a good chance for us to help people to understand better our spirituality,'' Father Spadaro said. ''But we like to do our job, not to be under the lights. So we'll just see.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Cancels Last Phase of Missile Defense System That Russia Opposed

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and MICHAEL R. GORDON; David M. Herszenhorn reported from Moscow, and Michael R. Gordon from Washington. Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The United States has effectively canceled the final phase of a Europe-based missile defense system that was fiercely opposed by Russia and cited repeatedly by the Kremlin as a major obstacle to cooperation on nuclear arms reductions and other issues.
Russian officials here have so far declined to comment on the announcement, which was made in Washington on Friday by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel as part of a plan to deploy additional ballistic missile interceptors to counter North Korea. The cancellation of some European-based defenses will allow resources to be shifted to protect against North Korea. 
Aides to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said there would be no reaction until early next week, when they expect to be briefed by American officials.
But Russian news accounts quickly raised the possibility that the decision could portend a breakthrough in what for years has been a largely intractable dispute between Russia and the United States. A headline by the Itar-Tass news agency declared, ''U.S. abandons fourth phase of European missile defense system that causes the greatest objections from Russia.''
Pentagon officials said that those longstanding objections by Russia played no role in the decision to reconfigure the missile interceptor program, which they said was based on the increased threat from North Korea and on technological difficulties and budget considerations related to the Europe-based program.
''The missile defense decisions Secretary Hagel announced were in no way about Russia,'' George Little, a Pentagon spokesman, said Saturday.
Still, other Obama administration officials acknowledged potential benefits if the decision was well-received in Moscow, as well as the possibility of continued objections given that the United States is not backing away from its core plan for a land-based missile shield program in Central Europe.
''There's still an absolutely firm commitment to European missile defense, which is not about Russia; it's about Iran these days,'' said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''If there are side benefits that accrue with Russia, so be it. But that wasn't a primary driver.''
Regardless, some experts said it could help relations by eliminating what the Russians had cited as one of their main objections -- the interceptors in the final phase of the missile shield that might have the ability to target long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are part of Russian's nuclear arsenal.
The Obama administration has sought cooperation from Russia on numerous issues, with varying degrees of success. Russia generally has supported the NATO-led military effort in Afghanistan and has helped to restrict Iran's nuclear program by supporting economic sanctions. But the two countries have been deeply at odds over the war in Syria, and over human rights issues in Russia. Most recently, President Obama has said he would like further reductions in the two countries' nuclear arsenals, something Russia has said it would not consider without settling the dispute over missile defense.
American experts insisted that the Russians' concern over the antimissile program was exaggerated and that the system would not have jeopardized their strategic missiles had the final phase been developed. That Russian concern has now been addressed.
''There is no threat to Russian missiles now,'' said Steven Pifer, an arms control expert who has managed Russia policy from top positions at the State Department and the National Security Council. ''If you listen to what the Russians have been saying for the last two years, this has been the biggest obstacle to things like cooperation with NATO.''
''Potentially this is very big,'' said Mr.Pifer, now of the Brookings Institution. ''And it's going to be very interesting seeing how the Russians react once they digest it.''
In Washington, many officials have said they believe Russia's real objections are not only about the particular capabilities of the missile shield but also about a more general political and strategic opposition to an expanding American military presence in Eastern Europe. Canceling only the final stage of the program does not address that concern, so it is possible that Russia's position will remain unchanged.
Sean Kay, a professor at Ohio Wesleyan University and expert in international security issue and Russian relations, said that the so-called fourth stage of the Europe-based missile defense program ''was largely conceptual'' and might never have been completed.
Eliminating that portion of the program made sense, Mr. Kay said. ''In effect, by sticking with a plan that was neither likely to work in the last stage but was creating significant and needless diplomatic hurdles at the same time, we gained nothing,'' he said. At least some of the canceled interceptors were to have been based in Poland, which will still host less-advanced interceptors.
In the past, efforts to restructure the antimissile program provoked sharp criticism in Poland, but this time reaction from Warsaw has been more muted. Analysts have said Poland's main goal in hosting the interceptors has been having an American military presence there as a deterrent to Russia.

HEADLINE: Coffee's Economics, Rewritten by Farmers

BYLINE: By NICOLE LaPORTE

 BODY:
IN 2005, Kenneth Lander, a lawyer in Monroe, Ga., moved with his wife, stepdaughter and the youngest three of his seven children to a coffee farm in San Rafael de Abangares, Costa Rica. He always ''had a heart,'' he said, for Latin America, and after a vacation to the lush cloud forests near Monteverde in 2004, he was determined to return on a more permanent basis.
He was also looking for more balance in his work-driven life. And so, after buying a coffee farm from a farmer he'd met on his earlier trip, he packed up his life and moved.
''It was like Swiss Family Robinson,'' Mr. Lander jokes. ''We just left.'' 
In Costa Rica, Mr. Lander, who is now 46, didn't have to worry about making money. He had received a cash windfall from selling a portion of a residential subdivision he had helped develop in Georgia; the plan was to keep selling more lots and live off the proceeds. So he grew coffee for fun.
Then, in 2008, the financial crisis hit. The value of his subdivision plummeted. Suddenly, he had to support himself as a coffee farmer. Very quickly, he realized how difficult that was going to be. He had just 12 acres that produced 6,000 pounds of specialty-grade coffee beans a year.
He belonged to a ''fair trade'' co-op, which guarantees farmers a minimum price, but was making only $1.30 a pound on coffee that retailed in the United States for $12 a pound. His net profit was so low that at one point he was down to $120 that had to last two weeks.
''I was at the register debating whether or not to buy shampoo or a bag of rice,'' Mr. Lander recalls.
Why wasn't he seeing more of that final price?
That question has been asked by farmers throughout history, particularly in developing countries, where growers of commodity crops like coffee and cocoa often live in poverty. Over the last few decades, a worldwide movement under the broad banner of fair trade has tried to rectify that imbalance.
In exchange for receiving ''fair'' prices for their products, fair trade farmers must adhere to environmental and labor standards set by certification groups, the largest of which is Fairtrade International, a nonprofit organization based in Bonn, Germany. It represents 1.24 million farmers and workers in industries including coffee, bananas and honey.
But Mr. Lander started to think that he might improve on the idea. He began to experiment. Using a roaster he had bought in better times, he started roasting his beans and selling them on Facebook to friends in the United States. He also opened a coffee shop, called the Common Cup, in Monteverde, and sold his coffee to tourists.
When he ran out of beans, he teamed up with two other area coffee farmers, Jorge Fonseca and Alejandro Garcia -- who also had a coffee shop, the Colibri -- and began shipping greater volumes. Suddenly, he was making money.
This D.I.Y. enterprise led to the creation in 2011 of Thrive Farmers Coffee, which Mr. Lander started with Mr. Garcia and Michael Jones, an entrepreneur based in Atlanta. The company is still largely untested, but is built on the idea that farmers can ''participate in the added value as coffee moves downstream to the consumer,'' Mr. Lander said.
TYPICALLY, farmers sell their green, or unroasted, beans. At that stage, the beans generally fetch a price based on the commodity market price, which in February averaged $1.53 a pound for Arabica coffee, according to the International Coffee Organization.
The fair trade concept offers an improvement on that model. It will pay the market price for beans, but, importantly, it guarantees a minimum price -- now $1.40 for Arabica coffee. In addition, the local co-op that collects and processes the beans keeps a premium, now 20 cents, which is used for social services like scholarships and health care for farmers and their families.
Theoretically, a fair trade farmer never loses, because when the commodity market price is higher than the fair trade price, the farmer receives the market price, and the co-op still receives the premium. But fair trade buyers purchase unroasted beans, and the processes that add to the price and value of the coffee come later.
In the system that Thrive is trying to develop, farmers are paid only after their coffee has been exported, packaged and sold -- at a much higher price -- to retailers. If coffee is sold for, say, $7.25 a pound, Thrive splits the proceeds 50-50 with the farmers, who end up, in that example, with about $3.60 a pound.
The farmers working with Thrive must pay the higher costs of processing and exporting, but Mr. Lander says they net about four times as much as they would through fair trade, once production costs and co-op fees are factored in. And Thrive helps farmers by establishing relationships for the farmers with local coffee processing mills and co-ops. Then, once the beans are shipped to the United States, Thrive takes over, handling packaging, roasting and sales. In some cases, Thrive sells green coffee beans to roasters, in which case the farmer receives 75 percent of the proceeds.
''We're teaching a farmer that you don't have to relinquish control of your coffee,'' Mr. Lander said. ''You can see it all the way through the value chain.''
Thrive's system is among a growing number of innovative business models in the coffee and cocoa industries that are allowing farmers to increase their ownership and profit margins. Divine Chocolate, based in London, is partly owned by cocoa farmers in Ghana, who get a percentage of company profits. Pachamama Coffee Cooperative, based in Davis, Calif., is owned by farmers in Latin America and Africa. After the coffee is roasted in the United States and sold, all profits go back to the farmers.
All of these initiatives have sprung out of fair trade and aim to send the movement in a more significant for-profit direction.
Fair trade ''can be part of a fairer deal for farmers,'' says Christopher Bacon, an environmental studies professor at Santa Clara University. ''Small-scale farmers have historically used fair trade as one of several strategies, including grass-roots organizing, to build stronger cooperatives'' that allow farmers ''to become active players in the global coffee industry.''
But, he added, the fair trade idea ''is more about making a living than rocketing coffee farmers out of poverty.''
Paul Rice, president and C.E.O. of Fair Trade USA, the nonprofit organization that certifies transactions between United States companies and their suppliers, said that the fair trade price ''is a floor, not a cap,'' and that co-ops with reputations for delivering high-quality coffee have commanded prices of more than $3 a pound. In 2011, a strong year for coffee, the average price for fair trade coffee was $2.84 a pound, according to the organization.
Mr. Rice applauded companies like Thrive, but asked: ''Is that model really scalable? Is it going to reach millions of farmers?''
After all, fair trade's partnerships with major coffee companies -- like Starbucks and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which together imported 84.6 million pounds of fair trade certified coffee in 2011 -- are central to keeping fair trade farmers in business. And he said those companies were accustomed to the quality and reliability that come with the fair trade label.
Moreover, exporting creates risks that farmers selling raw beans don't face. ''There are aspects around flavor and quality, and the changes in flavor that can happen during export,'' says Dennis Macray, the former director of ethical sourcing and global responsibility at Starbucks, who is now an independent specialty coffee and cocoa consultant. ''Most coffee producers don't have the capacity to manage that risk."
Mr. Lander acknowledges challenges in the Thrive model and says that there have been glitches as he and his partners figured out the business. Two groups of Thrive farmers who did not process their coffee up to standards set by the Specialty Coffee Association of America, for example, had to reprocess the coffee, leading to a delay in sales -- and their payment. ''It's the first time that farmers are being asked to think about quality,'' Mr. Lander said. ''Now they're selling to the end user. So that's something we have to teach them.''
Carlos Vargas, chief financial officer at CoopeTarraz R.L., a coffee co-op in Costa Rica, said Thrive's payment model, in which farmers have to wait until their coffee is sold in grocery stores before being paid, could be a hardship for small farmers.
''In the end, the farmer will get a good price, but the problem is there's not the right balance between when the farmer needs the money and when the farmer receives the money,'' Mr. Vargas said, explaining that farmers depend on money they receive from selling beans during the coffee season to cover their production costs. Waiting for the coffee to be processed and roasted and reach stores can take several months. He said that some farmers he knows, who have been working with Thrive, have had to wait 6 to 12 months to be paid.
''That's a very long time, and they have to invest in the next crop. For a small farmer that's very difficult.''
''Farmers do have to wait,'' said Mr. Lander, who added that 6 to 12 months is a typical time frame for getting paid. For this reason, farmers are asked to put in only a small percentage of their crop the first year and to increase the portion over time.
Still, fair-trade-certified co-ops -- which similarly rely on sales from beans early in the season -- are free to work with Thrive.
According to Mr. Jones, who has invested more than $1 million in Thrive, it is committed to high-quality farming and environmental standards. Eventually, he said, he would ''love to have a third-party agency to help us validate things,'' but ''we have to crawl before we walk, and walk before we run.''
Mr. Rice of Fair Trade USA agreed that ''there are a lot of different doors into this sustainability space that consumers can take.'' He added that ''if a consumer discovers a great product that also makes the world a better place through Thrive, that's great.''
IN 2012, Thrive sold 328,000 pounds of coffee over the Internet, to churches and through specialty stores like Golden Harvest Produce Market in Kittery, Me., and Earth Fare, a chain based in Fletcher, N.C. The coffee sells for $9.95 to $12.25 a pound. Mr. Lander said that of Thrive's 625 farmers in Costa Rica, Honduras and Guatemala, 480 had received their share of coffee sales. The remainder consigned their coffee to Thrive later in the season, so their coffee has not yet hit the market.
As for his own well-being, he said that since Thrive brought on angel investors last fall, he is taking a ''conservative salary.''
But, he added, ''I've never been more happy or more fulfilled.'' And he has no trouble buying shampoo.

''We're teaching a farmer that you don't have to relinquish control of your coffee,'' says Kenneth Lander, right, on his plantation with Alejandro Garcia.

HEADLINE: Ian M. Ross, a President At Bell Labs, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Ian M. Ross, who helped perfect the transistor and calculate whether the moon's surface could support a spaceship's weight, and then went on to lead Bell Laboratories, the legendary fount of technological marvels and Nobel Prize winners, died on March 10 at his home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. He was 85.
The cause was complications of pneumonia, his wife, Christina, said. 
For much of the 20th century Bell Labs was among the world's largest research institutions. Its mission was to help AT&T, the telephone monopoly and its corporate parent, cope with everything from digital communication to squirrels chewing phone lines. Its thousands of scientists and engineers fostered discoveries like the transistor, the laser and information theory, earning seven Nobel Prizes and 29,000 patents.
Dr. Ross was Bell Labs' president when its mission changed radically in 1984, after AT&T had spun off its local phone companies to settle a federal antitrust suit. The loss of these so-called Baby Bells -- subsidiaries like New York Telephone and Southern Bell -- opened the door for AT&T to hurl its economic and technological might into new, unregulated businesses to compete with companies like I.B.M.
Bell Labs was the glamorous vanguard of this drive to go beyond communications into all phases of information technology. Preaching ''urgency,'' Dr. Ross nudged his army of scientists to align their sometimes spectacularly esoteric schemes and dreams with market needs, going so far as to dispatch some of them to accompany AT&T sales employees on their rounds.
But he refused to give specific instructions to the 10 percent of Bell employees doing basic research, an enterprise that, among other things, yielded proof that the universe started with a Big Bang.
''It's a foolish thing to tell a research person what the problem is -- you'll get the answer to that problem and miss a brilliant discovery in the process,'' he said.
In the three years after AT&T's breakup, the labs' wizards never paused, conjuring wonders like an undersea fiber-optic cable to a superfast computer algorithm for solving complex problems.
In 1996, five years after Dr. Ross retired, AT&T split into three companies, one of which was its old manufacturing arm, renamed Lucent Technologies. Lucent took most of Bell Labs' personnel.
Lucent at first performed well, increasing the lab's budget and staff. Then the markets for both its shares and products dipped, and in 2006 Lucent merged with Alcatel, a French company. Two years later, Alcatel-Lucent announced that Bell Labs was pulling out of basic science to focus on more immediately marketable fields.
SBC Communications, a former Baby Bell, bought AT&T's bones (not including Bell Labs) in 2005 and took its name. Ian Munro Ross was born on Aug. 15, 1927, in Southport, England, and joined Bell in 1952 after earning a doctorate in mechanical sciences from the University of Cambridge. William Shockley, who led the team that invented the transistor in 1947, hired him. In a 2009 oral history interview, Dr. Ross said he had intended to stay for no more than a year but gave up that plan after finding the intellectual buzz there ''exhilarating.''
An early assignment was to organize a symposium to tell other companies everything Bell had learned about making transistors, the lightning-fast switches that underpin modern electronics. The fee to attend the symposium was only $25,000, as a down payment on a 5 percent licensing charge. Dr. Ross said the relatively small fee reflected AT&T's hope that the companies would develop things AT&T could use. Thus did Texas Instruments, Fairchild and Sony get a jump-start on a multibillion-dollar field.
Dr. Ross's early years at Bell were devoted to guiding teams working to improve the transistor. One effort involved making advances in ''field effect'' transistors, which became a mainstay of integrated circuits, the term for a set of electronic circuits on a small plate, or ''chip,'' of semiconductor material.
Another team developed epitaxy, the growing of specialized silicon crystals to make super-thin semiconductor wafers. The wafers allowed for greater speed and memory and led to a new generation of computers, microprocessors and switching systems.
In the oral history, Dr. Ross said of epitaxy: ''You know, the reaction, I think, in the industry was a sigh of relief that you could hear from coast to coast. And quite a number of cries, 'Why didn't I think of that?' ''
Dr. Ross next ran two of Bell's semiconductor laboratories and oversaw electronics on Telstar, the first communications satellite. In 1964, he was named managing director of Bellcomm, a Bell systems unit formed solely to plan Apollo moon missions.
Bellcomm's tasks included determining that the lunar surface was almost certainly not composed of dust so powdery that a landing vehicle would just keep sinking. NASA said moon missions would not have succeeded without Bellcomm's guidance.
After returning to Bell Labs, Dr. Ross was named president in 1979. He was AT&T's first witness in defending itself against federal charges of antitrust violations in 1981. He called the Bell system ''interactive and interdependent,'' but conceded that it had withheld information from competitors.
Dr. Ross belonged to the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Academy of Engineering, and won many industry and professional awards.
He is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Christina Leinberg; his son, Tim; his daughters, Nancy Ross and Stina Ross; and two grandchildren.
Dr. Ross was described as a quiet man, but he could not help bragging -- or at least expressing wonderment -- about the stunning electronic achievements he had helped foster. ''If we had had the same progress in the aircraft industry, you and I could be flying between London and New York in 500,000-seat planes and the fare would be about 25 cents,'' he once said.

HEADLINE: Accuser Testifies in Ohio Rape Case; Verdict Expected

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
STEUBENVILLE, Ohio -- A 16-year-old girl who prosecutors say was raped by two high school football stars here last August after a night of drinking took the witness stand on Saturday and told a judge that she had no memory of a six-hour period during which each of the teenagers is said to have assaulted her.
The trial abruptly ended Saturday night after the girl's testimony, and Tom Lipps, the juvenile court judge who is hearing the case, said he would issue a verdict at 10 a.m. on Sunday. 
The case has shaken Steubenville and drawn national attention for how it played out in text messages and social media.
The girl's testimony capped four days of evidence presented by prosecutors, who have charged the football players -- Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16 -- and accused them of penetrating her with their fingers. According to Ohio law, the definition of rape includes digital penetration.
The case deeply divided the town, whose powerhouse Steubenville High School football team has been a source of pride amid gloomy economic conditions.
Mr. Mays and Mr. Richmond were rising stars in the football program, and some Steubenville residents have complained about a culture that protects the team. Others say the girl, her supporters and the news media have blown the episode out of proportion. Lawyers for the two boys, who could be sent to juvenile jail until they are 21 if they are found guilty, have denied the charges and said that any sex was consensual.
The girl testified Saturday that after leaving a party around midnight on Aug. 11 with the two football players, she woke up the next morning in the basement living room of another house. She was naked, she recalled, with no idea how she got there or where she was, and Mr. Mays, Mr. Richmond and another boy were surrounding her. The girl said that the boys put her clothes on a table, but she could not find her phone, her underwear, her earrings or her shoes.
''I was embarrassed and scared, and I did not know what to think because I could not remember anything,'' she testified. She said that over the next two days she pieced together what had happened with the help of friends who showed her a video posted on YouTube and a picture that had circulated of her in the basement lying naked.
Earlier on Saturday, two former friends of the girl testified for the defense that she had a reputation as a liar. An expert defense witness also testified that the girl was not likely to have consumed enough alcohol to pass out that night but that she did drink enough to have a memory lapse, implying she could have consented to having sex but did not remember doing so.
On Friday, one friend and classmate testified that he saw Mr. Mays penetrate the girl with his fingers in the back seat of a car, while another student testified that Mr. Richmond did the same while she was in the basement. Both students testified after being granted immunity from prosecution.
When it was her turn on the witness stand, the girl, guided by the prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter, testified for two hours about how she discovered how she was treated that night, and how she came to figure out that Mr. Mays was only pretending to care about her in an effort to try to save himself.
She said an increasingly frantic Mr. Mays repeatedly sent her text messages the next day, pleading with her not to press charges and saying that he feared his football career would be hurt.
''He was just, like, freaking out,'' the girl testified Saturday. ''He kept asking, 'Are you going to tell the police?' He was trying to get me not to tell anyone.''
In one text message, she said, Mr. Mays admitted taking the picture of her naked in the basement but said that he did not know how the photograph had been circulated. He said the picture showed his semen on top of her, the result of what he said had been a consensual sexual act.
At one point, Mr. Mays, who maintained that he had taken care of the girl while she was drunk, appeared to grow increasingly frustrated that she refused to reassure him. He told her in a text message, ''I'll just never do anything nice for you again.''
Later, in the final series of text messages they ever exchanged, Mr. Mays told her, ''I'm about to get kicked off my football team.''
The girl replied: ''The more you bring up football, the more pissed I get, because that's like all you care about.''
Mr. Mays texted back: ''You know that's not all I care about, but that needs to be taken care of first.''

HEADLINE: Some New Songs for a Side Career

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
The last time Justin Timberlake released an album, Barack Obama was the junior senator from Illinois, Jay-Z and Beyonc were not married, and iPhones did not exist. It was 2006, just a few weeks before Taylor Swift's debut album arrived, setting her on the path to become perhaps the last old-fashioned pop superstar. But since then rapid industry decline and atomization have all but eliminated the need for Justin Timberlakes, or Taylor Swifts, or certainly the opportunities to make new ones.
In the meantime Mr. Timberlake signaled his importance in other ways: versatile appearances on ''Saturday Night Live,'' which he recently hosted for the fifth time; acting in films both acclaimed (''The Social Network'') and derided (''The Love Guru''); working on a fashion line; golfing. You know -- a full life. Given all that, there's no good reason Mr. Timberlake, 32, should be making music anymore. And yet he's about to release ''The 20/20 Experience'' (RCA), which could be mistaken for an exercise in hubris were it actually arrogant. 
Most artists who stay away so long are trying to cleanse themselves of something -- an unfortunate subgenre association, a nasty scandal. But mostly what Mr. Timberlake has been trying to cleanse himself of is music. That's reflective of his broader career goals, and also of the diminished value music stardom has in the current entertainment economy.
But while it was Mr. Timberlake's success in music that allowed him the chance to succeed in film, or TV, or fashion, or baking (who knows?), now the opposite is true: His sustained fame as a polymathic celebrity means there's still an appetite for his music, even if he's out of step with most current trends. (Or maybe he just has a contractual obligation. Nobler art has been made for less noble reasons.) He could have made a cabaret standards album, an acoustic singer-songwriter folk record, a ghastly dance-music immersion, a pseudo-Drake sing-rap hybrid. Any of those would have been more risky and more distinctive than what ended up on ''The 20/20 Experience,'' an amiable, anodyne album that hopes not to alienate anyone but also doesn't offer new reasons to commit. It's an album of largely inconsequential beauty, showing Mr. Timberlake as an artist with no incentive to innovate, making this primarily a paean to brand maintenance. It's not meant to change minds.
That's clear from the first single, the breezy hit ''Suit & Tie,'' which has the lighthearted bop of early New Edition with the vocal elegance of sunshine dappled soul groups like Tony! Toni! Ton! The molasses-y intro nods to Houston's screw music, and the song features the most negligible Jay-Z verse in recent memory (though this mediocre chemistry didn't preclude the two from teaming up for a tour this summer).
The album begins with a labored Prince-esque woman-as-drugs comparison, ''Pusher Love Girl,'' (''Just tell me, can I get a light?/Roll you up and let it run through my veins'') and, not long after that, a less labored woman-as-tasty-treat comparison, ''Strawberry Bubblegum,'' which has some pleasant frisson between Mr. Timberlake's sweet high voice and producer Timbaland's guttural exhortations.
It's odd that the one unreservedly great song on this album, ''Tunnel Vision,'' could be by Chris Brown, it's so modern, with its updating of Timbaland's vintage stutter-step drums and icy synths. Also unexpected is the rhythmically exciting ''Let the Groove Get In,'' which samples from an album of music from Burkina Faso, and is reminiscent of nothing so much as Beyonc's martial ''Run the World (Girls).'' It's almost a breaks record more than a proper song, with Mr. Timberlake working a few phrases over and over, never building any real tension or release.
''The 20/20 Experience'' was made with a small group of collaborators -- the producers Timbaland and Jerome Harmon (known as J-Roc), and the songwriter James Fauntleroy. Mr. Timberlake handled the vocal production and arrangements, and even some of the mixing. The result is a smallness of purpose, with only slight variation throughout, like the deeply wholesome soul of ''That Girl'' or the drowsy ''Blue Ocean Floor,'' which had it been released two or three years ago, might have been called chillwave's pop breakthrough. (Maybe Mr. Timberlake has been listening to Enya in his downtime.)
Seven of the 10 songs are more than seven minutes. In an era of Frank Ocean soul meditation, this could pass for artistry, but really it's a gesture of conservatism, an argument for the album as a whole over whatever abbreviated singles will eventually be shipped to radio. It also harks back to '70s soul, Prince's funk breakdowns and Michael Jackson's hyper-ornate pop. It is Mr. Timberlake radiating seriousness, lest you think his music making is frivolous.
There is something to that. This is just his third solo album; it's surprising how much of his fame is still rooted in his years in 'NSync, how much of a head start that gave him. It's kept him afloat even though, of all current pop superstars, he is the least present, the one still dining out on marginal benefits from old work.
Maybe that's why, if Mr. Timberlake is trying to communicate anything about his music, it's a certain groundedness. On the Grammys, and also on ''Saturday Night Live,'' he performed with a band set up behind podiums emblazoned with JT & The Tennessee Kids, a visual nod to swing bands and a gimmick that lands on the blue-eyed soul spectrum somewhere between throwback fetishist Mayer Hawthorne and earnest cheese ball Robin Thicke.
Until now Mr. Timberlake was rarely measured on that scale. He avoided those sorts of comparisons almost wholly thanks to the sui generis breakthrough of his debut album, ''Justified,'' from 2002, which introduced him as confident, randy, and just a touch sinister and wounded. That album also cemented the producer Timbaland, once a revered hip-hop eccentric, as something of a modern pop savant. ''FutureSex/ LoveSounds,'' Mr. Timberlake's follow-up, aimed lower aesthetically, but was embraced more widely.
But the peak of Mr. Timberlake's vocal feeling was ''Gone,'' the 2001 'NSync song that effectively served as his solo coming-out party, and which highlighted his pained yelp. Yet over the years that's been sandpapered to a more restrained move, all but free of anguish or ecstasy. ''Mirrors,'' the most nakedly emotional song on the new album -- seemingly written for his wife, Jessica Biel -- also perplexingly features the most vocal processing, burying Mr. Timberlake and his heart.
To show too much feeling would be to risk alienating people, and one of Mr. Timberlake's signatures is his accessibility. He's not common, but he's relatable, and never condescending. He gets a tremendous amount of mileage just for being a cool guy who's willing to hang out with regular folk.
During his ''Saturday Night Live'' performance of ''Suit & Tie'' he took a mild swipe at Kanye West, who'd recently targeted that song in one of his ceremonial mid-show rants. But just two days later, on ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,'' he quickly retreated, smile beaming. Mr. Timberlake wouldn't rock a baby bassinet.
He just wants to entertain. On ''Saturday Night Live'' recently he put his musical gifts to wide use, impersonating Elton John eulogizing Hugo Chvez in song, reprising his partnership with Andy Samberg as sensual early-'90s white R&B goons for a dating show sketch, and dressed up as a piece of tofu, hawking a vegan restaurant by singing health-friendly versions of Chic's ''Le Freak,'' Trinidad James's ''All Gold Everything'' and more.
He sounded more at home and vocally present in those moments than when singing his new songs, or almost anywhere on ''The 20/20 Experience.'' Forget the album; go see the show, or whatever else Mr. Timberlake applies his talents to. He's learned how to be a musician who has no need to make records, the perfect solution to the modern economy.

HEADLINE: A Tough Road for Charter Proposal

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
When Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, told Texas lawmakers recently to ''go big or go home'' on education reform, the Senate education chairman, Dan Patrick, had already embraced that advice.
In his new role, Mr. Patrick, a Houston Republican, has championed the policies -- robust virtual learning, unrestricted charter-school growth and private-school vouchers -- advanced by national reformers like Mr. Bush.
Conservative, business-friendly Texas, where Republicans have controlled the House and Senate since 2003, would appear to be fertile ground for a philosophy based on the belief that low regulation and high competition encourage innovation. But in the state that gave birth to the accountability movement embodied by the No Child Left Behind law, other key policies linked to that philosophy have struggled to take root.
Senate Bill 2, the centerpiece of Mr. Patrick's plans for the session, is the most ambitious attempt to expand the state's charter school system since it was established in 1995. To succeed, it will have to pass a Legislature that defeated more modest proposals just two years ago. 
The graveyard for such measures has typically been the State House, whose 150 members represent much smaller districts than the 31 state senators. That means the influence of local power players can override party politics -- particularly in rural areas where those players are often school boards and superintendents, two groups that have had tense relationships with charters, which are publicly financed but privately operated.
''In Texas, it's often the interests of rural, the interests of urban, the interests of suburban. In other states, it might be two factions instead of three,'' said Rob Eissler, Republican of The Woodlands, a former House Public Education Committee chairman who now works as a lobbyist. ''The Legislature has a strong hand, but that hand could be tied when you have seemingly similar but different goals.''
That dynamic threatens to materialize again. The chairman of the House Education Committee, Representative Jimmie Don Aycock, Republican of Killeen, has said he favors a more limited approach. ''Senator Patrick and I have had conversations about it, and he knows I'm not comfortable with that large a jump,'' Mr. Aycock said. ''That reflects the nature of the committee, if I am reading the committee right, and I think the House as a whole.'' Mr. Patrick's proposal would eliminate a law that caps the number of contracts the state can grant charter operators at 215 and would create an oversight board to handle the approval process. It would also provide an allotment for state-facilities financing and require that school districts offer to sell or lease underutilized classrooms and other facilities to charters.
Mr. Patrick has said that the authorizing board, whose members would be appointed by state leaders, including the governor, lieutenant governor and education commissioner, is needed to ensure that only high-quality schools make it through the process. It would operate on a budget of $2 million a year.
A new layer of state government may be another tough sell for the considerable number of legislators elected on their fiscal conservative bona fides -- a quandary that Senator John Whitmire, Democrat of Houston, recently mentioned in a hearing when he asked how the measure squared with the ''less government'' philosophy that Mr. Patrick typically espoused.
The legislation has also drawn objections from superintendents and school board members, who argue that in a time of limited resources, charter schools, which serve only 3 percent of the public school population, should not receive additional state financing -- and that before looking to expand charters, the state should move to shut down the poorly performing schools. Charter schools started by traditional school districts and universities do not count toward the cap, nor do the additional campuses of a single charter operator.
In 2011, a bill from Mr. Patrick that would have increased the charter contracts the state could offer by 10 a year, as well as measures addressing the facilities shortage, were part of a slate of legislation that failed.
Despite past difficulties, there may be room for compromise. Mr. Aycock said that he would favor a ''reasonable'' increase in the number of charter school contracts available with proper oversight.
Mr. Patrick, who did not respond to requests for comment, is expected to offer a committee substitute for his legislation at a Tuesday hearing. On Friday, an aide said the details of that proposal were still being worked out.
There is also renewed energy from outside groups to tackle the issue during the current legislative session, with an easing of the economic pressures that caused lawmakers to eliminate $5.4 billion from public education in 2011, and a turnover in state education leadership.
Two new organizations, with the backing of political and financial heavyweights in the state, have emerged to aid Mr. Patrick's efforts. His predecessor at the helm of the Senate Education Committee, former Senator Florence Shapiro, has joined the newly founded Texans for Education Reform, an advocacy group whose board also includes Richard Weekley, who leads a powerful tort reform organization, and Rod Paige, the former United States secretary of education. In January, Mr. Patrick announced the formation of Texans Deserve Great Schools, a nonprofit coalition that includes the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, which has invested millions in Houston and Louisiana charter schools, and the San Antonio-based Brackenridge Foundation, which is part of a $50 million campaign to bring more charters to the city.
For the Houston-based Arnold Foundation, which according to 2011 tax records has roughly $834 million in assets, a new oversight board and unlimited charter school contracts are close to a prerequisite for any more investment in Texas, said Caprice Young, the foundation's vice president for education and a spokeswoman for Texans Deserve Great Schools.
''We want to make sure that when we do make contributions, that money is going to be used well and lead to the creation of high-quality schools,'' she said.
Ms. Young said she believed the state had not strengthened its charter-school laws sooner because the high-quality charter operators in the state were only now encountering barriers posed by the cap on contracts and lack of facilities financing.
''I just think that the charter school movement hasn't demanded it in Texas,'' she said, referring to the reforms in Mr. Patrick's legislation.In the past decade, charter school enrollment has increased steadily to about 155,000 students at about 500 different campuses. After the latest round of approvals in 2012, only 6 charter contracts remain of the 215 available. An estimated 101,000 students are on waiting lists for the schools, though there are questions about whether that number adequately accounts for students on waiting lists for multiple schools.
While acknowledging the challenges posed in part by what she called the state's ''not-invented-here mentality'' that has at times caused suspicion of policies reflecting best practices elsewhere, Ms. Young said that she remained encouraged by the depth of lawmakers' engagement. ''In an awful lot of states, charters can't get a hearing at all,'' she said, ''In Texas, we kind of have a high-class problem in a sense, because we are talking about how are we going to create high-quality charter schools.''

HEADLINE: Diverting Your Dollars From the Purpose They're Meant to Serve

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Some people will do anything to stay away from tax bills and budget cuts.
Look at the Texas Legislature, which is on track to divert nearly $5 billion raised for specific programs to accounts where it balances spending in the two-year general budget. Legislators tell voters they are collecting taxes and fees to pay for pleasant-sounding programs like criminal justice planning, fugitive apprehension, clean air, artificial reefs, 911 emergency services and trauma care, to name a few.
Then they leave some or all of the money collected for those programs in account balances that, for accounting purposes, can be counted against general spending to balance the budget. 
Most taxes go from your pocket into general accounts that can be used for anything in the state budget. The dedicated funds are supposed to be used only for their intended purpose, if they are used at all. That last phrase -- ''if they are used at all'' -- is the part where the budget magicians do their work.
Money that is not used -- unspent balances in state accounts -- offsets overspending in other accounts. It doesn't matter to the counters whether the unspent money is dedicated to something or not.
There is a perfectly understandable reason for the diversions: they have closed gaps in the state budget that would otherwise have to be closed with new money or less spending, with tax increases or budget cuts.
People hate that stuff, and have not exactly stormed the Capitol to stop diversions and budget tricks and the sorts of things many of us have used, from time to time, to make our checkbooks balance.
Still, some people do mind. Senator Kirk Watson, Democrat of Austin (of which he is also a former mayor), minds. And after several years of talking about it, he has company on both sides of the aisle. It turns out that transparency is popular with Republicans and Democrats.
''We've got to get some more transparency,'' Mr. Watson said. ''Everybody recognizes this is not an honest way to budget. If you're going to collect a tax and not use it for that purpose, quit collecting the tax.''
It looks especially dishonest if the programs that are supposed to be supported by dedicated income go wanting. The state has been starving state parks for years, all the while collecting money specifically to keep those parks flourishing.
The state comptroller expects the fiscal year to end with $39.8 million sitting unused in one parks account, and $37.7 million in another.
''The folks in the 911 area would tell you the same thing,'' Mr. Watson said. ''Or the emission reductions program -- we fixed that? We can divert the money?''
One aspect of the comptroller's report on dedicated revenue is how well the various funds are named. Who would be against a fund for coastal protection, or oil-field cleanup, or breath alcohol testing, or college tuition loans?
The names, and the overall size of the diversions, could be the impetus for reform. It is a lot of money, rising from $4 billion, at the beginning of the current two-year budget to $4.9 billion forecast for the end. And those programs -- each with a constituency that probably helped get the money dedicated in the first place -- have advocates who would like to see the original purpose served.
The economy is better, too, and might bring the state enough new income to wean itself off the diversions now in place.
Some lawmakers want to limit diversions in the future. Mr. Watson wants to cut them out altogether, but even he would leave an exception, allowing the Legislature to divert funds from programs, one by one, in recorded votes.
Mr. Watson called diversions a ''grossly political'' way out of a budget pinch. ''Nobody wants to be for raising taxes, but everybody wants to be for giving the public whatever they want,'' he said.
Others have picked up on this. One piece of legislation would allow diversions up to what is now in place, but no more. Another would order a study by the Legislative Budget Board.
''I don't think people ought to be let up just because they're saying the right things,'' Mr. Watson said. ''I really worry that we're not going to be candid about how big a problem this is.''
Thanks to the comptroller's report, we know exactly how big it is: $4,949,031,180.

HEADLINE: A Profession With an Egalitarian Core

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
ECONOMICS is sometimes associated with the study and defense of selfishness and material inequality, but it has an egalitarian and civil libertarian core that should be celebrated. And that core may guide us in some surprising directions.
Economic analysis is itself value-free, but in practice it encourages a cosmopolitan interest in natural equality. Many economic models, of course, assume that all individuals are motivated by rational self-interest or some variant thereof; even the so-called behavioral theories tweak only the fringes of a basically common, rational understanding of people. The crucial implication is this: If you treat all individuals as fundamentally the same in your theoretical constructs, it would be odd to insist that the law should suddenly start treating them differently. 
At least since the 19th century, the interest of economists in personal liberty can be easily documented. In 1829, all 15 economists who held seats in the British Parliament voted to allow Roman Catholics as members. In 1858, the 13 economists in Parliament voted unanimously to extend full civil rights to Jews. (While both measures were approved, they were controversial among many non-economist members.) For many years leading up to the various abolitions of slavery, economists were generally critics of slavery and advocates of people's natural equality, as documented by David M. Levy, professor of economics at George Mason University, and Sandra J. Peart, dean of the Jepson School of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond, in ''The 'Vanity of the Philosopher': From Equality to Hierarchy in Post-Classical Economics.''
Professors Levy and Peart coined the phrase ''analytical egalitarianism'' to describe the underpinnings of this tradition. For example, Adam Smith cited birth and fortune, as opposed to intrinsically different capabilities, as the primary reasons for differences in social rank. And the classical economists Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill promoted equal legal and institutional rights for women long before such views were fashionable. Their utilitarian moral theories placed individuals on a par in the social calculus by asking about the greatest good for the greatest number.
Bentham and Mill didn't support personal liberty in every instance -- Mill was a proud imperialist when it came to India, and Bentham's idea for a Panopticon prison was a model of state-sponsored surveillance. But they prepared the way for dissecting the prevailing defenses of hierarchy and injustice.
More recently, a tradition from University of Chicago economists asserts that deep down, all human beings have the same desires, even though they may face different circumstances and incentives. Gary Becker, the Nobel laureate who is one of the founders of this approach, used the economic method to lay bare the selfish motives behind racial and ethnic discrimination. And the recent Republican amicus brief endorsing gay marriage carried the signatures of two renowned economists, Harvey S. Rosen of Princeton and N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard. (Mr. Mankiw is a regular contributor to this column.)
Often, economists spend their energies squabbling with one another, but arguably the more important contrast is between our broadly liberal economic worldview and the various alternatives -- common around the globe -- that postulate natural hierarchies of religion, ethnicity, caste and gender, often enforced by law and strict custom. Economists too often forget that we are part of this broader battle of ideas, and that we are winning some enduring victories.
So where will a cosmopolitan perspective take us today?
One enormous issue is international migration. A distressingly large portion of the debate in many countries analyzes the effects of higher immigration on domestic citizens alone and seeks to restrict immigration to protect a national culture or existing economic interests. The obvious but too-often-underemphasized reality is that immigration is a significant gain for most people who move to a new country.
Michael Clemens, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, quantified these gains in a 2011 paper, ''Economics and Emigration: Trillion-Dollar Bills on the Sidewalk?'' He found that unrestricted immigration could create tens of trillions of dollars in economic value, as captured by the migrants themselves in the form of higher wages in their new countries and by those who hire the migrants or consume the products of their labor. For a profession concerned with precision, it is remarkable how infrequently we economists talk about those rather large numbers.
Truly open borders might prove unworkable, especially in countries with welfare states, and kill the goose laying the proverbial golden eggs; in this regard Mr. Clemens's analysis may require some modification. Still, we should be obsessing over how many of those trillions can actually be realized.
IN any case, there is an overriding moral issue. Imagine that it is your professional duty to report a cost-benefit analysis of liberalizing immigration policy. You wouldn't dream of producing a study that counted ''men only'' or ''whites only,'' at least not without specific, clearly stated reasons for dividing the data.
So why report cost-benefit results only for United States citizens or residents, as is sometimes done in analyses of both international trade and migration? The nation-state is a good practical institution, but it does not provide the final moral delineation of which people count and which do not. So commentators on trade and immigration should stress the cosmopolitan perspective, knowing that the practical imperatives of the nation-state will not be underrepresented in the ensuing debate.
Economics evolved as a more moral and more egalitarian approach to policy than prevailed in its surrounding milieu. Let's cherish and extend that heritage. The real contributions of economics to human welfare might turn out to be very different from what most people -- even most economists -- expect.

HEADLINE: 2 Years Late, Zimbabwe Votes on New Constitution

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Batsi Munyaka, 27, an unemployed mechanic, had not read the document that could govern his nation for decades to come. But he said he was tired of trying to cobble together a living with little ventures that did not add up to much, and he hoped that a new Constitution, whatever its provisions, could help get Zimbabwe's economy on track.
''I have the right to vote, and maybe it can make a change in our country,'' he said with a shrug. 
More than two years late -- and in far smaller and less enthusiastic numbers than their leaders had hoped for -- Zimbabweans went to the polls on Saturday to vote in a referendum on a new Constitution, a crucial step toward holding presidential elections this year.
The document was the product of endless months of tortured negotiations between ZANU-PF, the party of the longtime president, Robert Mugabe, and the two factions of the rival Movement for Democratic Change.
The results of the vote are expected within five days, one of the last steps in the long process intended to set Zimbabwe back on the path of normalcy. That route was laid out after the disastrous 2008 presidential election, in which the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, won the most votes but then refused to participate in a runoff after his supporters endured a violent onslaught by Mugabe loyalists.
Eventually, regional leaders brokered an agreement in which Mr. Mugabe would share power with Mr. Tsvangirai as part of a transitional government that would overhaul the country's brutal and deeply politicized security services, stabilize its bottomed-out economy and write a new Constitution as a prelude to fresh elections. It was supposed to take 18 months, but the process has dragged on for four years. Switching to the United States dollar has arrested the hyperinflation that crippled the economy, but the country's security forces remain unchanged and firmly in the grips of Mr. Mugabe and his allies.
The new Constitution was meant to help resolve some of the festering problems that have kept Zimbabwe, once one of Africa's most stable and prosperous nations, mired in crisis.
Opposition parties had initially wanted a less powerful presidency, more power for provincial and local officials, and a strengthening of the rule of law. Mr. Mugabe's all-encompassing power, they argued, had allowed him to lead Zimbabwe into chaos by seizing land, stacking the courts with his allies and making disastrous economic policy with the stroke of a pen.
In the new Constitution, the president's power to rule by decree is curtailed, and the document bolsters the bill of rights by banning cruel punishments and torture. But critics say the draft retains many of the president's powers and does not do enough to increase oversight.
''This will create one monster who will determine the future of this country,'' said Job Sikhala, leader of a breakaway faction of the Movement for Democratic Change known as M.D.C.-99, who urged people to vote against the new Constitution. ''Is that what we fought for?''
Top officials of Mr. Mugabe's party, ZANU-PF, campaigned hard for a ''yes'' vote, seeing the approval of the Constitution as the fastest way to get to presidential elections, which are supposed to be held later this year.
Simon K. Moyo, a senior party leader, said in an interview that the draft had emerged from a public process and reflected the will of Zimbabweans.
''This is the people's Constitution,'' Mr. Moyo said. ''The people have given this Constitution. So why would they vote against themselves?''
The main faction of the Movement for Democratic Change is also supporting the new Constitution, arguing that it reflects the best bargain that could be won at this stage.
''It is the M.D.C. that single-handedly forced Mr. Mugabe to come to the negotiating table, kicking and screaming, to agree to the new draft Constitution,'' Mr. Tsvangirai, who has been serving as prime minister, said at a rally in Bulawayo on Thursday. ''That is why you must all vote yes.''
Lovemore Madhuku, a leader of the National Constitutional Assembly, a civic group that urged people to vote against the Constitution, said the document represented a compromise between political enemies, not an expression of how Zimbabwe's people wish to be governed.
''A democratic constitution must come from a democratic process that must be dominated by the wishes of the people,'' Mr. Madhuku said. ''Almost every Zimbabwean accepts that the process was not a good process.''
The initial draft of the Constitution was shaped by public meetings and outreach to Zimbabweans, as required by the agreement that created the power-sharing government. But ZANU-PF objected to many of its provisions, and several messy rounds of bargaining produced a very different final draft.
''Two political parties agreed to rubber-stamp a conglomeration of their own ideas into national law so that they go for elections,'' said an editorial in News Day, an independent newspaper. ''There is absolutely no doubt that most Zimbabweans that are voting today are doing so blindly.''
The new Constitution limits the president to two terms, a crucial provision given that Mr. Mugabe, 89, has ruled Zimbabwe since its independence in 1980. But Mr. Mugabe's previous terms will not count, so he is free to run twice more. The new charter also increases the size of Parliament, which critics say is wasteful because lawmakers get many perks but have few actual powers.
Some women's rights groups have praised the Constitution for cementing gender equality in Zimbabwe. The document also calls for the creation of a constitutional court, which would replace the Supreme Court as the highest court in the country and enforce fundamental rights.
Many voters have either not seen the new Constitution or do not really understand how it differs from the old one.
''I don't know much about it, to be honest,'' said Tanatswa Zimunya as a friend braided her hair in a busy market in the township of Warren Park, at the edge of Harare, the capital. ''I will vote yes anyway.''
Given the disputed election in 2008, in which hundreds of people died in bloody crackdowns on opposition supporters, Ms. Zimunya said she was simply happy that the main political parties had finally agreed on a Constitution.
''Whatever they decide is O.K.,'' she said. ''We need peace. We cannot have violence.''

Christopher Buckley's latest book is the novel ''They Eat Puppies, Don't They?''

 BODY:
MIMIBy Lucy Ellmann
342 pp. Bloomsbury. Paper, $16.
Lucy Ellmann's sixth novel, ''Mimi,'' starts off promisingly, and there are passages that mark her as a talented and erudite writer. But that Ellmann appears to share a word processor with another Lucy Ellmann, who insists on aggressively cloying tics: exclamation marks, Capital Letters and italics. She deploys these mannerisms with such remorseless, in-your-face frequency that the reader is left wondering whether Ellmann is attempting some elusive gestalt. Elusive, that is, unless gestalt also means ''self-indulgent'' in German.
There are more exclamation marks in here than there are stalks of wheat in Indiana!; more Capital Lettering than in the whole of A. A. Milne; more italics than in the whole of Italy! let me be blunt: this is annoying!!!
Then there is the novel's premise -- or conceit, or message, or ideological proposal -- namely that men are universally and fundamentally evil and that women are universally and fundamentally good. 
We could talk about it. I like a good argument myself. But a novel that reads in too many parts like a bar rant, and not an especially interesting bar rant, isn't likely to convince many fence straddlers. Even the most earnest, moussed metrosexual might be tempted to grab a hunting rifle and head for the woods after one of the rants here. But leaving aside the question of what audience Ellmann is aiming for, surely equating such male inventions as poison gas and leaf-blowing machines is not only over the top but embarrassing. Auschwitz and the burbs are in very different time zones. This book is a mess.
Or . . . is the joke on me? Let's stipulate: satire should be deadpan. Many thought Jonathan Swift was being serious in his ''Modest Proposal'' when he advocated that the Irish poor sell their children to the landowners as food. But as we know -- duh -- he was illuminating the monstrous economics of Irish poverty by the ancient rhetorical device of reductio ad absurdum. Ridicule as argumentative accelerant. The catch is you have to be Jonathan Swift to pull it off.
The plot: a successful but feckless New York plastic surgeon named Harrison Hanafan leaves his Martha Stewart-like girlfriend for Mimi, a potty-mouthed, crunchy, slogan-spouting, man-eating, nymphomaniacal Iron Woman. Physically, she resembles the stout, bare-breasted ''Liberty'' lady in Delacroix's painting. Love ensues, amid hot flashes. Mimi is going through menopause, which appears to be the omphalos of her sour, militant philosophical outlook.
Harrison is smitten -- poor beast, as Lady Julia Flyte said of her brother Bridey after he succumbed to the widow Muspratt -- not only by Mimi's voluptuous carnality and voracious sexual appetite, but also by her mind, a fecund organ that produces endless -- and I do mean endless -- aperus and apothegms. As narrator, Harrison provides these copiously, often in the form of lists, as though he were compiling the Wit and Wisdom of Mimi.
''Mimi on the Hadron Collider . . . : 'Who needs a big machine to recreate the chaos at the beginning of the universe? Chaos we got!' ''
''Mimi on Cormac McCarthy: 'He writes about cowboys and the apocalypse. Enough said.' ''
''Mimi on 'La Bohme': 'It's a multiple orgasm in musical form!' ''
And, in a show-stopping insight,
''Mimi on fans: 'It's cheap, lightweight, handy technology, and it works! All thanks to the wind-chill factor.' ''
Who can resist a girl who comes up with bons mots like those? Mimi also has an elaborate theory on the symbology of the vulva, but I'll let you read that for yourself.
Harrison soon realizes the error of his ways -- not only that a life overly spent on boob jobs and penis enlargements is ontologically hollow, but also that human history is little more than a record of crimes by men against women.
This enlightenment is not to be mistaken for misanthropy, which of course means hatred of mankind. The apt term here, which oddly is not deployed in the book, is misandry: hatred of men. (I had to look it up myself.) Boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy . . . not to spoil it for you, but there's a happy ending, depending on your definition of happy. Mine was coming across the words ''The End.''
But wait -- there's more! Sixty-nine pages more, including an appendix; recipes for the dishes described in the book (Nora Ephron is surely spinning in her grave); a photocopy of what appears to be an actual New York City vegetarian restaurant takeout menu; song lyrics, quite a few, including those to ''She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain''; a six-page, minutely detailed catalog to an exhibition of works by Harrison's sister, a sculptor, including the precise measurements in inches of all the works; a miscellany of quotations on such themes as patrilineality, menstrual taboos and ''male nuttiness''; a four-page, small-type list of recent headlines about male crimes and affronts against women (Mel Gibson is in there; oddly, that idiot congressman whose views on ''legitimate rape'' got such a good airing doesn't even merit a dishonorable mention); the ''Manifesto of the Odalisque Revolution'' (predicated on the philosophically daring premise that ''life is about pleasure'').
Hold on, there's MORE: four pages of an alphabetized list of nouns and verbs of mysterious relevance to the novel, from Asperger's to zoot suits; a two-page typology of the varieties of male terrorism (''Men who criticize women are terrorists''; ''Men who ignore women are terrorists''); along with the aforementioned postulated equivalency between Zyklon B gas and leaf-blowing machines; as well as historical factoids asserting that women invented the wheel and made the first cave paintings. Who knew?
When, toward the end of the Odalisque manifesto, Harrison writes, ''Enough guff, enough rebuff,'' my heart leapt, not only in agreement, but in elation at a light at the end of the tunnel. But no, to make my happiness complete, there was more:
''Mayhem isn't amusing anymore; we're all sick of slaughter.'' O.K., O.K., no more slaughter, promise. ''Gift Tax is an impediment if you are handing money over to your wife. This will be taxable.'' (Actually, Harrison, this is incorrect: monies flowing between spouses is a nontaxable event. But whatever.) The manifesto then declares that the United Nations must be ''the only body entitled to use force, and then only in direct relation to the procurement of peace.'' Yeah, that works.
Finally -- a word I cherish in the present context -- we get a three-page Certificate of Membership in the Odalisque Revolution. (Caution: reading this book may permanently put you off Ingres, Boucher, Goya, et al.) And acknowledgments that run to five pages in minuscule type and list, inter alia, Woody Allen, W. H. Auden, Joseph Campbell (aha!), Pablo Casals, Johnny Cash, Muammar Qaddafi, Mae West ''and others.''
The numerous Ellmanns listed therein remind us that Ellmann is the daughter of Richard Ellmann, distinguished biographer of Yeats, Joyce and Wilde, a lustrous pedigree indeed. The list of human acknowledgees is followed by a feline category -- sorry: another of Ellmann's tics is incessant bad puns, and it seems to have rubbed off -- of a dozen-odd ''Cats that have helped me.''
Is this book really that bad? Again, the joke may be on me, if Ellmann -- rather, Harrison and Mimi -- are swinging for the Swiftian fence. (The oldest fallacy of all is to attribute characters' views to their creator.) There are some fine passages, and a truly poignant and moving chapter set in Canterbury, England, where Harrison is beset by tragedy. In those, we observe a sharp intelligence and a humane soul at work. But Swift's ''Modest Proposal'' is a pamphlet that runs to about 24 pages, and 342 pages make for rather a lot of reductio ad absurdum.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: As the U.S. Reacts to North Korea's Threats

 BODY:
Readers discuss whether military defense and deterrence or diplomacy is most effective.
To the Editor:
In the last few months, North Korea has tested a more powerful nuclear weapon and a three-stage rocket that could reach targets on the West Coast. As the country works to combine these technologies into a long-range nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile, the United States should be taking concrete steps to better protect its citizens.
Our most important protection against Pyongyang's bomb is the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense missile defense network. Interceptors in Alaska and California have proved they can stop an incoming ICBM with eight successful test kills, leading the White House to declare that we are now ''capable of defending against any North Korean ballistic missile attack.'' But we must continue to improve radars and expand our interceptor fleet to handle larger-scale raid attacks.
Missile defense has broad bipartisan support; President Obama praised the system in his State of the Union address, and Congress has voted to study expanding it to the East Coast, which was recently recommended by the National Academies of Science. But missile defense doesn't need cheerleaders; it needs funding. 
The administration's proposal to cut our total nuclear forces in hopes of persuading other nations to do the same is a bad idea. Nothing is going to persuade North Korea to give up its hard-earned nukes, nor can we prevent it from transferring nuclear weapons technology to Iran. We need a strong deterrent to convince Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, that there's no upside to attack and to assure our allies that they need not seek out nuclear weapons of their own. We can't stop Kim Jong-un from building a nuclear bomb; let's not give up the tools to stop him from using one.
JAMES A. LYONS Jr. Warrenton, Va., March 11, 2013
The writer, a retired Navy admiral, was commander of the Pacific Fleet from 1985 to 1987.
Readers React
Admiral Lyons is a strident voice of the military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us about many years ago. By vastly exaggerating North Korea's current missile capabilities, he has become part of the overall demonization of North Korea and its leaders that has kept us from talking to them seriously and patiently as we did with South Korea when it developed a secret nuclear program 40 years ago.
North Korea says it no longer validates the 60-year-old armistice that ended the fighting in the Korean War but has never brought peace. Pyongyang wants a peace treaty with us, and to achieve that we need to talk to the North Korean government, something that Admiral Lyons apparently does not consider a worthy tactic.
He seems to prefer that we keep mute and spend additional billions on missile defense while North Korea becomes a full-blown nuclear power, which could trigger similar programs in South Korea and Japan.
DONALD P. GREGG Armonk, N.Y., March 14, 2013
The writer was United States ambassador to South Korea from 1989 to 1993.
One of Admiral Lyons's key assertions is: ''The administration's proposal to cut our total nuclear forces in hopes of persuading other nations to do the same is a bad idea.'' It is not. Neither North Korea nor Iran has anything to gain by launching nuclear attacks on any country. A nuclear assault by North Korea on South Korea and the United States and by Iran on Israel would be catastrophic globally.
If President Obama's aim is to initiate nuclear disarmament negotiations with other nuclear-armed countries, he should say so publicly. His next step should be an open declaration that the United States will not attack either North Korea or Iran if not threatened with a nuclear attack, and that America will assist both countries economically if they give up their nuclear ambitions.
K. NARAYAN KUTTY Mansfield Center, Conn., March 13, 2013
Protecting our country from missile attacks by rogue governments is a no-brainer. What is so surprising to me is the failure of this administration to pre-empt the horrible prospect of a nuclear Iran, with the capability to develop and acquire (from North Korea) the means to threaten Europe, destroy Israel and perhaps reach the United States (certainly our military bases).
Regardless of the political fallout and the censure of other countries -- who would secretly applaud the action -- the United States should collaborate with Israel and destroy the potential bomb-making sites in Iran once and for all. The Israelis have demonstrated in Iraq and Syria that sites associated with nuclear or chemical weapons can be destroyed with minimal, transient political fallout.
Not to worry about the North Koreans. Bluff and bluster are the tools of an adolescent ruler, puffing out his chest for a restless country whose citizens are fully aware of the failings of many decades of totalitarian rule. They just have to look south to see the differences. It's the Iranian government that we need to worry about.
HOWARD L. TANENBAUM Albany, March 13, 2013
The problem with Admiral Lyons's argument for deterring North Korea is that it is focused solely on a military response. Missile defense is certainly needed, considering North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile testing, yet diplomacy would be far more prudent in restraining such a country.
The real effort should be in pressuring China, North Korea's primary sponsor, to make it very clear that its bellicose comments and aggressive actions will not be tolerated. China has to be made aware that any military conflict on the Korean Peninsula will have a direct effect on its economic well-being.
LARRY HOFFNER New York, March 13, 2013
Attempts to pacify North Korea with bribes (such as food aid) have just given its government time to develop nuclear weapons and destabilize Asia and the world. There is a time for dialogue and there is a time for strength. We cannot reason with the Kim dynasty of Pyongyang.
MICHAEL FOSTER New York, March 13, 2013
The writer is a former professor at Korea University in Seoul.
Admiral Lyons appears to have a distinctly cold-war attitude about nuclear proliferation and our efforts to deter nuclear threats. The delivery vehicles and warheads that we now have in our operational strategic force number in the thousands. The key would appear to be strategic placement of our nuclear arsenal, so I see nothing wrong with cutting our nuclear forces in an attempt at persuasion.
And the idea of adding to the missile defense system is another outdated position. As the admiral says, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense missile defense network, with interceptors in Alaska and California, is a suitable deterrent to North Korea's potential threat.
In my opinion, the real nuclear threat going forward will not be missiles, but smaller delivery systems smuggled across our borders or delivered through our porous port system.
Let's update the definition of deterrence.
BILL MAGINNIS North Wales, Pa., March 13, 2013
The Writer Responds
Diplomacy with Pyongyang does not have a promising track record. In the past, the United States has offered financial incentives to North Korea (as suggested by Mr. Kutty) and implored China to put pressure on Pyongyang (recommended by Mr. Hoffner). These efforts have failed to halt the country's nuclear weapons or ballistic missile programs.
The United States should still make every effort to negotiate, as former Ambassador Gregg suggests. But when the schoolyard bully cocks his fist, you don't drop your guard. As then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told Congress, diplomatic efforts and ''strong support of missile defense'' go hand in hand.
I agree with Mr. Maginnis that we must tighten border and port security. But North Korea's explicit threat was to pre-emptively ''shell'' Washington, D.C. Missile defense provides the only real protection against that. And I reject his view that we should stand pat on our current defensive capabilities.
North Korea will grow and innovate its nuclear arsenal. The Obama administration on Friday wisely proposed increasing our operational interceptors. We must also continue to test the system against emerging countermeasures and install an East Coast interceptor base to face the Iranian threat noted by Mr. Tanenbaum.
We must also modernize our nuclear deterrent, ensuring that it is redundant, resilient against pre-emptive strikes and large enough to protect troops and allies worldwide -- not just in the Asia-Pacific region. The big stick of American nuclear might has helped forestall a hot nuclear conflict since the cold war. Cutting it now could invite dangerous acts of aggression, just as when overly permissive diplomacy led Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait.
As the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., recently testified, few know exactly what Kim Jong-un would do to prop up his regime.

HEADLINE: Bottle Bing

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
The Outer Coastal Plain might be the perfect place to make fine wine in America. The region, which has nearly the same sandy soil composition as Bordeaux, experiences a warm growing season; spring frosts are rare; and the breezes from the Atlantic Ocean and a local bay are ideal for winemaking. The O.C.P. has only one real challenge: it's in southern New Jersey, a state associated with many things -- Springsteen, Snooki, industrial pollution, the mob -- but not great wine. Much of what is bottled there, in fact, isn't even grape-based.
Louis Caracciolo, a vintner in Atco, N.J., just down the road from the Camden County Airport, is trying to change this reputation. Caracciolo, who refers to himself as Johnny Grapeseed, has spent a considerable amount of time promoting the notion that New Jersey may yet become an internationally recognized wine capital. It's a long process but not without precedent. Caracciolo started making wine there in 1976, the same year as the famous blind tasting in which a bottle of Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon scored higher than several from the finest wineries in France, like Chteau Mouton-Rothschild and Chteau Haut-Brion. The Judgment of Paris, as it became known, transformed the reputation of the California wine business and helped build it into a $20-billion-a-year industry. 
New Jersey's wine industry currently generates about $35 million a year, but Caracciolo has large ambitions. A trained food scientist, he has learned that while merlot grapes have a rough time with his region's cold winters, cabernet franc does remarkably well. He has visited wineries in Bordeaux and Burgundy and even consulted with winemakers at Chteau Margaux on his method of cleaning old barrels. A few years ago, he also reached out to George Taber, the respected wine journalist and author of ''The Judgment of Paris.'' Taber, who lived in New Jersey for 25 years, knew the state had a tradition of ''mass production of rotgut,'' but he was impressed by the wines at Caracciolo's Amalthea Cellars. Last year, Taber helped organize the so-called Judgment of Princeton, in which a panel of respected wine critics, including two from France, compared New Jersey wines with some of the best French ones in a blind tasting. Shockingly, the results showed a near tie. Several Garden State vineyards -- Heritage, Tomasello, Silver Decoy and Caracciolo's Amalthea -- scored nearly as well as Mouton-Rothschild and Haut-Brion. In several cases, the Jersey wines were hundreds of dollars cheaper per bottle, too.
After reading about the Judgment of Princeton, I took a trip to the O.C.P., which forms a wide crescent around Atlantic City. I am not an expert, but I really enjoyed a number of the wines at Amalthea, like a 2010 red blend inspired by Chteau Margaux. I also visited the Tomasello Winery a few miles away. Tomasello placed fifth among reds at the Judgment of Princeton, and I especially liked its Palmaris cabernet sauvignon, which retails for $48. The vineyard owner, Charlie Tomasello, explained that his core focus these days is on the high-end market. But he also confessed that the company still makes most of its money in more traditional Jersey wines. The company has more than 40 varieties, including blueberry, cranberry, raspberry and Concord grape ($8.95 a bottle). When I arrived, the staff was preparing for a Groupon event that would bring in nearly a hundred customers the next day.
My guide on the trail, via telephone, was Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton labor economist and president of the American Association of Wine Economists, a group that sometimes seems to exist to give economists a cover to drink lots of wine. New Jersey's quality winemakers face a classic economic conundrum known as a collective-action problem. There are about 50 wineries in the state, and 10 are making great wine. The other 40 are, well . . . the nicest phrase I heard was, ''Not very good.'' To make more money and earn prestige, Ashenfelter noted, the good winemakers need to shift the attitude of tastemakers (critics, sommeliers, distributors) about New Jersey wines. But every time they improve the reputation of their state, and the prices of their wines, they create the opportunity for producers of the state's traditional sweet wines to take advantage of that improved reputation. This increases the likelihood that on-the-fence observers, unaware of which New Jersey wine to try, might sample the wrong one.
Winemaking involves a host of choices between short-term revenue and long-term reputation. To make quality wines, vineyard owners use delicate European vines that require constant tending. But to save money, vineyard owners are tempted to use heartier, but funkier, local stock. If neighbors are making these short-term, reputation-destroying choices, it's difficult to invest for the long term.
And it's tough to establish a good reputation when your success depends, to a great extent, on how your competitors behave. A few decades ago, the South African wine industry developed some remarkably good wines that most of the world had never tried because of the boycotts and sanctions over the country's racist policies. When apartheid ended, global demand instantly spiked. Liz Thach, who teaches wine marketing at Sonoma State University, told me that a small percentage of those exported wines had an ''eraser or Band-Aid'' taste caused, possibly, by the dreaded Brettanomyces yeast. And because a few wineries had poor quality control, the entire South African wine industry failed in the U.S. market. It now has less than a 1 percent share.
Collective-action problems are not impossible to overcome. Before they became leaders in electronics and cars, Japan and Korea were synonymous, in the global economy, with shoddy manufacturing. Another great success story actually comes from the French wine industry. In the mid-19th century, some French vineyards made amazing wines; others made lousy stuff. And so the French established a formal classification system that would be applied to all wineries -- a hierarchy that remains, virtually unchanged, to this day. The grand wineries didn't need to worry that an upstart could damage their reputations. (But wineries that struggled before the system went into effect were at a disadvantage, a factor that's still reflected in their prices.)
As it turns out, this is a very effective way to solve a collective-action problem. In 2009, the political economist Elinor Ostrom won a Nobel Prize for studying how nomads in Africa, farmers in Nepal and others learned to forgo individual incentives for a quick buck in favor of longer-term shared profits. Potential competitors need to trust one another, she noted, to collectively steward a shared resource -- pastures, say, or the reputation of New Jersey wines -- even though each individual could make a lot more money in the short term through reckless exploitation. The most successful groups created self-governing associations that ostracized members who failed to follow the rules. To succeed, Ostrom concluded, groups needed to balance democracy with harsh economic sanctions. After all, a French winemaker who breaks the rules cannot claim an official appellation on its label. ''They need some way to gently spank people,'' Ashenfelter says of the New Jersey winemakers.
The Outer Coastal Plain Vineyard Association was founded, in 2009, along those guidelines. For now, though, it's all carrot and no stick. ''Make your blueberry wine,'' Louis Caracciolo advises skeptics. ''Just experiment. Make two barrels of this,'' he said, pointing to his higher-quality varietals. ''I'll show you how.'' But if Ostrom and Ashenfelter are right, that might not be enough. At some point, the association will have to channel Tony Soprano. It'll have to get tough.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Surprisingly, there's a lot of great wine in New Jersey.
2. But it can be hard to find among the plonk.
3. That's not a taste problem; it's a financial one.

HEADLINE: A Few Signs of Spring Downtown

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
Late last year brokers fretted that Hurricane Sandy would stigmatize downtown Manhattan. Flood zones and generators were the talk of the town after the superstorm knocked out power to most of the island below Midtown, leaving many residents to stumble in the dark looking for water and a place to charge their cellphones.
But three months into the New Year, two downtown condo buildings shelved during the financial crisis are roaring back to life, selling units like they were the last flashlights at the convenience store after the blackout.
Since starting sales about a month ago, 150 Charles in the West Village and 56 Leonard in TriBeCa have sold at least half of their buildings, developers say -- enough that each claims to have broken some sort of sales record for a new residential development in Manhattan and maybe on Planet Earth. 
The numbers their sales teams revealed this week are truly surprising. At 150 Charles, signed contracts have exceeded $557 million in about a month. At 56 Leonard, $450 million in units have sold in three weeks.
''We have had close to 350 showings in a little over three weeks,'' Leonard Steinberg, a broker at Douglas Elliman, who along with Raphael De Niro, is selling 150 Charles, gushed during a tour of the sales center last week. ''This is a real estate dream come true.''
At 56 Leonard, Kelly Mack, president of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, said the sales team had to hire additional staff to keep up with the demand and now has three paralegals working to get contracts out the door.
The buildings buck the trend of stalled projects that were eventually sold to new developers who significantly changed the original designs. In the case of 56 Leonard and 150 Charles, the developers stubbornly held on for many years to realize their pre-crisis visions.
The buildings are quite distinctive from each other and are being built in different neighborhoods. But taken together, the huge reaction to both buildings illustrates the pent-up demand for high-end development downtown and the lack of new inventory. Many of the early buyers at the buildings are New Yorkers, including neighborhood locals who have been waiting for the projects to come off the shelf since the 2008 financial meltdown, brokers said.
Clearly any concerns about downtown's fading luster were misplaced.
Five years ago there were doubts that either building would ever grace the skyline. Both struggled to get construction loans in the wake of the financial collapse.
The 56 Leonard sales center first opened the week that Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy in September 2008. The foundation had already been poured and some $60 million worth of units had sold when the developers pulled the plug to wait for better market conditions.
The developers thought they had a winner with a slender, 60-story structure designed by the architects Herzog & de Meuron that features a distinctive sculpture by Anish Kapoor that looks like a big silver ball being squished by one corner of the building. They bought air rights from New York Law School, allowing them to construct an 821-foot building that the developers say will tower above all others in TriBeCa. Early this year they finally secured a $350 million loan from a syndicate led by Bank of America. Virtually nothing changed from the original plans other than some updates of bathroom and kitchen finishings, Ms. Mack said.
Among the more distinctive features at 56 Leonard is that no apartment balcony looks up at another balcony. The architects designed the structure with at least two floors between balconies, which will appear to dance around the building.
Herzog & de Meuron also custom-designed the interiors, including a view gallery in the middle of full-floor apartments that will allow you to see through the apartment from east to west while also providing a good deal of wall space for art collectors.
There will be 17,000 square feet of amenity spaces on the ninth and 10th floors, including a 75-foot pool, a 25-seat screening room, a private dining room and a children's playroom. The building will have seven elevators; owners will share a hallway with at most one other apartment. In a shrewd pre-Sandy move, the developers figured a generator on the ninth floor into the plans. (The building falls into flood zone B.)
There will be eight full-floor apartments at the top, ranging from 5,200 square feet to 6,400 square feet, with 14-foot to 19-foot-high ceilings.
Prices start at $4 million and go up to almost $30 million. One full-floor four-bedroom with 1,700 square feet of outdoor space is currently available for $28 million.
While the developers said they feel they designed large enough apartments to satisfy luxury buyers demanding ever-larger spaces, I wondered if they were thinking in 2005 terms -- the year the building was designed. Izak Senbahar, the president of Alexico Group, a co-developer with Hines, said that there is no formal program to combine units. ''There is enough product that people shouldn't have to play around,'' Mr. Senbahar said. ''It is not impossible, but it is not encouraged.''
So far, plenty of buyers seem willing to live with that limitation. Many of the early buyers have been on an informal waiting list for the past five years, regularly calling Ms. Mack's office to inquire about the building's status. Mr. Senbahar said more than 70 percent of the buyers are New Yorkers, including many TriBeCa residents, although he acknowledged it is tough to say for sure where the buyers hail from, since most are buying through LLCs.
At least a few have swooped in from abroad. One buyer flew from Paris for the weekend to lock in an apartment, drawn mostly by the architecture, said Yejin Berman, a sales associate.
At 150 Charles, where foundation work is almost complete, West Village residents have dominated the early sales, brokers said. Steven Witkoff, the developer, said that locals have jumped at the chance to buy in a full-service building with luxury amenities. ''We don't have any global buyers,'' he said. ''We didn't get the L.A. crowd. We didn't get the pied--terre crowd. This went to New Yorkers that wanted to live there with their families.''
Stylistically the development is very different from 56 Leonard. There will be two 16-story towers with maroon brick facades. Eighty different floor plans are being offered for the 91 apartments for purchase, a handful of which have already been designated for potential combinations.
The residences will offer custom features like linear drains in showers (so the water rushes out faster), kitchen countertops with marble mined in Alabama, and design elements like a raised medallion on the walls of the bathrooms. There will be parking for 92 vehicles, 15,000 square feet of amenities in the basement (including a 75-foot pool), and two gas-powered generators with submarine doors on top of the building, which were added to the designs after Sandy.
The development also has 10 attached town houses, ranging from $8.75 million to $12.25 million, five of which have private garages. All but two are under contract. A five-bedroom duplex penthouse, with 2,500 square feet of outdoor space, is currently available for $35 million.
The sales velocity at 150 Charles has stunned all involved and created a mad scramble to adjust to the demand. Since Feb. 12, the development has raised the price of its offering plan nine times to $785.67 million, a boost of nearly 13 percent. (56 Leonard Street has raised prices three times, by a total of 4 percent.)
Still, 150 Charles is not beloved by all its neighbors. A group of West Village residents is still fighting to stop the development, claiming the developer unlawfully tore down the original building at the site. They wanted Mr. Witkoff to construct a taller, narrower building (up to 32 stories), which he had the right to build, that would have blocked fewer views and allowed in more light. He chose instead to construct a shorter, wider building, supposedly because it was more in keeping with the character of the Village.
In December, the city denied the residents' request to revoke the building's construction permit. The residents, who include the author Jean-Louis Bourgeois, son of the late sculptor and artist Louise Bourgeois, have appealed to the city's Board of Standards and Appeals, which is still considering the case, said Barry Mallin, their attorney.
The lower-profile design includes a 60-by-100-foot courtyard. To help win approval for his preferred design, Mr. Witkoff promised to create 40,000 square feet of landscaped green space, both private spaces and ones for all residents to share.
The Elliman sales team is pitching the notion that the building will be the downtown luxury alternative to 15 Central Park West, and brokers said some owners from the vaunted Robert A. M. Stern building have toured the 150 Charles sales center.
''It is amazing how many people said, 'We moved to 15 CPW because we loved everything about it, but had always dreamed about something like it in the Village,''' Mr. Steinberg said.

 BODY:
BALLINA, Ireland -- In this removed County Mayo town at the mouth of the River Moy, the widow of a local fish merchant decided one day to share her husband's collection of Irish miscellany with the public. Better to have it on display here in his beloved Ballina, as he had always wished, than to lose it, God forbid, in a fire in the family home above the family shop, Clarke's Salmon Smokery.
The six-week job of selecting the best items for an exhibition fell to Sinead McCoole, an author and historian who came the 150 miles from Dublin. She knew that this curious fish man, Jackie Clarke, was said to have acquired a rare, original copy of the 1916 Easter Proclamation -- Ireland's Declaration of Independence -- but local collections rarely warrant the enthusiasm of their owners. Her expectations remained at low tide. 
Ms. McCoole made her way down the town's ancient commercial row to the home above the shop, where the sight of some old but unremarkable books left her wondering whether six weeks in Ballina would be a few weeks too long. But then the widow, Anne Clarke, led the skeptical scholar to her husband's ''locked room,'' for many years off limits even to family. Inside were bundles and bundles wrapped in parcel paper; fish boxes and fish boxes packed with documents; stuff, and stuff, and more stuff.
Six weeks became six months, and then a year, and then -- well, Ms. McCoole is still in Ballina nearly eight years later, still immersed in what is now known as the Jackie Clarke Collection: an astounding treasure of more than 100,000 items that provide an intimate retelling of Ireland's long struggle to free itself of English rule. Fragile maps and rare newspapers, political posters and editorial cartoons, books, diaries, photographs, films, and even a scrapbook that Clarke began as a boy.
Looking back on that summer in 2005, Ms. McCoole cannot point to any one moment of epiphany. Was it when she saw the 1916 letter from the commander of Kilmainham jail, asking a priest named Father Aloysius to visit the Easter Rebellion leader Padraic Pearse before his execution? Was it the 1910 poster advertising a talk by another rebellion leader, James Connolly, at Cavanagh's Restaurant in New York City?
Or was it the fabric flower, called a cockade, that Wolfe Tone -- Wolfe Tone! -- wore affixed to his hat when he was captured while leading a failed rebellion against the English in 1798? When Ms. McCoole showed the cockade to a scholar friend steeped in that era, the scholar began to weep.
Another scholar, Christine Kinealy, an expert on 19th-century Ireland and a professor of history at Drew University, in Madison, N.J., spent some time with the collection two years ago and remains astonished by the rural merchant's curatorial eye and command of Irish history. She was especially impressed by Clarke's respect for the roles that ordinary people -- those not named Wolfe Tone or Michael Collins -- played in that history.
''It's history from the below,'' Ms. Kinealy said. ''And for each of the major watershed moments in Irish history Jackie Clarke has amassed an amazing collection of records.''
As the collection mesmerized historians and antiquarians, and as the provenance of central items became certain, Ms. McCoole's academic skepticism gave way to what she calls ''a gradual reveal.'' The original plan had been to exhibit pieces of the collection in the town library, but local officials decided that something grander was in order, which is why, beginning in April, these artifacts will be on display in an 1882 bank building rechristened the Jackie Clarke Collection.
It is named after an acquisitive and inquisitive man who spent his life rescuing vital bits of Irish history from sliding into the dull void of the forgotten -- but who, in the months before his death, fretted that he had lost the possession he prized over all others: that 1916 Easter Proclamation.
To understand Jackie Clarke you must first understand County Mayo, in the west of Ireland. It is a landscape both inviting and forbidding, one of serene greens and rocky grays, megalithic tombs and medieval abbeys, famine roads, mystical mountains and the violent sea -- all combining to assert the lingering presence of what has come before.
''You're so close to the past all the time,'' Ms. McCoole said.
This is where, in the 17th century, the ruthless Oliver Cromwell banished the Irish families he forced from better land in the east and south. Where, at the close of the 18th century, French forces joined Irish patriots like Wolfe Tone in the valiant but ill-fated rebellion known as the Year of the French. Where, in the 19th century, the potato famine and the decades of high emigration that followed reduced the county population by two-thirds, to about 115,000. And where, in the 20th century, local people figured in rebellion, civil war and the eventual formation of a republic.
Clarke was born into this self-governing but partitioned Ireland in 1927, in the Ballina home of his prosperous parents, owners of a news shop. Early on, he burned with a need to trace and chronicle Irish history. When he was 12, for example, he wrote ''J. Clarke Scrapbook'' in a fresh notebook and began pasting in newspaper clippings of local consequence: obituaries, sports results, and, especially, events reflecting rebellion's aftershocks. His first page included an article with the headline ''Sister's Visit to Sentenced Man.''
Sent to a boarding school in Dublin, he spent his free time not at rugby matches but in the old bookshops along the quays, searching for paper pieces of Irish history. He began a correspondence with Joe Clarke, an Easter Rebellion veteran and lifelong republican -- one devoted to a united Ireland -- who guided the unrelated younger Clarke in choosing items for his growing collection.
When he was only 18, Jackie Clarke opened a fish store a few doors down from his parents' shop. Over the years it grew into a salmon smokehouse that provided the income to cover his many acquisitions and kindnesses. He bought suits for anxious emigrants bound for London and paid for bodies to be returned for burial in Irish soil. He became a town councilor (on the Irish republican ticket of Sinn Fein), a mayor, an elder of Ballina.
After a relatively brief Irish courtship of four years, he married Anne Smyth, from County Carlow, who was taken with the crisp whiteness of his fish merchant's coat. (''He looked like a doctor,'' she recalled recently.) They settled in Ballina, of course, and spent happy weekends in Galway City, perusing Mrs. Kenny's famous bookstore there for hidden gems.
Clarke never drank or smoked. Beyond selling fish and helping to raise five children, all boys, he focused his interests on All Things Irish: the Irish language, the local Irish community, and, particularly, those touchstones in Irish history that reflected the country's quest for independence. Yet he also seemed determined to collect items reflecting all sides of a debate, whether over a postal strike or a hunger strike.
The Clarke family adapted to living among the stacks of rare books and odd papers that the patriarch was accumulating through his vast network of booksellers and antiquarians. Mrs. Clarke, now 72, never fully realized the extent of her husband's ever-growing collection, partly because she was not welcome in that mysterious locked room. But she well remembers his excitement whenever a wrapped acquisition arrived by post.
''He would never open it straightaway,'' she said. Instead he'd wait until day's end, close the shop and head upstairs like a boy with a birthday package. ''He enjoyed opening the packet and seeing what was in it,'' she said. ''The cockade I remember very well.''
Not everyone does. ''I never saw it until after he died,'' said Peter Clarke, 44, the couple's youngest.
Who knew about the 1665 copy of The Oxford Gazette, considered by some historians to be the first modern newspaper? Or the trove of late-19th-century eviction notices bearing familiar Mayo surnames? Or the small notebook containing a handwritten tally of the Irish Parliament's fateful vote in 1922 on the Anglo-Irish Treaty that would keep 6 of Ireland's 32 counties under British rule? A pencil line divides the page into ''for'' and ''against,'' foreshadowing the civil war soon to come.
One of Clarke's friends, Cyril Lonergan, 86, had an inkling. Sometimes, he said, his friend Jackie was too busy to chat, saying, ''I have to get the fish out.'' Other times, though, Jackie would share a gem, as when he allowed Mr. Lonergan a glimpse of the 1916 proclamation, then rolled it up and shoved it into a corner of the locked room.
''You should have that in a bank,'' Mr. Lonergan recalled saying.
''Ah, it'll be all right,'' Clarke replied.
One day, though, Clarke could not put his hands on the proclamation. The thought of its loss, or theft, or misplacement, haunted his final days before he died, of a stroke, in 2000. He was 72.
Afterward family members scoured their home for the proclamation. ''It was in the locked room,'' Peter Clarke recalled. ''Under a few papers.''
Then along came Ms. McCoole.
A scholarly force of nature who speaks in quick, complete and ever-flowing paragraphs, Ms. McCoole had written several books -- she has expertise on the role of women in the Irish Rebellion -- and was often featured on Irish television and radio. While researching another book project in 2005, she had a chance encounter with Mrs. Clarke, which led to a long, meaningful chat over tea at Gaughan's Pub, next to the fish shop.
''My mother would say it was the Holy Spirit,'' said Ms. McCoole, 44.
Mrs. Clarke told Ms. McCoole that she dearly wanted to honor her husband's wishes to have the collection displayed. Ms. McCoole told Mrs. Clarke that the collection first needed to be itemized. Mrs. Clarke said that Ms. McCoole should be the one to do it. Ms. McCoole laughed. But Mrs. Clarke persisted.
Not long after, Ms. McCoole was hired by the Mayo County Council to the six-week summer task of making sense of the Clarke treasure -- ''forensic anthropology,'' she says. The collection was not the result of some Collyer Brothers-style hoarding, but of careful selections in the many thousands, much of it newspapers, made by a man whose system of cataloging was known only to himself.
''There were multiple collections within the collections,'' Ms. McCoole said. ''It took years to yield the secrets.''
She developed her own system. After having the material hauled down the street to a second-floor room in the Ballina library, she sat amid the mounds of history, created a semicircle of general categories, and began distributing artifacts like a card dealer at a casino.
The 1916 material here, the 1798 material there, the land wars, the war of independence, the civil wars, the hunger strike, County Mayo, Ballina, handbills, posters, Bloody Sunday, on and on. At one point she came across a newspaper page from 1997 that had been clipped and folded to emphasize a photograph of an Irish author giving a lecture in London.
That author: Herself, Sinead McCoole.
Often, as Ms. McCoole set out to begin another wearying day of academic mining, one of the fish shop's employees, Smokey Gorman, would give her a cryptic greeting: ''And you haven't even gotten to the roof yet.'' For a while she thought this meant that Mr. Gorman might have spent too much time in the smokehouse, but Mrs. Clarke eventually told her that Mr. Gorman was referring to some ''modern stuff'' that he once helped Jackie Clarke carry to a storeroom built onto the roof.
One day, with the end of her papered tunnel in sight, Ms. McCoole went to that room on the roof, where loads of bundles were wrapped in relatively recent copies of the local newspaper. Inconsequential modern stuff, she thought. But when she opened a bundle or two, she found rare political pamphlets and newspapers dating to the 17th and 18th centuries.
''Instead of being euphoric, I cried for two days,'' Ms. McCoole said. ''I cried and I cried and I cried. It was just more things to do. I knew the job hadn't ended.''
But when she recovered Ms. McCoole realized that she was immersed in something very rare and wonderful, a feeling now validated by other scholars.
After all, here were artifacts of monetary and historical value, commingled with political handbills, shop receipts and other disposable items that provide ''the material texture of the past,'' according to Luke Gibbons, a professor of Irish literary and cultural studies at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.
''It does an unusual thing: It converts history back into memory -- into a lived relationship with the past,'' Mr. Gibbons said. ''And it opens onto the byways, as well as the highways, of history.''
Vincent Virga, an American photo editor and author who spends a lot of time in Mayo, agreed. He became so taken with the visual elements of the material -- the posters, the maps, the editorial cartoons -- that he began working closely with Ms. McCoole on the collection.
''Jackie Clarke collected things that told Irish history in documents and images,'' Mr. Virga said. ''It's a visual delight.''
A few years ago Ms. McCoole, Mr. Virga and other Mayo supporters set out to create a proper home for the collection. This effort met challenges along the way, including the collapse of the Irish economy, the occasional criticisms of Clarke's lifelong republicanism, and a particularly unpleasant Clarke family feud over what to do with the collection, which has been valued in the millions. But the Mayo County Council managed to buy a landmark bank building on Pearse Street, just down from the fish shop. Then sizable grants from the European Union and the Irish government helped to pay for the transformation of that building into the Jackie Clarke Collection.
Now visitors to the building can see Wolfe Tone's cockade, or trace their ancestral home place on ancient maps, or record their memories of Mayo in a sound booth. They can step into the bank's old vault to study its only display: the 1916 Easter Proclamation, one of only three dozen or so still extant.
''My whole memory of staying was that I wanted to do right by the collection,'' Ms. McCoole said, as she wandered among rooms chockablock with artifacts. ''An Irishman's collection.''
But Ms. McCoole knows that her work continues. On the second floor of the town library, just a few steps up the street, 64 boxes wait to be sorted through. They contain more and more bits of Irish memory, captured from oblivion by a fish merchant in Ballina, beside the burbling flow of the River Moy.

HEADLINE: Reading, Writing and Video Games

BYLINE: By PAMELA PAUL. 
The features editor and children's books editor at The New York Times Book Review.

 BODY:
WHEN I was a child, I liked to play video games. On my brother's Atari, I played Night Driver. On his Apple II, I played Microwave, Aztec and Taipan! When I got to go to the arcade, I played Asteroids and Space Invaders.
Here's what I learned: At a certain level on Microwave, the music from the bar scene in Star Wars comes on. If I am at the front line when aliens descend to Earth, we'll all be in trouble. Also, dealing opium in the South China Sea is more lucrative than trading in commodities.
In short, I didn't learn much of anything. My parents didn't expect me to. I just had fun.
Today, educational technology boosters believe computer games (the classroom euphemism for video games) should be part of classroom lessons at increasingly early ages. The optimistic theory is that students wearied by the old pencil-and-paper routine will become newly enchanted with phonemic awareness when letters dressed as farm animals dance on a screen. 
Last week, GlassLab (Games, Learning and Assessment Lab) unveiled an online resource for teachers based on the role-playing game SimCity, and this fall it plans to release a version of the game specifically for classrooms. According to its Web site, GlassLab's mission, in part, is to show that ''digital games with a strong simulation component may be effective learning environments.'' At the new PlayMaker school in Los Angeles, financed in part by the Gates Foundation, a gaming curriculum includes adventure quests and other educational game apps. A 2012 report by the New Media Consortium identified ''game-based learning'' as one of the major trends affecting education in the next five years.
Meanwhile, many parents believe that games children play on home computers should edify children, improve their hand-eye coordination and inculcate higher math skills. The most popular apps in the Apple store for toddlers and preschoolers are educational. Even parents who scoff at the idea of toddlers learning from Dora gleefully boast about their 2-year-olds' having mastered basic math on Mommy's phone.
The concepts of work and play have become farcically reversed: schoolwork is meant to be superfun; play, like homework, is meant to teach. There's an underlying fear that if we don't add interactive elements to lower school curriculums, children won't be able to handle fractions or develop scientific hypotheses -- concepts children learned quite well in school before television.
In a 2012 survey of elementary and middle school teachers by Common Sense Media, 71 percent of teachers say entertainment media use has hurt students' attention spans ''a lot'' or ''somewhat.'' The findings have had no apparent effect on palpable enthusiasm for interactive teaching. When experienced teachers express skepticism about the value of computer games in school, they're often viewed as foot-draggers or change-resistant Luddites. A 2012 Project Tomorrow report (paid for in part by the technology industry), found that only 17 percent of current teachers believe technology helps students deeply explore their own ideas.
Technology firms are understandably eager to enter the lucrative school market and acquire customers at the earliest age. News Corporation plans to introduce in schools a new tablet computer that directs a child's wandering gaze with the on-screen message: ''Eyes on teacher.'' Perhaps the child would have done just that had he not had a colorful screen blinking in front of his face. Take-home games for the device include one in which Tom Sawyer fights the Bronts. (Lest children avert their attention to the actual books.)
Alarmists warn that schoolchildren won't excel in the i-economy if they aren't steeped in technology. Many schools boast of their iPad-to-kindergartner ratio on the theory that children should learn early on how to use a touch pad. Really? Any parent with an iPhone can tell you how long it takes a small child to master the swipe.
OBVIOUSLY there is a place for technology in the classroom. For students of a foreign language, interaction with a native speaker is invaluable. Distance learning can connect a talented inner-city child with a math professor at M.I.T. Schools that cannot manage an incubator in the classroom will benefit from observing an egg crack open on-screen. High school students can study programming, and yes, even learn to design games.
In classrooms, apps may supplement traditional lessons in handwriting, letter recognition and math drills. Digital puzzle games offer none of the tactile effort involved in turning a shape and trying -- and trying again -- to get it to fit. Multiple studies show that skills learned on-screen don't always transfer to real life. Is it really advantageous for GarageBand to replace school orchestras?
Many of the games marketed as educational aren't as much fun as video games children would play if left to their own devices. But the added bells and whistles still make it harder for them to focus on plain old boring work sheets and exams. Imagine how flat a work sheet would seem after a boisterous round of Zap the Math From Outer Space.
Technologists aim for educational games that are ''immersive'' and ''relevant,'' ''experiential'' and ''authentic,'' ''collaborative'' and ''fulfilling'' -- adjectives that could easily apply to constructing an art project out of found objects. It's easy to foresee a future in which teachers try to unpeel children from their screens in order to bring them back to such hands-on, ''real world'' experiences. To renew their ''focus.'' ''Imagine if kids poured their time and passion into a video game that taught them math concepts while they barely noticed, because it was so enjoyable,'' Bill Gates said last year. Do we want children to ''barely notice'' when they develop valuable skills? Not to learn that hard work plays a role in that acquisition? It's important to realize early on that mastery often requires persevering through tedious, repetitive tasks and hard-to-grasp subject matter.
How's this for a radical alternative? Let children play games that are not educational in their free time. Personally, I'd rather my children played Cookie Doodle or Cut the Rope on my iPhone while waiting for the subway to school than do multiplication tables to a beep-driven soundtrack. Then, once they're in the classroom, they can challenge themselves. Deliberate practice of less-than-exhilarating rote work isn't necessarily fun but they need to get used to it -- and learn to derive from it meaningful reward, a pleasure far greater than the record high score.

 CORRECTION:
A Dispatch article last Sunday, about the use of technology in the classroom, incorrectly described the release of a free version of the role-playing game SimCity for classrooms. While GlassLab (Games, Learning and Assessment Lab), a project of the nonprofit Institute of Play, unveiled an online educational resource for teachers this month, based on SimCity, it does not plan to release a version of SimCity for students to use in classrooms until this fall.

HEADLINE: Waiting for the Run on the Banks

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: After months and months of something passing for blessed calm in the euro zone, the bailout of Cypriot banks rekindles fears of instability in Italy and Spain. 

 BODY:
The economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman could not have been clearer about the dangers of forcing depositors in Cypriot banks to take a loss on their accounts. 
"OK, I didn't see that one coming. With all the problems in Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal I wasn't watching Cyprus. But that's where the big euro news is this weekend; in return for a bailout, Cyprus is supposed to impose a large haircut - that is, loss - on all depositors in its banks," Paul blogged. 
"It's as if the Europeans are holding up a neon sign, written in Greek and Italian, saying 'time to stage a run on your banks!' "
Our colleagues Landon Thomas and Liz Alderman write that with smaller deposits being taxed at 6.75 percent to repay the bailout of Cypriot banks, Europe will "impose across-the-board losses on bank depositors - from the richest Russian oligarchs, who have increasingly deposited their money in Cyprus's banks, to the poorest Cypriot pensioners - in return for 10 billion euros, or $13 billion, in bailout money." 
Public officials in Spain and Italy did their best over the weekend to say that the situation in Cyprus was unique and that deposits in those countries - especially Spain, which experienced a period of deposit flight last year - remained safe. 
Still, as Paul Krugman writes: "Tomorrow and the days immediately following should be very interesting."
It may take the better part of the week to see how things turn out. The newly elected Cypriot president believes the legislature will not approve the terms, which could put the whole bailout at risk - and the whole banking sector in tiny Cyprus.

HEADLINE: Why Iran May Be Ready to Deal

BYLINE: By VALI NASR. 
Vali Nasr, dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, is the author of the forthcoming book ''The Dispensable Nation: American Foreign Policy in Retreat.''

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
FOR the first time since 2009, there may be signs of a break in the deadlock over Iran's nuclear program. Iran entered the latest talks with a slightly softened position. That is good news, but the United States will have to change its negotiating strategy to take advantage of it.
Economic sanctions are biting hard in Iran. Meanwhile, its strategic position is crumbling because of the turmoil in its ally Syria and the rise of militant Sunni Islamism throughout the Arab Middle East. Together, these forces seem to have forced Iran to reconsider its own bargaining position. 
So rather than strengthen sanctions another notch, America should give Iran a little tit for tat: begin negotiating directly, and put on the table the prospect of lifting sanctions, one by one, as bargaining chips.
The United States should shift from trying to further intimidate Iran to trying to clinch an agreement. The sanctions have given America leverage, and we should use it to seek a deal that would finally restrict Iran's ability to make bomb fuel, rather than ratchet up the pressure in the hopes of getting either a broader deal now or a total surrender later.
The problem with just standing tough is that it is likely to backfire; Iran is understandably nervous, and if it thinks America is intransigent, it might double down on its nuclear program, speeding it up past a point of no return.
Hints of progress were seen at the round of talks in Kazakhstan last month. The United States, negotiating together with Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, proposed only small steps that would slightly ease American-imposed restrictions (allowing Iran to again trade in gold and silver, and to obtain spare parts for civilian aircraft), while insisting on stringent demands that Iran give up its ability to highly enrich uranium and use it to build nuclear weapons. Somewhat surprisingly, Iran said the proposal was welcome but not enough -- and that it would respond in a few weeks. That contrasted with its previous pattern of flatly rejecting the other side's proposals.
In 2009 and 2010, Iran sent another signal, in the form of a proposal worked out with Brazil and Turkey, that it might agree to export much of its more highly enriched uranium in exchange for being allowed to enrich it to a level suitable for nuclear power and medical uses. But the United States and its partners dismissed the offer as propaganda, largely because Iran had not made it directly, and because Iran would have still retained enough fuel to start building bombs later.
The new pressures on Tehran, its milder tone in the talks and its past signals that it might consider restricting enrichment levels suggest that Iran may be ready for productive bargaining. So the United States should be open to that possibility when talks resume in the coming days, and make new proposals to determine how serious the Iranians are.
Since 2003, Washington has relied on sanctions to bring Iran to the international bargaining table. But the Bush and Obama administrations have done more sanctioning than negotiating -- partly because putting pressure on Iran is popular in America, while making deals with Iran is not. Rather than pushing for a negotiated solution to the crisis, Washington has often seemed to be holding out for Iran to simply capitulate.
But that only undermines the original purpose of the sanctions -- to resolve the crisis without war -- because sanctions can be a two-edged sword. The more pressure they exert, the more suspicious Iran's leaders get about America's real intentions. The more suspicious they are, the more they want a nuclear program. And the closer they get to their nuclear goals, the more they feel able to resist new pressure.
Iran's leaders already suspect that America's real goal is to overthrow their Islamic republic; at the same time, their citizens bitterly resent the sanctions, and generally support the idea of an Iranian nuclear program. Their leaders remember the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when Saddam Hussein violated international law by using chemical weapons and was never punished for it. Iran's leaders concluded that they were vulnerable to aggression by their better-armed Arab neighbors, and that international agreements offered no protection.
In other words, insecurity drives Iran's nuclear ambition, and it leaves Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, convinced that if he were to give up Iran's nuclear program entirely, as Libya did in the last decade, he would only invite the fate of Muammar el-Qaddafi. That logic -- if Iran is going to face sanctions anyway, better to face them with the bomb than without -- has produced a saying in Tehran these days: ''Better to be North Korea than Iraq.'' Still, Iran's leaders and citizens clearly want the sanctions lifted, and they may now be signaling a way out of the deadlock.
It's time for the United States to test the leaders' real intentions and offer them a path to rejoining the international community.
The committee of six nations involved in the Iran talks has achieved its original goal: to confront Iran with a united front. So the other five, whose differing agendas inevitably complicate the bargaining, should step aside and leave the United States to one-to-one talks with Iran.
And rather than offering only vague promises that serious concessions might be rewarded someday by dropping all the sanctions as a package, Washington should offer to do away with specific sanctions, piece by piece, in exchange for specific Iranian concessions. In that way, both sides might begin dismantling the most dangerous aspects of Iran's nuclear program in incremental, verifiable ways.
Of course, Iran might lose enthusiasm for negotiations as the sanctions disappear. But by then, if its first concessions had been substantial, it would have given up critical pieces of its nuclear program, leaving the world a little safer.

HEADLINE: Surveillance Software Draws Scrutiny

BYLINE: By NICOLE PERLROTH

 BODY:
Last May, two security researchers volunteered to look at a few suspicious e-mails sent to some Bahraini activists. Almost one year later, the two have uncovered evidence that some 25 governments, many with questionable records on human rights, may be using off-the-shelf surveillance software to spy on their own citizens.
Morgan Marquis-Boire, a security researcher at Citizen Lab, at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, and Bill Marczak, a computer science doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, found that the e-mails contained surveillance software that could grab images off computer screens, record Skype chats, turn on cameras and microphones and log keystrokes. The word ''FinSpy'' appeared in the spyware code. FinSpy is spyware sold by the Gamma Group, a British company that says it sells monitoring software to governments solely for criminal investigations. 
Now, one year later, Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak have found evidence that FinSpy is being run off servers in 25 countries, including Ethiopia and Serbia, without oversight.
Until Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak stumbled upon FinSpy last May, security researchers had tried, unsuccessfully, for a year to track it down. FinSpy gained notoriety in March 2011 after protesters raided Egypt's state security headquarters and discovered a document that appeared to be a proposal by the Gamma Group to sell FinSpy to the government of President Hosni Mubarak .
Martin J. Muench, a Gamma Group managing director, has said his company does not disclose its customers but that Gamma Group sold its technology to governments only to monitor criminals. He said that it was most frequently used ''against pedophiles, terrorists, organized crime, kidnapping and human trafficking.''
But evidence suggests the software is being sold to governments where the potential for abuse is high. ''If you look at the list of countries that Gamma is selling to, many do not have a robust rule of law,'' Mr. Marquis-Boire said. ''Rather than catching kidnappers and drug dealers, it looks more likely that it is being used for politically motivated surveillance.''
As of last year, Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak, with other researchers at Rapid7, CrowdStrike and others, had found command-and-control servers running the spyware in just over a dozen countries. They have since scanned the entire Internet for FinSpy.
The Munk School is publishing their updated findings on Wednesday. The list of countries with servers running FinSpy is now Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Britain, Brunei, Canada, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Vietnam.
In Ethiopia, FinSpy was disguised in e-mails that were specifically aimed at political dissidents. The e-mails lured targets to click on pictures of members of Ginbot 7, an Ethiopian opposition group. When they clicked on the pictures, FinSpy downloaded to their machines and their computers began communicating with a local server in Ethiopia.
''This continues the theme of FinSpy deployments with strong indications of politically motivated targeting,'' the researchers wrote in their report.
A Turkmenistan server running the software belonged to a range of I.P. addresses specifically assigned to the ministry of communications. Turkmenistan is the first clear-cut case of a government running the spyware off its own computer system. Human Rights Watch has called Turkmenistan one of the world's ''most repressive countries'' and warned that dissidents faced ''constant threat of government reprisal.''
In Vietnam, the researchers found evidence that FinSpy was running on Android-powered phones. They found one Android phone infected with FinSpy that was sending text messages back to a Vietnamese telephone number. That finding was particularly troubling, researchers say, given recent clampdowns by the nation's government. Last year, Vietnam introduced censorship laws that prohibit bloggers from speaking out against the country's ruling Communist party. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 40 people had since been convicted and sentenced to prison terms. Many are now serving terms ranging from three to 13 years.
The sale of surveillance technology is still largely unregulated, but Mr. Marquis-Boire and Mr. Marczak's findings have prompted greater scrutiny. Responding to their findings last fall, Germany's foreign minister Guido Westerwelle called for an Europe-wide ban on the export of surveillance technology to repressive regimes. And last month, Privacy International and other groups filed complaints with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development against Gamma Group and Trovicor GmbH, a German company that also sells surveillance software.
''I don't think you can put technology back in the bottle,'' said Mr. Marquis-Boire. ''I understand why police would want to use this type of technology, but I'm just not for commercial companies selling them to nondemocratic regimes with questionable human rights records.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fed, to Reassure Investors, Stresses It Will Not End Stimulus

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Each time in recent years that the Federal Reserve has paused in its efforts to stimulate the economy, it has come to regret the decision as premature. Its leading officials say the recovery has been slower as a consequence of those pauses. It is a mistake they do not want to repeat.
When the Fed's policy-making committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, its members are likely to spend a lot of time talking about the potential costs of the current stimulus campaign. Then the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will probably seek to reassure investors that the Fed plans to press on. 
The central bank is buying $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities because it wants unemployment to fall more quickly. While recent economic data suggests that growth is quickening, Mr. Bernanke has said that the situation remains unacceptable and that the pace of progress is uncertain.
Mr. Bernanke and the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, ''have been abundantly clear in recent commentary that the improvement in the labor market to date falls far short of what they will need to see before reducing monetary policy accommodation,'' Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote last week in a note to clients.
Also, the federal government has just embarked on another round of spending cuts, known as sequestration, and the extent of the resulting drag on the economy may not be evident for several months.
''The Fed will not take overt steps to scale back its asset purchases any time soon,'' Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a New York-based financial research firm, wrote last week. ''The Fed is not going to take any chances until it is sure that we have avoided another spring/summer swoon.''
The central bank has said that it plans to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent. It was 7.7 percent in February. The asset purchases are intended to hasten the arrival of that moment by further reducing long-term borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
Mr. Bernanke built a broad consensus among Fed officials last year in favor of taking both steps, and analysts say that supporters of the policy remain firmly in the majority of the Fed's 12-member Federal Open Market Committee. Only one official dissented at the most recent meeting in January.
But Fed officials who disagree with the policy, including some who do not hold votes on the committee this year, have become increasingly vocal in their criticisms. And among officials who support the purchases, there is disagreement about how much longer the Fed should keep its foot on the gas.
The focus of those concerns has shifted from the remote threat of inflation to the possibility that low interest rates could destabilize financial markets, in part by encouraging investors to take outsize risks.
Such concerns can dilute the impact of the Fed's efforts by causing investors to doubt how much longer rates will remain low. In response, Mr. Bernanke and other supporters of the current policies have tried in recent weeks to persuade markets that the purchases will continue because the benefits far outweigh the potential costs. Indeed, Mr. Bernanke argued recently that pulling back could pose even larger risks to stability by weakening the economy.
''In light of the moderate pace of the recovery and the continued high level of economic slack, dialing back accommodation with the goal of deterring excessive risk-taking in some areas poses its own risks to growth, price stability and, ultimately, financial stability,'' he said this month. ''Indeed, as I noted, a premature removal of accommodation could, by slowing the economy, perversely serve to extend the period of low long-term rates.''
In seeking to persuade markets that it plans to press forward, the Fed must also contend with evidence that the economy is gaining strength. Fed officials projected in December that the economy would expand 2.8 percent to 3.2 percent this year, the fastest growth since the recession. Analysts expect an updated forecast on Wednesday to be modestly more optimistic.
The Fed has said that it will continue to stimulate the economy for an unusually extended period, even as the recovery gains strength. Since the benefits of that policy depend on its credibility, it is searching for ways to communicate more clearly with investors so that expectations of its eventual retreat do not become a premature drag on growth.
''At this stage in the business cycle, central bankers obsess that market participants will expect policy tightening to come sooner and more sharply than is consistent with sustained economic expansion,'' said Vincent R. Reinhart, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.

HEADLINE: White House Urged to Fire A Housing Regulator

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Prominent state attorneys general are calling on President Obama to fire the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and name a new permanent director, arguing that current policies are impeding the economic recovery.
Under its current leader, Edward J. DeMarco, the F.H.F.A., which oversees the bailed-out mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has refused to put in place a White House proposal to reduce the principal on so-called underwater mortgages -- a move that might prevent foreclosures and thus save the mortgage giants money, but also might expose taxpayers to additional losses.
Led by Eric T. Schneiderman of New York and Martha Coakley of Massachusetts, the attorneys general argue that writing down the principal on underwater mortgages -- those where the outstanding mortgage is greater than the current value of the home -- would aid the recovery. They note that write-downs were a central part of a multibillion-dollar mortgage settlement that 49 state attorneys general negotiated with five major banks a year ago. And they say the White House should name a director to take that action. 
''Our nation's economy will never fully recover until we address this foreclosure crisis,'' Ms. Coakley said in a statement. ''Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been an obstacle to progress for far too long, and it is time for new leadership and a new direction to ensure that homeowners receive this important relief.''
Mr. DeMarco has held the position at the head of the F.H.F.A for more than three years. In the last year, especially, he has clashed with the administration over the issue of write-downs, also called principal forgiveness.
The Treasury Department has argued that write-downs would save money by reducing the chances homeowners would default. An F.H.F.A. analysis released last year seemed to show that a carefully directed program could save Fannie and Freddie money. But Mr. DeMarco has rejected the idea on the grounds that it would expose taxpayers to more losses. Fannie and Freddie have already required tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer aid.
The administration has frequently criticized Mr. DeMarco's decision. ''F.H.F.A. is an independent federal agency, and I recognize that, as its acting director, you have the sole legal authority to make this decision,'' Timothy F. Geithner, who stepped down as Treasury secretary in January, wrote Mr. DeMarco last year. ''However, I do not believe it is the best decision for the country.''
Yet the White House has failed to replace Mr. DeMarco.
That decision has troubled some members of Congress. ''Ensuring that F.H.F.A. implements Congressional directives to support the most liquid, efficient, competitive and resilient housing finance markets is a matter of national urgency,'' said a letter to Mr. Obama signed by 45 members of the House last month. ''We strongly urge you to nominate an F.H.F.A. director who is ready to fulfill this mission and address the many challenges still facing the nation's housing finance markets.''
Some housing advocates suggest the White House has not named a new director in order to keep Mr. DeMarco as a scapegoat for what they perceive as a failed housing policy.
The administration has struggled to find a qualified person to take the job. There is speculation that the White House may finally be close to naming a director. The Wall Street Journal reported that officials were considering nominating Representative Mel Watt, Democrat of North Carolina, perhaps next month.
The White House declined to comment on personnel policy.
Any director would probably be named as a recess appointment because he or she would be unlikely to win Congressional approval. Many Republicans concerned about the cost of Fannie and Freddie to the taxpayer have said the two agencies should not adopt principal-reduction policies. In 2010, the White House nominated Joseph A. Smith Jr., a North Carolina banking commissioner, for the position, but his nomination died in the Senate.
Attorneys general who have signed the letter also include Kamala D. Harris of California, Beau Biden of Delaware, Lisa Madigan of Illinois, Douglas F. Gansler of Maryland, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Bob Ferguson of Washington.

HEADLINE: Slim Chance of U.S. Tax Code Change With This Congress

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Everyone in Washington celebrates the idea of a tax overhaul. President Barack Obama embraced it in his State of the Union address. John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House of Representatives, called it a top legislative priority. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee are convening bipartisan working groups, and lobbyists are licking their chops.
To the president and Democrats, a tax overhaul is an opportunity to create a more equitable tax code while bringing in more revenue to reduce the deficit; to Republicans, it is about cutting marginal rates, especially the top ones, to promote economic growth; to lobbyists, it is about padding their wallets. 
It is a mirage, say a number of serious participants who would like to see something achieved. The chances of any substantial overhaul in this Congress are slim to none.
The U.S. tax code is riddled with special-interest provisions, economic inefficiencies and inequities. Yet every preference enjoys either popular support or influential backing from a vested interest.
This always makes the politics of tax changes daunting; in reshaping a code that hands out more than $1 trillion a year in preferences, there would be winners and losers. Inevitably, it is the potential losers who bring the most passion to the deliberations.
What makes an overhaul next to impossible today is the added burden of total polarization: Democrats insist that any changes must result in net revenue gains; Republicans say any measure must be revenue neutral. Both sides agree that changing the way taxes are allocated is politically perilous and can be done only with bipartisan support.
That rules out any sweeping change, despite the genuine support of both the president and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan.
It is conceivable, if unlikely, that a deal could be struck to replace the current across-the-board spending reductions under sequestration with some additional revenue, along with cuts to entitlements. That could open the way for a modest tax overhaul that slightly lowered rates and cut a few preferences.
The goals of strong advocates for change, to cut the top rate by as much as a third and to slash loopholes, run into current realities.
''Democrats just raised the top rate, and Republicans say no more tax increases,'' says William G. Gale, a tax expert at the Brookings Institution.
It might be a little easier to take up the corporate tax code because there is a general consensus that changes should be revenue neutral. Mr. Camp wants to lower the top corporate rate to 25 percent from 35 percent; the administration wants to cut it to 28 percent.
Here, too, the trade-offs are tough. Even if the controversial foreign source issue is resolved -- the largest corporate preference is the ability of U.S.-based multinationals to defer taxes on income abroad -- with some acceptable global minimum tax, powerful sectors like agriculture, mining and real estate could face higher taxes.
The same could apply to partnerships, a sector that includes law firms and financial companies with clout. (Mr. Camp floated a surprising proposal last week that would curtail the ability of some partnerships, like hedge funds and private equity firms, to allocate income and tax benefits among their members.) On the individual side, the demand for more revenue means the losers outweigh the winners. Yet experience shows that most of the biggest preferences -- charitable write-offs, the deductions for home mortgage interest payments and state, local and property taxes, and the exclusion of health insurance benefits -- are close to untouchable.
Republicans offer several ways to circumvent these obstacles. One is to put a ceiling on overall write-offs instead of attacking individual subsidies. The problem with that idea, as former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts discovered when he made a vague campaign pledge along these lines, is that it would hit taxpayers hard who make $100,000 to $200,000 a year -- and who do not consider themselves rich, and vote heavily. The other impediment is the Republican argument that there is no need for net new taxes because an effective overhaul would promote economic growth and bring in more revenue. The evidence for that is flimsy.
All right, proponents still say, some periodic changes to the code are essential, and Washington overcame similar obstacles with the sweeping Tax Reform Act of 1986. It is true that rates were lowered and the base was broadened. However, it was financed with huge increases in corporate and capital gains taxes, both of which would be off the table today for Republicans and more than a few Democrats.
In 1985-86, there also was real bipartisan cooperation among a Republican president, Ronald Reagan; Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III; and Democratic lawmakers like Representative Dan Rostenkowski and Senator Bill Bradley. Even then, it took almost two years, and on several occasions the effort very nearly died. No trace of that spirit exists today.
Still, a major discussion of changes to tax policy this year would be healthy. It could be educational, underscoring the deficiencies and unfairness of the code and the tough trade-offs required to make it better. That could lead to gradual changes and improvements at the margins.
It probably would also be a boon for the Washington economy, as special interests rushed to hire any lobbyist with a pulse to protect their benefits.

HEADLINE: As Government Stands Firm, Analysts See Risk of New Recession in Britain

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- As George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, prepares this week to update Parliament on his plans for the economy, the prospect of stagflation is back to haunt Britain.
Recent disappointing economic data coupled with rising consumer prices have heightened fears among some economists that Britain is once again edging closer to a recession, leaving Mr. Osborne and his austerity plan increasingly isolated.
Calls for Mr. Osborne to take a break from his relentless efforts to balance the budget and instead find ways to get economic growth back on track intensified in advance of the annual budget, which he is to present to Parliament on Wednesday. Even within his own Conservative Party and among members of the government's junior coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, lawmakers have started to suggest that it time for a new approach.
''The pressure is mounting on Mr. Osborne,'' said Simon Wells, an economist at HSBC. ''He's been in the job almost three years, and over this period the economy has grown by a measly 1 percent.'' That compares with 4.9 percent growth in the United States during that span, 3.7 percent in Germany and 1.7 percent in France, according to Mr. Wells. 
''With an election looming in 2015, he needs growth if he is to stabilize the public finances, and he needs it soon,'' Mr. Wells said.
Some lawmakers and economists suggested that Mr. Osborne should use the budget update to announce a slight increase in borrowing to invest in infrastructure, education and other projects that would help revive growth. But the government is widely expected to stick with its plan of balancing the books within five years, even as a deteriorating economy makes achieving that goal more difficult.
''This month's budget will be about sticking to the course, because there's no alternative,'' Prime Minister David Cameron said in a speech last week.
In January, Britain's industrial production surprisingly fell to its lowest level in 20 years, reviving concerns that the country could fall back into a recession for the third time in little more than four years. A dismal economic outlook had pushed the pound to the lowest level against the dollar in nearly three years; that makes imports more expensive and threatens to increase inflation that is already above the E.U. average. Higher consumer prices in turn would further cut spending power.
Irfan Aslam, the founder of Global Components, a British supplier of bolts, textiles and other components to the local furniture industry, said the weak pound had already hurt his business by making parts he buys in the United States and Europe more expensive.
''It's having a real detrimental effect on the business,'' said Mr. Aslam, 37. ''It forces us right to the edge.''
Mr. Aslam had to postpone plans to expand his warehouses and hire staff members and said he might be forced to pass price increases to his customers. ''Demand is weak anyway, and we should be thinking about offering promotions to create demand, but we can't. We're actually thinking about increasing prices,'' he said.
The government and the Bank of England had welcomed a weaker pound, arguing it would help the economy by making British exports cheaper. But the recent slump of the currency against the dollar, as well as the euro, prompted Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, to change his tone. In an interview with the television channel ITV on Thursday he said the pound was now ''properly valued,'' indicating a further decline was not desirable.
Ha-Joon Chang, an economist at the University of Cambridge, said Britain had failed to generate a trade surplus despite the relatively weak pound because the country was unable to produce enough valuable goods that could be exported. Britain's economy shrank 0.3 percent in the final quarter of last year and is expected to grow 1 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The opposition Labour Party has been pointing to the weak economic growth as evidence that Mr. Osborne's austerity plan -- which has included some tax increases, the elimination of tens of thousands of public sector jobs and cutting social benefits -- was not working. Austerity is choking the economic recovery, opposition lawmakers have argued; they say the government needs to increase spending to fuel growth.
Mr. Cameron has repeatedly rebuffed such criticisms and instead blamed the euro zone and higher fuel costs for the troubles. But in an embarrassing gaffe this month, Mr. Cameron quoted the Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent group that provides economic forecasts, as being ''absolutely clear'' that the deficit reduction plan was not responsible for Britain's economic difficulties, only to be contradicted a day later by the O.B.R. chairman, Robert Chote.
The group's forecasts ''incorporated the widely held assumption that tax increases and spending cuts reduce economic growth in the short term,'' Mr. Chote wrote in an open letter.
The success of Mr. Osborne's plan to eliminate the budget deficit by 2017 has hinged on the strength of the economic recovery. But sluggish growth last year has already forced Mr. Osborne to acknowledge, which he did in December, that it would take a year longer -- well into 2018 -- to achieve his target of balancing the budget. Disappointing tax revenue and rising benefit payments have made his job more difficult.
And yet, the Cameron government has been sticking to its plan, arguing that anything else would raise concerns among investors about Britain's ability to pay its debt, which would drive up borrowing costs. Taking on more debt -- even short-term -- was not an option. There was no ''magic money tree,'' Mr. Cameron said in his speech.
Some economists expect Mr. Osborne to turn to the Bank of England to pump more money into the economy. The central bank has already poured in 375 billion, or $562 billion, over the past four years by buying assets, mostly government bonds, and it is expected to buy more soon.
Mr. Osborne could perhaps ask the Bank of England on Wednesday to adopt a more flexible approach starting in July when Mark Carney, the head of the Canadian central bank, is to take over as governor of the Bank of England. The central bank, on its own, could also focus more on reviving growth than on reducing inflation to its target of 2 percent, some economists said.
Mr. Cameron has already hinted that he would welcome interest rates that remained close to the current record low of 0.5 percent. A sharp rise in interest rates would do ''unthinkable damage'' to Britain's economy, he said in the speech last week.
Meantime, opposition is brewing even within the government's ruling coalition to Mr. Osborne's reluctance to consider alternatives to debt reduction. Vince Cable, the business secretary and member of the Liberal Democrats, wrote in an article earlier this month that more borrowing to finance projects like new schools or roads could revive growth.

HEADLINE: Google Executive to Visit Myanmar

BYLINE: By AUNG HLA TUN | REUTERS

 BODY:
YANGON -- Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt of Google plans to go to Myanmar this week, becoming the first high-profile executive from a technology company to visit the country since the West eased sanctions imposed during decades of military dictatorship. 
Since Myanmar's military stepped aside and a quasi-civilian government was installed in 2011, setting off a wave of political and economic changes, the country has enjoyed a surge of interest from overseas businesses.
Myanmar, formerly Burma, is the last unexploited territory for businesses in Asia, with untapped markets including the telecommunications sector: Mobile penetration in the country of 60 million is estimated to be a meager 5 percent to 10 percent.
The country's planned modernization of mobile infrastructure and the expected boom in cellphone use will pave the way for companies like Google, which could profit greatly through sales of inexpensive smartphones built around its Android platform.
Mr. Schmidt ''is visiting several countries in Asia to connect with local partners and Googlers who are working to improve the lives of many millions of people across the region by helping them get online and access the world's information for the first time in the next few years,'' Google said in a statement.
The Myanmar trip, which will be followed by a visit to India, will be Schmidt's second this year to a country off the beaten track and unaccustomed to Western telecommunications. In January he went to North Korea, saying it was a personal trip to talk about a free and open Internet.
Mr. Schmidt is due to give a speech at the Myanmar Information and Communication Technology Park in Yangon on Friday before making his way to the capital, Naypyidaw, to meet senior government officials, said Zaw Min Oo, secretary general of the Myanmar Computer Society.
For the Friday speech, ''there will be an audience of about 400, comprising entrepreneurs, executive committee members of the computer association and young leaders,'' Zaw Min Oo said.
In February the U.S. Treasury Department issued a general license for four of Myanmar's biggest banks, two of which are owned by tycoons associated with the former junta, before a visit by 50 U.S. executives that month to explore opportunities.
The delegation, led by the U.S. Agency for International Development and including representatives of Cisco, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Microsoft , visited Myanmar to look into projects to increase access to the Internet, strengthen transparent government and expand digital literacy, according to a statement from the agency.
Many leading firms in Myanmar are still largely controlled by businesspeople subject to sanctions, but Western companies are starting to move in after the implementation of a new foreign investment law.
Myanmar is offering two operating licenses for companies to build a new telecommunications infrastructure.
MTN Group, the largest African mobile phone company, is bidding for a license and has said about 90 companies have expressed interest.

HEADLINE: Spanish Magazine Publisher Bets Against the Crisis

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER

 BODY:
MADRID -- Andrs Rodrguez, the publisher and founder of SpainMedia, has the most at stake in the debut this month of a Spanish-language edition of Forbes, the U.S. business magazine, in crisis-hit Spain.
For Forbes Inc., the New York-based publisher of Forbes Magazine and his partner in the Spanish licensing venture, ''their only risk is if the magazine really proves a failure, because that could hurt their image,'' Mr. Rodrguez said Thursday during an interview in his office, inside what had been an abandoned printing-equipment plant. ''I'm also betting my image, as well as my money and my work.''
SpainMedia is swimming against a tide that has driven many other Spanish media entrepreneurs out of business amid a recession and credit squeeze. Since the start of the financial crisis, dozens of Spanish publications have shut down and more than 8,000 journalists have lost their jobs, according to the Federation of Spanish Journalist Associations.
In this climate, SpainMedia is adding its incarnation of Forbes to a roster that includes Spanish editions of three other well-known periodicals: Esquire and Harper's Bazaar -- both owned by Hearst -- and Robb Report, which is owned by CurtCo Media Labs in Malibu, California. SpainMedia also publishes its own travel magazine, Orizon. 
Mr. Rodrguez's outlook on the future of magazines in Spain goes beyond being merely optimistic. ''I'm a publisher who believes that paper as a product is more alive than ever,'' he said.
He also sees the sector returning to its ''golden era'' of 50 years ago when advertising mushroomed and magazines set the benchmark for photojournalism.
''Magazines have their own language and we need to return to the origins of that language,'' he added. ''It's also about walking into a bar and sending a very clear message by the way you're holding the magazine under your arm -- and that's an experience that anything digital will never give you.''
Yet no matter how much Mr. Rodrguez values paper, the transition from print to digital magazines ''is now happening, even if it is slower than for daily newspapers,'' according to the journalist Pedro Cifuentes, director of a master's degree program in digital journalism at the IE Business School in Madrid. Mr. Cifuentes said early estimates suggested that circulation for digital magazines had risen 15 percent in Spain last year, compared with a 5 percent decline in printed copies, in line with what happened in markets like Britain. Meanwhile, advertising has fallen about 40 percent overall since the start of the global economic crisis in 2008.
Forbes already published 26 other licensed editions of its magazine, including several in East European countries like Poland and Romania. Spain is the first foray by the family-controlled Forbes into Western Europe.
Asked about the timing of its Spanish entry, Miguel Forbes, a family member who is in charge of the publisher's worldwide development, said by telephone recently that ''the time to launch is when a market is in the process of recovery.''
The Spanish edition of Forbes, a monthly released March 6, had a print run of 65,000 copies. Neither Mr. Forbes nor Mr. Rodrguez would disclose financial details about their venture, which involves SpainMedia paying a licensing fee to Forbes based on its magazine sales and advertising revenues.
''Andrs has shown that he's able to put out very strong titles with a very lean staff,'' Mr. Forbes said of Mr. Rodrguez. ''A lot of publishers have a big staff, but it's hard to make money when you have a large headcount.''
SpainMedia, which has annual sales of about &#x20ac;10 million, or $13 million, operates out of the former printing facility, which Mr. Rodrguez bought two years ago ''in the midst of the property collapse'' and then renovated. The company has only 30 employees, with an average age of 28. Half the staff members are journalists.
''I want talent and don't care about age or experience,'' said Mr. Rodrguez, who is 47. He wears several hats at SpainMedia, including that of editor in chief of Spanish editions of Forbes and Esquire. He also handles many of the negotiations with advertisers.
SpainMedia produces about 80 percent of its own content, half of which comes from freelance reporting contributions. For the debut of Forbes this month, Mr. Rodrguez chose only one article from the American edition of Forbes: an interview with Sheldon Adelson, the gambling tycoon who plans to build a EuroVegas casino complex on the outskirts of Madrid.
For the most part, however, Mr. Rodrguez says he steers clear of the content in the American editions of his magazines and chooses different paper stock and cover designs. ''I want to return to the craftsmanship of magazines,'' he said.
About 85 percent of SpainMedia's magazines are sold by dealers, while a fraction go to subscribers, Mr. Rodrguez said. The rest are given away in places like airport business lounges.
''The subscription market doesn't work in Spain because our mailing service isn't as efficient as in the United States,'' he said. ''Magazines arrive late here or folded and creased in the mailbox.'' The magazine costs &#x20ac;4 at a newsstand, or &#x20ac;36 for an annual subscription. The Kindle version is &#x20ac;1.79 this month, rising to &#x20ac;4 next month on Kindle and the iPad, he said.
Mr. Rodrguez cut his teeth in radio journalism before switching to newspapers during a period of media frenzy in Spain that followed decades of information censorship under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, who died in 1975. Mr. Rodrguez helped start two newspapers in the 1980s. Both foundered.
After several years working for Prisa, the media group that owns the newspaper El Pas, he decided in 2006 to set up his own company.
His breakthrough was to convince Hearst that he could publish Esquire in Spanish. He then negotiated a bank loan of &#x20ac;500,000, shortly before the start of the financial crisis. SpainMedia has been profitable since its second year of operations, he said.
''When media companies now ask for a loan, the bankers run away,'' Mr. Rodrguez noted with a wry smile.
Mr. Rodrguez said Forbes had approached him after a recommendation from Hearst. At first, he was reluctant to branch out from lifestyle publications like Esquire into business journalism, despite the reputation of the Forbes brand.
''I really felt this was the worst time to do a business magazine,'' he said. But Forbes persisted, he added, and he ''came to the conclusion that there was the readership, because never in Spain's history had people been so aware of the economy and its impact.''
Since then, Mr. Rodrguez said, his conversion to business journalism was so complete that, when he fell two months ago and broke his ankle while skiing, ''the only thing that I was worrying about was whether this could somehow screw up the launch of Forbes.''

HEADLINE: Senators' Plan Alters Waiting Periods for Immigration

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The nation's 11 million illegal immigrants would have to wait a full decade for a green card but could earn citizenship just three years after that, under a provision being finalized by a bipartisan group of eight senators working to devise an overhaul of immigration law, several people with knowledge of the negotiations said.
Taken together, the two waiting periods would provide the nation's illegal immigrants with a path to United States citizenship in 13 years, matching the draft of a plan by President Obama to offer full participation in American democracy to millions who are living in fear of deportation.
The arrangement would shrink the amount of time it takes to become a naturalized citizen, to three years from five years. But in an appeal to Republicans, it would also extend to 10 years, from 8, the amount of time that illegal immigrants must wait before receiving permission to work in the United States permanently. 
Such a compromise might give both sides something to crow about: Republicans could argue that they pushed for a longer waiting period before a person could get a green card, which allows its holder to remain and work in the United States indefinitely. Democrats could say that illegal immigrants would become citizens faster.
''It is an unusual construction, but it gets them to citizenship in the same time as the administration plan,'' said Kevin Appleby, the director of migration policy at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. ''Most importantly, it eliminates the prospect of a permanent underclass by ensuring that, in time, all will have the opportunity to become Americans.''
Negotiations among the senators have intensified significantly in recent days as they push toward a goal of announcing comprehensive immigration legislation in early April. Senators from both parties and their staffs met for hours on Thursday as they struggled to overcome obstacles that several people familiar with the negotiations said could hinder a deal in the weeks ahead.
Among those obstacles is a continuing concern among Republicans that a three-year naturalization process for illegal immigrants could give them a faster path to citizenship than people who enter legally. One possible solution, officials said, would be to reduce the wait for citizenship to three years for everyone. But they said the agreement could still unravel.
''We can't create a system where it's faster for illegal immigrants than for legal immigrants,'' said one Republican familiar with the internal debate who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Republicans are clear that they are not going to create a special pathway to citizenship.''
The senators also remain at odds over a series of other major issues, including the establishment of a guest-worker program for low-skilled immigrants; a better system for companies to verify the immigration status of job applicants; determining who has the final authority to declare the borders secure; and modifying rules that prioritize the family members who can immigrate to the United States legally.
One big sticking point has become the visa program for low-skilled, year-round, temporary workers. In February, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. reached a compromise that acknowledged the need for a system that would allow businesses to meet their demand for lower-skilled labor, while still protecting American workers.
But the two groups remain divided on the number of visas the new program should offer, said Randel K. Johnson, the chamber's lead negotiator on immigration. The chamber, he said, wants 400,000 visas, while the A.F.L.-C.I.O. prefers a number in the ''very, very low five figures.'' Ana Avendao, the director of immigration for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., refused to discuss a specific number, but said ''the whole notion is to create a system that responds to the needs of the economy.''
The bipartisan group of eight senators is also still debating how to improve E-Verify, the system that employers use to check the immigration status of their workers. A high-tech, biometric identification card was deemed too costly; instead, the group is considering an enhanced E-Verify system that would allow employers to use photographs to identify job applicants and would let workers provide answers to security questions to help prove their legal work status.
But despite the remaining differences, the eight senators who are in negotiations are continuing to make steady progress toward an overall deal, according to people familiar with the talks. Mr. Obama, who has threatened to push forward with his own legislation if Senate efforts stall, is satisfied with the current pace of talks, White House officials said.
Even if the Senate passes an immigration overhaul later this spring or summer, it still faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled House. A group of House Republicans told Speaker John A. Boehner last week that they were close to releasing a set of principles to guide their own legislation.
House Republicans would prefer to tackle an immigration overhaul in several smaller bills rather than one big bill. And many House Republicans want to offer illegal immigrants a legal status that stops short of a pathway to citizenship.
But the momentum that appears to be most evident is the progress among senators on the path to citizenship. No immigration debate has been more contentious over the years than the question of whether, and how, illegal immigrants eventually become citizens.
After last year's election, when Hispanic voters overwhelmingly backed Mr. Obama's bid for a second term, there now appears to be broad support in the Senate for a so-called path to citizenship. But the length of the waiting period has continued to be at the heart of the philosophical struggle between Democrats and Republicans.
Draft legislation by the White House that came to light in news reports several weeks ago called for an eight-year waiting period before getting a green card. Republican senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida, had urged a wait that could take years longer.
Republicans and Democrats say they believe that a 10-year wait for a green card would provide enough time to clear out the existing backlog of millions of immigration cases, so that illegal immigrants would not skip ahead of legal entrants. Currently, it can take up to 20 years to obtain a green card to work in the United States.
And as a side benefit, waiting a decade would mean that the costs of the overhaul would not kick in until the second decade because illegal immigrants do not qualify for government benefits until after they earn green cards. That means the 10-year cost estimates by the Congressional Budget Office would not include the expense of those benefits.
Those with knowledge of the negotiations said the legislation would require that the existing immigration backlog be cleared up and the border be secured before illegal immigrants receive green cards or citizenship.
And the senators have already agreed that illegal immigrants would have to pay back taxes, pay a hefty fine and learn English before being eligible for green cards and citizenship.

HEADLINE: Marches Of Folly

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Ten years ago, America invaded Iraq; somehow, our political class decided that we should respond to a terrorist attack by making war on a regime that, however vile, had nothing to do with that attack.
Some voices warned that we were making a terrible mistake -- that the case for war was weak and possibly fraudulent, and that far from yielding the promised easy victory, the venture was all too likely to end in costly grief. And those warnings were, of course, right.
There were, it turned out, no weapons of mass destruction; it was obvious in retrospect that the Bush administration deliberately misled the nation into war. And the war -- having cost thousands of American lives and scores of thousands of Iraqi lives, having imposed financial costs vastly higher than the war's boosters predicted -- left America weaker, not stronger, and ended up creating an Iraqi regime that is closer to Tehran than it is to Washington. 
So did our political elite and our news media learn from this experience? It sure doesn't look like it.
The really striking thing, during the run-up to the war, was the illusion of consensus. To this day, pundits who got it wrong excuse themselves on the grounds that ''everyone'' thought that there was a solid case for war. Of course, they acknowledge, there were war opponents -- but they were out of the mainstream.
The trouble with this argument is that it was and is circular: support for the war became part of the definition of what it meant to hold a mainstream opinion. Anyone who dissented, no matter how qualified, was ipso facto labeled as unworthy of consideration. This was true in political circles; it was equally true of much of the press, which effectively took sides and joined the war party.
CNN's Howard Kurtz, who was at The Washington Post at the time, recently wrote about how this process worked, how skeptical reporting, no matter how solid, was discouraged and rejected. ''Pieces questioning the evidence or rationale for war,'' he wrote, ''were frequently buried, minimized or spiked.''
Closely associated with this taking of sides was an exaggerated and inappropriate reverence for authority. Only people in positions of power were considered worthy of respect. Mr. Kurtz tells us, for example, that The Post killed a piece on war doubts by its own senior defense reporter on the grounds that it relied on retired military officials and outside experts -- ''in other words, those with sufficient independence to question the rationale for war.''
All in all, it was an object lesson in the dangers of groupthink, a demonstration of how important it is to listen to skeptical voices and separate reporting from advocacy. But as I said, it's a lesson that doesn't seem to have been learned. Consider, as evidence, the deficit obsession that has dominated our political scene for the past three years.
Now, I don't want to push the analogy too far. Bad economic policy isn't the moral equivalent of a war fought on false pretenses, and while the predictions of deficit scolds have been wrong time and again, there hasn't been any development either as decisive or as shocking as the complete failure to find weapons of mass destruction. Best of all, these days dissenters don't operate in the atmosphere of menace, the sense that raising doubts could have devastating personal and career consequences, that was so pervasive in 2002 and 2003. (Remember the hate campaign against the Dixie Chicks?)
But now as then we have the illusion of consensus, an illusion based on a process in which anyone questioning the preferred narrative is immediately marginalized, no matter how strong his or her credentials. And now as then the press often seems to have taken sides. It has been especially striking how often questionable assertions are reported as fact. How many times, for example, have you seen news articles simply asserting that the United States has a ''debt crisis,'' even though many economists would argue that it faces no such thing?
In fact, in some ways the line between news and opinion has been even more blurred on fiscal issues than it was in the march to war. As The Post's Ezra Klein noted last month, it seems that ''the rules of reportorial neutrality don't apply when it comes to the deficit.''
What we should have learned from the Iraq debacle was that you should always be skeptical and that you should never rely on supposed authority. If you hear that ''everyone'' supports a policy, whether it's a war of choice or fiscal austerity, you should ask whether ''everyone'' has been defined to exclude anyone expressing a different opinion. And policy arguments should be evaluated on the merits, not by who expresses them; remember when Colin Powell assured us about those Iraqi W.M.D.'s?
Unfortunately, as I said, we don't seem to have learned those lessons. Will we ever?

HEADLINE: Jos Alfredo Martnez de Hoz, 87, Dies; Argentine Official During Dictatorship

BYLINE: By EMILY SCHMALL

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES -- Jos Alfredo Martnez de Hoz, who was the economics minister during Argentina's dictatorship, died on Friday at his home here, where he was under arrest, accused of human rights abuses. He was 87.
His death was announced by the government-run news agency Tlam. His son Jos Martnez de Hoz said Mr. Martnez de Hoz had been ill and had probably died of a heart attack.
Mr. Martnez de Hoz, a former law professor, was in charge of Argentina's economy from 1976 to 1981. Initially, he was praised by international bankers, including David Rockefeller, for his free-market policies, designed to combat Argentina's hyperinflation, but was condemned by Argentine businessmen for the nation's subsequent economic collapse. 
Mr. Martnez de Hoz oversaw Argentina's financial deregulation in 1977, which drew record inflows of capital from speculative investors.
''He's identified as most responsible for Argentina's deindustrialization,'' said Sergio Berensztein, a political consultant with the independent research firm Poliarqua in Buenos Aires. ''The bullet that blew up the policy was when Ronald Reagan was elected and the U.S. Fed increased interest rates dramatically.''
After Argentina returned to democratic rule in 1983, Mr. Martnez de Hoz was under arrest for two and a half months on suspicion of involvement in the kidnapping of two prominent businessmen. He was the first civilian government official to be held for abuses committed during the rein of the military junta.
He was accused of fraud for burdening the country with foreign debt, and criticized for the government's purchase in Swiss francs of the privately owned Italo-Argentine Electric Company, where he had been a director.
However, Mr. Martnez de Hoz was shielded from the courts by President Carlos Sal Menem's blanket amnesty of those involved in the so-called Dirty War. He was pardoned by Mr. Menem on Dec. 30, 1990.
That amnesty was ruled unconstitutional and overturned by the Supreme Court in 2005, and an investigation into Mr. Martnez de Hoz's role in the kidnapping of the businessmen, Federico Gutheim and his son Miguel -- whose cotton export company, Sideco, was said to have been coerced into deals that favored the dictatorship -- was revived in 2006. Mr. Martnez de Hoz, who was arrested in 2010 and held at home until his death, denied the accusations.
Jos Alfredo Martnez de la Hoz, familiarly known as Joe or Josecito, was born on Aug. 13, 1925, into an aristocratic family of wealthy landowners. In addition to his son Jos, he is survived by another son, Marcos; a daughter, Elvira; and 11 grandchildren.
Mr. Martnez de Hoz, who studied at Oxford, was appointed economics minister days after Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla toppled the government of Isabel Pern, the widow of the three-time president Gen. Juan Domingo Pern. General Videla is now in prison serving multiple life sentences for human rights abuses.
As part of the dictatorship's so-called National Reorganization Process, Mr. Martnez de Hoz conceived and imposed a plan called Tablita, or little table, to let the peso depreciate steadily against the dollar. The era of plata dulce, or sweet money, ushered in by Tablita, ended in collapse, plunging Argentina into a deep recession in 1981.
Mr. Martnez de Hoz was also accused of using government funds on speculative deals, and Argentina's foreign debt soared under his stewardship because of speculative deals with companies and International Monetary Fund loans. A federal court found him guilty in 1985 of ''economic subversion'' and froze $1 million of his assets, but he did not go to prison because of the court's prior agreement when the trial began in 1983.
Strikes were banned during Mr. Martnez de Hoz's tenure. A government investigation after Argentina's return to democracy in 1983 found that military squadrons had seized as many as 30,000 people, including hundreds of labor activists, and secretly had them tortured and executed.
''He was among the civilians who laid out plans, alongside the armed forces, for what was an oppression of the people,'' said Estela de Carlotto, the president of Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group formed in 1977 that focuses on identifying grandchildren of so-called disappeared people, who were kidnapped and appropriated by military families.
Mr. Martnez de Hoz never expressed remorse for his role in the dictatorship.

HEADLINE: Local TV News Is Following Print's Path, Study Says

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
With shorter stories and scarce coverage of politics and government, local television newscasts in the United States, like local newspapers before them, are suffering from ''shrinking pains,'' according to the Pew Research Center.
The diagnosis comes in the center's 10th annual State of the News Media report, which will be published on Monday. The report, covering 2012, describes cutbacks in the reporting ranks of newspapers and television networks and a surge in efforts by politicians, corporations and others to tell their own stories.
''This adds up to a news industry that is more undermanned and unprepared to uncover stories, dig deep into emerging ones or to question information put into its hands,'' the report's main author, Amy Mitchell, wrote in an introduction. 
The report also highlighted the results of a new Pew survey that asked Americans whether they had heard much about the financial challenges that the news industry faces, like the steep decline in newspaper advertising revenue.
Sixty percent of the respondents said they had heard little or nothing, indicating that ''awareness of the industry's financial struggles is limited,'' the report said. But some have sensed the results: 31 percent of respondents said they ''have stopped turning to a news outlet because it no longer provided them with the news they were accustomed to getting.''
The report's authors did find, as in prior years, a robust public appetite for news. Digital news sources are now used daily by 50 percent of Americans, according to Pew's survey, making the Internet nearly as important a source as television. Mobile phones and tablets were mostly responsible for the surge in digital news consumption.
Computers and mobile phones, of course, redistribute news from television, radio and newspapers. But cutbacks at many of these traditional sources continued in 2012, Pew found.
The report's authors cited an estimate from Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at The Poynter Institute, of newspaper newsroom employment that dipped below 40,000 last year, to the industry's lowest level since 1978. They decided to dig deep into television news coverage, partly because it has escaped the scrutiny focused on newspapers in recent years. They found that local television stations have increased their reliance on three main topics -- weather, traffic and sports.
The researchers sampled the newscasts in four markets (Bend, Ore.; Houston; Milwaukee; and Pittsburgh) and compared their findings with a similar study of three of the markets in 2005. Back then, there were more taped stories and interviews; now there are more live reports from reporters in the field. The report called this a sign that ''there is less in-depth journalism being produced.''
Only 20 percent of the stories in the 2012 sample were more than a minute long. Segments about weather, traffic and sports ate up 40 percent of local newscasts' time, up from 32 percent in 2005, even though this kind of information ''is now available on demand in a variety of digital platforms,'' the report said.
Stories about government and politics in the markets that were sampled fell by more than half, to 3 percent of the broadcasts from 7 percent in 2005. There was also a marked decline in the percentage of stories about crime, to 17 percent from 29 percent. The volume of economic stories rose to 8 percent, from 3 percent, perhaps, the report's authors said, because of the fragile state of the economy.
Nielsen ratings show that the audiences for local television newscasts in 2012 declined, albeit slightly, versus the prior year. The medium remains a top source of news overall, though.
Pew's researchers didn't find the same kinds of changes to network news programming that it found locally; in fact, they were struck by how little had changed about the big three network nightly newscasts since 2007, the last time they studied them. However, a lot had changed on the three major cable news channels, which have become more politically oriented in the last five years, the study found. Daytime programs on cable news increasingly resembled prime-time talk shows, the report said, adding that ''interview segments are now as prominent in daytime cable as they are in prime time.''
As for newspapers, Pew followed up on a prediction in last year's report that more news organizations would require customers to pay for full access to their Web sites. The number of daily newspapers doing so has more than doubled since then, according to Monday's report, to about 450. (That figure, out of 1,380 daily newspapers across the country, included the newspapers that have announced such plans as well as the ones that have actually started.)
''This is already helping rebalance the print industry's heavy reliance on advertising over subscription revenue,'' the report said, adding that digital advertising for newspapers ''grew only at an anemic 3 percent rate in 2012.''
The report also identified a split in digital advertising. While the news industry ''continues to lose out,'' it said, ''on the bulk of new digital advertising,'' some outlets are seeing growth from sponsored content. An online twist on ''advertorials'' of old, these ad units appear within a publication's Web page and are often called ''native ads.''
''Traditional publications such as The Atlantic and Forbes, as well as digital publications BuzzFeed and Gawker, have relied on native ads to quickly build digital ad revenues, and their use is expected to spread,'' the report said.

HEADLINE: Saving Schools and Libraries by Giving Up the Land They Sit On

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER and AL BAKER

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Heights library is neither the oldest nor the most dilapidated branch of the Brooklyn Public Library system. But the 52-year-old limestone building is nonetheless ripe for demolition.
It sits on land that developers crave, in a fashionable neighborhood where housing is in high demand. And so the library system, desperate for money to pay for $230 million in long-deferred repairs for its 60 branches, has embraced a novel financing model that is increasingly being used around New York City as a way to pay for government services.
The library, on Cadman Plaza, along with another library near the Barclays Center, would be sold to developers, torn down and then rebuilt at no public expense on the ground floor of a new apartment tower.
Government-financed agencies, seeing a way to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in a weak economy, are looking at the land right under some of their own institutions and offering it to the best bidder, who will build new, modern libraries or schools in the base of new developments. In the process, they will also erase the stout civic buildings now there, in effect leveling public facilities to make sure the agencies are financially secure. 
The strategy has been embraced in Brooklyn, where the two libraries need repairs of $9 million to $11 million.
''We would deliver two of these libraries for essentially no cost to the library system,'' said Joshua Nachowitz, the Brooklyn Public Library's vice president for government and community relations. ''It's a win-win.''
But the approach has provoked growing protest in the affected communities. Most pressingly, residents are concerned about how far they will have to go to reach a library, and where their children will go to school, during the years it will take to erect the new towers. But they are also worried about the aesthetic and cultural price of replacing local institutions to which they are deeply attached, neighborhood landmarks if not official ones, and having them swallowed up into stacks of concrete, steel and glass.
''What makes a place interesting is different kinds of architecture and a school looking like a school,'' said Laurie Frey, a member of the Community Education Council in District 3, a board that represents public school parents on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. ''There's a feeling of, 'Oh please, not another high rise,' and a feeling that, since we're already getting used to an increased density in our few blocks, do we really need more?''
The city's Educational Construction Fund is reviewing proposals for construction of high-rise apartment towers on the sites of two public schools near Lincoln Center -- P.S. 191 on West 61st Street and P.S. 199 on West 70th Street, which was designed by the modernist architect Edward Durell Stone -- and another school on East 96th Street, the School of Cooperative Technical Education. In each case, new schools would occupy the lower floors of the new buildings.
Officials have mingled private development and schools before; the new High School of Art and Design on East 56th Street is a prime exhibit. But the pace is accelerating. Three projects have been executed since 2008, and the latest proposal would sweep up three schools at once.
''We anticipate that we will be able to bring this successful model to other high-density zoning areas of the city,'' said Erin Hughes, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, pointing to the success the department has had creating new classrooms on the Upper East Side.
Ms. Frey said she worried that ''kicking students out of their home school is not a gentle process'' and that ''there will be an immediate negative impact on learning.'' At a meeting last month, she said, an official of the Educational Construction Fund said that students from P.S. 191 would be moved to the Beacon High School building while the school was demolished and rebuilt, but that a relocation site for P.S. 199 had not yet been identified.
Meanwhile, the New York City Housing Authority, facing the biggest deficits in its history, has proposed letting developers build private, mostly market-rate residential towers on parking lots alongside eight housing projects in Manhattan. The authority would use the resulting lease payments -- as much as $60 million a year -- to pay for badly needed repairs in the 179,000 apartments it manages.
And this month, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced that the city was selling off two municipal buildings near City Hall -- 49-51 Chambers Street and 346 Broadway. City Hall officials boasted that these ''well-positioned properties'' would generate almost $250 million in revenue and savings and also lead to the creation of a public digital arts and media space inside one of the buildings.
The New York Public Library, which covers Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, capitalized on the strategy when it sold the Donnell branch on West 53rd Street for $59 million. The library was vacated in 2008 and after some stumbles, a new library is expected to be built by 2014 inside a 46-story hotel and condominium tower, meaning that a popular library will have been shuttered for six years.
The real estate industry, of course, is delighted with this growing trend. Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, pointed out that the Barclays Center arena -- itself the result of an eminent domain effort that prompted bitter accusations that the city was enriching a private developer -- had revived a sleepy quarter of Brooklyn and made a place like the nearby Pacific branch library suddenly ripe for a lucrative land deal.
''Brooklyn is booming and the library system doesn't want to sit on the sidelines and not use it as a chance to upgrade its branches,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University. ''At a time when people don't want to raise taxes, taking advantage of the value of the property is one of the more intelligent ways to invest in the library system while getting new revenue.''
The Brooklyn Heights branch was closed for 30 days last summer because its central air-conditioning kept failing; replacing it alone would cost $3 million. But the city gives the entire Brooklyn system only $15 million a year for repairs and construction, Mr. Nachowitz said, with the rest of its financing coming from private donations and other sources.
The Pacific branch, at Pacific Street and Fourth Avenue, is a Beaux-Arts building that opened in 1904 and was the first library in Brooklyn financed by Andrew Carnegie, who eventually built 1,689 libraries across the United States. Its 10-step entrance has no ramps for wheelchairs and strollers, and officials say the interior is leaky, overcrowded, poorly air-conditioned and honeycombed with small office spaces librarians no longer use.
It was never declared a landmark, which means it could be demolished. Patrons will eventually be steered to a new library two blocks away squeezed into a 32-story tower that Two Trees Management, the major developer of Dumbo, is erecting across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Two Trees is carving out cultural space, including the library, in order to create more apartments than zoning would otherwise allow. The Pacific branch would remain open until the new library was completed, then it would be torn down, with a new building put up by the winning bidder.
Howard Kolins, president of the Boerum Hill Association and a parent whose two children regularly used the Pacific library when they were in middle school, said the new location would require Park Slope and Boerum Hill families to cross heavily trafficked Flatbush Avenue.
The Brooklyn Heights branch, which will be rebuilt in the same spot, will have to close during the two or three years of construction, and residents have yet to be told where there will be an alternative place to find books and use computers. ''My concern is that it not get lost in the shuffle and that the whole library system is not sacrificed to the interests of a private developer,'' said Pearl Hochstadt, 82, who has lived in the Heights since 1953, before the current branch opened, and holds book club meetings in the library.
But David Giles, research director of the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit urban-affairs institute, said there was wisdom to the approach.
''They can rebuild a new branch for the neighborhood and add money for other branches as well,'' he said. ''That's clearly part of the calculation there. It's property values.''

HEADLINE: Saving Lions by Killing Them

BYLINE: By ALEXANDER N. SONGORWA. 
Alexander N. Songorwa is director of wildlife for the Tanzanian Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism.

 BODY:
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania
ODD as it may sound, American trophy hunters play a critical role in protecting wildlife in Tanzania. The millions of dollars that hunters spend to go on safari here each year help finance the game reserves, wildlife management areas and conservation efforts in our rapidly growing country.
This is why we are alarmed that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is considering listing the African lion as endangered. Doing so would make it illegal for American hunters to bring their trophies home. Those hunters constitute 60 percent of our trophy-hunting market, and losing them would be disastrous to our conservation efforts. 
In 2011, five animal-rights and conservation groups petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the African lion as endangered, arguing that the population had fallen dangerously low because of habitat loss, poaching, commercial hunting and new diseases associated with human encroachment. ''The U.S.,'' their petition said, ''is by far the largest importer of hunting trophies from Tanzania.''
While that is true, the lion population in Tanzania is not endangered. We have an estimated 16,800 lions, perhaps 40 percent of all lions on the continent, the biggest population in the world. Their numbers are stable here, and while our hunting system is not perfect, we have taken aggressive efforts to protect our lions.
Tanzania has regulated hunting for decades; female and younger lions are completely protected, and the hunting of males is limited by quotas set for each hunting area in the country. We recently made it illegal to hunt male lions younger than 6 years old to ensure that reproductively active animals remained with their prides. And proposed amendments to our wildlife law would further crack down on the export of lions taken illegally, penalize hunting companies that violated our rules and reward those that complied.
Africa, of course, is endowed with a tremendous wealth of wildlife, and Tanzania has been particularly blessed. We have roughly 130,000 elephants, two of Africa's three largest populations of wild dogs, and spectacular landscapes like the Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater and Mount Kilimanjaro. We have placed nearly a third of our land in national parks, game reserves and wildlife management areas.
Of all the species found here, lions are particularly important because they draw visitors from throughout the world -- visitors who support our tourism industry and economy. Many of these visitors only take pictures. But others pay thousands of dollars to pursue lions with rifles and take home trophies from what is often a once-in-a-lifetime hunt. Those hunters spend 10 to 25 times more than regular tourists and travel to (and spend money in) remote areas rarely visited by photographic tourists.
In Tanzania, lions are hunted under a 21-day safari package. Hunters pay $9,800 in government fees for the opportunity. An average of about 200 lions are shot a year, generating about $1,960,000 in revenue. Money is also spent on camp fees, wages, local goods and transportation. And hunters almost always come to hunt more than one species, though the lion is often the most coveted trophy sought. All told, trophy hunting generated roughly $75 million for Tanzania's economy from 2008 to 2011.
The money helps support 26 game reserves and a growing number of wildlife management areas owned and operated by local communities as well as the building of roads, schools, hospitals and other infrastructure -- all of which are important as Tanzania continues to develop as a peaceful and thriving democracy.
If lions are listed by the United States as an endangered species, American hunters may choose to hunt other prized species outside of Africa or simply not hunt at all. This would add further strain to our already limited budgets, undo the progress we've made, and undermine our ability to conserve not only our lions but all of our wildlife.
As Tanzania's highest-ranking wildlife official, I ask on behalf of my country and all of our wildlife: do not list the African lion as endangered. Instead, help us make the most from the revenues we generate. Help us make trophy hunting more sustainable and more valuable. In short, please work with us to conserve wildlife, rather than against us, which only diminishes our capacity to protect Tanzania's global treasures.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
10 P.M. (TMC) MY LEFT FOOT (1989) Daniel Day-Lewis, in his first Oscar-winning role, portrays Christy Brown (1932-81), who was born in Dublin with cerebral palsy and learned to write and paint using the only limb he could control, his left foot. Brenda Fricker, who also won an Oscar, and Ray McAnally play Christy's parents; Ruth McCabe (above, with Mr. Day-Lewis) is the young woman he falls in love with and eventually marries; and Fiona Shaw is the doctor who largely facilitates his education in what Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, called ''an intelligent, beautifully acted adaptation'' of Mr. Brown's first book, directed by Jim Sheridan. But ''though 'My Left Foot' is blunt and tough in its presentation of Christy's handicaps, it avoids any direct criticism of the handicapped world into which he is born, one in which his mother spends most of her time being pregnant, in which poverty is as likely to make the spirit ugly as beautiful, and in which the church always has the last word.'' 
10 A.M. (Flix) CINEMA PARADISO (1990) When Salvatore (Jacques Perrin as an adult and Salvatore Cascio as a child), now a successful movie director, receives word that his old friend Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), a projectionist, has died, he recalls his days in the Sicilian village where he grew up in the postwar 1940s, and his love affair with movies. '' 'Cinema Paradiso' is stuffed with dozens of clips and other mementos that evoke the heritage of the cinema,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The Times about this movie from Giuseppe Tornatore, which won the Oscar for best foreign film. ''The film, however, evokes nothing more substantial than sentimental B-movies made by hacks in Hollywood and abroad, and which go unrecognized by Mr. Tornatore in his anthology of clips.'' He added: ''Though 'Cinema Paradiso' is certainly better, I'd rather watch a half-dozen reruns of 'Diff'rent Strokes.' Not so much magic, and the pretensions are fewer.''
10:30 A.M. (CUNY) BUILDING NY: NEW YORK STORIES Eric Ripert, the executive chef and co-owner of Le Bernardin, and the chairman of City Harvest's Food Council, talks about learning to cook in his grandmother's kitchen in France; traveling to the United States in 1989, where he served as a sous chef at the Watergate Hotel in Washington; moving to New York in 1991 to work in David Bouley's kitchen; and taking the helm at Le Bernardin after the 1994 death of Gilbert Le Coze. He also speaks about his goal of ending hunger in New York. (Repeated at 4:30 and 10:30 p.m.)
4 P.M. (CNN) THE LEAD WITH JAKE TAPPER Mr. Tapper, left, the former ABC News White House correspondent, anchors this new show, which covers financial and political news, sports and entertainment.
7 P.M. (13, 49) PBS NEWSHOUR Margaret Warner reports from the Middle East during President Obama's visit to Israel, the West Bank and Jordan. The weeklong coverage begins with a look at the new governing coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
8 P.M. (NBC) THE BIGGEST LOSER The season's contestants return to weigh in one last time before the final three participants compete for $250,000. The previously eliminated players are eligible for the $100,000 ''at home'' prize.
8 P.M. (ABC) DANCING WITH THE STARS Twelve celebrities -- Andy Dick, Dorothy Hamill, D. L. Hughley, Jacoby Jones, Wynonna Judd, Sean Lowe, Victor Ortiz, Kellie Pickler, Ingo Rademacher, Alexandra Raisman, Lisa Vanderpump and Zendaya -- trip the light fantastic in this 16th-season opener, which introduces the new professional dance partners Lindsay Arnold, Sharna Burgess and Gleb Savchenko.

HEADLINE: College Cost Scorecard: A Good Step to Transparency

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''How to Shop for College'' (editorial, March 11):
Students need accessible and accurate information to make their college decisions. The administration's college scorecard is a step forward and no doubt will be refined and strengthened. 
For example, the reported graduation rates on the scorecard don't count students who transfer to another university. About half the students in this country attend more than one school before they graduate, but only students who start full time and finish their education at the same school are counted as graduated on the scorecard.
Fortunately, the higher education community has agreed on a method of reporting graduations that will address this transfer problem and other issues to provide much more accurate graduation numbers. That information will be available on a Web site before the end of this year.
PETER McPHERSON President, Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities Washington, March 12, 2013
To the Editor:
As a complement to the federal scorecard for college costs, I suggest a ''core card,'' to help prospective students and parents figure out where their fees are actually going.
College and university expenditures are traditionally divided into six categories, of which the first two (instruction and academic support) go to the core academic mission, and the other four include housing, athletics, administration, dining and so on.
At Marlboro College in Vermont, where I am an alumna and a trustee, we don't have expensive athletics or luxury dorms, but we do have a great library and a 6-to-1 faculty-student ratio. As a result, we spend slightly under 50 percent on the core academic mission, a relatively high proportion. As a parent in tough economic times, I'd like to have that kind of information.

HEADLINE: Tax Credits or Spending? Labels. But in Congress, Fighting Words.

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a low-income neighborhood in Bozeman, Mont., taxpayers helped pay for the construction of a grocery store, Town and Country Foods. They are doing the same in New Orleans, with federal dollars helping to build new groceries, including a Whole Foods, in an area still suffering after Hurricane Katrina.
The Bozeman project relied on tax credits, while New Orleans is using federal grant money. To economists -- and to taxpayers -- that makes no real difference. ''These are at some point arbitrary distinctions between taxes and spending,'' said Donald Marron, the director of the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington research group.
But to Congress, it makes all the difference -- and is something worth fighting over. As lawmakers struggle to narrow the government's deficit, every dollar taken away from the block grant program used in New Orleans counts as a budget cut. Every dollar taken away from the Bozeman tax credit program -- part of a vast array of so-called tax expenditures that cost the federal government more than $1 trillion in lost revenue every year -- counts instead as a tax increase. 
In budget proposals put forward last week, both Democrats and Republicans called for scrubbing billions of dollars' worth of the popular deductions, loopholes, preferential rates and credits that litter the tax code, mostly benefit higher-income taxpayers and often reflect undue government interference in economic decisions. But the two sides are sharply divided what should happen to any revenue raised.
Senator Patty Murray of Washington State, the shepherd of the Senate Democratic budget proposal, proposed raising nearly $1 trillion in new revenue over the next 10 years by cutting tax expenditures and using the money to reduce the deficit. The White House has said it supports her plan.
''We don't often think of tax expenditures as a form of spending,'' Senator Murray said at a hearing this month. But, she said, ''they require us to make the same kinds of trade-offs that other forms of government spending would, and lots of them.''
In contrast, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, in the House Republican budget, insisted that any money generated from curbing tax expenditures must be offset with lower tax rates, so that overall revenue remained the same. Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee echoed that argument. ''Eliminating tax exemptions is a tax increase,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. ''You can't spin it any other way.''
At the root of the bitter semantic back-and-forth is a simple truth: every tax expenditure -- and there are scores of them, used to encourage employers to provide their workers with health care, to make houses more energy-efficient, to aid timber cutters and much more -- benefits a certain group of taxpayers or a specific industry. And nobody wants to give up anything.
For instance, as part of the January deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, stock car racetrack owners managed to secure an extension of a tax break that lets them write off investments in their properties more quickly. That break -- as lobbied for by Nascar fans -- will cost the government about $80 million over the next 10 years.
In the corporate code, expenditures are ''just a hidden, ersatz, Soviet-style five-year plan,'' said Edward Kleinbard, a longtime Congressional tax expert now at the University of Southern California. ''We would never contemplate a world in which the government said, 'We're going to write out checks to Nascar because it's an important resource and we're going to pay for it!' People would say, 'They're out of their mind!' ''
Tax expenditures also make it harder to gauge the impact of the federal budget on such crucial activities as housing and retirement security. For instance, the home mortgage interest deduction costs the Treasury about $100 billion a year in lost revenue, and effectively encourages the mostly affluent families who itemize deductions to buy a more expensive home. In contrast, the annual budget of the Housing and Urban Development Department, which generally goes to aiding the poor, is less than $50 billion.
''If someone said, 'Let's have a voucher program on the spending side, giving high-income families vouchers to subsidize their mortgages,' '' said Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School and a prominent Republican economist, referring to the home mortgage interest deduction, ''I don't think that would get through Congress.''
Spending through the tax code has also proved harder to scale back than spending through the regular appropriations process. Already, Congress has cut more than $2 trillion from health spending and the domestic and military budgets. It has hardly touched tax expenditures. For that reason, lobbyists on Capitol Hill working for specific industries often push for tax provisions, like credits, rather than straightforward federal pork.
''Spending embedded in the tax code is effectively funded before discretionary spending is considered,'' said the Government Accountability Office in one of several reports warning of the consequences of tax expenditures. ''Congress lacks the opportunity to regularly review their effectiveness.''
As a result of their pervasiveness, many individuals, businesses and communities have come to rely on tax expenditures, in some cases even more than on traditional spending programs. The new-markets tax credit used in Bozeman has helped pay for hospital wings, grocery stores, food banks and other projects.
''This is such a catalytic program,'' said Heidi DeArment, the vice president of the Montana Community Development Corporation, which assists tax credit projects in the state. ''Every program goes through the but-for test: But for this financing, this project wouldn't exist.''
Ending or curtailing more widely used tax breaks would not just be unpopular but could also destabilize certain parts of the economy. To suddenly cut the home mortgage interest deduction, for example, might damage the still-weak housing market.
But cutting many tax expenditures would do the economy as a whole a lot of good, economists argue, even lifting growth rates over the longer term. And in the struggle to wrench down long-term deficits, both Republicans and Democrats say they want to cut them.
The White House and Democrats, for example, often take aim at tax breaks that aid the oil and gas industry, or hedge fund managers. In general, however, both sides have avoided getting specific. The two budget proposals put out last week suggested hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts, without committing to any particular ones.
That is in part because threatening to take away a tax break often means starting a fight with a powerful interest group. When House Republicans and the White House contemplated curbing the deduction for charitable giving as part of the tax standoff this winter, nonprofits lobbied furiously on Capitol Hill and through the media.
Experts say the most realistic prospects are for Congress instead to put an overall cap on deductions, starting with higher-income families, or to convert deductions into tax credits. ''You can make a powerful case that itemized deductions should simply be disallowed completely,'' said Mr. Kleinbard of the University of Southern California. ''But that's too heavy a lift, and they'll start smaller.''

HEADLINE: Hacker Case Leads to Calls For Better Law

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK and CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
Matthew Keys, the 26-year-old deputy social media editor at Reuters charged with assisting computer hackers, has emerged as the latest lightning rod in the continuing battle between proponents of Internet freedom and the Justice Department.
A federal indictment of Mr. Keys filed in California on Thursday met an online cacophony of protests against the 1984 computer crime law under which he was charged, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
The indictment says that Mr. Keys, who previously worked as a Web producer at KTXL Fox 40, a Sacramento-based television station that, like The Los Angeles Times, is owned by the Tribune Company, provided a user name and password to hackers associated with the group Anonymous. Those hackers then changed a headline on a Times online article from ''Pressure Builds in House to Pass Tax-Cut Package'' to ''Pressure Builds in House to Elect CHIPPY 1337,'' a reference to another hacking group.
Each of the three charges against Mr. Keys could result in fines of as much as $250,000, with possible prison terms of as many as five years in one count and as many as 10 in the other two. The Tribune Company spent more than $5,000 to update its systems in response to the attack, the indictment says. 
The aggressive tactics by prosecutors come amid an uptick in prominent cyberattacks in recent months. Last week, President Obama met with chief executives to discuss online security, which has become a hot issue on Capitol Hill.
In Mr. Keys's case, the scale of the potential punishment relative to the actual harm caused -- the vandalism to the Web site was quickly fixed -- raised comparisons to the potential sentence in the indictment of Aaron Swartz, a 26-year-old computer programmer and Internet freedom advocate. Accused of breaking into a university system to download an archive of scholarly papers, Mr. Swartz committed suicide in January.
''Anyone horrified by the amount of jail time'' Mr. Keys faced should join in calling for Congressional reform of the computer fraud act, Trevor Timm, an advocate and blogger at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that supports an open Internet, wrote in a Twitter post on Thursday.
Still, it is not clear that an overhaul of the fraud act would change the damage charges Mr. Keys is facing. Orin S. Kerr, a former computer crimes prosecutor who now is a legal scholar at George Washington University, said that the part of the fraud act covering damage to a computer, which Mr. Keys was accused of violating, was more straightforward than the part involving authorized access, which Mr. Swartz was charged with violating; some scholars, including Mr. Kerr, have called those provisions overbroad.
Moreover, several legal specialists said that even if Mr. Keys were convicted on all three charges, they most likely would be collapsed into a single offense for purposes of calculating a sentence since they involved the same basic conduct. The sentencing guidelines would then be consulted in light of Mr. Keys's previous criminal history, if any, and the economic harm caused by the vandalism -- including any overtime or outside consultants piad to audit the system after the intrusion was discovered.
Mark Eckenwiler, a former deputy chief of the Justice Department's computer crime section, said that statutory maximums cited in department news releases are ''purely theoretical'' in most cases, and that it would be inappropriate for the department to speculate at the start of the case about what an eventual sentence would be.
''The truth is that a lot of first-time offenders may well come in the very bottom band'' of the sentencing guidelines, he said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Keys's defense team stoked the furor. ''I think hackers are the new Communists for the D.O.J.,'' Tor Ekeland, a Brooklyn-based lawyer representing Mr. Keys, said in an interview. He maintained his client's innocence and said that he intended to ''vigorously litigate'' the charges.
Jay Leiderman, a criminal defense lawyer in Ventura, Calif., known for representing computer hackers affiliated with Anonymous, is also representing Mr. Keys.
The case against Mr. Keys struck a particular nerve because of his outsize, and outspoken, online presence. A popular and at times volatile figure in the world of social media, Mr. Keys is in many ways emblematic of the new-media landscape. The writer of what was described by Time magazine as one of the 140 best Twitter feeds, Mr. Keys quickly used his feed to discuss the indictment and assure his nearly 25,000 Twitter followers that he was ''fine.''
Mr. Keys is among a coterie of young journalists adept at social media who see their stars rise quickly and often are snapped up by major media organizations, said Sree Sreenivasan, chief digital officer at Columbia.
''At a young age you can have more influence than at any time in journalistic history,'' Mr. Sreenivasan said, adding, ''and the mistakes you make at a younger age are more visible than ever before.''
A Thomson Reuters spokesman said on Friday that Mr. Keys had been suspended with pay. ''Any legal violations, or failures to comply with the company's own strict set of principles and standards, can result in disciplinary action,'' the company said in a statement, adding that Mr. Keys joined Reuters in 2012; the apparent crimes occurred in December 2010.
Supporters of Mr. Keys echoed criticism that reached a high pitch in January, when online activists accused prosecutors of trying to bully Mr. Swartz into pleading guilty. An article in Slate was posted on Friday under the headline ''Has the Justice Department Learned Anything from the Aaron Swartz Case?''
Last week Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. was questioned at a Congressional oversight hearing on whether there had been prosecutorial misconduct in the Swartz case. Mr. Holder called the case tragic but defended prosecutors' conduct, noting that they had offered Mr. Swartz several versions of a plea deal that would involve only a few months of prison time.
''I don't look at what necessarily was charged as much as what was offered in terms of how the case might have been resolved,'' Mr. Holder said.
Mr. Kerr, the former prosecutor, said the Justice Department had noted the maximum statutory punishments in news releases in part for their deterrent effect -- to dissuade others from committing similar crimes -- and not because they were realistic. ''It's mostly for show,'' Mr. Kerr said.
Anonymous, the global collective of loosely organized ''hacktivists'' who have used computer attacks to protest political causes, has recently faced particular scrutiny. In August, Higinio O. Ochoa III, a member of an offshoot of Anonymous, was sentenced to two years in prison after he pleaded guilty to defacing Web sites and stealing confidential data when he tapped into several law enforcement computers. In 2011, hackers associated with the group targeted the Sony Corporation's PlayStation online network, costing the company around $171 million.
''They're an organization that should be taken seriously, and anyone who is thinking about their network and their security should consider them a force to be reckoned with,'' said Edward Schwartz, chief security officer for RSA, the security arm of the EMC Corporation.
''There are three categories of hackers: Russian criminals trying to rob us blind; the Chinese who are trying to steal our secrets; and then there's Anonymous, and a lot of them are like merry pranksters,'' said Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at the electronic security firm Sophos. He added: ''We're treating them all the same.''
According to the F.B.I., Mr. Keys went by the name ''AESCracked'' and in Internet chat rooms offered hackers access to the Fox 40 computer systems and e-mail addresses. ''That was such a buzz having my edit on the LA Times,'' a user named ''sharpie'' suspected of being associated with Anonymous wrote, according to the indictment. Mr. Keys is said to have responded, ''Nice.''
When compared with recent attacks by Chinese hackers on media organizations including The New York Times, Mr. Keys's apparent crime is ''nothing,'' said Josh Shaul, chief technology officer at Application Security Inc., a New York-based provider of database security software. ''It's like someone handed you the keys to a building and you used them to get in.''

HEADLINE: The Unregulated Work of Mechanical Turk

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: A brave new world of computer piecework will not automatically provide opportunities for human development or dignity, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
Ever wonder what our labor market would look like without minimum wages or labor law protections? Take a look at the brave new world of online piecework platforms, like Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which allows employers, politely termed "requesters," to post jobs for a "global, on-demand, 24 x 7 work force." 
Workers are offered pay for completion of a series of Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), easily fragmented activities (like transcription, categorization or tagging) in which computers actually need assistance from carbon-based life forms like ourselves. 
Spamming and fake reviewing can be easily commissioned. For instance, I could probably pay less than 10 cents apiece for unique posted comments of at least 50 words including at least two positive superlatives on this blog. (Should I discuss this with my editors?)
Estimates of what workers can earn on these crowdsourced tasks range from about $1.20 to $5 an hour without any benefits. Employers treat them as independent contractors not covered by federal minimum-wage legislation. A standard terms-of-use agreement gives employers the freedom to reject an employee's work on any grounds; workers (oops, I mean contractors) have no easy recourse.

Mechanical Turk takes its name from an 18th-century hoax featuring a man-size Turkish puppet that could vanquish most opponents at chess with serene equanimity. Years later it was revealed that his chess table concealed a human prodigy who could manipulate the pieces from underneath with magnets. Other successful companies have adopted equally poetic names, like CrowdFlower and CrowdCloud.
What started as a niche experiment has become a major global industry. Like some other activities, like work at call centers, digital piecework represents a form of virtual labor migration that denationalizes employment. Research by Panos Ipeirotis, a computer expert at the Stern School of Business at New York University, estimates that Mechanical Turk alone engages 500,000 active workers in more than 100 countries, with workers heavily concentrated in two countries: the United States (with 50 percent of the total) and India (with 40 percent). 
About 70 percent of its employees are women, many of whom probably can't find other opportunities to work from home with flexible hours and are therefore willing to accept low wages. 
The Mechanical Turk Web site promotes itself with a quotation from a proud chief executive: "Over all, we estimate saving 50 percent over other outsourcing methods." Yet as both Zakia Uddin on Alternet and Julian Dobson on The Huffington Post point out, these labor practices haven't gotten as much attention as sweatshop practices in other countries. 
A recent Utne Reader article by the California journalist Ellen Cushing briefly profiles some of the industry's fans as well as its critics. In general, computer scientists, including Professor Ipeirotis, seem quite cheerful about its prospects for improving both efficiency and opportunities for people in developing countries who can gain access to computers. 
Low-quality wages may elicit low-quality work. But as Professor Ipeirotis points out, companies can compensate in two different ways, through redundancy (hiring several workers to do the same job and comparing their results) or through use of "gold data" - questions to which employers already know the answer, randomly inserted as a test of worker competence. 
One recent academic paper on the future of crowd work, acknowledging sweatshop anxieties, asks, "Can we foresee a future crowd workplace in which we would want our children to participate?" It does not provide a clear answer. 
Such a future can clearly be imagined. But can it be achieved? 
Workers relying on such low wages and unstable employment are not likely to be able to educate their children enough to escape increasingly high rates of unemployment. A sustainable form of crowdsourcing will require forms of collective governance that mitigate the effects of market competition on those treated as mere links in a chain of algorithmic logic. 
In other words, it will require some assurance of human rights, including access to decent employment, living wages and high-quality public education.
Computers don't care whether they have meaningful opportunities for the development of their potential capabilities. Most humans do. If they had such opportunities, they would not be willing to crawl under a table and create the illusion of an eternally smiling, amazingly intelligent global machine. They would not be willing to get turked.

HEADLINE: SAC Looks on the Bright Side

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: SAC Capital sees the positive in a $616 million settlement of two insider trading suits. | A Senate hearing on JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s huge trading loss shines a spotlight on Jamie Dimon. | Shares of big banks fell on news that a bailout for Cyprus would require depositors to share the cost. | Lloyd C. Blankfein has gained a daughter-in-law. 

 BODY:
SAC LOOKS ON THE BRIGHT SIDE | The $616 million fine against SAC Capital Advisors that was announced on Friday by the Securities and Exchange Commission would be enough to cripple some hedge funds. But SAC saw the positive in the penalty, which settles two insider trading lawsuits brought by the government, DealBook's Peter Lattman writes. The $15 billion hedge fund said in a statement that the settlements were "a substantial step toward resolving all outstanding regulatory matters."
 Some investors also cheered the development, as it removed the fund's exposure to litigation against two former employees. The Blackstone Group, whose $550 million investment makes it SAC's largest outside client, views the settlements favorably, Mr. Lattman reports. But it is still too early to say what Blackstone will decide to do come the mid-May deadline to ask for its money back, a person familiar with Blackstone's thinking said. 
Rival hedge fund managers and securities lawyers criticized the settlements of $602 million and $14 million as too weak, even though the S.E.C. called the larger penalty the biggest settlement ever of an insider trading case. "While $616 million would normally be a massive penalty, for Cohen this is basically a drop in the bucket," said Bradley D. Simon, a criminal defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor in New York. "There is also no debarment or admission of wrongdoing."
DIMON'S CLOUT IS QUESTIONED | The Senate hearing on Friday over JPMorgan Chase's huge trading loss shines an uncomfortable spotlight on Jamie Dimon, the bank's influential chief executive. Though Mr. Dimon was not present while his top lieutenants were being questioned, the hearing and the Senate panel's report could create fresh challenges for an executive long considered an expert manager of risk, Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook.
Some investors and even members of the bank's board are becoming frustrated with Mr. Dimon's "off-putting arrogance," as one shareholder put it. Mr. Dimon is not likely to face a serious threat to his power. Still, two board members are concerned about the repercussions of Mr. Dimon's comments last April that dismissed the disastrous trades as a "tempest in a teapot," people briefed on the board's thinking said. "The concern is that those statements - made months after Mr. Dimon learned the trades had breached the firm's internal alarm system hundreds of times, according to the Senate report - could put the bank in a precarious situation with regulators investigating the trades," DealBook writes.
"And government officials who would speak only anonymously say that Mr. Dimon, faulted in the Senate report for strong-arming regulators, is also losing sway with some authorities in Washington."
STOCKS FALL ON CYPRUS BAILOUT | Shares of big banks fell on Monday after the announcement this weekend that bank depositors in Cyprus would be required to share the cost of a European bailout. HSBC fell more than 2 percent in Hong Kong trading, and Standard Chartered was down about 2 percent in trading in London.
The scene in Cyprus was chaotic. "The euro fell sharply against major currencies ahead of the action, as investors around the world absorbed the implications of Europe's move," Liz Alderman and Landon Thomas Jr. write in The New York Times.
European Union leaders are proposing a 6.75 percent tax on deposits of up to 100,000 euros to help pay for the bailout. Nicos Anastasiades, the Cypriot president, who said he was trying to persuade the leaders to modify those demands, described in apocalyptic detail what might happen if Cyprus did not approve the rescue: a "complete collapse of the banking sector," major losses for businesses and depositors and a possible exit for Cyprus from the euro zone.
ON THE AGENDA | Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany holds a press briefing in Berlin with President Franois Hollande of France at 1:45 p.m. Peter Orszag, a former White House budget director and current Citigroup executive, is on Bloomberg TV at 8:10 a.m. Bart Chilton of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is on CNBC at 8:30 a.m. The analyst Meredith Whitney is on CNBC at 4:10 p.m.
A BLANKFEIN WEDDING | Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has gained a daughter-in-law. Mr. Blankfein's son, Alexander, 27, was married on Saturday at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami, in an outdoor ceremony beneath a huppah and a canopy of trees. The bride, Cristina Mercedes Ros, 26, is a founder of Circle of Women, a group in Cambridge, Mass., that promotes women's education. The couple met at Harvard, where they are both pursuing M.B.A. degrees, according to an item in The New York Times. Rabbi Judy Kempler officiated the ceremony. The groom is to become a consultant at Bain & Company in September, according to The Times.
Among the guests at the wedding was Joshua Kushner, founder of the venture capital firm Thrive Capital. Mr. Kushner, son of the real estate developer Charles Kushner and brother of Jared Kushner, owner of The New York Observer, was Mr. Blankfein's roommate when they were undergraduates at Harvard.

"The recession is the thing that's absolutely causing this," said Kevin Cunningham, a 37-year-old animal lover who _____ the National Exotic Animal Sanctuary after he left his job at a Dublin nightclub. He has transformed an old single-room schoolhouse near Ballivor, a hamlet in the Meath countryside, _____ a reptile sanctuary.
"It was about status," Mr. Cunningham said as he waved to a four-foot red iguana that was found under a sink in an _____ house in Dublin. "During the boom, people _____ these animals as conversation starters."

"In the Tiger economy," said P. J. Doyle, a reptile expert, "young people could pay 600 quid for a snake" and the _____ equipment - about $700 to $1,000 during much of the boom. But these days, he said, some owners "just drive up and _____ them somewhere."
Mr. Doyle, a hulking man with weathered skin and a gap between his teeth, helped the cruelty prevention society _____ for an influx of reptiles around, of all dates, St. Patrick's Day, when the warmer spring weather _____ that the coldblooded snakes will be more active and more likely to show themselves.
"We always get a bump in calls around Paddy's Day," Gillian Bird, the education officer at the society, said as she pet Carl, a green iguana from South America that she named after a colleague's boyfriend.
Irish legend holds that the country has no native snakes because St. Patrick _____ them in the fifth century. But science says the country was snake-free long before Patrick's time. When the glaciers of the most recent ice age retreated from the British Isles more than 10,000 years ago, Ireland was already separated from the rest of Europe by open sea, an isolated ecosystem with a damp, chilly climate that is _____ to almost all reptiles, other than a common lizard.

HEADLINE: With a Big If, Science Panel Finds Deep Cuts Possible in Auto Emissions and Oil Use

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A panel finds that a blend of intensified research and strong policy could take a big bite out of oil use and CO2 emissions. 

 BODY:
A panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences has concluded that deep cuts in oil use and emissions of greenhouse gases from cars and light trucks are possible in the United States by 2050, but only with a mix of diverse and intensified research and policies far stronger than those pursued so far by the Obama administration. 
Sadly, much of the report has a "same as it ever was" feel, including a push for "feebates" on efficient vehicles balanced by a surcharge on gas guzzlers (something I wrote about in my 1992 book on global warming): 
"Feebates," rebates to purchasers of high-fuel-economy (i.e., miles per gallon [mpg]) vehicles balanced by a tax on low-mpg vehicles is a complementary policy that would assist manufacturers in selling the more-efficient vehicles produced to meet fuel economy standards.
The report also describes the merits of a gasoline tax or "price floor" on petroleum-based fuels: 
Several types of policies including a price floor for petroleum-based fuels or taxes on petroleum-based fuels could create a price signal against petroleum demand, assure producers and distributors that there is a profitable market for alternative fuels, and encourage consumers to reduce their use of petroleum-based fuels. High fuel prices, whether due to market dynamics or taxes, are effective in reducing fuel use.
For related reading, see "A Conservative's Case for a Gas Tax" (2011), "Fuel Taxes Must Rise, Harvard Researchers Say" (2010; Rush Limbaugh didn't like this one), "A 2-Cent Solution to Help Fuel an Energy Quest" (2010) and "Selling Fuel-Sipping Cars Despite $2 Gas" (2009).
Here's an excerpt from the National Academies news release: 
A new National Research Council report finds that by the year 2050, the U.S. may be able to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent for light-duty vehicles - cars and small trucks - via a combination of more efficient vehicles; the use of alternative fuels like biofuels, electricity, and hydrogen; and strong government policies to overcome high costs and influence consumer choices. While achieving these goals will be difficult, improving technologies driven by strong and effective policies could make deep reductions possible.
"To reach the 2050 goals for reducing petroleum use and greenhouse gases, vehicles must become dramatically more efficient, regardless of how they are powered," said Douglas M. Chapin, principal of MPR Associates, and chair of the committee that wrote the report. "In addition, alternative fuels to petroleum must be readily available, cost-effective and produced with low emissions of greenhouse gases. Such a transition will be costly and require several decades. The committee's model calculations, while exploratory and highly uncertain, indicate that the benefits of making the transition, i.e. energy cost savings, improved vehicle technologies, and reductions in petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions, exceed the additional costs of the transition over and above what the market is willing to do voluntarily."
Improving the efficiency of conventional vehicles is, up to a point, the most economical and easiest-to-implement approach to saving fuel and lowering emissions, the report says. This approach includes reducing work the engine must perform - reducing vehicle weight, aerodynamic resistance, rolling resistance, and accessories - plus improving the efficiency of the internal combustion engine powertrain.
Improved efficiency alone will not meet the 2050 goals, however. The average fuel economy of vehicles on the road would have to exceed 180 mpg, which, the report says, is extremely unlikely with current technologies. Therefore, the study committee also considered other alternatives for vehicles and fuels, including:

        
hybrid electric vehicles, such as the Toyota Prius;
        
plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Volt;
        
battery electric vehicles, such as the Nissan Leaf;
        
hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, such as the Mercedes F-Cell, scheduled to be introduced about 2014; and
        
compressed natural gas vehicles, such as the Honda Civic Natural Gas.
Although driving costs per mile will be lower, especially for vehicles powered by natural gas or electricity, the high initial purchase cost is likely to be a significant barrier to widespread consumer acceptance, the report says. All the vehicles considered are and will continue to be several thousand dollars more expensive than today's conventional vehicles. Additionally, particularly in the early years, the report predicts that alternative vehicles will likely be limited to a few body styles and sizes; some will rely on fuels that are not readily available or have restricted travel range; and others may require bulky energy storage that will limit their cargo and passenger capacity. Wide consumer acceptance is essential, however, and large numbers of alternative vehicles must be purchased long before 2050 if the on-road fleet is to meet desired performance goals. Strong policies and technology advances are critical in overcoming this challenge.
The report identified several scenarios that could meet the more demanding 2050 greenhouse gas goal. Each combines highly efficient vehicles with at least one of three alternative power sources - biofuel, electricity, or hydrogen. Natural gas vehicles were considered, but their greenhouse gas emissions are too high for the 2050 goal. However, if the costs of these vehicles can be reduced and appropriate refueling infrastructure created, they have great potential for reducing petroleum consumption.
While corn-grain ethanol and biodiesel are the only biofuels to have been produced in commercial quantities in the U.S. to date, the study committee found much greater potential in biofuels made from lignocellulosic biomass - which includes crop residues like wheat straw, switchgrass, whole trees, and wood waste. This "drop-in" fuel is designed to be a direct replacement for gasoline and could lead to large reductions in both petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions; it can also be introduced without major changes in fuel delivery infrastructure or vehicles. The report finds that sufficient lignocellulosic biomass could be produced by 2050 to meet the goal of an 80 percent reduction in petroleum use when combined with highly efficient vehicles.

HEADLINE: The Labor Agenda

BYLINE: TERESA TRITCH


HIGHLIGHT: Thomas Perez has what it takes to be an outstanding labor secretary. But will Mr. Obama let him do his job? 

 BODY:
Unemployment is persistently high. Wages are low. Inequality is rising. Employee bargaining power is decreasing. The lack of good jobs and the dearth of opportunities cast doubt on any and all indications of economic recovery. 
Against that backdrop, President Obama has nominated Thomas E. Perez, currently an assistant attorney general, to be the next secretary of labor. Mr. Perez, by all indications, is an excellent choice. He has proven leadership qualities and the requisite experience - in terms of both personal history and professional accomplishments.
The question is whether Mr. Obama is committed to a forceful labor agenda.
Mr. Perez, 51, is the son of immigrants, a Harvard-educated lawyer who worked his way through college and a public servant who has served in many local, state and federal roles. As secretary of Maryland's Department of Labor from 2006 to 2009 he led early efforts to investigate and combat the devastating impact of foreclosures on working families; he also successfully spearheaded legislation to crack down on the misclassification of employees in Maryland as independent contractors, a label that was often misused by employers to deny fair pay and benefits.

At the federal level, he has led the civil rights departments of both the Department of Health and Human Services and, from 2009 to present, the Department of Justice, where he has aggressively handled cases on fair lending discrimination, police abuse, human trafficking and voting rights. (A recent report on personnel problems in D.O.J's voting rights division will surely be a point of contention from Republicans at his confirmation hearing, even though the report notes that the problems predated Mr. Perez.)
In all his roles, Mr. Perez has displayed an ethos and a skill set that reflects the mission of the Labor Department, namely, to bring the force and protections of the law to bear in upholding and advancing the rights and opportunities of working people.
In announcing the nomination, Mr. Obama said that Mr. Perez would be a key member of his economic team. In the first term, however, the labor secretary, Hilda Solis, was all but ignored. Economic growth and job creation received lip service. But early pushes in those directions - including the stimulus, the auto rescue and health care reform - were not sustained. Instead, bank recovery and deficit reduction emerged as higher priorities, while specific labor goals have gone unmet. Mr. Obama campaigned on a higher minimum wage in 2008, but officially put the issue on his agenda only last January. He failed to keep a 2008 campaign promise to advance legislation to make it easier for workers to unionize. Long awaited workplace regulations, including those to protect construction workers from silica dust and to grant minimum wage and overtime protections to home care workers have been held up at the White House.
Mr. Perez has what it takes to be an outstanding labor secretary. Will Mr. Obama give him the clout he needs to be the public force and face of a renewed labor agenda?

HEADLINE: Evangelical Groups Call for Path to Citizenship in Immigration Overhaul

BYLINE: JULIA PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: A coalition including some of the nation&#8217;s largest evangelical Christian organizations said on Monday that Congress should include &#8220;clear steps to citizenship&#8221; for illegal immigrants in any bill to overhaul the immigration system. 

 BODY:
A coalition including some of the nation's largest evangelical Christian organizations said on Monday that Congress should include "clear steps to citizenship" for illegal immigrants in any bill to overhaul the immigration system. 
The group, the Evangelical Immigration Table, issued a statement of principles calling for an eventual path to citizenship for immigrants who would gain legal status under proposals that lawmakers in both houses of Congress are considering. "This call is rooted in our biblically informed commitment to human freedom and dignity," the group said. 
While the coalition has previously expressed support for comprehensive changes to immigration laws, including paths to legal status for those in the country illegally, the statement on Monday was the first time the evangelical groups, most of them politically conservative, have explicitly endorsed a pathway to citizenship. The groups include the National Association of Evangelicals, the largest national umbrella organization; the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission; Liberty Counsel, a Christian legal advocacy group; and two national organizations of Hispanic evangelical Christians. 
The evangelical groups' statement came as the Republican National Committee released a soul-searching report on growth strategies that urged Republicans to change their tone and policies on immigration to recover lost ground among Hispanic voters. The report said the party should "embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform."
"If we do not," the report warned, "our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only." The report's mention of comprehensive reform suggested that Republican strategists were endorsing some kind of legal status for illegal immigrants, but it did not take a position on whether to offer them citizenship, a point of tense debate within the party.
A bipartisan group in the Senate, which has been meeting to craft a bill, has agreed on offering a path to citizenship, although discussions are still under way on how long it should be and what hurdles immigrants would pass along the way. The evangelical leaders did not specify how long a path they would advocate. They said illegal immigrants should first attain a provisional status, passing background checks and paying fines or doing community service. Immigrants would then become eligible for permanent resident green cards, the first step toward citizenship, after a "period of feasible years," the evangelical principles said.
Robert Gittelson, president of Conservatives for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, said on a conference call Monday with evangelical leaders that a 13-year path to citizenship, which the senators are debating and President Obama has proposed, would be "rigorous but somewhat appropriate."
The evangelicals' message is likely to be controversial in the House, where many Republicans have said they want a plan that would give legal status to immigrants who lack it, but would stop short of citizenship.
The evangelical leaders said they have encountered little resistance from Christian congregations to their immigration policy. Galen Carey, vice president of government relations for the National Association of Evangelicals, said on the call that "quite a remarkable degree of consensus is growing" among evangelicals in favor of comprehensive legislation, a major shift on the issue, he said, in the last few years.

HEADLINE: What the Cyprus Bailout Could Mean for Europe's Debt

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Some economists say that they are optimistic about reducing Europe&#8217;s debt levels after leaders took controversial steps in the Cyprus bailout. 

 BODY:
The Cyprus bailout is perhaps an even bigger deal than it first seemed, and not for bad reasons.
When Europe announced details of its efforts to rescue Cyprus, it was immediately seen as contentious. The bailout imposes a tax on bank deposits to help pay the cost of shoring up the country's fragile finances. The plan doesn't just aim at foreign depositors, largely Russians, who have placed money in Cyprus's bloated banking sector; it is also expected to hit ordinary Cypriot savers who thought their government was backstopping their deposits.
As things stand, Cypriots with smaller savings will pay a smaller percentage on their money than people or companies with larger amounts deposited at Cypriot banks. 
 But the fact that Europe's leaders blessed depositor haircuts at all has relevance well beyond Cyprus. It shows that the European Union is still grappling for ways to reduce the region's debt levels, a process known as de-leveraging. Some experts think Europe's economy and employment levels won't grow in earnest until debt is substantially reduced. As a result, they are, with some reservations, optimistic after the moves taken in Cyprus. 
"You will not have a recovery in the euro zone that puts a serious dent in unemployment unless we get a de-leveraging," said Willem H. Buiter, senior economist at Citigroup. "The bad news is that in Cyprus, they went about it in a stupid way by including small depositors."
After the 2008 financial crisis, the governments of Europe and the United States faced the same problem: What to do with the large amounts of dubious debt in their economies? They couldn't just default on large amounts of it, as that could create a cycle of panic and even greater economic pain. But just leaving the debt pile at close to its original size could stifle economic activity and create doubts about the financial sector's viability. 
The United States in some ways had it easier. Most of its bad debt was related to housing. The cascade of mortgage defaults reduced housing debt in the economy, providing some relief. And American authorities tried to quickly offset the pain and panic those defaults set off with fiscal and monetary stimulus.
But in Europe, the problem was more complex. Government debt levels, rather than subprime mortgage debt, has been the main issue. There, reducing government debt has the potential to be far more destabilizing than restructuring private obligations. 
Even so, Europe eventually blessed haircuts on Greece's government debt, because those obligations were egregiously burdensome. At the same time, however, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have wanted to get Ireland and Portugal through the crisis without default. And the European Central Bank moved forcefully last year to head off government debt routs in Italy and Spain. 
This approach means the sovereign debt pile remains a brooding burden on the Continent. Recent events show that some of Europe's policy makers are not comfortable with this. When the opportunity arises, they look for ways to impose haircuts on debt. 
Bank debt has come into the cross hairs. Bank debt can become government debt if a government decides to take over an ailing bank without applying haircuts to the bank's creditors, as happened on a large scale in Ireland. 
In recent months, the Netherlands and Spain have forced losses on so-called junior bank creditors during bailouts. But in doing so, they spared senior bondholders, who have a higher standing in the credit pecking order and lend far more to banks than the junior bondholders. The fear was that hitting senior bondholders could stoke contagion.
But with Cyprus, the treatment of depositors show that the haircut is back with a vengeance. There are reasons specific to Cyprus for this. If Europe had paid the full bailout bill itself, it would have meant adding even more to Cyprus's government debt. It would also have prompted outrage. A large share of Cypriot bank deposits are from Russians, who may have parked their money there to avoid money laundering screens in other countries. The country's banks have $27 billion of foreign deposits, according to the central bank of Cyprus. Moody's Investors Service estimated last year that there were $19 billion of Russian deposits in Cyprus. 
Despite the situation in Cyprus, Europe's approach has deepened the fear that bank creditors stand a greater chance of being targets in future bailouts. "This is quite a significant step to impose losses on any sort of senior bank creditor," said Alastair Wilson, chief credit officer at Moody's Investors Service, who views depositors as a type of senior creditor. "It raises the possibility that they'll do it elsewhere."
There are powerful forces that will resist any attempts to force losses on debt issued by European banks and governments. They have persuasive arguments. Haircuts can set off panics and that may deepen the cost of a rescue. 
But the counter case is that, by not aggressively cutting bank debt, the financial system in Europe remains vulnerable. In the euro zone, bank liabilities are equivalent to around 320 percent of the region's economy. In the United States, that ratio is much smaller at 83 percent. What is more, once new laws come in that are intended to make haircuts more orderly, the likelihood of panic may diminish. 
"Europe is blundering toward a much-enhanced level of senior bank debt restructuring and sovereign debt restructuring," Mr. Buiter, the economist, said. "The recognition of reality in Europe can be a drawn-out process."

HEADLINE: A Bank Levy in Cyprus, and Why Not to Worry

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Analysts were breathless waiting for impending disaster from the bailout in Cyprus. But nothing bad happened. 

 BODY:
Never mind.
The last 72 hours have been filled with breathless proclamations of impending disaster after the European Union and International Monetary Fund indicated that they planned to take money directly from depositors with bank accounts in Cyprus as part of a bailout of that country.
Analysts and politicians compared the bailout plan, the first to include a levy on deposits that were considered to be insured, to government-sponsored larceny, and said it would cause a run on banks across Europe, if not a full-fledged global crisis. 
"The very nature of banking has been shaken to its roots with this decision, for banking depends upon trust," Dennis Gartman, the investor, wrote in a note to his clients. "Trust that has now been shattered; torn asunder, broken ... destroyed."
Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, called the decision an "astonishing move" with "little thought of contagion to the rest of the euro zone, and indeed perhaps the world."
Mark J. Grant, a market commentator who has been predicting an economic apocalypse in Europe for years, went so far as to compare the terms of the bailout with "rape." He said: "Pay attention please. The European Union and the European Central Bank and the I.M.F. have just advocated the confiscation of private property for their own indulgence."
Even President Vladimir Putin of Russia got into the debate, given that much of the deposits in Cypriot banks are Russian. "Mr. Putin said that such a decision, if adopted, would be unfair, unprofessional and dangerous," a spokesman said.
And yet here we are. And, well, nothing bad has happened.
There have been no re-enactments of "It's a Wonderful Life," with people lined up around banks in Italy or Spain - considered the next dominoes, if you believe the doomsayers. The stock markets in Europe dropped less than 1 percent. In the United States, investors shrugged their shoulders, too.
Why?
While the bailout of Cyprus is a fascinating case study and raises interesting theoretical questions about moral hazard for policy wonks and talking heads, here is the reality: It is largely irrelevant to the global economy. Cyprus is tiny; its economy is smaller than Vermont's. And the bailout is worth a paltry $13 billion, the equivalent of pocket lint for those in the bailout game.
Even the larger issue about bailing out a country by taking money from depositors - which quickly created outrage around the world - seems overblown.
The worry is that the European Union and I.M.F. have created a dangerous precedent by making depositors share in the pain of the bailout. Historically, the goal of bailouts has been to raise confidence in banks so depositors don't flee. The approach in Cyprus is at odds with that notion, raising questions about whether future bailouts in countries like Spain and Italy - if they are needed - could affect depositors.
The alarmist thinking is that depositors will move their money from troubled banks, creating a death spiral.
Even in the United States, some commentators used the Cyprus bailout as a scare tactic about what they speculated could eventually happen here.
"An executive order issued by the president to debit taxpayer bank accounts during a future financial emergency is entirely possible," Andrew Gause, author of "The Secret World of Money," said in a news release.
But, in truth, the smart money knows that the bailout of Cyprus says very little about future actions.
"I would assume that anyone in Spain, Portugal or elsewhere who knows about the taxation of Cypriot depositors also would know that the Cypriot banking system is a very different animal than anywhere else in the euro zone," Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit, wrote in a note to clients.
Mr. O'Neill of Goldman also acknowledged: "I am sure it will not set a precedent."
Cyprus is unique. Besides being tiny, its banking system looks different from those in most other countries. Much of the big money deposited in its banks is from foreign investors, including Russians who have long been suspected of money laundering. Those investors had fair warning that Cypriot banks were troubled. The issue has been simmering for six months. But those investors left their money in the bank, in part because they were gambling that the banks would be bailed out at no cost to them. If the current plan is approved, depositors will have lost that bet.
Worse, the strategy employed in the bailout of Greece - in which bondholders of its sovereign debt were paid less than face value - will not work in Cyprus. Cyprus's banks own much of the country's debt, so any effort to reduce that debt by forcing debt holders to accept less would only make the banks more troubled.
Given the brutal history between Russia and so much of Europe - and speculation that so much of the money is ill gotten - it is clear why it would be so politically unpalatable to countries in the euro zone, Germany in particular, to bail out Russian depositors. And even if the move were to create a run on the banks in Cyprus, the contagion would be limited.
There is very little chance that politicians would ever choose to use the model they developed in Cyprus in a country like Italy or Spain, where a run on the banks would have such profound implications. By the way, if you're wondering why investors left so much money in troubled Cypriot banks, here's a trivia question: Would you have been better off leaving your money in a bank in the United States or in Cyprus over the last five years?
The answer: You would have been better off in Cyprus, even after the bailout, when your money was "confiscated." If you had 100,000 euros in a Cypriot bank account over the last five years, where the interest rate has averaged about 5 percent, you would have about 127,600 euros today. Even after the bailout, which would require you to give up 10 percent of your deposit - 12,760 euros - you would be left with 114,840 euros. The American bank? The $100,000 you deposited at Bank of America five years ago is about $105,100, at the going rate of about 1 percent interest a year.

HEADLINE: American Honda Divides Its Biggest Ad Assignments

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: One of the largest recent reviews for an advertising account has ended with the incumbent agency keeping a significant part of the assignment, but relinquishing two large pieces to other agencies. 

 BODY:
One of the largest recent reviews for an advertising account has ended with the incumbent agency keeping a significant part of the assignment, but relinquishing two large pieces to two other agencies.
The American Honda Motor Company, based in Torrance, Calif., said on Monday evening that it had concluded the review, which began in early December, with a split decision. The company, part of the Honda Motor Company Ltd. of Japan, spends more than $1.1 billion a year on advertising in the United States.
When the review began, RPA, an agency in Santa Monica, Calif., handled the creative assignments for the company's two automotive brands, Honda and Acura, as well as the media planning and buying duties - that is, deciding where ads run and negotiating over how much to pay for them - for both. 
RPA will keep creating ads for the Honda brand, American Honda Motor decided, but the task of creating ads for the Acura brand will be shifted to Mullen, an agency in Boston that is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. Mullen has previously created ads for automotive brands like BMW.
RPA, which is independent, and Mullen were among four creative agencies that were finalists in the American Honda Motor review. The others were another Interpublic agency, the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., and a Los Angeles agency, 72andSunny, which is part of MDC Partners.
The media planning and buying duties are leaving RPA for MediaVest, a giant media-specialist agency that is part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe. MediaVest competed in the review against media agencies that included Horizon Media and the PHD division of the Omnicom Group.

The review did not affect American Honda Motor's relationship with two agencies that create ads aimed at consumers who are members of minority groups.
Those agencies are Muse Communications in Culver City, Calif., which creates ads aimed at African-American and Asian-American consumers, and La Agencia de Orci & Asociados in Los Angeles, which creates ads aimed at Hispanic consumers.
All five agencies will be part of a new structure being created by American Honda Motor, which is to place the company at the center of what it calls a team of agency partners. The agencies will have space at the company's office in Torrance that they can use in addition to their own offices.
"We are creating a new and highly collaborative path forward that will yield outstanding creative and enable us to focus more of our marketing investment in communicating with our customers," Michael Accavitti, vice president for national marketing operations at American Honda Motor, said in a statement.
RPA had been the Acura brand's creative agency since 1999. And RPA has created Honda brand advertising since it opened as Rubin Postaer & Associates in 1986, spun off from what had been the Los Angeles office of the agency known as Needham Harper & Steers and also Needham Harper Worldwide.
(The Needham Harper office began creating Honda ads in 1974. So depending on how lineage is traced, it could be said that RPA and its predecessors have been working on Honda for 39 years.)
RPA has other clients in addition to American Honda Motor, among them Farmers Insurance and La-Z-Boy. Adage.com, citing executives familiar with the matter, said the American Honda Motor account had represented more than half the agency's total business.

HEADLINE: Does China Have a Foreign Policy?

BYLINE: By ZHENG WANG. 
Zheng Wang, an associate professor of diplomacy and international relations at Seton Hall University and a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, is the author of ''Never Forget National Humiliation: Historical Memory in Chinese Politics and Foreign Relations.''

 BODY:
Shanghai
WHILE many Western analysts focus on the balance of reformers and conservatives in China's new leadership, most overlook the absence of career diplomats and foreign affairs experts at the highest level of power in Beijing.
China is rising as a global power, but the position that foreign policy occupies in the Chinese political system is very low.
On Saturday, the government, led by the new Chinese president, Xi Jinping, announced its new foreign policy team. 
Yang Jiechi, the foreign minister since 2007, was elevated to the State Council. His successor, Wang Yi, has overseen relations with Taiwan and Japan and represented China in talks with the West over North Korea's nuclear program. China also named a new ambassador to the United States: Cui Tiankai, a career diplomat and a graduate of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
However, neither Mr. Yang, who will continue to oversee foreign relations, nor Mr. Wang, the new foreign minister, is among the 25 members of the Politburo -- the power center of Chinese politics.
None of the seven members of the even more powerful Politburo Standing Committee -- which includes Mr. Xi and the new prime minister, Li Keqiang -- is a foreign policy expert, though one of them, Wang Qishan, has worked closely with the last two Treasury secretaries of the United States, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Timothy F. Geithner, in coordinating the response to the global economic crisis of 2007-8.
China watchers have a tendency to overstate the sophistication of Beijing's foreign policy and ambitions, but the truth is that China's foreign policy is highly deficient. While the outsiders often see China as a rising giant and a threat, Chinese leaders are in fact largely nervous and insecure, uncertain of how to manage, both at home and abroad, the inevitable tensions that arise from their nation's rapid ascent on the world stage. For the newly ''elected'' leaders, their first challenge would be how to fill the foreign policy vacuum and how to solve the country's choice between nationalism and globalism.
Words like ''aggressive,'' ''assertive'' and ''arrogant'' have been used to describe China's foreign policy, particularly with respect to its protracted war of words with Japan over a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea.
However, a country's foreign policy should be judged on the basis of its actions as well as its rhetoric. When we conduct a careful examination of Chinese policies and actions, we see that Chinese foreign policy is actually ambivalent, even weak. Beijing does not have a clear and well-developed policy on many issues, from the disputed islands to North Korea to climate change. Strong rhetoric is often used to compensate for weak or incoherent policies.
In fact, China's bark is often far worse than its bite: China has not been at war with another country since a brief armed conflict with Vietnam in 1979, and has been very cautious in its dealings with its neighbors who occupy islands claimed by China in the South China Sea. This explains why Chinese nationalists have at times criticized the government's foreign policy for being as soft and accommodating.
The absence of clear policy also partly explains why China lacks decisive influence even over strategic allies who depend most on its support, like North Korea, Myanmar and Pakistan. North Korea's recent nuclear test and decision to nullify the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War is but the latest example. If a country does not have a clear foreign policy, it will not know when, where and how to use its power. It cannot provide a road map for its allies to follow.
Behind this foreign policy vacuum is a dual crisis of identity. First, Beijing is not prepared to take on the bigger role that other countries expect it to play. Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi's predecessor as president, was the first Chinese leader who had to run a China that had truly become a full member of the international system. Beijing still needs time to adjust to its new status as a world power and absorb the radical economic, social and cultural transformation it has experienced in recent decades.
Second, the Chinese political elite is facing a major conflict between domestic politics and foreign policy. On the one hand, the leadership strategically allows nationalism to flare, now and again, to serve the regime's domestic needs to increase its legitimacy and internal cohesion. On the other hand, the often crudely jingoistic nationalism makes it more and more difficult to be cooperative and professional in China's diplomatic dealings.
Since the early 1990s, as a nominally socialist regime shifted to free-market authoritarianism, the Chinese Communist Party has turned to nationalism as a playing card to maintain its control. This propaganda has included a ''patriotic education'' campaign focused on China's humiliating modern history with the West -- a curriculum that, of course, portrays the party as the solution to a weak, divided China.
At the same time, China has actually bravely embraced globalization. Even before joining the World Trade Organization, in 2001, it was arguably the greatest beneficiary of globalization. Its giant trade surpluses and enormous reserves of foreign currency -- especially American dollars -- have provided the government with huge resources for multiple tasks, from a large stimulus program following the global financial crisis to the suppression of domestic unrest.
The new Chinese leadership will be tempted to please its domestic base by adopting more nationalistic foreign policies. China has many domestic troubles, from corruption to a slowing economy. However, the new leaders have to make sure that they fully understand the consequences of China's heading down a path of nationalism.
China is highly dependent on the global market, resources, investment and technology. A more nationalistic, hard-line route would inevitably cause more conflict and direct confrontation with China's neighbors, even to the point of war. Such an outcome would severely set back China's desire to assume a role it believes should be commensurate with its wealth and size.
The challenge is for China's diplomats, who are not represented at the highest echelons of power in Beijing, to make clear to the government how shortsighted and unwise a confrontational foreign policy strategy would be. I hope this is the first foreign policy advice that President Xi gets from his advisers.

HEADLINE: Budget Cuts and the Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''As Automatic Budget Cuts Go Into Effect, Poor May Be Hit Particularly Hard'' (news article, March 4): 
While this article may be a shock to many, faith leaders from the Circle of Protection have been tirelessly advocating for our elected officials to protect those living in poverty in the budget debates of the last several years. The critical entitlement programs serving low-income Americans that are protected in the sequester is evidence of the faith coalition's effectiveness.
While certain low-income programs are shielded from cuts, that the sequester has taken effect is a moral tragedy. Rather than pursue the common good, Washington is focused on the politics of who is to blame for the collective failure.
Our elected leaders should listen to the voice of the faith community and all the other advocates for the poor and vulnerable. The partisan bickering and economic brinkmanship must end. A balanced solution to our fiscal challenges that reduces the deficit, protects the poor, grows our economy and replaces poverty with opportunity is urgently needed.

HEADLINE: The Great Aid Gap

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
IT was an unusually enthusiastic shout-out for the job certificate programs offered by many community colleges. A report found that men with nondegree certificates in computer/information services earned $72,498 a year on average -- more money than 72 percent of men with associate's degrees and more than 54 percent of men with bachelor's degrees.
That study, completed this past June by work force experts at Georgetown University, also found that women with such certificates earned more money than 75 percent of women with associate's degrees and 64 percent of women with bachelor's degrees.
Certificates are the fastest-growing form of postsecondary credential, the Georgetown study said, prized by employers for equipping workers with skills in high demand. Last year, the nation's colleges awarded one million such certificates -- more than triple the 300,000 awarded in 1994 and more than one-fifth of all postsecondary credentials awarded last year. 
But as certificates grow in number and importance, many educators are calling attention to what they see as an overlooked problem in the nation's efforts to upgrade workers' skills and deal with soaring higher-education costs: Federal financial aid goes overwhelmingly to students in traditional degree programs, while little goes to the many students in noncredit certificate programs who may need it more. As many employers complain of difficulty finding applicants with the proper skills, many educators and economists say the government should make it easier for students to take certificate programs.
''There's an estimated 80 million people out there in the work force who could benefit from coming back and gaining some form of postsecondary credential,'' said James L. Applegate, vice president for program development at the Lumina Foundation. ''A lot of them are interested in work-force-aligned credentials.''
Students and educators alike say the unavailability of financial aid prevents many from even entering these programs, which not only bolster students' employability but, economists say, America's overall competitiveness. Federal financial aid, like Pell grants, is not available to students who take noncredit courses, and many certificate programs, whether to be a certified nurse's aide or to fix air-conditioners and heating systems, are not for credit.
Suri Duitch, dean of continuing education at the City University of New York, said federal programs often treated certificate students like second-class citizens. ''These programs are less expensive than the degree programs at many four-year schools, but this student population generally has fewer resources,'' said Ms. Duitch, whose university has more than 220,000 students in nondegree programs. ''It's not hard to find examples of people who had to drop out of such certificate programs for financial reasons.''
One reluctant dropout is Jennifer Machado, who has worked for five years as a child care aide at the Vanderbilt Y.M.C.A. in Manhattan. Last semester, she took two City University courses toward a child development associate certificate. She loved the courses, but when she signed up for this semester, university officials told her she could not continue because she had not paid off the $1,000 bill for the previous semester's courses.
''For a lot of people, $1,000 doesn't sound like much, but for me, it's really difficult,'' said Ms. Machado, 24, who says she earns slightly more than $25,000 a year. She asked her mother for help, she said, but her mother was also taking continuing education courses, in human resources, and was not in a position to help.
''Right out of high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do,'' Ms. Machado said. ''I just stumbled into this job and I love it. This child development program works hand in hand with what I'm doing.''
She plans to scrape together the money over the next few months to pay the $1,000 balance so she can resume her studies this fall. She also hopes to qualify for state financial aid for next semester. Longer term, she said, she hopes the child development certificate, which entails three semesters of study, will be a first step toward a bachelor's degree.
The Georgetown study, ''Certificates: Gateway to Gainful Employment and College Degrees,'' found that many students who obtain nondegree certificates do go on to obtain degrees: 20 percent of certificate holders get an associate's degree and 13 percent obtain a bachelor's degree.
Of course, not all certificate holders earn as much as those with the exalted computer/information services certificates, the study noted. Nonetheless, those who have obtained certificates earn more on average than 24 percent of people with bachelor's degrees. And those with certificates earn 20 percent more on average than someone with just a high school degree, which translates into $240,000 in earnings over a lifetime.
At a time when so many college graduates are unemployed and forecasts show that 18 of the nation's 20 fastest-growing occupations will not require bachelor's degrees (home health aides, for example), some experts, like the scholar Charles Murray, are arguing that many young Americans should consider a different path. It may make more economic sense to obtain a certificate than to spend four years and tens of thousands of dollars studying for a bachelor's degree.
Students pursue certificate programs for several reasons. The unemployment rate remains high, and many see such certificates as a way to upgrade skills and get hired. At the same time, many employers are cutting back on the training they provide to workers, including new hires.
A manufacturer that might have devoted weeks to training a new employee to operate elaborate metal-cutting machinery now often insists that job applicants obtain certification on such machines before even applying. Some cities whose police and fire academies once had programs to train rookies now expect job applicants to attend outside schools and pay for it themselves.
''This means the employee is accepting the cost of the training before even getting considered for hiring,'' said Jim Jacobs, president of Macomb Community College in Michigan. Mr. Jacobs said that credit and noncredit courses and programs were often similar and that qualifying only degree-seeking students for federal Pell grants and federal loans often seemed arbitrary. The presidents of several colleges said the lack of financial aid for certificate students hurts more than just those students. Gail O. Mellow, president of LaGuardia Community College in Queens, said the lack of aid made it hard for her college to attract and train all the students the city needs to do coding for Manhattan's Silicon Alley or to work in its ''green waste management program.''
Robert G. Templin Jr., president of Northern Virginia Community College, said the lack of financial aid had kept his institution from expanding some certificate programs that might help meet demand from employers. Dr. Templin, whose college has 20,000 continuing education students, about half pursuing certificates, mentioned in particular a program for information technology certificates, which can cost $800 to $4,000.
He said some who would like to pursue certificates have been unemployed for months or are from low-income households.
''There is a group that typically tends to be individuals who are financially very fragile,'' Dr. Templin said. ''For some of them, paying the tuition is often cost-prohibitive. And not having a source of reliable student aid discourages institutions like ours from offering some of these training programs for job categories that are among the fastest growing in the nation.''
Northern Virginia is offering a program for certified nurses' aides this spring, but officials there said they were forced to delay it until April because several interested students were having problems pulling together the money needed to enroll. Some students, for the most part those who have been unemployed, can obtain federal aid for programs under the Workforce Investment Act, but many fail to, partly because there is not enough money.
Ana Bausher, scheduled to begin that four-week nursing aide program in April, said it was hard to come up with the $1,600 fee.
''I had to save up six, seven months to save up that money,'' said Ms. Bausher, who earns $250 a week as a part-time package clerk at a United Parcel Service sorting facility. She said she was enrolling in the program because ''I like to work with people. I like taking care of people.'' It is unfair, she said, that so many people she knows in college can qualify for federal loans and grants but she cannot.
President Mellow of LaGuardia College said the federal Pell grant program, created in 1972, was built for a different time -- structured to promote economic mobility by enabling less well-off students to attend four-year colleges. She said it was established ''when students tended to go to school full time and were basically being supported by their family. So they didn't hold jobs. They didn't have family responsibilities. But the world has changed dramatically since then.''
Anthony P. Carnevale, the director of Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce and the chief author of its study on certificates, questioned whether it was the best use of federal money to give Pell grants to students at four-year colleges who pursue majors in fields like philosophy, with little economic payoff in employment and earnings. Why not, he asked, provide aid to students who take noncredit certificate courses that often translate quickly into jobs and higher pay?
''If you want to take four years of Shakespeare, that's up to you,'' he said. ''Is that what the public sector should support? The bottom line is, given the budget situation, we ought to be more concerned about preparing people for the job market.''
Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the George Washington University Graduate School of Education , took issue with Mr. Carnevale.
''We know that people who get bachelor's degrees in philosophy are getting an education that will ground them in all kinds of things,'' she said. ''That might not help them the day after graduation, but it will help long term.''
Donald E. Heller, dean of the college of education at Michigan State University, said that with Congress pushing to cut the budget, he was worried that shifting some Pell funds to certificate programs could mean less money to help low-income students earn bachelor's degrees.
''In an ideal world, you'd like to be able to support people in some short-term programs to upgrade their skills,'' Dr. Heller said. ''In a world where it's a zero-sum game, if you're talking about taking away money from traditional financial aid programs, it's hard for me to support that.''
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Lumina Foundation are financing a panel, set up by the College Board, to recommend changes to the Pell grant program. The report is due next month.
President Jacobs of Macomb Community College is on the panel, and he is eager to see Pell grants geared increasingly to help the many adults who lost their jobs or were otherwise dislocated and were trying to get skills to land new jobs. And he said an expanded Pell program should provide guidance services to certificate students who return to college after not having been to school in years.
Ms. Baum, the panel chairwoman, voiced concern that an expansion of Pell to noncredit courses could be too broad.
''A lot of people take courses for self-enrichment and recreational stuff,'' she said. ''What happens if someone takes a basket-weaving course? There is no clear reason we would want to provide financial aid for that.''
Among those struggling because they are not able to get financial aid is Justo Amastal, who is studying for an A+ Computer Service Technician Certificate Program at LaGuardia Community College. The six-month program costs $2,470.
Mr. Amastal, 36, an immigrant from Mexico, had been earning about $15,000 a year working at restaurants and delis, but he was told he could make $40,000 to $60,000 with the computer tech certificate. Going to school has made it hard for him to support himself and his 11-year-old son. ''I don't really have time to work,'' he said. ''I need the time to study. The textbook is 1,650 pages, and there is a lot of reading.''
Luckily for him, he said, a close friend is lending him money for living expenses and the course's tuition. Despite the deprivation, he is sure the effort is worth it. ''If you don't have skills, it's really hard to find a good job,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Falling Out of Love With China

BYLINE: By DAVID SHAMBAUGH. 
David Shambaugh, a professor of political science and international affairs at the George Washington University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of ''China Goes Global: The Partial Power.''

 BODY:
Washington
NOW that China is becoming a world power, it is beginning to recognize the importance of its global image and the need to enhance its ''soft power.'' It is tracking public opinion polls worldwide and investing huge amounts into expanding its global cultural footprint, ''external propaganda work'' and public diplomacy. Unfortunately for China, that's not enough.
While pockets of positive views regarding China can be found around the world, public opinion surveys from the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project and the BBC reveal that China's image ranges between mixed and poor. And the negative view is expanding: for almost a decade, European public opinion toward China has been the most negative in the world, but that is now matched in America and Asia. 
There are likewise increasing signs of strain with Russia: on the surface, there is considerable harmony of worldviews and interests, but underneath lie lingering historical suspicions, growing trade frictions, problems stemming from Russia's military sales to China, immigration controversies and nascent strategic competition in Central Asia.
China's reputation has also deteriorated in the Middle East and among the Arab League due to the country's support for the Syrian and Iranian regimes as well as its persecution of Muslim minorities in far western China, a policy that has also sullied its image in Central Asia.
Even in Africa -- where relations remain positive on the whole -- China's image has deteriorated over the past three years as a result of the flood of Chinese entrepreneurs, its rapacious extraction of oil and other raw materials, aid projects that seem to benefit Chinese construction companies as much as recipient countries and support for unsavory governments. A similar downturn is apparent in Latin America for the same reasons.
Finally, China's most important relationship -- with the United States -- is also troubled. It is now a combination of tight interdependence, occasional cooperation, growing competition and deepening distrust.
For both sides, the critical question is how to manage an increasingly competitive and distrustful relationship without its becoming a full-blown adversarial relationship. Neither country has any experience handling such strategic competition amid deep interdependence, although we can hope that the latter feature will buffer the former.
While the decline in China's image may be global, the reasons differ from region to region.
China's huge trade surpluses have contributed directly and indirectly to job losses around the world, but the impact on its image has been most pronounced in Europe, Latin America and the United States, where China seems to loom as an unprecedented economic threat.
Meanwhile, China's military modernization and regional muscle-flexing in Asia has tarnished its reputation among its neighbors. Its unprecedented cyber-hacking has skyrocketed to the top of the agenda of Sino-American relations in recent weeks, while China's domestic human rights situation has been a long-standing concern in the West.
Underlying many of these complaints are China's authoritarian political system and its business practices, which are opaque and riddled with corruption.
While trying to broaden their global operations, China's multinational corporations often encounter substantial difficulties establishing themselves abroad and gaining global market share. China does not have a single corporate brand listed in the top 100 of the annual Businessweek/Interbrand global rankings of respected corporate brands.
Given China's growth rates, its image might not seem to matter much. But it does. As a result of China's declining image, its new president, Xi Jinping, and his new foreign policy team face mounting foreign policy difficulties and challenges, both perceptually and substantively.
Mounting suspicions and growing frictions are part and parcel of being a global power. But China would be better advised to substantively engage foreign criticisms than to reflexively dismiss them or respond with unconvincing public-relations campaigns.
There are any number of immediate steps China could take. It should work to halt its hacking. It should open its markets and reduce its trade surpluses, while restricting subsidies to its foreign investment and exports. It should protect intellectual property rights and ratify and adhere to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which commits its members to protect individual liberties.
In foreign policy, it should involve itself in multinational negotiations under the Law of the Sea Treaty to resolve its disputes in the South China Sea, negotiate a settlement with Japan over its disputed islands and pressure North Korea and Iran to end their nuclear programs. It should also be transparent in its overseas aid programs and military budgets, and it should better respect sensitivities in developing countries over China's extraction of natural resources.
Taking such steps would go much further toward enhancing China's international image than the billions of dollars the country is currently pumping into its overseas propaganda efforts.

HEADLINE: In Tourism, Classes Can Open Doors

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
JOHN LINDER had a career as a senior human resources manager, but he wanted something more. ''It was a good job, but I didn't want to be in an office anymore or in a corporate environment,'' he said. He also did not want extensive schooling, since he already had a master's degree. He loved to travel, and knew his strong people skills would translate well. His answer: a two-week immersion course at the International Tour Management Institute.
Now he is a certified tour director, planning itineraries and providing insights into local cultures while leading tour groups in the western United States and Canada. Many like Mr. Linder, who is 42 and from Tucson, are choosing careers in travel because the industry has job openings and training, making it especially attractive at a time of persistently high unemployment. The American travel industry employs 7.7 million people and added more jobs in 2012 than many other industries, according to the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group. 
''It is a field with extraordinary mobility, across jobs and geography,'' said Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. ''It's among the strongest growth industries globally.''
Every sector of the industry offers instruction, including degree programs or short-term certificate programs, provided by community colleges, universities and professional associations, he added.
Sharr Prohaska, a clinical associate professor at the Tisch Center, said the wide range of training available, like hotel management and ''green'' tourism, could accommodate people with backgrounds as diverse as econometrics and food services, and entry-level workers or midcareer switchers.
Berkeley Young, chairman of the Southeast Tourism Society's Marketing College, said programs to upgrade skills were also important. ''The way we communicate to potential travelers is changing so rapidly, it's important for any professional to continue education and professional development to stay on top of the latest trends,'' he said. ''You've got to stay fresh.''
Since 2010 the Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group has provided graduate-level business training for hotel management. The company also offers online programs, provided by the American Hotel and Lodging Association, for service-level employees, like front desk and housekeeping workers, interested in career advancement.
Enterprise Holdings, which owns and operates the Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Alamo Rent A Car and National Car Rental brands, has an extensive military recruiting effort. Nearly 10 percent of its workers based in the United States were previously in the military.
Cheryl Hargrove, president of HTC Partners, a consulting firm specializing in heritage tourism (focusing on the culture of regions), said many veterans successfully transition to travel jobs.
Sallay Kim, retired after 20 years in the Army, recently earned a master's degree in tourism administration at George Washington University, taking traditional and online classes. ''She used a skill set from the Army to start a business,'' Ms. Hargrove said of Mrs. Kim, who co-founded Serenity Event Solutions, an event management company based in Lorton, Va., that helps local companies and groups visiting the Washington area. Mrs. Kim, 41, a former intelligence officer, said: ''What military professional is not proficient in planning? That's what we do for a living.''
But despite the robust travel job market, educational offerings and data suggesting that many travel jobs pay well, some industry insiders say they suffer from an image problem.
''Many countries around the world place a greater value on travel,'' said Geoff Freeman, U.S. Travel's chief operating officer. ''In this country, tourism and travel is not seen as a critical economic driver.'' It is ironic, he said, that when the United States helps other countries grow economically, ''one of the first places is to kick-start tourism.''
Henry Harteveldt, an analyst for Hudson Crossing, a travel industry consulting firm, says due diligence when choosing a continuing education program is important. ''Promises or guarantees of employment need to be carefully examined,'' he said.
Ted Bravos, chief executive of the International Tour Management Institute, says he is careful to enroll only the number of students that the market can support.
Still, he is always looking to develop new markets, like the growing number of tourists from Brazil and China, by training Americans who speak the languages of those countries. The institute also provides hands-on training and job referrals.
Mr. Linder, the tour director, confirms this. ''Most of the work I get is through International Tour Management Institute,'' he said.
But even with such support, challenges remain. ''This pays nowhere near what my old salary was,'' Mr. Linder said, and the work is seasonal. ''But it offers more opportunities for professional and personal growth than the corporate world,'' he said. ''I feel on balance, it works for me.''

HEADLINE: State Leaders Reach Deal On Increasing Minimum Pay

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and legislative leaders reached a tentative agreement on Monday to increase the state's minimum wage to $9 over the next three years.
Increasing the wage had been a top priority of Democrats in Albany, including the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and one of the leaders of the Senate, Jeffrey D. Klein, who heads an independent faction of Democrats. Along with Mr. Cuomo, they had argued that the current minimum wage in New York, $7.25, was too low to support workers, and that the wage had not kept pace with the rising cost of living.
Mr. Silver, of Manhattan, said that if the Legislature raised the minimum wage to $9, ''I think we've done a tremendous service.'' He spoke to reporters after he and other legislative leaders met with Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, early Monday evening. 
The deal would raise the minimum wage to $8 per hour next year. The wage would rise again to $8.75 in 2015 and $9 by the start of 2016.
The agreement was described by people who had been briefed on the negotiations, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because a deal on the overall budget had not yet been reached. Increasing the wage to $9 would match the level to which President Obama has proposed raising the federal minimum wage.
If the wage increase is approved by the Legislature, as expected, New York would join 18 other states with minimum wages above the federal minimum as of the start of this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The $9 wage would be one of the highest in the country, although lawmakers in many other states are also contemplating increasing their minimum wage this year. New York's current minimum wage took effect in 2009 when the federal minimum became $7.25.
Michael Kink, the executive director of the Strong Economy for All Coalition, a group backed by labor unions that has advocated a minimum-wage increase, said he was pleased with the emerging deal. But Mr. Kink said it was disappointing that the wage increase would not be indexed to inflation, as liberal groups and labor unions had sought so that the wage would automatically increase in the future.
''If this stays on track to get to $9, then workers all over the state are going to get a real raise, and that's a good thing,'' Mr. Kink said.
Republicans were concerned that raising the wage could hurt the state's fragile economy, but have agreed to the increase in exchange for tax breaks; the Senate Republican leader, Dean G. Skelos, told reporters that the plan would also include at least $700 million in new tax cuts for businesses and families.
Some business groups remain concerned about the proposed minimum-wage increase. Mike Durant, the New York State director for the National Federation of Independent Business, said the wage increase would still have a detrimental effect on small businesses, especially upstate.
''In an economy that's stagnant, that's an enormous amount of significant pressure on small businesses that's going to threaten their viability,'' Mr. Durant said. He said the fact that the increase would be phased in, and would be accompanied by tax breaks, was a plus, but not enough.
''Does it help? Sure,'' he said. ''Does it mitigate the damage completely? Absolutely not.''
The developing agreement on the minimum wage and the tax cuts came as Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders continued to negotiate over the fine points of an overall state spending plan, which must be approved by April 1. Mr. Cuomo proposed a $143 billion spending plan in January.
Legislative leaders said they were hopeful that an overall deal on the budget could be reached by Tuesday; they are trying to finish the budget early this year so lawmakers can head home for Passover and Easter.
''We're very close to having a deal,'' Mr. Skelos, of Long Island, told reporters after the meeting with Mr. Cuomo.
Among the other items under negotiation: whether to extend a new tax bracket on the state's highest earners that was created in December 2011 and is scheduled to expire at the end of 2014, and whether to decriminalize the visible possession of small amounts of marijuana in an effort to reduce the number of low-level marijuana arrests in New York City. The marijuana decriminalization proposal, which Republicans in the Senate resisted last year, remained a sticking point on Monday night.

HEADLINE: The Progressive Shift

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Frank Bruni is off today.

 BODY:
There is a statue outside the Federal Trade Commission of a powerful, rambunctious horse being reined in by an extremely muscular man. This used to be a metaphor for liberalism. The horse was capitalism. The man was government, which was needed sometimes to restrain capitalism's excesses.
Today, liberalism seems to have changed. Today, many progressives seem to believe that government is the horse, the source of growth, job creation and prosperity. Capitalism is just a feeding trough that government can use to fuel its expansion. 
For an example of this new worldview, look at the budget produced by the Congressional Progressive Caucus last week. These Democrats try to boost economic growth with a gigantic $2.1 trillion increase in government spending -- including a $450 billion public works initiative, a similar-size infrastructure program and $179 billion so states, too, can hire more government workers.
Now, of course, liberals have always believed in Keynesian countercyclical deficit spending. But that was borrowing to brake against a downturn when certain conditions prevail: when the economy is shrinking; when debt levels are low; when there are plenty of shovel-ready projects waiting to be enacted; when there is a large and growing gap between the economy's current output and what it is capable of producing.
Today, House progressives are calling for a huge increase in government taxing and spending when none of those conditions apply. Today, progressives are calling on government to be the growth engine in all circumstances. In this phase of the recovery, just as the economy is finally beginning to take off, these Democrats want to take an astounding $4.2 trillion out of the private sector and put it into government where they believe it can be used more efficiently.
How do the House Democrats want to get this money? The top tax rate would shoot up to 49 percent. There'd be new taxes on investment, inheritance, corporate income, financial transactions, banking activity and on and on.
Now, of course, there have been times, like, say, the Eisenhower administration, when top tax rates were very high. But the total tax burden was lower since so few people paid the top rate and there were so many ways to avoid it. Government was smaller.
Today, especially after the recent tax increases, the total tax burden is already at historic highs. If you combine federal, state, sales and other taxes, rich people in places like California and New York are seeing the government take 60 cents or more out of their last dollar earned.
Democrats would make that weighty tax burden much, much heavier. In fact, the entire Democratic governing vision, from President Obama on down, is based on the notion that we can have a growing welfare state and pay for it by taxing the top 2 percent.
The first problem, of course, is that there aren't enough rich people to cover even the current spending plans. As an analysis by the group Third Way demonstrated, even if we threw every semiplausible tax increase at the rich, the national debt would still double over the next three decades.
The second problem is that if you set the tax burden at astronomical levels you really do begin to change behavior and wind up with a very different country. You don't have to be a rabid supply-sider to believe that when you start taking away 80 percent or 90 percent of somebody's top marginal earnings, you are going to get some pretty screwy effects.
Higher taxes will produce long-term changes in social norms, behavior and growth. Edward Prescott, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics, found that, in the 1950s when their taxes were low, Europeans worked more hours per capita than Americans. Then their taxes went up, reducing the incentives to work and increasing the incentives to relax. Over the next decades, Europe saw a nearly 30 percent decline in work hours.
The rich tend to be more sensitive to tax-rate changes because they've got advisers who are paid to be. Martin Feldstein, an economics professor at Harvard, looked into tax changes in the 1980s and concluded that raising rates causes people to shift compensations to untaxed fringe benefits and otherwise suppresses their economic activity. A study last year by the economists Michael Keane and Richard Rogerson found that tax rates can have a surprisingly large influence on how much people invest in education, how likely they are to create businesses and which professions they go into.
The progressive budget in the House seems to have been written by people hermetically sealed in the house of government. They work in government. They represent public-sector workers. They seem to have had little contact with private-sector job creators and no idea about what factors might play in their thinking. It's a reminder that while Republicans may embarrass on a daily basis, many progressives have lost touch with what actually produces growth and prosperity.

HEADLINE: U.S. Drug Costs Dropped in 2012, But Rises Loom

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Spending on prescription drugs nationwide has been slowing for years because of the increasingly widespread use of low-cost generics. But in 2012, something unheard-of happened: money spent on prescription drugs actually dropped.
The dip was small -- 1 percent, to $325.7 billion -- but it was the first time the research firm IMS Health had recorded a decrease in United States drug sales since the company began tracking such numbers in 1957. And this month, the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts reported that spending on commonly used pills -- like those that treat high blood pressure and cholesterol -- dropped by 1.5 percent, the first time that had happened since Express Scripts began following drug trends 20 years ago.
But even as the United States is in the midst of what has been called a ''golden'' period in spending on drugs, some are warning that the ever-expanding use of generics has masked a growing problem for the government, insurers and others who pay the bill for prescription drugs: the rising cost of complex specialty medicines that treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases. 
''This is a charmed era that won't last forever,'' said Paul B. Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research group that studies health care trends. ''When you talk to benefits managers at large employers or insurers, the trend of specialty pharma is very, very prominent. You might even say they regard it as their biggest problem.''
The potential for higher spending on drugs comes as the nation is struggling over how to contain the cost of health care, which many experts agree is a major threat to the country's fiscal condition.
Despite a recent slowdown in the growth of spending on overall health care, Republicans and Democrats alike have warned that rising health costs will eventually overwhelm the federal budget and make basic health care unaffordable for many Americans. Drugs, while not the major cause of rising costs, nonetheless account for about 15 percent of the nation's health care expenditures.
Mr. Ginsburg and others said the forces that have been holding down drug costs are beginning to subside. Dozens of brand-name products, including widely used best sellers like the anticholesterol drug Lipitor, and Plavix, which prevents blood clots, have lost their patent protection in recent years, a phenomenon that has been called the ''patent cliff.''
That cleared the way for cheap generic alternatives. But fewer major drugs are set to lose their patent protection over the next several years, and many of the newer drugs are so complex that it is still unclear how or when lower-cost copies will be brought to market once those patents expire.
The use of generic drugs may also be nearing its saturation point. In 2012, 84 percent of all prescriptions were dispensed as generics, according to IMS, the highest rate in history. IMS estimates that use of generics may reach 86 or 87 percent, but will probably not go higher than that. Some have also attributed the slowdown in spending to the weak economy as patients cut back on visits to the doctor and filling prescriptions.
''The majority of the patent cliff is over right now,'' said Kevin Host, the head of specialty pharmacy at OptumRx, the pharmacy benefit manager for UnitedHealth Group. ''That's been muting the real effect of specialty.''
Express Scripts found that, among commercially insured patients, spending on specialty drugs, which account for about a quarter of all prescription drug costs, increased by 18.4 percent in 2012 even as the cost of traditional drugs dropped.
Specialty drugs are often injected or infused and many are so-called biologics, complex proteins that are made in living cells that treat a range of diseases, from various types of cancer to rare hereditary diseases. Increasingly, they come with jaw-dropping price tags: four drugs approved in 2012 carry a yearly cost of more than $200,000 per patient, according to Forbes.
The cost of some of these drugs can add up, even if only a handful of patients need them, said Judith P. Clark, the pharmacy director of Mississippi's Medicaid program. ''I do know if we don't do something quickly, our budgets are going to be blown out of the water,'' Ms. Clark told a gathering of generic pharmaceutical executives in February.
The high prices have also led to a wide disparity in the out-of-pocket expenses paid by patients. Michael Kleinrock, director of research development at the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, noted that while most drug-benefit plans ask for a small $10 co-payment for generic drugs, some patients who need specialty drugs can be required to pay more.
''For the vast majority of patients, their share of costs and their out-of-pocket for costs may go down,'' he said. But ''those few whose medicines are specialty and complicated -- their share of costs may well go up.''
Still, some have questioned how quickly prices will rise, arguing that the pharmaceutical industry is no longer bringing as many blockbuster drugs to market. ''I don't see any return to the glory days,'' said David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard.
IMS Health has predicted that drug sales will rise by more than 4 percent in 2014, because of fewer brand-name drugs losing patent protection and also an influx of newly insured patients with the putting in force of the federal health care law. Sales growth will then dip slightly to just over 2 percent in 2015, another year in which several big drugs are expected to lose their patent protection, before rising faster again in 2016 to nearly 4 percent.
IMS has not yet released figures for global sales in 2012, but spending on drugs is expected to rise more quickly internationally because of higher growth in markets like Brazil, India and China, where an expanding middle class is increasingly able to afford prescription drugs.
But whether higher drug costs translate to increased health care costs overall is unclear, said Mr. Kleinrock, of IMS. That's because many drugs are worth the investment if they lead to better outcomes for patients and fewer hospital visits, especially for complex diseases like diabetes.
Many large employers and insurers are placing their hopes in biosimilars, what many consider to be the generics of the future. Biologic drugs, because of their complex nature, cannot be precisely copied. Biosimilar drugs would have the same effect in the body as the original biologic, but would not be exactly the same.
Although biosimilars are already available in Europe, they are unlikely to be available in the United States for at least two more years, and it is still unclear whether they will be automatically substituted for the original drug.
What is clear, however, is that they will not be cheap: several experts have estimated that the drugs will sell for anywhere from 30 percent to 50 percent less than the brand-name price, a far cry from the discounts of as much as 80 percent for traditional generics. Even so, those savings will be significant, said Dr. Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts. ''It won't get us back to the lower single digits like we were, but it will keep us in the single digits'' of spending growth, he said.
Several insurers and drug-benefit managers say they are already taking steps to try to rein in the cost of specialty drugs. They are requiring prior approval for high-price drugs or asking patients to try older, less expensive treatments first.
''I think they see the pain coming,'' said Dr. Alan Lotvin, the head of the specialty pharmacy at CVS Caremark, the pharmacy benefit manager. ''They know this dynamic is going to happen and they're very concerned about it, and I think they're looking for solutions.''

HEADLINE: Small Gains Are Observed By Engineers In Report

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The nation's infrastructure is crumbling a little bit less.
America's roads, bridges, water systems and energy networks have long been in poor repair. The American Society of Civil Engineers, which releases a report every four years that evaluates the problem in a letter-grade format, awarded the nation a ''D'' in its last report, published in 2009.
The latest Report Card for America's Infrastructure, released Tuesday, has an unexpected bit of qualified good news: the grade has inched up to a D+. It is the first time in the 15 years that the engineering organization has conducted its study that the grade has improved. 
The report is showing progress in six areas, including bridges, rail, wastewater and drinking water. No category saw a lower grade than that given in the previous report, though the nation's inland ports, waterways and levees received a near-flunking grade of D-. (The full report can be downloaded, along with interactive analysis of all 50 states, at www.infrastructurereportcard.org.)
Some connected trends have led to the shift, according to the engineering organization. It cited a rise in the private financing of public projects and renewed attention from state and local government to kick-start their own projects, rather than wait for Washington to send money. The jump in private investment was instrumental, for example, in the improved outlook for the nation's rails, according to the report. That evaluation jumped to a C+ from a C-. The group also cited short-term increases in financing -- a reference to President Obama's economic stimulus package, which focused in part on ''shovel-ready'' projects like road and bridge repair.
''When investments are made and projects move forward, the grades rise,'' the report stated.
Gregory E. DiLoreto, the group's president, said, ''A D+ is simply unacceptable for anyone serious about strengthening our nation's economy,'' but he added that the improvement ''shows that this problem can be solved.''
The engineering group estimates that the nation needs an investment of about $3.6 trillion by 2020, but that current levels of spending will leave a shortfall of $1.6 trillion.
The report was greeted with approval by the Obama administration, which has called for greater infrastructure investment from government and private sources, and has moved to streamline the process of granting permits and getting projects under way. Matt Lehrich, an administration spokesman, said, ''This report confirms what we already know: that while smart investments in infrastructure have not only created jobs but started to produce the improvements American workers and businesses will need to compete in a global economy, we have a very long way to go.''
Phineas Baxandall, a senior analyst with U.S. Pirg, the public interest advocacy group, said that while the president's speeches about high-profile programs like high-speed rail and solar energy investment were the most visible elements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, ''one of the things that the stimulus got right was to invest in repair rather than new capacity,'' in existing roads, bridges and other infrastructure. ''Pothole repair is always a shovel-ready endeavor,'' he said.
An expert in infrastructure who is more skeptical of government investment, Robert W. Poole Jr. of the Reason Foundation, said the results of the new report card tracked what he has been arguing for some time in the face of doom-and-gloom pronouncements: ''There actually is progress.''
Congress and state transportation departments have increased their spending over the past 10 or 15 years, he noted, and many of them have increased the gasoline taxes that pay for a great deal of road work. He also applauded the work of railroads and private companies that have invested in ports development, which show ''the ability to do a lot of things without, necessarily, a big additional slug from the federal government.''
Edward G. Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania who is now the co-chairman of Building America's Future Educational Fund, a group that advocates a stronger national effort at upgrading infrastructure, said ''the improvement is modest, and frankly, the investment is modest.'' His group has called for hundreds of billions of dollars a year in additional spending and a commission to create a long-term plan to address the issues. ''Not only do we need more investment, we need to do it right,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Greener Acres

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
From the potato fields of Michigan to the high prairies of Kansas, farmers are receiving record prices for their land -- but economists and banking regulators warn that this boom, like so many before it, could end badly.
Across the American heartland, farmland prices are soaring. In places like Waco, Neb., and Chickasaw County, Iowa, where the boom-and-bust cycle of farming reaches deep into the psyche, some families are selling the land that they have worked for generations, to cash in while they can.
Behind the rush is the age-old driver of farm booms: high crop prices. Corn, in particular, has been soaring, reflecting demand overseas and, domestically, for ethanol. High prices mean good profits for farmers, and many are using their growing incomes to bid for land. Sensing opportunity, investment firms are buying, too. David Taylor, of Oskaloosa, Kan., said he was saddened to sell his family's farm but that the prices were too good to resist. Four generations had planted corn and soybeans on the 146-acre spread. But after living through the Midwest farm crisis of the 1980s, when land values plunged, and realizing that his children would not follow in his footsteps, he sold the farm at auction in December. 
''I bawled like a baby,'' Mr. Taylor, 59, said. His crop-producing fields sold for $10,100 an acre.
In Iowa, despite the drought last year, farmland prices have nearly doubled since 2009, to an average $8,296 an acre, far surpassing the last boom's peak in 1979. In Nebraska, the price of irrigated land has also doubled since 2009.
But if the price of corn falls -- and many forecasters predict it will, particularly if the ethanol boom wanes -- the price of farmland will fall with it. While many farmers have borrowed little money or used cash to finance their purchases, those who have overexpanded could run into trouble, leaving banks and other creditors with their bad debts.
''You can't continue to see the price increases in land like we've been seeing. That's just heading for trouble,'' said Michael Duffy, an economist in farm management at Iowa State University. If the price of a bushel of corn were to fall to $4.50 from about $7 now, farmland values could collapse by as much as 25 percent, he said.
The potential dangers for the economy are nowhere near as serious as the consequences of the housing collapse. But for individual farmers and farming communities, as well as rural farming banks, the repercussions could be severe.
As far back as 2011, when the run-up in land prices was still gathering momentum, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation held a symposium in Arlington, Va., for bankers, regulators and investors titled ''Don't Bet the Farm: Assessing the Boom in U.S. Farmland Prices.'' But banks and others continued to offer farmers low-interest loans.
Debt held by the nation's farmers has risen nearly 30 percent since 2007, to an expected $277.4 billion this year. The bulk of those loans were made by commercial banks, the farm credit system and the Farm Service Agency. Some regulators and critics say that figure is most likely undercounting debt from specialized finance institutions or credit extended by seed companies like Monsanto and equipment manufacturers like John Deere.
While national data does not show sharp jumps in closely watched debt gauges, some analysts point to other data that reveal farm debts have already topped levels reached just before the farm crisis of the '80s. Data that the Kansas Farm Management Association has collected from more than 1,300 farms in the state showed the amount of debt compared to the value of underlying assets had climbed to 25.5 percent at the end of 2011, slightly above where it stood in 1979.
Some farmers are in over their heads already. One of the heartland's most talked about bankruptcies in years is that of Stamp Farms, of Decatur, Mich. In less than a decade, Michael D. Stamp, 37, built his farm into a huge operation growing corn and soybeans. In November, he was hailed as a savvy farming entrepreneur on the cover of Top Producer, an agricultural magazine, and was one of three national finalists in its annual contest.
''Multiple bankers have laughed me out of their office,'' Mr. Stamp said in a video accompanying the article. ''I wonder what they're thinking now.''
Before the month was over, Stamp Farms filed for bankruptcy. Its debts totaled more than $94 million, including $63 million in a loan made a year earlier by Wells Fargo. Millions more were owed to over 200 creditors, including $1.9 million to Deere and $3.9 million to Monsanto.
In bankruptcy filings, Wells Fargo accused Mr. Stamp of misrepresenting his farm's size, part of what the bank described as an elaborate fraud. The lawyer handling Mr. Stamp's personal bankruptcy wrote in an e-mail that Mr. Stamp denied the bank's accusations. He declined to make Mr. Stamp available for an interview, citing possible litigation against his client.
''We all started to wonder what was going on last fall when the corn was still green and he was out there picking it,'' Tom Jerdon, who leased land to Stamp Farms, said of Mr. Stamp. Mr. Jerdon said he believed that Mr. Stamp was harvesting early to raise cash. Aware of the allegations made by Wells Fargo, Mr. Jerdon said he found Mr. Stamp to be a hard-working farmer who kept his promises, even those made on a handshake.
''It sounds like he was really growing the farm with borrowed capital,'' Mr. Jerdon said. ''There was just a lot of debt.''
Regulators say it is difficult to determine exactly how much farm debt exists, because much of it involves debt owed to various vendors and suppliers.
''In so many ways, we're blind to some of that information,'' said Jason Henderson, a vice president at the Omaha branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
In the meantime, large investors have been moving in. In November, an investment unit of the big Swiss bank UBS bought 9,800 acres of Wisconsin farmland for $68 million, a purchase first reported by Farmland Investor Letter. The financial services firm TIAA-CREF is managing a $4 billion fund and now owns 600 farms -- half of those in the United States, according to an executive there. But as prices soar, investors say it is becoming difficult to find bargains.
''There are some opportunities out there, but man, it's tough,'' said Shonda Warner, a former Goldman Sachs trader who returned to her Midwest farm roots in 2006, when she started Chess Ag Full Harvest Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in farmland. Like many other investors, Ms. Warner's fund buys land and then rents it to farmers. As land prices have risen sharply, so have rents.
''I worry about people who are buying farmland and expecting to get big rents, $500 or even $600 in the Midwest,'' Ms. Warner said. ''What happens when corn prices fall next year and they can't pay? What are you going to do? Take their television set?''

HEADLINE: For Colorado Governor, a Long Path to Gun Limits

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
DENVER -- The wounds and rage from a mass shooting in a Colorado movie theater were still raw one morning last July when Gov. John W. Hickenlooper went on national television to discuss grief and guns. Shaken and groping for answers, he nevertheless cast doubt on one idea: that tighter gun laws could have prevented the carnage.
''This person -- if there were no assault weapons available, and no this or no that -- this guy's going to find something, right?'' he said on CNN, referring to the gunman whose rampage killed 12 and wounded dozens. ''If it was not one weapon, it would have been another.''
Eight months later, Mr. Hickenlooper is poised to sign some of the toughest new gun control laws in the nation, capping a journey that has transformed a popular, data-driven Western Democrat who takes his son shooting into an unlikely frontman for bringing new gun laws into the center of the United States. The bill signing is expected on Wednesday. 
''It absolutely lays a path for the rest of the country,'' said Jill Hanauer, a Democratic strategist in Denver. ''If you can do it here, you can do it anyplace.''
Democrats hope the expanded background checks and new limits on ammunition clips are signs of a durable shift in a Western swing state where the biggest political affiliation is ''unaffiliated.''
A decade ago, Colorado was loosening concealed-weapons laws and facing court challenges over a law that stripped legal protections for gay residents. It has now legalized marijuana, voted twice for Barack Obama, approved civil unions for same-sex couples and allowed illegal immigrants to pay cheaper in-state tuition rates at state colleges.
Where Democrats see progress, Republicans see overreach. About one in three Colorado households own a gun, and Republicans are hoping the state's hunters and sport shooters, libertarians and social conservatives will punish Democrats in next year's state-level elections. Conservatives in southwestern Colorado have already submitted petitions to recall State Representative Mike McLachlan, a Democrat who supported the gun bills.
''We are not the East Coast or the West Coast,'' said State Senator Ellen Roberts, who joined fellow Republicans to attack the package in a 12-hour Senate debate. ''There will be political blowback.''
When it came to guns, Mr. Hickenlooper, 61, a onetime oil geologist and brewpub owner, said he simply wanted solutions.
''We were just pulling our hair out, saying, What can you do?'' the governor said. ''Rather than feeling good, something that can make a difference. What are best practices? Where can we improve?''
Aides said his strategy reflected a pragmatic approach, one that extended to his days as a business owner or as mayor of Denver. In 2010, a year of fervid partisanship, he cruised to the governor's seat by running as a pragmatist who rejected nasty campaigning. He even filmed a television ad in the shower (clothes on) and promised voters a muck-free campaign.
But guns were risky territory. Colorado had not passed new gun laws since just after the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School. Any move by Democrats would instantly be characterized as a ''gun grab.''
After attending funerals and memorial services for the victims of the Aurora movie theater shooting, Mr. Hickenlooper started asking questions about guns and death. Did ammunition limits make sense? Did background checks really keep guns away from potential killers?
As Democrats started drafting bills, Mr. Hickenlooper sent his staff on a research expedition, seeking data on mass shootings, crime statistics and gaps in mental health laws.
''He put our people through their paces,'' said Mark Glaze, the director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which lobbied and advertised in support of the bills. The National Rifle Association bought radio and print ads condemning the measures.
Throughout the autumn, as Mr. Hickenlooper and his staff drove around the state, the topic kept coming up in conversations with suburban parents and hunters, gun advocates and ranchers. He asked: What limits could you support? Which ones go too far? He met with the head of the N.R.A. On a three-day bicycle tour in Eastern Colorado's more conservative plains, he asked farmers and rural Coloradans their opinions.
On some issues, he was out in front. In his annual State of the State speech in January, he jump-started the debate with a call to expand Colorado's background check system. After Columbine, Colorado voters closed a loophole to require checks not only at retail gun shops but also at gun shows.
Other measures stirred a deep ambivalence. Some critics said he was not taking a bold enough stance on one of the defining issues of his governorship -- one easily as consequential as raucous debates over oil and gas drilling (he is a proponent) or the parallel plagues of wildfire and drought.
When Democrats at the Capitol proposed limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds, Mr. Hickenlooper did not jump on board. He knew the Glock 17 was one of the most popular handguns in the country, and outlawing its 17-round clips would be deeply unpopular with some gun owners.
A gun-magazine manufacturer in Northern Colorado threatened to leave if the law passed, potentially sending 200 jobs to places like Wyoming or Texas. Not good news in a state where unemployment, though falling, is at 7.3 percent.
For weeks, aides said Mr. Hickenlooper was ''examining'' the proposal. He suggested he would support the bill, then hesitated.
But he had seen a study saying that 30 percent to 40 percent of slain police officers had been killed with high-capacity magazines. At a conference in Washington, he talked to government staff members from Arizona who described how Jared L. Loughner, the gunman in the mass shooting in Tucson in 2011, had been subdued as he changed clips. Eventually, and with reservations, Mr. Hickenlooper decided to support the 15-round limit.
''It seemed like in the end there might be more benefit than harm,'' he said.
As the bills marched ahead, hundreds of outraged gun owners and dealers crammed the halls of the gilded Capitol to vent. Cars drove around the building, honking like angry geese in opposition to the measures.
An airplane even circled overhead, towing a banner that read, ''Hick: Do Not Take Our Guns.''
But supporters say most Coloradans, even those who shoot skeet and store elk meat in their deep freezes, quietly support the new laws.
In December, a telephone survey of 905 Coloradans by Keating Research found that 80 percent agreed with expanded background checks and 61 percent supported magazine limits.
Mr. Hickenlooper is running for re-election next year, and his opponent -- Republicans are still looking for a candidate -- will almost certainly try to bludgeon the governor with the gun package.
But to Mr. Hickenlooper, it is time for the fight over guns to end.
''Coloradans are very nonpartisan, common-sense, pragmatic people,'' he said. ''There's just a common-sense approach to these kinds of issues that tries to look at the real facts, make a decision and say, Let's move on.''

HEADLINE: Market Declines on Fear Cyprus Deal Could Hurt Euro

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market lost ground Monday as investors worried that a proposal to seize money from bank depositors in Cyprus could cause more anxiety over the fate of the euro, Europe's shared currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 62.05 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 14,452.06 Monday. It plunged as much as 110 points early, briefly turned positive in the afternoon, then fell again in the last hour of trading.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.60 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,552.10, moving further from its high of 1,565.15, set in 2007. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 11.48 points, or 0.4 percent, to 3,237.59. 
European markets recovered most of an early decline and closed with modest losses. Yields on government bonds issued by Spain and Italy edged up, and the euro fell to a three-month low against the dollar.
The market rally that has pushed the Dow to record levels this year has been punctuated by concerns about the euro zone's lingering debt crisis.
''Europe has got problems,'' said Uri Landesman, president of the hedge fund Platinum Partners. ''You could get more stuff like this, and the market isn't priced to handle that.''
Cyprus reached an agreement last weekend with its European partners for its government to raid bank accounts as part of a 15.8 billion-euro ($20.7 billion) financial bailout, the first time in the euro zone crisis that the prospect of seizing individuals' savings has been raised. The measures are stoking fears of bank runs in the other 16 nations that use the euro.
Cypriot authorities, facing an uproar, delayed a parliamentary vote on the seizure and ordered the country's banks to remain closed until Thursday while they try to modify the deal to lessen its impact on small depositors.
Markets in Europe and Asia also fell during early trading, before retracing some of their losses later in the day. Germany's DAX index dropped 0.4 percent and Spain's main stock index shed 1.3 percent. Indexes in Britain and France each lost 0.5 percent.
The American stock market's reaction to euro zone developments has eased over time.
The Dow slumped more than 8 percent last year from May 1 to June 1 on concerns that Spain and Italy would be dragged into Europe's debt crisis. While the Dow initially dropped last month in reaction to the unsettled Italian election results, which threw the country into political paralysis, it has since gained 4.6 percent. Likewise the market recovered much of the early loss on Monday prompted by the Cyprus bailout deal.
Even with the stock market's pullback Friday and Monday, the Dow is still up 10.3 percent this year, while the S.& P. 500 is up 8.8 percent.
The stock market's resilience suggests that traders consider the Cyprus situation to be contained for now, said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential. The threat of rising volatility may also deter the Fed from thinking about ending its economic stimulus program. The central bank starts its second two-day policy meeting of the year Tuesday. ''Absent the Cyprus flare-up, the markets were slowing a bit and it looked as if investors were digesting the gains and waiting for the next catalyst,'' Ms. Krosby said.
In the bond market in the United States, interest rates slipped. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 10/32, to 100 13/32, while its yield fell to 1.96 percent from 1.99 percent as investors moved into low-risk investments.

HEADLINE: China: Beijing Says U.S. Response To North Korea Increases Tensions

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China said Monday that the United States' decision to strengthen antimissile defenses in response to threats from North Korea risked deepening regional tensions, underscoring Beijing's caution on further pressuring the North despite its third nuclear test. 
Earlier this month, China backed a United Nations Security Council resolution imposing banking, trade and travel sanctions on North Korea after it held the test on Feb. 12.
China's warning was in response to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's announcement on Friday that the Pentagon would spend $1 billion to put in place more ballistic missile interceptors to counter the growing reach of North Korea's weapons.
The 14 new interceptors will be in Alaska, where 26 of the existing 30 are already deployed, and American officials said the decision was meant to show its allies South Korea and Japan that the United States would muster the resources needed to deter the North.
But a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hong Lei, told reporters in Beijing that the decision risked adding to regional instability.
''Strengthening antimissile deployments and military alliances can only deepen antagonism and will be of no help to solving problems,'' Mr. Hong said, in answer to a reporter's question about Mr. Hagel's announcement, according to a transcript on the Foreign Ministry's Web site.
Mr. Hong did not name the United States, but was plain enough, saying, ''China hopes that the country concerned will proceed from the standpoint of protecting regional peace and stability, demonstrate a responsible attitude and act carefully in regard to the antimissile issue.''
China has long served as North Korea's most important diplomatic and economic supporter. It has opposed North Korean efforts to develop nuclear weapons, but has argued that harsh sanctions will not induce the North to abandon such ambitions.
China's backing of the Security Council resolution, and open calls from prominent Chinese experts for their government to distance itself from North Korea, stirred speculation among some observers that China might move to reduce its political and economic support for the North.
But Chinese officials have been stressing that North Korea has its own security worries that should be dealt with, and that they do not see sanctions as the right tool to bring the North back to negotiations.
Mr. Hong's comments appeared to reflect that view. China advocates ''resolving missile proliferation issues through political means,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Senate's Muckraker

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
I'll miss Carl Levin when he leaves the Senate after the next election -- and you will, too.
At 78, Levin has represented Michigan in the United States Senate for 34 years. He has certainly earned the right to retire on his own terms. But as a longtime Democratic member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations -- and as its chairman since 2007 -- Levin has done more than anyone to expose the scams, the conflicts, the wrongdoing and the sheer idiocy of the financial industry from the run-up to the financial crisis to the present day. Every time Levin's subcommittee holds a hearing, it should shame Attorney General Eric ''Too Big to Jail'' Holder Jr. 
The subcommittee's most recent expos took place on Friday, when it held a hearing to explore the infamous ''London Whale'' trades that cost JPMorgan Chase $6 billion last year. Months earlier, the Senate Banking Committee, whose members lean on the big banks for major campaign contributions, held its own inquiry into the disastrous trades. There, JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, was treated more like a visiting dignitary than a committee witness. Senator Charles Schumer of New York, unctuously describing Dimon as ''a financial expert,'' asked him to gauge the ''danger of this kind of thing happening at other institutions not as well-capitalized as JPMorgan.'' Pathetic.
Levin and John McCain, the permanent subcommittee's ranking minority member, didn't even bother to invite Dimon. ''We wanted to speak to the people who had the most information,'' Levin told me. Thus, the subcommittee's witnesses included Ina Drew, who led the division that oversaw the London traders, and Douglas Braunstein, who was the bank's chief financial officer. The combination of Levin's tough questions and a 300-page report by the subcommittee's investigators was brutal. The bank, and Dimon, took a major reputational hit.
For instance, Levin established that JPMorgan knew more about the mounting losses than it let on during the now-notorious conference call in April 2012, when Dimon described the trades as ''a tempest in a teapot.'' The report included examples of the utter contempt for which the bank held its regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The O.C.C., meanwhile, never understood the risks involved. Indeed, under Levin's relentless questioning, bank witnesses essentially conceded that their explanation for the losses -- that the London trades were part of a hedge that had gone wrong -- was not a particularly truthful statement. What the trades were supposed to be hedging was never adequately explained.
(''Our executives said what they believed to be true based on the facts they had at the time,'' said a JPMorgan spokesman in a statement. ''In retrospect, the information they had was wrong, and they apologized for this.'')
The JPMorgan hearing was only the latest in the subcommittee's muckraking efforts. Previous hearings -- on the mortgage shenanigans at Washington Mutual, the egregious conflicts of the credit-rating agencies, and Goldman Sachs's efforts to dump its toxic assets on unsuspecting clients -- were every bit as illuminating, and as devastating. They often exposed behavior that was at least potentionally criminal.
But when I asked Levin about the purpose of the hearings, he did not mention criminal prosecutions, perhaps just as well given our supine Justice Department. ''All of our hearings are held with some legislative purpose in mind,'' he said. For instance, the Goldman hearing led the authors of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law to include language intended to prevent investment banks from hiding that they were on the opposite side of trades being pushed on their clients.
One goal of Friday's hearing, Levin told me, was to ''stiffen the spine of regulators. Rule-makers are struggling with what to allow in terms of hedging under the Volcker Rule,'' he said. (The Volcker Rule is intended to prevent banks from trading for their own accounts.) ''This should help them.''
Of course, the O.C.C. has bigger problems than that -- as the hearing implicitly underscored. It is a classic captured regulator. As American Banker pointed out recently, the Promontory Financial Group, a prominent banking consulting firm founded by Eugene Ludwig, a former comptroller of the currency, recently hired the O.C.C.'s general counsel, Julie Williams. And where did the O.C.C. find its new general counsel, Amy Friend? From the Promontory Financial Group!
But I digress.
Toward the end of my interview with Levin, he let slip a tantalizing tidbit. Sometime in the next few months, the permanent subcommittee plans to call the Internal Revenue Service to task for allowing the political super PACs to be classified as tax-exempt 501(c)(4)s. ''Tax-exempt 501(c)(4)s are not supposed to be engaged in politics,'' he said. ''It is against the law to do so.'' Then he added, with a certain undeniable relish, ''We're going to go after them.''
Oh, boy!
