Stocks Continue to Slide As Fears About Brazil Grow
Stocks continued to decline as fears intensifed that Brazil's financial turmoil, reflected in the devaluation of its currency, may spread to other Latin American economies and dampen business with the United States. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 228.63 points, or 2.45 percent, to 9,120.93. It was the fourth consecutive decline for the index. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 22.21 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,212.19. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index fell 39.99 points, or 1.73 percent, to 2,276.82. Page C6.
 
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose for the third consecutive session. The yield fell to 5.05 percent, from 5.13 percent. C6.
 
Kodak Shares Drop on Profit Report
In a rare public forecast, the chief executive of Eastman Kodak, George M. C. Fisher, told analysts that Kodak would earn $4.81 to $5.24 a share this year, bracketing Wall Street's prediction of $5.19 a share. But that was not enough to appease investors, who focused on Kodak's other announcement, that its fourth-quarter earnings came in 10 cents below estimates and that its sales declined. Shares of Kodak plummeted $8.1875, or 10.4 percent, to $70.50. Market Place. C6.
 
Ratings High for '60 Minutes II'
The debut of the second CBS news magazine "60 Minutes" scored the highest rating of any program Wednesday at that time period and more than doubled the audience CBS had been attracting then. "60 Minutes II" had a 12.4 rating, 110 percent more than CBS has averaged on Wednesday nights at 9 this season. It also exceeded the expectations of network executives, who said that the numbers proved the value of the promotion of the program in recent weeks. C5.
 
European Economies Are Worsening
The economies of the 11 countries that have adopted the euro are stalling faster than experts had expected. C3.
 
Witness Accused of Altering Stance
A Justice Department lawyer produced several academic papers that he said showed that Microsoft's first witness in the antitrust trial, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had written opinions that contradict views he offered in testimony for the software giant. C2.
 
Profits Increase 49% at First Union
First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, said its fourth-quarter profit jumped 49 percent based on renewed strength in its capital markets business, strong loan growth and robust fee income. C2.
 
Time Warner Believed to Be in Talks
Reader's Digest Association and Time Warner are said to be in talks to combine Reader's Digest with a number of Time Inc. titles and direct-marketing businesses. C5.
 
Nation's Economy Hummed in 1998
Consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in 1998, their slowest pace in 12 years, and retail sales surged nine-tenths of a percent in December, capping a year in which rising wages allowed consumer spending to jump at its fastest pace since 1984 and energized the economy's longest peacetime expansion. C2.
 
Tax on Cigarettes to Be Proposed
Another increase in cigarette prices is being proposed. This time it is from the Clinton Administration, which is proposing a Federal tax increase of 55 cents a pack to help pay for new domestic and military spending programs. Cigarette companies raised prices by 45 cents a pack last year to pay for a $206 billion legal settlement with 46 states. A21.

HEADLINE: THE TRIAL OF THE PRESIDENT: THE CAPITAL;
Business as Usual, but With TV Turned On Low

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
As the Senate listened to the case for her husband's removal from office today, Hillary Rodham Clinton's mind was a world away -- on Mars, to be precise.
Under a panorama of the Martian landscape in the planetarium at the National Air and Space Museum, Mrs. Clinton unveiled a program called the Mars Millennium Project through which schoolchildren will develop plans for how a colony on the red planet would function. 
 "It Takes a Village" meets "The Martian Chronicles."
It was not just his wife who was taking a page from the playbook of the Compartmentalizer in Chief as the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton unfolded on Capitol Hill and on television screens throughout Washington.
George W. Black, one of the five members of the National Transportation Safety Board, and an expert in highway safety, said, "I'm watching the Weather Channel."
As the weather here switched from rain to freezing rain and back to rain, Mr. Black said, "I'm trying to figure out whether to sleep in the office or drive home."
Mr. Black, a Republican appointed by Mr. Clinton, said he had not found time to watch the impeachment proceedings.
"We at the safety board have a lot of things to do," he said, including work on major unsolved air crashes. "I am totally immersed in reading dockets and technical reports."
From the bowels of the bureaucracy to the highest reaches of the political class, work went on, but with an occasional halt to view what jaded Washingtonians seemed to be straining to view as history. Even as televised drama, it did not seem to measure up to Sam Ervin listening to John Dean -- or Marcia Clark questioning Kato Kaelin, for that matter.
"This is quite different from Watergate," said Richard A. Steinwurtzel, a partner at the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, who as a law student had summer jobs in the Government during the Senate Watergate hearings and the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings against Nixon. "During Watergate, all the TV's were on, and we were hanging on every word."
Bob Squier, a Democratic strategist who worked for Mr. Clinton, said the television in his office was not working properly, so he walked home to watch, tuned in "and promptly fell asleep."
"Can you believe it?" Mr. Squier said. "The President I helped get elected is on trial for impeachment, and I can't stay awake."
At the offices of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, televisions were on. "People are popping in and out and taking a look at it," said a staff member who insisted on anonymity. "But no one is glued to it."
Interest in the proceedings varied, unsurprisingly, by political conviction. Bill Pascoe, the political director for the American Conservative Union, was watching the trial at his home office in Alexandria, Va.
"I'm watching it for the same reason you watch a car race -- you keep watching in the morbid hope that someone is going to wipe out in the fourth turn," Mr. Pascoe said. "It's compelling."
Within the Clinton Administration, predictably, there was a concerted effort not just to get on with the people's work but to be seen as getting on with the people's work.
Mr. Clinton had lunch with Vice President Al Gore -- no talk of impeachment there, Mr. Gore's aides said -- and worked on his State of the Union address. Late in the day he canceled a trip to New York because of the wintry weather.
At the Pentagon, Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre reported that the military was going all out to insure that software problems associated with the year 2000 would not imperil national security. The State Department proposed loosening restrictions on oil sales by Iraq. The Department of Housing and Urban Development unveiled a plan to help businesses in poor communities create jobs.
"I don't have the time or the inclination to watch this stuff," said David C. Leavy, the spokesman for the National Security Council, who said his television was not on. "All my colleagues on N.S.C. are focused on the hard work of Iraq and Kosovo and international economic issues and others. Even if I wanted to watch, I don't have the time."
Not all of his colleagues were quite so pure, with some stealing glances at television sets that were tuned to the proceedings, albeit with the sound turned down.
And at the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, some employees admitted to having tuned in, curious about a proceeding far different from their criminal and civil trials in Federal court.
One F.B.I. official said today's proceeding seemed devoid of new information, but was interesting as a piece of history. "It's pretty awesome." he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Wants Big Increase in Federal Tax on Cigarettes

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration plans to propose a Federal tax increase of 55 cents a pack on cigarettes to help pay for new domestic and military spending programs, White House and Congressional officials said today.
The new tax, if enacted, would raise $8 billion a year over the next five years and would be used to help pay for a host of new social initiatives the President has announced over the past two weeks, including expanded after-school programs, support for disabled workers, hiring of new police officers and a tax credit for people requiring long-term medical care. The money would also help offset $100 billion in proposed new Pentagon spending over the next six years. 
 The President has not announced how he intends to pay for these programs, promising that the details will be provided in the budget he submits to Congress on Feb. 1. But the White House has long signaled its intention to seek more money from tobacco, and officials confirmed a report in The Wall Street Journal today that Mr. Clinton will propose the tobacco tax, which is now at 24 cents, as part of a package of tax increases and loophole-closings that it intends to push to pay for new programs.
Mr. Clinton plans to discuss in the State of the Union address next week his Administration's efforts to reduce smoking by teen-agers, including the proposed tax increase to make cigarettes too expensive for some potential smokers.
But the money to be raised by the new levy would not be designated solely for anti-smoking programs, but rather to pay for a variety of social initiatives, a senior White House official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Mr. Clinton is trying to tap the deep pockets of the tobacco industry for the second time in a year. In last year's budget, the President assumed that the Federal Government would collect $65 billion over five years from a proposed national legal settlement with the tobacco industry. But after an expensive lobbying campaign by the cigarette makers, the national pact died in the Senate, and the Administration realized none of the anticipated revenue.
The Administration hopes to claim some of the $206 billion the industry agreed late last year to pay 46 states to settle dozens of lawsuits filed by the states seeking reimbursement for health-care costs caused by smoking. Officials are considering withholding part of state Medicaid reimbursements to recoup part of the Federal share of the expenses of smoking-related diseases.
Cigarette companies raised prices by 45 cents a pack to pay for the settlement with the states, driving the price of cigarettes over $3 a pack in most markets. The Administration's 55-cent increase would be in addition to the industry's price increase and would more than double the Federal tax on cigarettes, which is already scheduled to rise to 39 cents a pack in 2002.
Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee, reacted skeptically to the Administration proposal, saying it was a part of a pattern of taxing and spending that was likely to meet strong opposition on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Fleischer said the President should cut spending in other programs to pay for his new programs.
"Why does everything have to be a tax hike?" he said. "Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will be troubled by how much of his budget relies on tax and spend."
An industry spokesman said the tobacco companies would vigorously contest the tobacco increase.
"Federal Government economic terrorism of the industry has to stop," said Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco companies. "The industry will oppose a more than doubling of the Federal excise tax on a legal consumer product in one fell swoop."
"As we all know, that $8 billion will fall primarily on lower- and middle-income Americans," Mr. Williams said. "The proposal is also an affront to people on both sides who have tried to bring a resolution to these issues."
The states are also likely to object to an effort to claim any of the money they won from the tobacco companies, saying that the Federal Government had no role in the litigation that led to the settlement. They are also expected to argue that while $206 billion sounds like a lot, a substantial part of the proceeds will pay lawyers' fees and the remainder will not cover all the health-care costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses.

HEADLINE: French Mischief on Iraq

 BODY:
If the United Nations were to end sanctions against Iraqi oil exports and let the proceeds flow through the hands of Saddam Hussein, there is little doubt what would happen. He would use the oil money to rebuild his arsenal of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and extended-range missiles. That is why France's proposal to lift the oil embargo and move to a weakened system of weapons monitoring and anemic safeguards against Iraqi weapons purchases is unacceptable. Sanctions can safely be lifted only when Iraq has fully complied with the disarmament requirements the Security Council imposed after the Persian Gulf war.
Before sanctions were imposed in 1990, Iraq used its oil revenues to import the equipment and ingredients needed to make large quantities of unconventional weapons. The tenacity with which it has shielded its weapons programs from U.N. inspection leaves little doubt that Baghdad means to rebuild them, and will resume buying components abroad as soon as it can afford to. 
 For now, sanctions are the only effective means to restrain these weapons programs. No system of monitoring Iraqi purchases, as the French propose, is reliable enough to prevent secret deals with rogue arms merchants from Europe, Russia, China or America. Iraq already has the technology and equipment for making germ weapons, nerve gas and nuclear bombs. The ingredients needed for resuming production are readily available in world markets.
The most compelling argument made for ending sanctions is the suffering of Iraq's people, who are innocent victims of a cruel dictatorship. But it is a deceptive argument. Under the United Nations program of oil for food and medicine, Iraq is already allowed to sell $5.26 billion worth of oil every six months, about as much as Baghdad can pump given today's low oil prices and Iraq's aging oil facilities. Washington now proposes allowing unlimited sales under this program, which finances supervised purchases of food, medicine and other basic consumer goods. If sanctions ended, there might be less money for civilian needs rather than more, since Baghdad would probably spend some of its oil income on presidential palaces, security forces and covert weapons purchases.
The French proposal includes monitoring of known Iraqi weapons facilities by a less aggressive inspection agency than the one now headed by Richard Butler. That is scarcely adequate. Because of Iraqi obstruction over the years, many weapons research and production sites remain unknown and would not be subjected to monitoring. Only aggressive, surprise inspections can keep Iraq from rapidly rebuilding its arsenal of terror.
For now, the United States and Britain stand almost alone in their insistence on effective measures to curb Iraqi weapons programs. But that is enough. Both countries can veto any weakening of Security Council resolutions on Iraq. They must stand ready to do so.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The U.N. Suicide Road

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Behind the closed doors of the United Nations Security Council, three of America's major partners are closing fast on their goal: to give Saddam Hussein victory in the war he lost eight years ago.
The victory would not just establish Iraqi dominance in the Mideast, it would threaten the pragmatic reality of the Western alliance and America's role in it. And in words I choose with unhappy care: It would bring into vivid danger the purpose and existence of the U.N. 
 Each of the countries -- France, Russia and China -- has worked long at those closed meetings to kill the oil embargo against Iraq, the only barrier that prevents Saddam from again building arsenals of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons.
All three want to resume oil and industrial trade with Iraq. They are also bound by desire to build Mideast influence, squeezing out America's.
On Wednesday, France went public, proposing to lift the oil embargo. It was imposed by the U.N. for as long as Saddam keeps refusing to reveal his hidden weapons of mass destruction and his capacity to build more.
By his own decision, the embargo imposes suffering on Iraqis. He will not even give them ease by spending all the relief money the U.N. allows.
France has surrendered to his choice and with great spirit spits in the U.S. face.
The French have this terrific idea. After the embargo is lifted, the U.N. would kind of watch to see if Saddam bought or built the weapons. But it would end all the inspection that now stops him beforehand.
The U.S. said it stood by the embargo, but sent shivers through Saddam's enemies by saying the French proposal had "some positive elements." President Clinton has had no policy toward Iraq for his six years in office, except a couple of bomb-and-run bombings, which made Americans look like fools and cowards.
Certainly at the U.N. we have proved the former. Council meetings were open for the first two decades of the U.N., and the public could see and hear what was going on.
You can see that was an annoyance for diplomats. So they closed the meetings. They threw the press a few briefing bones after the sessions.
Americans, who would not let a village council meet in private about a school budget, allow Washington to agree that the Council should meet in private about issues of death or life, including ours.
For much of my career, I have been involved in U.N. coverage -- a decade of writing about it before I escaped to foreign places, then more decades of involvement back in New York as an editor and columnist.
I believed, and still do, that even with its failures, weaknesses and bouts of lickspittle about dictatorships, the U.N. could be a force for social decency and democracy. I am embarrassed that my country will not pay its dues -- something that I would never have imagined.
For many months I have been writing about the pro-Saddam tripartite alliance, while Washington told us how strong the anti-Saddam "consensus" was at the U.N. That escaped perjury because nobody put a hand on the Bible.
Usually, I am alone in my criticism. American "opinion makers" rarely set foot in an organization that affects American national interests around the world.
The guilt in the plot to rebuild Saddam rests mostly with the nations that hatch and nest it. But it lies too with U.S. ineffectiveness and with Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Mr. Annan's praise of Saddam and defensive attitude toward him may come from some concept of peacemaking. But they damage him and the U.N. more than he seems to know.
So, very carefully, I want to tell him, and all who have any hopeful interest in the U.N., that it is traveling the suicide road.
The U.N. was created to expand freedom on the defeat of Germany, Japan and Italy, not to strengthen other tyrannies or create new ones.
Dictatorships hold seats at the U.N. But their values and interests are contrary and fatal to those on which the U.N. was founded -- the preservation and growth of liberty. If the U.N. removes restraints it imposed itself on the resurgence of Saddam Hussein, restoring him as a threat to the existence of millions of people, free or tyrannized, it will have prostituted its own purpose and meaning.
The U.N. will have no reason to exist and will leave few to weep at its burial.

HEADLINE: On Iraq, Time for an Accounting

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "France, in Break With U.S., Urges End to Iraq Embargo" (news article, Jan. 14): As sanctions against Iraq are subjected to increasing criticism while Saddam Hussein's support in the Arab world is also at a new low, perhaps the time has come to address Mr. Hussein's status as a war criminal. Certainly, the Iraqi leader and his top lieutenants meet the test for indictment for aggression, genocide and other crimes against humanity. 
 Acting to require an accounting for their wrongdoing would distinguish them from the Iraqi people, who are most hurt by sanctions; sanctions could then be eased without giving Mr. Hussein a psychological victory. If the United States offered an easing of sanctions coupled with creation of a war crimes tribunal, the Arabs, Russians and French would have to support such a tribunal or admit that their concern is not really for the Iraqi people.

HEADLINE: High Court Was Right to Back Initiatives;
A Case for Bilingualism

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The United States Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that an Arizona law requiring public employees to speak only English on the job was unconstitutional (news article, Jan. 12). 
 And last year, California voters approved the dismantling of hundreds of bilingual school programs. But as you reported (news article, Oct. 3, 1998), not all school districts have fully complied.
Many Hispanic parents, and others, are concerned that their children will not be able to communicate their most cherished dreams and intimate thoughts in their native languages, which is often necessary for warm relationships with relatives and friends who speak little or no English. Bilingualism is also necessary in an increasingly global economy.

HEADLINE: Sending Authority for Athletics Back to the Schools

SERIES: DROPPING THE BALL: The Decline Of School Sports -- Third of three articles.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON and JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
The breakdown of public school athletics in New York City over the last quarter century was to a great extent a matter of impersonal forces and unintended consequences. But in equally large part, the fate of school sports was determined by individuals -- people who made a difference or who did not, who tried to defend athletics or who stood idly by on the sidelines.
Ed Reynolds fought back. 
 Reynolds, the principal of West Side High School in Manhattan, became so angry that the 350 students at his alternative school could get no money from the city for sports that he formed his own league and ran it himself. Organizing the city's expanding group of smaller, specialized high schools beginning in the 1970's, Reynolds pushed and prodded and insisted that sports for students mattered. And it worked.
Now, the more than four dozen alternative high schools like West Side get money from the Board of Education that, while paltry compared to schools around much of the nation or in the New York metropolitan area, is better than nothing. The schools now participate in interscholastic sports alongside the oldest and largest schools in the city.
"You don't have to yell," Reynolds said of the lessons he learned in his battles over sports. "But you do have to be aggressive -- you have to continually lobby for your position, you have to write letters and organize meetings, you have to be sort of a crusader," he said.
But, coaches, teachers and administrators across the city say, Reynolds was an exception -- a principal who would go to the mat for sports. Most others would not, or could not. The pattern of de-emphasis of sports and physical education came from the top down, as Board of Education administrators cut and cut financing and never restored it, and partly from the bottom up as parents stopped caring as much or pushed for other school improvements. Principals were caught in the middle.
Most took the meager amount of money doled out by the Public Schools Athletic League -- the Board of Education's administrative arm for high school sports -- and did what they could. They found ways to raise more money through stopgap measures or they eliminated a sport here or a gym class there as they balanced their budgets and their needs for books, materials and teachers.
Athletics programs, as they struggled, came more and more to mirror everything that works and does not work about the New York City school system: varying resources from neighborhood to neighborhood, varying levels of commitment and ability from school to school, and always and everywhere a seemingly constant conflict over politics and labor and management and who was or should be in charge. Schools chancellors came and went like waves on the beach. Frank J. Macchiarola tried to rebuild some of the sports program in the late 1970's and early 1980's, and the current schools chief, Rudy Crew, has added back money in the late 1990's. But the deeper structural problems remained.
Now, in the city's first concerted effort in years to rethink and retool how it runs its high school sports programs, it has decided that the answer is to decentralize authority further, giving more responsibility to individual schools. What many principals and teachers had seen as a symptom of the erosion in commitment and money from the center -- decentralized sports programs that seemed orphaned and at the mercy of local neighborhood economics -- has now been embraced as a cure.
Leaders on the scene, the city has said, really do know best. Under the plan, parts of which are being put in place now, principals will be charged with insuring that athletes are academically eligible and medically fit to compete and that coaches are certified. Principals will enforce rules and assume legal liability for mishaps or oversights.
"We're now trying to say to the principals, 'It's your show,' " said Thomas Hemans, the director of the P.S.A.L., which has until now scheduled games, set rules, hired officials and certified the training of coaches since its creation in 1903.
 
Consequences and Politics
Caught in a Battle Involving Principals
The overhaul plan has in turn opened a new debate about what school sports could be and should be. Some principals and teachers say the city is giving up on the idea of systemwide improvement, while accepting the diminished state that sports has assumed. Some say they believe that the overhaul represents real hope of improvement. Still others say the timing, coming in the middle of a pitched battle between the city and the principals' union over tenure, promises to make school sports more of a political issue than ever. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has pushed to eliminate tenure for principals -- a move the principals' union has rejected.
Even principals who think the sports overhaul is a positive step say that greater decentralization will make the inequities between poor and middle-class schools more profound -- or at the very least leave the problems unaddressed -- because each school will be left more on its own than ever.
"Everything is moving toward school-centered leadership teams, everything is moving out, this is just in keeping with that whole movement," said Thelma B. Baxter, the principal of Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Fordham section of the Bronx; the district has a 100 percent poverty rate among its students and no athletic fields at all. "But I think it's going to make it more difficult for the schools to be competitive -- truly competitive."
The principal of New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn, Howard J. Lucks, also believes the changes -- contained in a new rule book given to principals last year -- have some positive aspects, notably the new section on sports and ethics. But for all the good intentions, he said, decentralized authority will inevitably mean unevenness of application.
"I think it's very difficult for every school to have the same kind of program," he said.
Phil Watnick, the girls' track coach at South Shore High School in Brooklyn, questioned the wisdom of further burdening principals. The new plan simply will not work, he said, because principals are already overwhelmed by the responsibilities they have. "How much do you want to put on their heads?" he asked.
Other administrators and sports officials, however, say that the city may have stumbled onto an important truth: that for all that principals did not do as the city's commitment declined, people like Reynolds -- scattered here and there across the system -- kept sports programs alive.
"Sometimes, I think it's a miracle that high school sports even survived in New York," said Arthur Greenberg, the schools superintendent for District 25 in Queens and a principal in the 1980's.
 What is indisputable about the city's sports overhaul is that it comes at the expense of the P.S.A.L.
Indeed, a Board of Education task force last year concluded that the P.S.A.L. , which administers sports programs for 165 high schools and 2,361 boys' and girls' teams, had to a great extent failed. Its staff of eight full-time employees and its network of coaches and athletic directors who serve as part-time commissioners for individual sports had been overwhelmed, the report said, by the sharp growth in the number of high schools in the 1990's and the explosion of girls' teams that the city was forced by Federal law to create in recent years.
The P.S.A.L.'s new role is more consultant than administrator. It will schedule games between schools, arrange for officials and umpires and offer advice about rules and procedures when asked.
By comparison with the P.S.A.L.'s original mission and historic role in the school system, such a diminished role falls just short of extinction. In the century's early decades, when New York City's system of high school sports and physical education was being built, and being seen as a national model, the agency was a central -- sometimes autocratic -- voice and authority and advocate for the value and necessity of school sports. In the name of greater local control, that unifying voice, however much it had already been eclipsed, has been silenced.
But many principals also fear that downsizing the P.S.A.L., whatever the result for students, will make sports more political in New York by injecting the issue directly into one of the most divisive subjects in public education: tenure for principals. The Board of Education and Giuliani are leading vehement campaigns to chip away at or eliminate tenure for principals.
In such an environment of acrimony, some principals say they believe the overhaul will change the traditional politics of money for sports into the politics of blame. Greater local control has raised the specter, some principals say, of a kind of Trojan horse -- a huge extra task, cast as an improvement, that principals cannot possibly keep up with, given all their other duties. The new rule book could come back to haunt them, they say, as a prosecutorial exhibit with the first major scandal of poor enforcement or student injury.
"The burden is now placed on the principals; if anything goes wrong, they can always point the finger at us," said Bruce Schnur, the principal of Liberty High School, a small specialized school in Manhattan mainly for new immigrants.
The principals' union, for its part, sees little change in the status quo. Sports will be made better, union officials say, because principals are more capable and competent than P.S.A.L. staffers.
"I think it will amount to a more effective administration of the sports programs and less chance for violations to take place," said Norman Sherman, the high school director for the principals' union, the Council of Supervisors and Administrators.
Crew, the city's Schools Chancellor, said he believed that spending increases for sports in the last few years -- and his own statements of commitment -- had changed the debate: The question is no longer survival, he said, but rather how to create the proper role for sports going forward. Crew said in an interview that athletics must become part of a broader educational effort aimed at putting students onto what he calls a "road of personal competency." Arts education and internships, in which students can get experience outside school in real-life working situations, are others.
"I would argue that there are many ways of being able to scale that road," he said. "And I have not chosen one over the other -- I'm saying all three have to be present."
Crew said he thought it was probably reasonable for principals to feel cynical about the recent changes for sports, given the long, dismal record of retrenchment. But he said he hoped to embed athletics once again so firmly in the curriculum that it would not be the first to fall when tough budget times return.
All across New York -- and in schools all over the nation -- educators are wrestling with similar questions. At a time of taxpayer revolts and state mandates for better academic performance, the question of how and whether to fit sports in -- let alone finance them seriously -- has become a burning question. And as the public schools have struggled, the number of new private groups seeking a new path for sports, or seeking to help finance existing programs, has exploded. In many corners of the city, in and out of the school system, people are searching for new vehicles to provide sports and are articulating new ideas about their value and role in youth development.
One group, for example, that is held out by some educators as a model of what school sports could be is a five-year-old program in Harlem called the Urban Youth Bike Corps.
The group is ostensibly about biking, said its director, Erik A. Cliette. But Cliette said that biking was in many ways just a cover story. The corps blends physical and emotional and academic development, all revolving around bike-riding trips, bicycle maintenance, personal responsibility and academic achievement, with all expenses paid for by private and corporate sponsors.
It is like school sports in its focus on physical development and training, he said, but with the emphasis shifted to a broad and structured coming-of-age strategy.
And many school officials, in struggling to keep sports programs going, have reached back to these private-sector efforts as well, forming public-private partnerships -- some as ambitious as raising money for a new gymnasium, some as small as the bats and balls that are being provided to several local school teams by the Shooting Gallery, a Manhattan-based movie production company that recently created a foundation to raise money for New York City public school teams.
 
Optimism and Resignation
A Need for Change, And Faith as Well
Many principals say they are optimistic about the changes at the P.S.A.L. mainly because they say the administration of sports could not get much worse.
At Liberty High School, for example, which has only three sports teams -- boys' and girls' volleyball and coed bowling -- Schnur, the principal, said that his new responsibilities had resulted in changes already. Students who want to use the gym after school must now provide proof that they have had a physical examination. That rule, he said, has probably been on the books for years, if not decades, but in the hands of the P.S.A.L. it was never enforced.
"It was essential that it be changed," said Eileen Taylor, the principal at Aviation High School in Queens and an enthusiastic supporter of the overhaul. "More accountability is built in, and it's more realistic."
Most school officials, though, said that keeping sports going in New York -- no matter what changes are made in the name of reform -- had become a matter of faith. Either you believe that it can be done, they said, or you don't.
"We grit our teeth and find a way," said Wanda Nix, the athletic director at Townsend Harris High School in Queens. "I think there are answers. I think they're out there somewhere."

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Welfare Overhaul Justifies Hope and Some Fear

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

 BODY:
Though Wisconsin's radical welfare experiment has drawn more interest than that of any other state, there was little information until this week on what was happening to the droves of people leaving the rolls. In a statistical vacuum, the key question -- "is it working?" -- was answered with a mix of hopes, fears and dueling opinions.
Now state officials have released a trove of information, on things as varied as the number of former welfare recipients with access to a car (54 percent) and the number who say they have been forced to abandon their children (5 percent). But in an environment of sudden statistical abundance, the question of "is it working?" still remains a matter of, well, hopes, fears and dueling opinions. 
 And perhaps it always will.
With the nation's toughest work requirements, Wisconsin has seen the steepest caseload declines.
The good news from Wisconsin, which began its program in 1997, is that the percentage of former recipients who found jobs remained high, even as the welfare exodus reached deeper and deeper into the caseload. Sixty-two percent of the former recipients were working at the time of the survey, and 83 percent had worked sometime in recent months.
Citing such numbers, Larry Mead, a welfare expert at New York University, went as far as to argue that "these work levels represent the greatest achievement in anti-poverty policy since the Great Society."
The bad news is that economic difficulties remained common and for some recipients grew worse. Despite the state's booming economy, sizeable minorities of those pushed from the rolls by the program's universal work requirement reported problems paying for such basics as utilities (47 percent), housing (37 percent) and food (32 percent). Indeed, after leaving welfare, families were almost 50 percent more likely to say they had no way to buy groceries.
"This supports the view of advocates who say the program has serious problems," said Pamela Fendt, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.
Though subject to sharply different interpretations, the study is destined to attract much attention from around the country. More than a dozen states have done similar studies, but Wisconsin's began after about 75 percent of the caseload -- presumably those most employable -- had already left the rolls. Therefore, it gives the first glimpse of how the nation's least job-ready recipients may ultimately fare. On balance, many experts are likely to see the study as reason for guarded optimism.
Though Wisconsin is now dealing with a more troubled portion of the caseload, the percentage of its "leavers" who find work remained comparable to those in other states.
"We're dealing with those at the bottom of the employability ladder, yet our work levels are on par with states that have reformed much less radically," said J. Jean Rogers, who runs the Wisconsin welfare program. "That implies either we underestimated the employability of our most disadvantaged clients, or that Wisconsin's done a good job of promoting and sustaining work."
Under the program, Wisconsin Works or "W-2," virtually everyone is required to work. But the state has created thousands of community service jobs and pledged services, like child care, to all who need them.
On the positive side, the study found most former recipients were earning considerably more than the minimum wage. The average wage was $7.42 an hour, with the median wage $7 an hour. Of those employed, 57 percent said they worked 40 hours or more a week while just 9 percent said they worked less than 20 hours. On average, the study calculated weekly earnings of $262 for those who had jobs.
At that rate, a former recipient who worked all year would earn about $13,600 -- just a few dollars shy of the official poverty threshold for a family of three. But such a worker could also qualify for tax credits worth several thousand dollars, lifting them out of poverty.
On the negative side, fewer than half of the former recipients -- 47 percent -- said they had more money now than when they were on welfare. When asked whether "they were just barely making it," 68 percent answered yes. The study also asked about 17 types of material hardship, such as the ability to afford food, housing and child care. Few of the areas showed substantial improvements since recipients left welfare, and in five categories recipients said things had gotten worse.
In general, surveys like these tend to underestimate the actual amount of hardship since the most troubled people are the hardest to find. Wisconsin found 69 percent of the former recipients it tried to contact, a good rate by national standards. The response rate was lowest in Milwaukee, the urban center where troubled clients are most concentrated.
Though the report is full of numbers, almost all can be bent to varying interpretations. For example, the high percentage of former recipients who say they "are barely making it" were responding to a highly subjective question. A high percentage of the country as a whole might answer the same way. And it is impossible to predict whether things will get better or worse with time.
It is plausible that the earnings will grow, and hardships diminish, as former recipients settle into their new roles as workers. "This is a new experience for them," Ms. Rogers said. As people grow more adept at budgeting, she said, problems with food and housing will abate. But it is also plausible that hardships may increase, especially for the 38 percent still unemployed.
There is one useful comparison. The Wisconsin study borrowed a survey used earlier in South Carolina. While the Wisconsin economy is somewhat better -- its unemployment rate at the time the study began was 3.2 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in South Carolina -- Wisconsin's levels of hardship ran higher. Only 13 percent of former South Carolina recipients reported an inability to buy food, for example, compared with 32 percent in Wisconsin.
Why the difference? At the time of its last survey, South Carolina had cut the rolls only by about half, compared with 75 percent in Wisconsin.
"It's evidence that the further we go down the rolls, the more problems we see," said Jack Tweedie, who tracks welfare programs for the National Conference of State Legislators. "We're not going to conclude that welfare reform 'worked' or 'didn't work' -- it'll work for some and not for others."

HEADLINE: Plot to Oust Castro, Run on a Shoestring, Lands 5 Underpaid Amateurs in Jail

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

DATELINE: GUATEMALA

 BODY:
When terrorist bombs began exploding in Cuba two years ago, speculation about the bombers' identity was rampant. Coup-minded military officers, some Cuban exiles insisted. Or right-wing infiltrators from Miami. A nascent rebel underground, perhaps, supplied from abroad.
But none of those theories help much to explain the role of Jazid Ivan Fernandez, a 28-year-old data processor from Guatemala City who is one of five Central Americans now in a Cuban prison on charges stemming from the attacks. 
 Mr. Fernandez, people who knew him in Guatemala said, was a punctual if undistinguished bureaucrat, a pleasant young man who compiled bus statistics for a Government transport office. He devoted most of his free time not to politics, they said, but to whatever happened to be on television.
The story of the accused saboteurs, assembled from interviews with the five in the Havana prison and accounts of their relatives, associates and others, suggests that even as radical Cuban exiles mounted their most intense campaign of violence in years against the Communist Government, their operations were less cloak-and-dagger than cut-rate and lucky.
"These do not appear to be militants or activists or doctrinaire fanatics," said the Guatemalan Foreign Minister, Eduardo Stein. "They seem to be something like what, in the drug-trafficking world, one would call mules."
 
The Recruits
Gang Couldn't Shoot, Straight or Otherwise
The accused bombers were anything but professional.
Two had had brief experiences as soldiers; a couple, at least, thought vaguely ill of the Cuban Government. But most important to the cause was that all of them were short of cash, struggling with debts on everything from cellular telephones to children's schools.
The most successful of the group, a 28-year-old Salvadoran who needed money for car payments, got $2,500. Another, an executive at El Salvador's biggest car dealership who was struggling to support two children he had fathered out of wedlock, agreed to make the trip to Cuba for $1,000.
Exactly who paid the bills is unclear.
Luis Posada Carriles, an aging Cuban veteran of Central Intelligence Agency crusades against Fidel Castro, acknowledged organizing the attacks, suggesting that he did so with money provided by Cuban exiles in the United States. But he declined to identify them.
United States officials said Federal prosecutors in Puerto Rico were also looking at the bombings as part of a grand jury investigation into what they say was a plot to kill Mr. Castro during a regional summit meeting in the Caribbean last May.
The prosecutors have filed conspiracy charges against seven men, including three with ties to the most prominent exile political group in the United States, the Cuban American National Foundation. A Federal judge recently decided to transfer these proceedings to Miami from Puerto Rico.
Cuban officials have repeatedly accused the foundation and its late chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa, of orchestrating the attacks, a charge it vigorously denies.
But recently Cuba made the charges more specific: In late October, the Government said that Mr. Posada's chief financier was Arnaldo Monzon, a wealthy businessman from Fort Lee, N.J., who is a director of the foundation.
In an interview at his office above a clothing store in Union City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, Mr. Monzon dismissed the accusations as ridiculous.
"That was the first I had heard of it," he said of the plot described by the Cuban Interior Ministry. "I don't think that is a way to overthrow a government."
Cuban security officials, speaking in interviews in which they discussed many details of their investigations for the first time, said they had already found traces of Mr. Monzon and other well-known Cuban-Americans as the pattern of anti-Castro attacks began to shift in 1994 and 1995.
Until then, said Col. Adalberto Rabeiro, a senior official of the Interior Ministry's counterintelligence directorate, such actions had typically been pirate raids on beachfront hotels, with attackers firing automatic weapons from speedboats. Then the attackers grew bolder, aiming at the tourist industry, a key source of foreign exchange.
Cuban officials allowed a reporter to interview the five suspects awaiting trial in Havana after Mr. Posada described his role in the attacks in articles published last summer in The New York Times.
The interviews were conducted at the Villa Marista prison, in a room that appeared to be monitored by security agents.
All five prisoners admitted the crimes of which they have been accused, and denied having been mistreated or coerced to do so. But several were held incommunicado for months, and though much of their accounts was corroborated by friends, relatives, employers and associates, it is impossible to tell whether parts of their stories might have been rehearsed.
Cuban officials said the five were only the last in a recent series of attackers trained abroad. Two of the first, they said, were young Cuban emigres trained in Miami and dropped back on the island in 1995, with 51 pounds of plastic explosives. They and two other exiles, who entered Cuba with a small quantity of explosives in 1996, were arrested before they could blow up anything, the officials said.
On April 12, 1997, however, a bomb exploded at the discotheque in Havana's newest five-star hotel, the Melia Cohiba, and another was found unexploded weeks later. Cuban officials said this marked the start of Mr. Posada's more direct management of the sabotage, a wave of 13 bombings that rattled Cuba for months.
 
The Lures
Jobless Salvadorans And Visions of Cash
As his first mercenary, Cuban officials said, Mr. Posada hired Francisco Chavez Abarca, 29, a Salvadoran. Mr. Posada had met Mr. Chavez's father, a well-connected arms dealer, after arriving in El Salvador in 1985 to work for the United States National Security Council when it was supplying Nicaraguan contra rebels.
That year Mr. Posada escaped from a Venezuelan prison where he had been held on charges of plotting the bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 in which 73 people were killed.
How the younger Mr. Chavez made his living is unclear. But to the young men who hung out with him, the Fat Man, as they called him, had the trappings of small-time underworld success: a used BMW, spending money, a semiautomatic handgun.
"I told him at one point, 'Look Francisco, I'm sure you're mixed up in the drug business,' " said one of those young men, Raul Cruz Leon. " 'When you've got a job, remember me.' "
Such activities were out of character for Mr. Cruz Leon, but his finances were getting desperate. His main job, driving Latin pop singers as the "security chief" for a Salvadoran promoter, rarely paid more than $500 a month. Between car payments, credit-card bills and his cellular phone, he owed nearly $6,000, and relatives said his mother finally mortgaged her small jewelry store to help him pay off the debt.
"I was drowning in the interest payments," he recalled.
Mr. Cruz Leon was clearly something less than the hardened military veteran that Cuban officials suggested and that many news accounts have described.
The son and grandson of army veterans, he had dreamed of entering the Salvadoran military academy, a well-traveled social escalator for boys from the working class.
But he had also studied at the Jesuits' Central American University, and said he was troubled by the military's killing of six priests there in 1989. Within a year of entering the academy, he rose almost to the top rank of his class -- then dropped out.
When Mr. Chavez approached him about "a little job" in late 1996, he said, he agreed immediately. When Mr. Chavez told him later that he wanted to set off small bombs at Havana hotels, Mr. Cruz Leon said he suspected some dispute with a hotel owner.
"I thought of that movie 'The Specialist,' with Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone," Mr. Cruz Leon recalled, looking pale and tired in a blue-polyester prison uniform. "That guy planted a bomb, and he ended up a hero."
Mr. Cruz Leon became the most able of the accused mercenaries, learning to assemble his bombs -- a small wad of plastic explosive, a detonator, a thin Casio alarm clock and a nine-volt battery -- in little more than a minute.
Mr. Chavez, who is said by associates to still be living in San Salvador, appears from travel and telephone records obtained from the Cuban authorities to have been in Cuba when the Melia Cohiba hotel was bombed on April 12. Mr. Cruz Leon followed him in July, he said, getting past a strip search at the Havana airport to bomb two hotels for $2,500. He was arrested during a second trip in September, after another of his bombs killed a 32-year-old Italian businessman.
Mr. Posada said he was unperturbed. "He's not Cuban," he said in the interview, referring to Mr. Cruz Leon. "He did this for money."
But as attention focused on El Salvador after those attacks, Mr. Posada turned to Guatemala, where he recruited a pair of young men to plant two more bombs in August 1997. Guatemalan newspapers reported that one of those men, Marlon Gonzalez, 31, and another man were found in a dump truck last May, badly beaten and shot to death.
Mr. Chavez apparently found his most unlikely recruits in late 1997, at the Guatemala City guest house of Maria Elena Gonzalez, a 54-year-old former school teacher who read tarot cards on the side.
In a prison interview in Havana, Mrs. Gonzalez said Mr. Chavez had come to her because she knew a woman he wanted to kill, apparently on contract, to retaliate for the murder of a wealthy Salvadoran businessman. He spent days having his cards read and hanging about at her pink-plaster home where, coincidentally, the Cuban patriot Jose Marti had once lived.
Cuban security officials suggested that some of their main evidence against Mr. Monzon came from his chatter during card readings by Mrs. Gonzalez. In two interviews, she said Mr. Chavez told her he was owed money by three men, two of whom he named as Arnaldo Monzon and Ramon Medina, an alias used in El Salvador by Mr. Posada.
Mrs. Gonzalez said she also took a telephone message for Mr. Chavez from a caller who identified himself as "the man from New Jersey."
Eventually Mr. Chavez recruited another of Mrs. Gonzalez's sometime guests, Nader Musalam, a 28-year-old Guatemalan who had previously owned a small store where, he said, he had done a modest business in stolen clothing. He had gone to Cuba on vacation years earlier, looking for girls; although the bombs seemed like "not such a good idea," he was eager to get back.
"I liked it a lot," he said. "It wasn't like they made it sound in Guatemala."
According to a deal he said he made with Mr. Chavez early last year, Mr. Musalam was to receive $1,300 for each bomb he planted, enough for a down payment on a Hyundai sedan that he could drive as a taxi. For $800, Mrs. Gonzalez said, she agreed to carry two toothpaste tubes filled with plastic explosives and two small alarm clocks. But she also had to pay for her own plane ticket, which she bought on credit.
"It was the end of the month," she said. "I had to pay the water bill, the electricity bill. I thought this would be some quick money."
Mr. Musalam was arrested at the airport, and Mrs. Gonzalez was picked up as she waited for him at his hotel. Mrs. Gonzalez's husband, Jazid Ivan Fernandez, 28, the data processor, said he had opposed the trip but helped pack the explosives. He was detained three weeks later when he traveled to Cuba to try to locate her.
 
The Organizer
Moving In, in Vain, To Keep Plot Going
When his sabotage network started to fray with the arrests in 1997, Mr. Posada -- who acknowledged before the Cuban Government's announcement that three of his bombers had been captured -- became more directly involved.
A retired Salvadoran Air Force captain, Alberto Barraza, whom Mr. Posada had known from the contra operation, said in an interview that he introduced Mr. Posada to Otto Rene Rodriguez, supposedly to buy inexpensive ammunition.
Mr. Barraza denied any knowledge of the Cuba plot. He said Mr. Rodriguez bought lots of ammunition because of his job as the security supervisor for the Salvadoran company that owns the car dealership, a position in which he supervised more than 200 guards and other employees. Mr. Rodriguez had also spent time at the Gerardo Barrios military academy, leaving early to attend architecture school. And he too was in financial trouble.
The son of a prosperous businessman and the nephew of one of El Salvador's most respected centrist politicians, Otto Rodriguez earned just under $1,000 a month at the car dealership. But in addition to supporting his two children by his estranged wife, he said, he was trying to help two children by other women with whom he had become involved.
"With $1,000 I could solve my problem," he said. "And I thought I could keep some of the expense money they gave me."
He arrived at the Havana airport in August 1997, carrying the explosives in a back pocket, the transistor batteries in a front pocket. He said he planted a bomb at the Melia Cohiba, had a brief affair with a young Cuban woman and returned home to pay off his elder children's school tuition.
After agreeing to try again, he was arrested at the Havana airport last June. This time he was supposed to meet a Cuban conspirator, identified to him only as Juan. Instead he has spent the last months wondering why he ever agreed to join Mr. Posada's campaign.
"This really doesn't have anything to do with us," he said of the plot to bring down the Cuban Government. "Sometimes, it takes a long time to figure out how lost you are."

HEADLINE: Industry Posts Rise in Output For December

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Despite falling exports, American industries churned out more goods in December and managed their most vigorous quarterly gain of the year during the final three months of 1998, the Federal Reserve said today.
Analysts said the robust production data demonstrated the resilience of the nation's nearly eight-year-old expansion. But they noted that turmoil in Asia and Latin America was taking a toll in lost manufacturing jobs and weaker foreign sales. 
 Production by the nation's mines, factories and utilities increased two-tenths of a percent last month after the figure was revised to a decline of one-tenth of a percent in November. Production gained a half-percent in October.
But for all of 1998, industrial production grew only 3.7 percent, far short of the 6 percent jump in 1997. It was the smallest rise in annual output since a 3.5 percent rise in 1993.
Businesses ran at 80.9 percent of maximum capacity last month, down from 81.0 percent in November and the weakest since 80.6 percent in August 1993.
A global slump in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America has sapped demand for many United States-made goods abroad. But production has stayed strong amid robust domestic demand.
For example, production of new cars surged by 79.3 percent in last year's final quarter after weakness earlier in the year related to a strike at the General Motors Corporation. And computer output soared all year, shooting up at a 50.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter.
The Fed said utility companies increased output by 1.6 percent in December after demand for electricity and natural gas slumped amid mild weather in October and November.
Manufacturers increased production by two-tenths of a percent last month after a pickup of one-tenth of a percent in November.
"While it is clear that the manufacturing sector increased at a slower rate than the overall economy last year, the main reasons were lower exports and the process of reducing excess inventories," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Separately, the Commerce Department said today that business inventories in November rose four-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted $1.088 trillion, following a two-tenths of a percent advance in October. Sales also rose four-tenths of a percent after a three-tenths of a percent October gain, implying a healthy balance in stocks of unsold goods.
The picture remained mixed for manufacturing in 1999 after a difficult year in 1998.
"There have been 252,000 manufacturing jobs lost since March and what this output for the whole year reflects is the damage from Southeast Asia," said David Orr, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.

HEADLINE: Pete Wilson Reflects on One More, Elusive Rung

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 15

 BODY:
For eight years in Sacramento, Pete Wilson had to look no farther than the big portrait of Ronald Reagan in his office to dream of what the future might hold for a Republican Governor of California. Now, in his second week as a private citizen, Mr. Wilson has begun sharing an office suite here with the former President himself, but the dream remains uncertain.
As he unpacks boxes and pictures from his tumultuous tenure at the helm of the nation's most populous state, Mr. Wilson is looking both backward and forward. He is celebrating, explaining and defending his record -- including a Presidential bid that died aborning three years ago -- and considering one more run for the White House. 
 "The table stakes are very high," Mr. Wilson said of the newly compressed primary election calendar and the $15 million to $25 million that he says would be needed to run a credible campaign. He has formed a political committee to advocate his policy ideas but makes clear that he will run only if he can raise the money. He plans a foreseeable future of private breakfast soundings and fund-raising phone calls, and promises a decision by "late spring or early summer."
Mr. Wilson, 65, who was barred by law from seeking a third term, has already had quite a ride. He has won four statewide elections since 1982 and built a reputation as one of the shrewdest politicians California ever produced. He has endured the biggest budget deficit and enjoyed the biggest budget surplus in the state's history, and persevered through a punishing recession and a plague of natural disasters to preside over a booming economic recovery that in the last three years has seen California create more new jobs than New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois combined.
But he has also left a trail of controversy and divisiveness with his support for ballot measures to curtail social services for illegal immigrants and end state affirmative action programs, and with his breaking a 1994 re-election promise not to run for President in 1996. In November, Republicans lost the governorship by a landslide, and their minority in the Legislature shrank to the point where this is now the nation's most Democratic state except Hawaii.
Finally, as a prospective Presidential candidate whose principal draw is his electoral appeal in California, where a giant pile of delegates will now be chosen early in the nominating process, Mr. Wilson faces a painful paradox: He left office with the highest job approval rating of his tenure, but more than 6 in 10 California voters say they would not be inclined to support him for President.
"Toward the end of his term, he was finally getting some credit -- and quite a bit of it -- for the outstanding performance of the economy in 1998," said Mark Baldassare, survey director of the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research group. "But assuming that is going to carry over into national leadership is another matter altogether."
In fact, the latest survey by Mr. Baldassare's organization shows Mr. Wilson supported by just 5 percent of likely voters in a statewide Presidential straw poll, one-quarter the level of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
Mr. Wilson swats away those poll numbers, saying with typical asperity, "Well, a lot of them have been told for a long time that I'm not popular," and noting that his ratings on leaving office were comparable to those Mr. Reagan had after eight years as Governor.
Yet Mr. Wilson has been hurt by a willingness -- sometimes even a seeming eagerness -- to take combative stands. His support for abortion rights and gay rights, which has given him a moderate coloration useful to any national candidate, has made him a pariah among many of the conservative activists who dominate the Republican primary process. His willingness to raise taxes to help close a crushing budget deficit when he took office in 1991 infuriated anti-tax crusaders while earning him little credit from liberals, because he insisted on cutting spending by a like amount.
That battle, Mr. Wilson says, taught him "that there are people who, when faced with certain options, were not capable of exercising any, and legislators can get away with that, but chief executives cannot."
The worst recession since the Great Depression severely curtailed Mr. Wilson's ability to deliver on the notion of "preventive government" that he initially campaigned on. He battled relentlessly with the state's public employee unions, and only in the last three years was he able to begin to restore spending for education, reducing class sizes in the early grades and forcing an annual student test through the Legislature -- accomplishments on which his Democratic successor, Gray Davis, is unabashedly building.
"He gets no credit for the good things he did for the state; he's got a legitimate gripe there," said Tony Quinn, a moderate Republican analyst in Sacramento. "But he picked all these unnecessary fights."
The fight most damaging to Mr. Wilson was his support for Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot measure curtailing health, education and other social services for illegal immigrants. It passed overwhelmingly but has since been tied up in court, and a Wilson television advertisement with the slogan "They keep coming" roused the state's growing Hispanic population to register and vote Democratic in record numbers.
Mr. Wilson is defiantly unrepentant about his stand, which he says grew out of a huge drain that illegal immigrants were causing in the state budget. He accuses his political opponents of demagoguery and derides Republican critics as "weak sisters in our party who make the mistake of letting the other side define the game and the rules."
"There was no 'inflammatory rhetoric,' " Mr. Wilson said. " 'They keep coming'? That's a statement of fact."
But the Democrats have effectively used the issue not only against Mr. Wilson but also against Republicans throughout the state, and the crowd at Mr. Davis's inauguration last week responded with a thunderous standing ovation when he promised to "ring down the curtain on the politics of division." Mr. Wilson and his wife, Gayle, alone among the dignitaries on the dais, remained seated.
"I thought they were a little tasteless, to be honest," Mr. Wilson said of his successor's digs. "But was I surprised? No. I mean, that was an audience that was hungry. That was a very partisan audience. They've been waiting for 16 years." Then, in a dig of his own, at the last Democratic Governor, the quixotic Jerry Brown, he added, "They've been waiting for longer than that, actually."
Mr. Wilson's last Presidential campaign collapsed after throat surgery left him unable to speak for nearly four months and he had trouble raising money. He acknowledges his decision to run as the one real regret of his tenure.
"If he hadn't run last time," one longtime former aide said, "they'd be talking about Wilson and Bush as the two powerhouses."
Mr. Wilson said the fund-raising necessary for a Presidential campaign was "an enormous chore," and predicted that the Republican field would be limited because of the costs.
But Larry Thomas, who was Mr. Wilson's press secretary when he was Mayor of San Diego two decades ago, and in his first, failed campaign for governor in 1978, said, "It's very difficult for me to believe that he will just go quietly into the night."
Mr. Baldassare, the pollster, agreed. "I think it's too early to count him out," he said. "People have counted him out before, especially in 1994, and he's somebody who knows how to put together a campaign to win. That's something the Republicans desperately need. But he still has an awful lot to overcome to convince those voters who know him the best -- Californians -- that he's Presidential material."

HEADLINE: Henry Cohen, 76, Urban Planner And a New York City Official

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Henry Cohen, an urban planner, a retired dean at the New School for Social Research and a prominent New York City official in the Wagner and Lindsay administrations, died Thursday at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 76.
The cause was liver cancer, his family said. 
 Dean Cohen served in the city government from 1950 to 1968. He was the First Deputy Administrator and Acting Administrator of the Human Resources Administration before he joined the New School staff in 1968.
He was appointed a professor of urban affairs and became the founding dean of what is now the Milano Graduate School of Management and Urban Policy. He built the school into one of the foremost teaching centers of its kind in the country.
Starting in 1968, he was the director and then dean of the Center for New York City Affairs. The center was merged into the Graduate School of Management and Urban Professions when it was established in 1975.
Dean Cohen drew up innovative curriculums offering seven graduate professional degree programs. He recruited a faculty that trained a fresh generation of urban leaders and brought to life his concept of what he called "new urban professions." Among them were urban policy analysis and management, human resources management, health management and policy, and nonprofit management.
Henry Cohen was born in Manhattan, graduated from City College in 1942 and received a Master of City Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1944. Toward the end of World War II, he fought in the Army's Ninth Infantry Division through the Huertgen Forest, the Battle of the Bulge and across the Rhine to occupied Leipzig.
He worked with the postwar military government in Germany, then did postgraduate studies at the University of Iowa and Columbia University, taught urban sociology at City College and lectured at the University of Birmingham, England.
In 1950, he joined the New York City government. He organized the research division in the Department of City Planning and directed it until 1955. He lectured on urban studies at Columbia's School of General Studies and School of Social Work, and did research for the New York Regional Plan Association.
He was a Deputy City Administrator and senior management consultant, simultaneously, in the office of Mayor John V. Lindsay. He was appointed First Deputy Administrator and Acting Administrator at Human Resources in 1967, the year before he moved to the New School.
Dean Cohen is survived by his wife of 50 years, Evelyn Fuhrman Cohen; a daughter, Alison Rose Levy of Brooklyn; a son, Daniel, of Needham, Mass.; a brother, Dr. Sidney Cohen of Manhattan; a sister, Margaret Weisman of the Washington area, and two granddaughters.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE POLICY MAKERS;
Brazil Is Warned to Clean Up Its Economic Act

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Having given up on defending the value of its currency at least temporarily, Brazil got a muted but clear warning from the International Monetary Fund and the United States today that failure to act quickly on pledges to bolster its financial condition through spending cuts and tax increases would lead to a downward economic spiral.
Two top Brazilian officials, Pedro Malan, the Finance Minister, and Francisco Lopes, the central bank governor, were flying to Washington tonight for meetings on Saturday at the I.M.F. and on Sunday at the Treasury Department. 
 Although the collapse of Brazil's effort to prop up the currency revealed the depth of the country's economic and political problems, it also came as something of a relief to policy makers, who had come to view the attempt as futile and a waste of the country's dwindling foreign currency reserves.
Despite having previously called on Brazil to maintain currency stability, the I.M.F. issued a statement tonight calling the decision "a wise move to stop the loss of reserves."
Earlier in the day, Stanley Fischer, the first deputy managing director at the I.M.F., said he still expected Brazil to meet the fiscal targets it agreed to as part of the $41.5 billion international aid package negotiated last fall. Brazil's failure so far to enact the politically painful measures needed to reduce its huge budget deficit led to rapidly mounting pressure on the currency, the real, and to today's decision to let market forces set the currency's value.
Mr. Fischer said it was "very early to be drawing any firm conclusions" about how Brazil should proceed.
Mr. Fischer suggested though that I.M.F. officials would discuss with the Brazilians whether they should continue allowing the currency to float or whether they should attempt to stabilize its value through intervention in the foreign exchange market or by establishing a new trading range that the Government could try to enforce.
"Questions on exchange rate systems, on how to make them more flexible and when, is high on the agenda," Mr. Fischer told a conference at Harvard University.
Brazilian officials said they would disclose their plans for the currency on Monday, and President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said tonight that the Government would continue to defend the currency's value and believed that it would eventually be able to reduce interest rates.
In remarks to reporters in New York, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said it was unlikely that there would be any new aid pledged to Brazil this weekend. The solution to Brazil's problems, Mr. Rubin said, "lies in Brazil itself, in putting together an effective fiscal program and an effective foreign exchange regime."
But economists said it was an open question whether Brazil could restore enough confidence in the financial markets to avert a long economic slide. They said the country would probably have to keep extremely high interest rates in place to keep the currency from free fall, ultimately leading to a choice between a painful recession or dropping rates and allowing inflation to surge.
Officials from a number of countries said they remained concerned about the possibility of Brazil's troubles dragging down neighboring countries, including Argentina, and ultimately having an effect around the world.
The troubled search today for a response to Brazil's problems and to the broader issue of containing the financial turmoil that has swept around the world for the last year and a half prompted a new initiative today from Germany, France and Japan that is likely to exacerbate tensions between those countries and the United States.
After a meeting in Frankfurt, German, French and Japanese officials called for a new international system to limit the volatility of currencies. The nations provided few details of how such a system would work, but backed the creation of "an exchange rate regime among major currencies which would reduce excessive volatility."
The Clinton Administration has always viewed attempts to control currency fluctuations with skepticism if not hostility, and economists said it was hard to understand why Germany, France and Japan would call for such a system in the immediate aftermath of Brazil's failure to control its exchange rate. And American officials said the focus should be on Brazil's efforts to improve the soundness of its basic economic policies.
Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a Federal Reserve governor, said it was "now even more important that Brazil move as quickly as possible to implement a clearly sustainable fiscal position and regain the confidence of international markets and investors."
The World Bank said in a statement that President Cardoso "has consistently shown his commitment to implementing Brazil's reform package," but noted that further aid to Brazil was dependent on the changes actually being enacted.
Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, said the crisis of the last few days created an opportunity for Brazil to get back on track solving its underlying economic problems, particularly its budget deficit.
"The sense of urgency in Brazil began to evaporate after the agreement was signed with the I.M.F. last year because there was a feeling that things were looking better," Mr. Hormats said. "The question now is whether Brazil can use the greater sense of urgency created by the events of the past few days to move more boldly on measures to reduce the fiscal deficit."
Mr. Hormats said the experience in Indonesia last year suggested that it might be futile for Brazil to re-establish an exchange rate target for the currency until after it had proved to the markets that it was serious about dealing with its fiscal problems.
For the I.M.F. and the United States, Mr. Hormats said, one of the most difficult decisions will be whether to continue providing money to Brazil if it does not fully comply with the requirements of its agreement with the fund.
"If they provide the money without Brazil having complied with the measures, then they take the pressure off again," Mr. Hormats said. On the other hand, he said, the fund does not want to repeat its experience with Russia last year, when a breakdown of Russia's economic plan led the I.M.F. to cut off assistance.
"I think they will avoid at all costs a Russian situation," Mr. Hormats said.
But analysts are divided over Brazil's prospects. Desmond Lachman, an emerging-markets research analyst for Salomon Smith Barney and a former I.M.F. official, said Brazil had an opportunity now to run its economy with a more realistic exchange rate.
"If they do what the I.M.F. is telling them to do on the budget and restore people's confidence, they can bring interest rates down and not go through a crushing recession," Mr. Lachman said.
Guillermo Calvo, the director of the Center for International Economics at the University of Maryland, said he was very pessimistic about Brazil.
"The focus has shifted from a balance of payments crisis to an inflation crisis, from an international crisis to a domestic crisis," he said.
To avoid the inflation that a weaker currency creates, the I.M.F. will probably insist that Brazil keep interest rates high, he said. But high rates will push the economy toward recession, creating intense political pressure to reduce rates, he said, a move that would allow inflation to flare up as the currency falls again and import prices rise.
"This has always been the story in Brazil," Mr. Calvo said.

HEADLINE: Enlistments Falling, Navy Lowers Education Standard

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Facing a shortage of sailors at sea, the Navy announced today that it would have to lower educational standards for new recruits as part of a series of initiatives to increase enlistments.
Since the end of the cold war, the Navy has required that 95 percent of new recruits have a high school diploma, but for the first time in a decade, it will require no more than 90 percent. 
 The Secretary of the Navy, Richard Danzig, ordered the changes in the wake of one of the Navy's worst recruiting efforts in years. Last fall, the Navy fell short of its annual recruiting goal for the first time since the draft ended in 1973, and it did so disastrously, enlisting 12 percent fewer recruits than it needed.
The difficulty in recruiting -- which has also hit the Army and, to a lesser extent, the Air Force and the Marine Corps -- has forced the Navy to send ships to sea with less than full crews. In recent weeks, the Navy disclosed today, it has had as many as 22,000 empty positions -- or bunks -- in its 327-ship fleet. Most shortages have come on ships at sea.
The services attribute the shortages in new recruits to a variety of factors, from a booming economy and low unemployment rate to the fact that 70 percent of young people go straight to college after finishing high school, compared with less than half a decade ago.
But the Navy's response is certain to provoke criticism that the service is lowering the standards of its enlisted sailors. The Army faced sharp attacks from Congress when it announced a similar change two years ago. The Marine Corps continues to require at least 95 percent of enlistees to have diplomas. The Air Force also has a minimum standard of 90 percent but for the last 15 years has never fallen below 99 percent.
Representative Stephen E. Buyer, a Republican from Indiana who is chairman the House subcommittee on military personnel, responded this evening by saying that he was "deeply concerned" about the recruiting problems facing the services and the impact those problems were having on the military's readiness.
"While I am pleased the Navy is working to address these issues," Mr. Buyer said in a statement, "I have very deep reservations about any action which results in the lowering of recruitment standards."
In announcing its changes late on a Friday before a holiday weekend, a time traditionally used to disclose unpleasant news, the Navy emphasized that it had decided not to lower its standards for aptitude. Instead, the Navy noted that some young people drop out of high school for a variety of reasons but nonetheless prove to be good recruits because of innate intelligence or hard work.
"A high school diploma is an important validation of ability to succeed," the Navy's announcement said. "It is not, however, the 'be all' or 'end all' of a potential recruit's measure of worth."
The Navy estimated that by not requiring a diploma, it could recruit 2,600 more new enlistees to help it reach this year's goal of 53,224.
In addition to the education standards, the Navy announced a series of initiatives to entice more young people to sign up and stay in once they join. The Navy plans to increase its enlistment bonuses and the money it gives for college tuition, as the Army did last year when it increased tuition grants to $50,000 from $40,000.
The Navy also said it would make it easier for experienced sailors to re-enlist even if they did not qualify for promotion. And it pledged not to immediately discharge sailors who failed tough new fitness tests.
The Navy's announcement has come as the Clinton Administration has faced criticism from Republicans who argue that budget constraints have robbed the Pentagon of the resources it needs.
Heeding the advice of the military chiefs and of Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, President Clinton has proposed $110 billion in new Pentagon spending during the next six years. Included are increases in pay and pensions aimed at persuading young men and women to join the military and then stay.
The Navy, with 372,000 officers and enlisted personnel, needs 160,000 sailors to fill its ships at sea. The shortages have left some ships, including aircraft carriers and submarines, at less than 90 percent strength.
Mr. Danzig, who took over as Secretary in November, said the shortages did not necessarily hurt "readiness" for combat. Still, he said, crews were being forced to do double duty or to work in areas outside their specialties.
While he dismissed criticism about the change in educational standards, others voiced concerns.
Eugene J. Carroll Jr., a retired two-star admiral who is now deputy director at Center for Defense Information in Washington, said the end of the draft and the reduction of forces after the cold war meant that the Navy and other services could select better qualified, less troublesome recruits. The diploma, he said, was not an absolute standard of intelligence but a sign of discipline and perseverance.
"The high school diploma isn't just an educational badge," he said. "It's a character badge, in a sense. And if you have to take more people without that, you take a little more risk."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Brazil's Currency Move Gives Shares a Lift Worldwide

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
World stock markets soared yesterday as traders saw in Brazil's decision to stop defending its currency an end to the uncertainty that has recently clouded the global investment outlook.
For the time being at least, investors returned to stocks and pulled money away from havens, like United States Treasury bonds, where they had sought shelter in recent days. 
 South American markets soared, led by a 34 percent jump in Brazil's Bovespa stock index, and European markets also gained.
In the United States, Wall Street started a three-day weekend with a positively giddy response to Brazil's new currency regime. After four straight days of losses, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 219.62 points yesterday, or 2.4 percent, to 9,340.55.
Long-term Treasury bonds fell nearly a point as traders moved back into stocks, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 5.12 percent.
The stock market's gains were not enough, however, to allow either the Dow industrials or the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to recoup all the week's losses. The S.& P. index rose 31.07 yesterday, or 2.6 percent, to 1,243.26.
Both the Dow and S.& P. indexes finished the week lower than they began, putting gains for the year between 1 percent and 2 percent. And economists and investment managers say they expect that further trouble in Brazil's economy is likely to find its way into the earnings of American companies by year-end.
"I think this is the calm before the storm," said John Y. Kim, chief investment officer of Aeltus Investment Management, a unit of Aetna Retirement Services. "I think there will be more bad news before any good news."
Technology stocks, meanwhile, proved to be one of the safest havens of all.
Yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index tacked on 71.38, or 3.1 percent, to 2,348.20. In the first two weeks of 1999, the Nasdaq index, which rose nearly 40 percent last year, gained more than 7 percent.
Traders on Wall Street typically exhibit one of two moods: despair or euphoria, and frequently switch between them several times a day.
But for four days the mood was mostly gloomy, as Brazil's economic crisis threatened to sink the earnings momentum of big American companies that do business overseas.
In early trading, the price of futures contracts on the S.& P. 500 index, which traders use as a gauge of how the day will proceed, fell precipitously, losing another 2 percent of their value in the 30 minutes after trading began at 7 A.M.
Then, shortly after 7:30 A.M., the world changed. Reports flooded the news services that Brazil's currency had already declined about 9 percent, out of the range set on Thursday by the nation's central bank.
In New York, futures prices rose tentatively, then soared shortly after 8 A.M., when Brazil announced that it would allow the real to float freely, at least until Monday.
To traders, the good news was in the Brazilian Government's decision to use its reserves to deal with the economic impact of devaluation rather than slowly bleed them as investors withdrew capital from the country.
So when the New York Stock Exchange and other American markets opened at 9:30 A.M., stock prices raced higher.
The American companies with the most at stake in Brazil -- banks with big loans to the country, and manufacturers of automobiles and heavy equipment with operations in South America -- retraced some of their recent losses.
American Express gained 8 3/8, to 104 3/8, while J. P. Morgan rose 6 3/4, to 108 3/4. Ford Motor rose 1 5/8, to 62, and Caterpillar climbed 1 1/8, to 47 9/16 .
However euphoric traders were in the short term, economists and market analysts warned that Brazil's problems were far from over. If a slowly dying Brazilian currency was bad for investors, it was understandable that a swiftly eviscerated one might be worse.
With the devaluation, "growth in Brazil will be much smaller than it would be otherwise," said Art Steinmetz, portfolio manager of the $8 billion Oppenheimer Strategic Income fund, which invests in global bond markets. He expects a 4 to 5 percent contraction in the Brazilian economy this year, about twice the size of the downturn he previously expected, he said.
"Certainly that will affect the region, which will have an effect on the hemisphere, which will eventually show up in the world's growth," Mr. Steinmetz said. "Should we be rallying stocks and selling Treasuries in that situation? I don't think so. I think the markets are being a little short-sighted today."
A recession in Brazil that is deepened by the weakened currency is more likely to spill over to other South American countries, if not to Mexico, economists said. The further north the effects of the crisis creep, the more likely that United States companies could feel the effect of that slowdown later this year.
Mr. Kim of Aeltus said he expected an economic slowdown across Central and South America that will eat into economic growth here, slowing America's gross domestic product gains this year to 2 percent from a previously forecast 2.5 percent.
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said that the direct trade impact on the United States of the Brazilian slowdown would be relatively small. But, he added, the effect on the earnings of American companies could be more pronounced.
"Before all the emerging market crises, 30 percent of U.S. corporate earnings came from outside the United States," Mr. Steinberg said. "Now the U.S. stands alone as the colossus of the world economy. We are strong, and the rest of the world has negligible or negative growth. As more and more pieces of the map fall off, at some point later in the year we've got to slow down in reaction."
Others, however, saw no such problem. Speaking at a conference in San Jose, Calif., Abby Joseph Cohen, the investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs, said she was "still bullish" on the stock market, according to Bloomberg News.
"Over the next several weeks we will introduce our forecast for 2000 and at this point I do not expect there to be any significant problems developing either in terms of growth, inflation or interest rates," Ms. Cohen said.
Certainly few investors appeared to believe that many problems lie ahead for companies in the technology industry, which has taken the lead as the market's bellwether industry group and whose prospects seem to have no limits.
Prices of almost all of the largest technology stocks were higher yesterday: Cisco Systems gained 5 5/16 , to 101 11/16 ; Microsoft rose 8, to 149 3/4; Compaq Computer jumped 2 1/16 , to 46 5/8, and Sun Microsystems rose 5 15/16 , to 100 7/16 .
Shares of some of the larger Internet companies also gained, with Amazon.com rising 2 3/8, to 140 3/8, and America Online moving ahead 2, to 146 1/2. But Yahoo fell 26 15/16 , to 317, cutting the stock's gain in the first two weeks of the year to 33 percent.
None matched the stunning debut of Marketwatch.com, however, which made its initial public offering yesterday. Those lucky enough to get shares in the offering paid $17, but the shares started trading at 90 and finished the day up 80 1/2, to 97 1/2.
Shares of Data Broadcasting, which owned half of Marketwatch.com before the offering, fell 9 7/16 , to 21 3/4, retracing some of the gains it had made as traders anticipated today's stock sale. CBS, which owned the other half of Marketwatch.com, rose 13/16 , to 34 15/16 .

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Bonds Drop Sharply
 (By Bloomberg News) -- The bond market snapped a three-day rally yesterday, faltering as strong gains in stocks worldwide reduced demand for the haven of Treasury securities.
"The flight to quality has reversed," said Marc Fovinci, who helps oversee $1.6 billion at Ferguson, Wellman, Rudd, Purdy & Van Winkle in Portland, Ore.
The 30-year bond fell 1 1/32 , to a price of 102 6/32 . Its yield, which rises when the price falls, increased to 5.12 percent from 5.05.
Yields on two-year notes, the most actively traded Treasuries, rose 12 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 4.56 percent. The market will be closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

HEADLINE: Russia Proposes New System For Monitoring Iraqi Arms

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Russia, which is opposing any revival of the present arms inspection system in Iraq, today gave the Security Council a detailed blueprint for a new monitoring apparatus having much less independence.
The United States representative here quickly rejected the plan. 
 It was the fourth proposal this week as nations lay out their positions and try to influence others. The bargaining could turn into a long debate if the Security Council is to reach a common position.
Plans from France and now Russia outlining new inspection systems start from premise that the oil embargo imposed after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 would end. On Thursday Canada also presented a plan that it hoped would be able to bridge gaps between the positions.
The hastily assembled American plan would keep the current inspection system, but would allow the unlimited sales of Iraqi oil, provided that the revenues went solely to buy civilian goods to alleviate the strains of eight years of sanctions. The Clinton Administration said it would look favorably on requests by Baghdad to buy more spare parts to upgrade its dilapidated oil industry. With the state of its industry and with world oil prices low, Iraq has not been meeting even its current ceilings on production and sales.
Today Iraq rejected the American proposals, which members of Congress say were made hurriedly and without consultation with legislators. In Baghdad, the Commerce Minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said Iraq would accept "nothing less than a total lifting of the embargo."
Official Iraqi newspapers repeated the Government's call for an end to the no-flight zones that the United States, Britain and France have imposed over large areas of northern and southern Iraq. Furthermore, Iraqi leaders continued their denunciations of Arab leaders critical of President Hussein and renewed vague threats against Kuwait.
An Iraqi threat to rescind its recognition of the territorial integrity of Kuwait, repeated most recently by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, is being taken seriously by the United States, which hears warnings similar to those that preceded Iraq's 1990 invasion. "This is a very provocative thing for the Iraqis to have said," Peter Burleigh, the American representative on the Council, said today.
The United States response to the Russian proposal was negative on several counts. American diplomats say any arms control system in Iraq cannot afford to be politicized in the United Nations bureaucracy and must remain technically competent and maintain freedom of action within Security Council resolutions.
The United Nations commission for disarming Iraq and the International Atomic Energy Agency "have to continue functioning with regard to the disarmament of Iraq," Mr. Burleigh said.
The representative of France, Alain Dejammet, said today that the reality of the situation was that the present United Nations Special Commission was never going to go back, and that while the Security Council was paralyzed over the issue, nothing was being done to monitor Iraq.
At the core of the Russian proposal is the creation of a monitoring center "within the framework of the U.N. Secretariat." Since 1991, inspections of Iraq's reputed biological, chemical and missile programs have been carried out by the Special Commission, a body of independent experts set up by the Security Council and answerable to its member nations. Only the Iraqi nuclear program has been monitored by an established United Nations body, the International Atomic Energy Agency, although in cooperation with the commission, known as Unscom.
Russia's plan begins with the sending of a assessment mission made up of representatives of the 15 members of the Security Council and international technical experts. Its task would be to work out with Iraq how to resume cooperation.
The assessment team would be drawn at least in part from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the relatively new international organization set up in The Hague to monitor a treaty banning chemical weapons. Unscom would have no standing with the new team, except to provide some "purely technical support" through individual experts taking part as individuals.
Under the Russian plan, all past weapons files would be closed, allowing the oil embargo to be ended and a long-term monitoring system to be installed or activated, since much of the machinery is in place -- or was when the Unscom inspectors were evacuated in December hours before American and British air strikes.
A monitoring center would be established in Baghdad, supplanting the Unscom base there. It would house an export-import control group, which would watch for Iraqi efforts to import "dual use" equipment that may look civilian on paper but could find its way into arms projects.
The Russians say this group could be built around Unscom's existing operation, which had been very successful in finding clues to Mr. Hussein's intentions based on what he tried to buy abroad.
Diplomats watching various proposals unfolding in the Security Council doubt that the United States will be able to hold back a tide against the existing systems set up to curb Mr. Hussein. The United States can veto any proposed resolutions indefinitely, but would prefer not to.
American diplomats are still talking about rebuilding the fragile Council unity against Iraq that was shattered by the December air strikes. The United States could be in the embarrassing position of seeing its military action, however successful on the ground, lead to a diplomatic victory by Iraq.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE ECONOMICS -- One Choice Made, More to Come;
Why Brazil Did What It Did and What Options Are Left

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
On Wednesday, Brazil drew a line in the sand in front of its embattled currency, the real. Yesterday, it erased that line, sending the sand scattering, as it allowed the real to trade freely against other currencies.
That abrupt reversal came after investors doubted the Brazilian Government's ability to defend the currency following the resignation of Brazil's hard-money central bank chief, Gustavo Franco, and the 9 percent devaluation in the real's value on Wednesday. 
 After yesterday's surprise move, the real tumbled another 8 percent, but stock markets from Toronto to Santiago surged in apparent relief that Brazil would no longer waste billions of dollars propping up the currency. For a day, at least, Brazil did not threaten to spin out of control, taking the rest of Latin America down with it.
But throwing in the towel on its old policy of pegging the real to the dollar is only a stopgap. Now the Brazilian Government and international finance policy makers must wrestle with what comes next.
Brazil has the same choices that other countries with tottering currencies have had. It can continue allowing the currency to trade freely, or it can try to set a new trading range and maintain that range by buying reais in the foreign exchange market.
Or it can follow the more radical example of its neighbor Argentina, and set up a currency board, which would peg the real to the dollar at a fixed rate of exchange.
Such options are likely to be discussed this weekend, when Brazil's Finance Minister and central bank chief meet in Washington with officials from the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury Department.
Whatever Brazil's decision, it will reverberate throughout the world. The impact will be felt most heavily in Argentina, Brazil's biggest trading partner and, like Brazil, a country that has only recently recovered from years of hyperinflation. Should the Brazilian currency be allowed to trade freely, it is unclear how the Argentine peso could keep its dollar peg when most of its exports and imports will be priced in a currency that can fluctuate wildly in value. Currency volatility is the last thing Latin American economies need, as they enter a period of slowing growth and rising unemployment.
For American investors and businesses, the Brazilian eruption is the latest chapter in a contagious currency crisis that started in Thailand in July 1997 and spread as far as Russia last summer. If the turmoil leads to a prolonged downturn on Wall Street or cuts heavily into American exports, the robust economy in the United States could turn anemic. Here is a brief guide to what is at stake and what might happen next:
 
Q. Why is Brazil so important?
 
A. Brazil is the biggest economy in Latin America, about twice as big as Mexico's. While it buys just 3 percent of United States exports, its economic health is vital to a region that accounts for one-fifth of United States exports. But Brazil looms even larger in the minds of international investors for the simple reason that it was one of the last large countries to go down the road of free trade, privatization and hard money. If that approach fails in Brazil, the ideal of a unified global economy knit together by trade and investment is threatened. That is one reason that the I.M.F. cobbled together one of the biggest rescue packages in history, and one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates in the United States three times last fall.
 
Q. What's a devaluation?
 
A. Both devaluation and depreciation refer to a decline in the value of a currency. The distinction is this: when a government has declared that it is pegging its currency to another and will defend it by any means necessary but lets it fall anyway, that is a devaluation; when the falling currency is that of a country that allows the market to set its value and its value falls, that is a depreciation. One involves a broken promise; the other doesn't.
When Brazil announced its devaluation, overseas investors saw it as a sign that the Government was caving in to political pressure from unions and big business to put its anti-inflation strategy on the back burner and to fight unemployment instead.
 
Q. Why did Brazilians make the choices they made?
 
A. Brazil pegged its currency to the dollar in the first place as a way of convincing investors at home and abroad that it would no longer tolerate the chronic inflation that has plagued it for decades. When the so-called Real Plan was enacted in 1994 inflation was running at more than 3,000 percent. Like Russia and scores of other developing countries, Brazil had long financed huge Government commitments mainly by printing money rather than collecting taxes.
But fixing the exchange rate and getting inflation down initially proved easier than scaling back Government commitments. Brazil has a social security system that allows workers to retire after 20 years, often with pensions higher than the pay workers were earning on the job. What is more, it takes the equivalent of a constitutional amendment to lay off public workers.
At the same time, Brazil's economy has been stagnating, unemployment is at near-record levels, exports are falling and the trade deficit is way up. Tight money was not only hurting exporters by keeping the currency strong but was keeping interest rates high (around 30 percent). Remember the early 1980's, when the United States had a big budget deficit and the Federal Reserve's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, declared war on inflation? Interest rates were sky high, the dollar was extremely strong and American manufacturers were screaming murder.
Now, Brazil's industrialists and unions are the ones who are screaming. They want a weaker currency to stimulate exports by making their goods more competitive on the world market -- even at the cost of more inflation, lately running less than 3 percent a year. Newspapers in Sao Paulo, the industrial center of Brazil, had been calling for Mr. Franco's head for months.
 
Q. What did Brazil hope to accomplish?
 
A. The devaluation was supposed to buy time. If investors had gone along, bond prices might have stabilized or gone up, interest rates might have leveled off or fallen, and exports might have received a lift. But the strategy fell apart almost as soon as it was introduced for the same reason it failed in Thailand, Russia and elsewhere. Investors at home and abroad simply were not convinced that the first devaluation would be the last. They saw it as a sign of more to come. Any investor holding a currency she thought was going to be worth less tomorrow would sell immediately.
With foreigners and, increasingly, domestic investors taking large positions against the real, Brazil faced a nasty choice. It could try to stem the tide by using its hard-currency reserves. Unlike Mexico in 1994 or Russia in 1998, Brazil had roughly $40 billion in reserves as well as a $30 billion credit line from the I.M.F. Or it could let the currency fall to whatever value the market placed on it, making no promises to exchange it for dollars at a particular rate or to defend it if it fell below a certain level. It chose the latter.
 
Q. What are Brazil's options now?
 
A. A jet flying at 40,000 feet can fall 10,000 feet and still avoid disaster if the pilot manages to regain control of the aircraft. Everything depends on Brazil's regaining control of its economic policy. For the moment, at least, it has. But to resolve its currency crisis, Brazilian policy makers must choose among several long-term strategies.
Brazil could simply announce a new fixed rate -- or more accurately a new range of rates -- tied to the dollar to replace the old range of rates. As with the old regime, the new currency system could be devalued by a specified, tiny amount every few days, but no more than that. The central bank would promise to use monetary policy and foreign exchange reserves to support the value of the currency in the foreign exchange market. But this would work only if Brazil could keep investors convinced that it was going to keep its promises more faithfully in the future.
With good reason, the Finance Minister of Mexico noted at the height of his country's currency crisis that only the most extreme exchange rate regimes -- in other words, those that essentially remove any discretion -- truly rule out the threat of speculative attacks. A permanent floating rate, the system that the United States and most other rich countries have embraced, is one such extreme. The other, chosen by Argentina and a number of former Soviet republics, is to adopt a system that virtually rules out devaluation by putting foreign exchange policy in the hands of a currency board.
Letting your currency fluctuate with supply and demand has the definite advantage of allowing the currency to adjust to shocks like, say, a collapse in commodity prices. Further, a country does not risk speculative attack because it has not promised to exchange r its currency for a specified amount of dollars. Alas, Brazil is not a good candidate for a permanent floating exchange rate scheme.
For starters, where Brazil goes, Argentina must follow. Argentina, Brazil's biggest trading partner and a fellow recovering inflation addict, would be forced to abandon its fixed rate currency strategy -- a strategy that seems to be working well and one that lots of investors are counting on.
The Brazilian Government's huge domestic debt, around $270 billion, also poses an obstacle. Because the Government could not persuade investors to lend it money except by providing very short maturities and promising to index much of the debt to dollars, every time the exchange rate fell, the Government's obligations would jump. A big drop in the currency would mean instant default, just as it did in Russia last summer or in Mexico in 1995.
Another option for Brazil, a currency board, is the most radical, but has some strong supporters both within Brazil's central bank and in the I.M.F. It is a desperate measure that involves giving up all pretense of controlling one's own currency and in effect replacing the central bank with a board that includes some foreigners. On the other hand, Argentina, which has such a board, has been able to borrow on world markets at the modest rate of 8 percent this week.
Under a currency board, the supply of reais in circulation would have to be fully backed by dollars and convertible, on demand, at a fixed rate of exchange. In effect, Brazil would be handing over control of its money supply -- which would fluctuate with the amount of dollars available -- to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Currency boards have long been considered an appropriate strategy for small economies that rely heavily on international trade. They do not eliminate the need to solve the fiscal imbalance, but simply take away the option of printing more money to finance shortfalls -- yet another hard choice for Brazil.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court to Hear Broadcasters' Suit Challenging Federal Ban on Casino Advertisements

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the Federal Government could continue to ban broadcast advertising by gambling casinos. The case raises an important issue of commercial speech with implications for government regulations on advertising for other lawful but disfavored activities like smoking.
Since 1934, Federal law and Federal Communications Commission regulations have prohibited broadcasters from carrying advertising for gambling. The ban has been whittled down by a series of legislative exceptions: in 1975, Congress permitted some broadcast advertising of state-run lotteries, followed by other exceptions for casinos run by Indian tribes and for games of chance sponsored by non-profit groups for charitable purposes. 
 But the ban on advertising by traditional, non-Indian casinos, now legal in 22 states, has remained on the books. The case the Court accepted today was an appeal by an organization of radio and television broadcasters in the New Orleans area, which want the right to sell advertising time to casinos in Louisiana and Mississippi. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, upheld the ban in a 2-to-1 decision in July.
The appeals court, after noting that recent Supreme Court precedents on commercial speech were confusing and inconsistent, said that the ban permissibly reflected the view of Congress that casino gambling was to be discouraged.
The law "simply targets the powerful sensory appeal of gambling conveyed by television and radio, which are also the most intrusive advertising media, and the most readily available to children," Judge Edith H. Jones wrote in the majority opinion.
The Clinton Administration has been defending the ban in Federal courts around the country, with mixed success. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which covers California, Nevada and seven other Western states, struck it down in a 1997 decision that the Justices refused to review. Also in 1997, a Federal District Court in New Jersey declared the law unconstitutional in a suit brought by the National Association of Broadcasters, several casino companies and others. That case is on appeal.
The Administration had asked the Supreme Court to take the New Jersey case, rather than the New Orleans appeal, even though the New Jersey case has not yet been ruled on by an appellate court. The New Jersey case, U.S. v. Players International, No. 98-721, contained a stronger evidentiary record on the social and economic ills associated with casino gambling, Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman told the Justices in his unusual request for an accelerated review, which the Court turned down earlier this week.
In their appeal in the New Orleans case, Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association v. U.S., No. 98-387, the broadcasters told the Court that the growing split in judicial opinion around the country was intolerable. "There is only one First Amendment," they said. "It is based on principles, not on geography, and it applies to everyone."
The brief continued: "Chief among the principles that underlie the First Amendment is a conviction that the government of a free people cannot suppress ideas or information solely on the basis of a paternalistic belief that they concern matters the government deems undesirable."
The broadcasters' argument relies heavily on a 1996 Supreme Court decision that struck down a Rhode Island law prohibiting the inclusion of prices in advertisements for liquor. The state defended the law on the ground that price advertising encouraged competitive discounting and had the unfortunate effect of increasing liquor consumption, a rationale the Court rejected as constitutionally inadequate.
Although all nine Justices agreed with the result in that case, 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, there was no majority opinion for the Court. The outcome demonstrated that the Court's commercial-speech doctrine is very much in flux, with the Justices disagreeing over where to place advertising and other commercial speech in the spectrum of First Amendment values.
In any event, the Government would seem to have an uphill battle in justifying the casino prohibition, especially in light of the many exceptions that have left the airwaves saturated with lottery and other gambling advertising.
The area of commercial speech is being monitored closely as part of the ongoing debate over Government regulation of smoking, with several cases in the pipeline.
Last month, a Federal District Judge in Manhattan, Deborah A. Batts, struck down a New York City law that would have sharply limited cigarette advertising in stores and banned it from doors, awnings, and windows. The decision was based not on the First Amendment but on the ground that Federal law preempted the local regulation.

HEADLINE: ABC Ends Lockout Of 2,200 Workers As Latest Offer Is Put Up for a Vote

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
ABC ended its 74-day lockout of 2,200 behind-the-scenes workers in five cities yesterday as the workers' union agreed to send the network's latest contract offer to its members for a vote, even though many of them were dissatisfied with it.
Members of the union, the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, will return to work at ABC television and radio stations in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington by tomorrow. 
 The contract offer would provide two raises of 3.5 percent and two of 3 percent over four years, and allow the company to increase the number of temporary workers hired, now 14 percent of the union work force, to 26 percent this year and 45 percent by 2002. The workers include camera operators, engineers, editors, graphic artists and news writers.
On the picket line outside ABC headquarters on the Upper West Side of Manhattan this week, workers were encouraged by news of the approaching end of the lockout, but still wary of the details.
"I wanted to go back the first day; I want to work," said William Bores, a videotape editor for "Monday Night Football." "But I'm not going for a contract that will, in effect, phase me out after a few years."
The lockout began after the union, whose members had been working without a contract since March 1997, staged a one-day strike on Nov. 2. As part of the agreement ending the lockout, the union is promising not to stage any job actions until the completion of the contract vote, which is expected by Feb. 7. If the workers reject the contract, the situation will return to where it was last fall: the union members can either work without a contract or stage another strike.
Robert A. Iger, the president of ABC, described the end of the lockout as a "very welcome development," but he noted that the labor dispute was still to be resolved.
"While the return of our employees brings one difficult period to a close, there is much that still needs to be accomplished," Mr. Iger said in a statement released yesterday. He added that ABC executives were "hopeful that our final contract proposal will be ratified promptly by all of the various bargaining units so that we can get on with the business of keeping ABC a strong, competitive force in the broadcast industry."
Jim Joyce, a spokesman for the union, said that returning to work was a victory, even if the contract did not represent many concessions by the company.
"People not having the pressure of not receiving a paycheck and not receiving their medical benefits, having that lifted certainly is a better position," he said. "People being able to vote on the inside, they don't have that economic threat hanging over their heads."
Morton Bahr, president of broadcast union's parent union, the Communication Workers of America, described the 11-week standoff as "a valiant battle against a stubborn employer who was determined to break their spirit." He recommended ratification of the contract.
Union officials said ABC was eager to end the lockout because a boycott of the network by prominent Democrats was hurting the network's coverage of the impeachment trial of President Clinton, and because next week new celebrity anchors will make their debuts on "Good Morning America." The company, on the other hand, maintains that it was ready to take the workers back as soon as the union agreed to provide warnings of future strikes.
In the last few days, the United States Secretary of Labor, Alexis M. Herman, has been involved in the negotiations, meeting with both Mr. Bahr and Mr. Iger.
"I was pleased to work with these two leaders, who never lost sight of their common goal: the health of the company and the security of ABC's workers," Ms. Herman said in a statement. "The rapidly changing global economy and technological advances offer real challenges to this country, and I believe it is important for both corporate and union leaders to work together as we define the workplace of the future."
On the picket line in Manhattan as the lockout officially ended at 5 P.M. yesterday, one technician was sweeping the curb of debris, removing barricades, and taking down two American flags that had flown from trees during the round-the-clock demonstrations.
"It was worth it," said the man, who spoke on the condition he not be named. "You've got to stand up for what you believe in, for what you think is right. We stood up against a multibillion-dollar corporation. It wasn't easy to do."

HEADLINE: Mayor's Stadium Plan Is Grandly Vague, Experts Say

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
When it comes to sports, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has big dreams.
But experts on sports financing said yesterday that the Mayor's latest and grandest vision, for a domed football stadium and new Madison Square Garden on the West Side of Manhattan, is so far only that -- a dream. 
 The idea, offered by the Mayor in his State of the City address on Thursday, seemed more like a wish list than a fully formed plan, the experts said.
The biggest problem, they said, was the lack of details about financing and about how the burden would be shared by the city, state and private sector.
"What can you say but that it's very ambitious?" said Mike Kelly, a partner in Coudert Brothers, a New York-based law firm involved in financing arenas and stadiums. "But you have to wonder if there was any financial analysis behind this, or just the generalized thought that it looked neat and appealing."
John Moag, former chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority, which publicly financed side-by-side baseball and football stadiums in Baltimore for $550 million, said, "I don't know how the economics will work, but the private contribution for this will have to be huge."
The sketchiness of Mr. Giuliani's plan also dampened the enthusiasm of aides to Gov. George E. Pataki. The Governor's communications director, Zenia Mucha, said, "We really can't say anything about it at this point because we really don't have any details about it."
Although some of Mr. Giuliani's aides have been working on sports options for the West Side for months, he offered only the bare bones of his vision, and seemed unconcerned that some people had difficulty responding to his plan because of the lack of details.
"Good," he said. "Somebody had to propose it."
The scope of Mr. Giuliani's idea -- which also seemed to represent a tacit admission that the Yankees should stay in the Bronx, not move to the West Side -- puts him more than ever in the thick of a nationwide debate over the appropriateness of using public money to build stadiums and arenas for privately owned teams.
Mr. Giuliani's concept "is one that should be initiated by the private sector with the majority of money coming from the private sector," said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College. "This isn't a brilliant idea for public development. There is no crying public need for this."
The Mayor's latest proposal is even more ambitious than his suggestion last year that the Yankees move to a new, $1 billion ball park above the Long Island Rail Road storage yards, land bounded by 11th and 12th Avenues and 31st and 33d Streets and owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Now, he wants a retractable-dome football stadium to be built on the site, to serve in part as a much-needed expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which is too small for giant conventions that now bypass New York. He also proposed extending the No. 7 subway line from Times Square and extending Metro North and L.I.R.R. lines to serve the site.
Mr. Giuliani suggested that the stadium serve as a new home for the New York Jets, who have a lease to play at Giants Stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands through 2008. The Mayor said the stadium could also handle national political conventions, the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball tournament, college bowl and Army-Navy football games or a Super Bowl, which is usually played in warm climates.
In fact, Mr. Giuliani and his advisers insist that the stadium concept is feasible even without attracting the Jets back to New York. "The viability without a team is very good," said Deputy Mayor Randy Levine. "Football is only 10 dates a year. This is a need. New York City has a vacuum. We lose enormous business."
One critical question is whether Cablevision Systems, which owns Madison Square Garden, wants to move to a new arena further west.
The existing Garden, its exposition hall and adjacent theater handled about 450 events last year, including Knicks and Rangers home games, and has sharply increased its cash flow in recent years.
"Why do they need a new arena?" said Mark Rosentraub, director of the Center for Urban Policy and the Environment at Indiana University. "It's already the busiest arena in the country."
The Mayor said a new Madison Square Garden and football stadium could be financed partly by Cablevision selling its property, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues and 31st and 33d Streets, for hotel and office towers.
The tax revenue from the development that would replace the Garden, which now pays no property taxes, would help the city pay for the sports complex, Mr. Giuliani said.
Mr. Giuliani also suggested using revenue from the commercial rent tax, a financing instrument that he first proposed using last year for new ball parks for the Yankees and the Mets. The tax, which is now scheduled to be phased out, is paid only by large Manhattan businesses below 96th Street.
In 1986, Gulf and Western, then the owners of the Garden, proposed moving to the rail yard site, but the plan was eventually scuttled in favor of a $200 million renovation of the 30-year-old arena that was completed in late 1991.
Presumably, a new Garden on the West Side could generate more money with additional luxury suites and club seats.
Four senior Cablevision executives met with the Mayor several days before his State of the City speech, and James Dolan, the company's president, expressed interest in the West Side plan afterward.
If a new Garden were privately financed, it would join others, like the MCI Center in Washington, the Fleet Center in Boston, and the Staples Center, which is being built in Los Angeles, in not requiring taxpayer subsidies.

HEADLINE: THE TRIAL OF THE PRESIDENT: THE OVERVIEW -- IN THE CHAMBER;
Senate Told It's Clinton 'Who Is Not Telling the Truth'

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
The Republican prosecutors asserted today that Monica S. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony was far more credible than President Clinton's, and one of them told senators sitting in judgment in the impeachment trial that "it's the President who is not telling the truth."
"If you believe the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, you cannot believe the President or accept the argument of his lawyers," said Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, opening the second of three days of arguments by House managers. The Senate must decide which to believe, he said, adding, "If you have any significant doubt about Monica Lewinsky's credibility or testimony, you should have us bring her in here and let us examine her face to face." 
 As it had on Thursday, the question of calling witnesses, with most Republicans in favor and most Democrats opposed, wound its way through the day's proceedings like a Wagnerian leitmotif. The issue will not be decided until the week after next, but several Republican senators who said they had doubted the wisdom of witnesses said they were changing their minds.
Mr. McCollum, the main Republican speaker today, delved into sexually explicit material to support his contentions, something no one had done previously during the trial. He cited sworn testimony by Mr. Clinton to the effect that he had never kissed or fondled her breasts or touched her genitalia, and sworn testimony by Ms. Lewinsky that he had done so repeatedly, as well as corroboration by friends who said she told them at the time. Excerpts, pages A12-14.
Referring to Ms. Lewinsky, the lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and others, Mr. McCollum said, "Time and again, the President says one thing and they say something entirely different."
The Florida lawmaker's approach dramatized one of the dilemmas that Republicans face. Some of their strongest evidence in support of the perjury article involves precisely the sort of material that caused much of the public to sour on the presentation of the special prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr, and the proceedings of the House Judiciary Committee.
Without going into it, and not questioning witnesses whose testimony conflicts, their case is weakened; going into it with live witnesses runs the risk of alienating voters further with a spectacle reminiscent of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings.
Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, who filed the first impeachment resolution over campaign financing in the House in November 1997, concluded for the Republicans with typically vivid language that produced a chilling moment of television. As he urged the Senate to "strike down these insidious cancers that eat at the heart of our system of government," CNN showed Mr. Clinton, returning from a trip to New York, stepping from his helicopter and calling to his dog, Buddy.
Mr. Barr also prompted the first brief clash of the trial. Several times, he referred to the senators as "jurors," which prompted Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, to rise to his feet and insist that the Senate was sitting as a court, not as a jury. Until then, the senators had sat mute, except for the majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, who had spoken exclusively about housekeeping details. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, issuing his first ruling from the chair, said that Mr. Harkin's "objection is well-taken."
The seemingly petty intervention had a large political point, Democratic senators said. Mr. Harkin, who has backed Mr. Clinton as fiercely as Mr. Barr has attacked him, told colleagues he was worried that the word "jurors" would lead the public to conclude that the Senate's job was merely to find Mr. Clinton guilty or not guilty, whereas in his view they also needed to decide whether the President's crimes, if any, constituted impeachable offenses, and whether removing Mr. Clinton from office would serve the national interest.
Mr. McCollum, a mild-looking man who wears aviator glasses, is known in the House as a detail man of unflagging persistence. Those qualities were on display today as he extensively examined Ms. Lewinsky's Aug. 6, 1998, grand jury testimony, now one of the most familiar items in the case. It was then that she said, as the White House never tires of pointing out, "No one asked or encouraged me to lie."
She was testifying about a late-night telephone conversation with Mr. Clinton on Dec. 17, 1997. Mr. McCollum made two points: One, that the entire sentence at issue was, "No one asked or encouraged me to lie, but no one discouraged me, either." Two, that Ms. Lewinsky later said, "I knew what he meant." Pressed, she added that she knew that as "we had on every other occasion and every other instance of this relationship, we would deny it."
Mr. McCollum then asked: "Can there be any doubt that the President was suggesting that she file an affidavit that contains lies and falsehoods?"
Much of what the Republicans presented ended with rhetorical questions like that. Much else involved phrases like "not plausible," "not reasonable," "logical common sense says no," "you may infer," and so on. Mr. Barr, a former C.I.A. analyst and former prosecutor, was at pains to insist, perhaps because of this, that circumstantial evidence was not to be denigrated, no matter what commentators or the President's lawyers might say.
"It is a principle of long and consistent standing in every Federal court in our land, and I suspect in every state court in our land," he said, "that circumstantial evidence is not to be, and shall not be, afforded any less weight than direct evidence."
That question of the weight of the evidence also preoccupied Mr. McCollum.
Conceding that not all the many details of the case meshed, he admonished the Senators: "Never lose sight of the totality of this scheme to lie and obstruct justice. Never lose sight of the big picture. Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees."
Viewed as a whole, he insisted, "the weight of the evidence in this case is very great; it's huge."
To none of this was there any direct White House rebuttal. That will begin next Tuesday, the very day when Mr. Clinton, in another of the bizarre juxtapositions which have abounded in this case, goes up to Capitol Hill to deliver the seventh State of the Union Message of his Administration.
The Republican presentation today was not well-organized, with speakers crossing each other's paths again and again. It sometimes seemed that they had not read or heard one another's statements. Representative Christopher B. Cannon of Utah, to cite just one example, used the same quotation from Theodore Roosevelt in his opening that Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin had cited in his first words on Thursday.
Mr. Barr heard criticism of this "floating around in the ether out there," he said, and entered a defense of "not endless, not pointless but appropriate repetition" as a legitimate and effective tool of prosecutors.
In his own argument, Mr. Barr devoted considerable time to the events of Jan. 18, 1998, a Sunday, when Mr. Clinton talked with his secretary, Betty Currie. He had testified the day before. He asked her a series of questions -- in the form of "false and misleading accounts of events," Mr. Barr said -- and asked her to agree. In one question, Mr. Clinton asked Ms. Currie to agree that he had never been alone with Ms. Lewinsky in or near the Oval Office.
Asked why he did so, Mr. Clinton said he was "trying to get the facts down." But Mr. Barr contended that he was coaching her to support his testimony, which he knew to be false.Often in white-collar obstruction-of-justice cases, Mr. Barr continued, no one suggested to anyone that they lie. He cited a 1953 case in the Fifth Circuit Court in which Michael H. O'Keefe, a New Orleans real estate man, was convicted of obstruction for having tried to persuade a colleague to testify falsely by falsely describing a transaction.
Mr. O'Keefe never asked anyone to lie, Mr. Barr said. "He didn't have to. He was too smart for that."
In the case of Mr. Clinton, Mr. Barr declared, "when one considers that he had already testified, it was obviously too late to try to recollect what the facts were." Mr. Barr added, "in any event, Mrs. Currie could not have told him what the true facts were because he alone knew what they were."
Three prosecutors, or "managers," to use the formal term, gave little seminars on the law. One of them, Representative Steve Chabot of Ohio, who explained what constituted perjury, said one key element was whether a person lied knowingly or through accident or ignorance.
Mr. Clinton could not claim to have spoken out of ignorance in testifying to the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter because "the President's own lawyer has acknowledged the care, the intention, the will of the President to say exactly what he said." He was alluding to a statement by Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House counsel, and he showed it on the special television screen set up in the Senate.
But Mr. Ruff was clearly speaking about Mr. Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones civil case, not his grand jury testimony, which is a subject of the impeachment article alleging perjury. The House of Representatives rejected a separate impeachment article involved perjury in the civil case.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Jackson Challenges 'Capital of Capital'

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson's push to get minority-owned companies a bigger slice of America's economic pie has shown early results. But to judge by the reaction of the hundreds of mostly black executives who attended his second annual Wall Street Project conference in lower Manhattan the last two days, a main attraction is still Mr. Jackson himself.
In seminars above the snow clouds at the top of the World Trade Center, on the podium above the neon tickers of the New York Stock Exchange, introducing President Clinton or hobnobbing with Wall Street tycoons at a black-tie soiree, Mr. Jackson teased, inspired and generally enthralled the crowd. His rolling-thunder speaking style, his witty asides, sprawling metaphors and full-flower alliteration had this button-down collection of businessmen and businesswoman laughing, clapping, chanting approval and spewing scorn. 
 Mr. Jackson said his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition had come to Wall Street -- what he calls "the capital of capital" -- to find new ways for blacks, Hispanic-Americans and other members of minorities to make money. And money was the constant refrain. "We have invited President Clinton to this place to talk about money, not about Monica," Mr. Jackson told one gathering. Government and business must learn to invest in minority areas, he said. "Money does grow on trees if it's planted in the money mud," he added.
He encouraged supporters to embrace corporate America -- sometimes with a bear hug. "Sharecroppers are becoming shareholders," he said. "We have taken our battle from the picket line to the board room."
By Mr. Jackson's estimate, 68 percent of Fortune 500 companies have no minorities on their boards, and he promises new scrutiny. He announced that the Wall Street Project had bought stock in more than 100 American multinationals, and he planned to use that status to urge companies to increase the jobs and contracts won by minorities.
"We will now ask, he said, "who is on our board of directors? Who are our top 100 employees. What are our community reinvestment commitments? Who are our vendors. Our attorneys. Our accountants?"
Mr. Jackson regaled one seminar with an anecdote of his visit to the Boeing Company in Seattle, where he spent time with Philip M. Condit, the chief executive. Boeing is facing a discrimination suit by black employees who complain that opportunities are limited there. Mr. Condit introduced him to some employees who are members of minorities, including a pilot. But Mr. Jackson said he was more interested in the statistic that every Boeing 747 has four million parts.
"At this stage of our struggle, we need to measure progress not just by pilots and flight attendants but also by contracts to supply rivets, pistons, carpets and, yes, peanuts," Mr. Jackson said. "By legal firms retained and advertising agencies hired." His name for this strategy: Revenue Return Relative. For the nearly $600 billion that blacks spend in America each year, he explained, they should get a corresponding share of the service and manufacturing contracts companies award.
 
Building Closer Encounters
Sipping a cocktail on the floor of the stock exchange, Kevin E. Davis, president of the New York-based investment banking firm May Davis Group, is having a friendly chat with a stranger. The stranger does not offer his name, but says he works for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the Wall Street bank.
Mr. Davis, who is black, quickly shifts to salesman mode. How many black-owned fund management firms does Morgan Stanley use? Has he heard of May Davis's convertible equity product? The Morgan Stanley executive, who is white, demurs, fails to find a business card in his bulging wallet, and politely escapes.
"I find it hard to believe that he doesn't have a card," Mr. Davis scoffs after the encounter. He warned that Wall Street firms could not ignore investment services provided by blacks and other minorities for long. Governments and companies that have funds to invest, he said, want to see more diversity among their fund managers.
"He will lose business unless he opens up the process," Mr. Davis said.
That was one of a thousand encounters at the conference, where Mr. Jackson pushed executives to get to know one another in designated "networking sessions." But while there were businessmen of all races taking advantage of the opportunity, many also ruminated on the obstacles that remain for black-owned companies that are trying to get contracts from the Fortune 500.
"Rev. Jackson can bring people to the table, but then you have to sell yourself," said Bennie L. Hadnott, managing partner of Watson Rice L.L.P., a New York accounting firm. "It is all about developing personal contacts, not just opening the door." Watson is one of a few large black-owned accounting firms in the United States, and it has some marquee clients, Mr. Hadnott said. But winning new business is a struggle.
"When you are working with people's gold, it's an exclusive club," he said. "I call it the green ceiling."
Likewise, Julius Alston Jr. of Alston Insurance Services of New Jersey said big business had grown accustomed to buying some parts made by black-owned companies, but not using services they provide.
"The water gets muddy in services," he said. "People only think of goods. The architects, the engineers get locked out." He added, "This is not about widgets anymore."
 
A Year of Progress
The Wall Street Project had a shaky start last year, some attendees say. The turnout was good, but the message was muddled and the results were few. This year, the message was clear, the turnout was impressive despite dismal weather, and Mr. Jackson's press people were busy tallying a laundry list of corporate and government programs that help minorities.
Among the results: President Clinton said he would ask Congress to set aside $1 billion over five years to provide enticement for private investment in economically distressed urban and rural areas. But Mr. Jackson said he was proud of efforts by big corporations to delegate for minority-owned companies a portion of the services that they contract out to minority-owned companies.

HEADLINE: THE TRIAL OF THE PRESIDENT: THE FRIENDS;
At a Conference on Wall Street Diversity, the President Finds His Own Stock Soaring

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

 BODY:
While under attack again by House prosecutors in Washington, President Clinton was doused with praise yesterday for the economy's strength, likened to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and generally celebrated at a Wall Street conference bringing together minority and white business leaders.
"You done good, William Jefferson Clinton," said Susan Taylor, the editor of Essence magazine, who advised him to "be gentle with yourself" because "only God is perfect." 
 Richard Grasso, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, told Mr. Clinton that Dr. King was surely smiling down on the gathering.
"He's recognizing what you've done for this country," said Mr. Grasso, who described how the Clinton Presidency had benefited "my little corner of southern Manhattan."
And the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who organized the conference to promote diversity on Wall Street, told the President that the only people with "clean uniforms" were those whose coaches lacked confidence that they could play the game.
"Those who play have stains on their uniforms," Mr. Jackson said as the crowd, gathered at Windows on the World, at the top of the World Trade Center, responded with cheers and applause.
White House aides said they had learned only at the last minute that Mr. Jackson had arranged for the series of eight testimonials, delivered before Mr. Clinton spoke. The President sat solemnly, his face growing red, as speaker after speaker saluted his achievements in a session that combined the whooping of a revival with the statistics-spouting of a shareholders meeting.
When he finally stepped to the lectern, Mr. Clinton observed that such nice compliments were usually paid at funerals. Breaking into a grin, he jabbed a hand in front of him and added, "And I don't think we're there yet!" The crowd rose in a clamorous ovation.
For Mr. Clinton, it was another day of the brutal juxtapositions that have come to define his Presidency. As the House prosecutors declared that he had corroded his office, he spoke, in speeches in New York and Washington, of his hopes for renewing faith in government.
In a wide-ranging, ruminative address yesterday morning, the President spoke to a conference at the State Department on making government more efficient, saying that "this is about, in my judgment, the preservation of the vitality of democracy."
"To the extent that people do not believe their representatives will handle their money for public purposes the way they themselves would," he said, "democracy is itself diminished."
Then, in his half-hour speech in Manhattan, he argued that now was the time to act to "build a bridge between Wall Street and our greatest untapped markets": low-income areas in the cities and the countryside.
"If we can't do it now, when in the wide world will we ever get around to it?" he said. "If there was ever a time when none of us have an excuse, this is that time. But the world changes very fast, and we have to seize the moment."
To that end, Mr. Clinton proposed a Federal initiative intended to stimulate $15 billion of new private investment in poor areas over several years. One element of the proposal is $1 billion in tax credits spread over five years. Another would provide $608 million in Federal spending, mostly for guaranteed loans to increase such investment.
Mr. Clinton, who flew up to New York yesterday morning after icy weather had postponed a flight scheduled for Thursday, returned to Washington after the conference for a fund-raiser last night on behalf of the Democratic National Committee.
For the White House, the day was another opportunity to demonstrate that neither sleet nor snow nor prosecution in the Senate would stay Mr. Clinton from his duties. Such strategy aside, the President was plainly enjoying himself. He clearly relished the praise as well as the opportunities to talk before appreciative audiences about the sorts of issues -- government reform and economic development -- that have been hallmarks of his quarter-century political career.
Yet the Senate trial was never far from sight. One participant in the Wall Street conference was Lanny J. Davis, former White House strategist and spokesman, who now is a lawyer in private practice -- his name tag identified him as a representative of Motel 6, a client -- but informally advises the President.
Moments before Mr. Clinton arrived, Mr. Davis, illuminated by a television light, stood at the back of the jammed, low-ceilinged hall and, to an interviewer's question about the House prosecution, said: "Been there, done that. There's nothing new in this whole thing."
Several members of Congress, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, also attended the conference. Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, was seated before the lectern as Mr. Clinton spoke. When the President said, "I always liked him," Mr. Kemp shot back, "I like you too, Mr. President."
The President's predicament was much on the minds of those in the room. An appreciative murmur rippled through, for example, when Ms. Taylor, the Essence editor, told him that because of his "bravery" in hiring women and members of minority groups, "some hardened hearts are bent on punishing you."
"We black women," she continued, "we just want to say thank you, thank you for including us, and not demonizing our men."
Dr. Emma Chappell, president of the United Bank of Philadelphia, said Mr. Clinton shared with Dr. King, who would have turned 70 yesterday, a love of justice and civil rights.
"Tragically," she said, "one was assassinated and one is now persecuted."
C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of the AT&T Corporation, did not refer to the President's travails, but nor was he stinting in praise of Mr. Clinton's stewardship of an economic boom.
"You had the courage to get it started," Mr. Armstrong said, adding that everyone was then able to take the greatest "economic ride in the history of the country."
Mr. Jackson also compared the President to Dr. King.
"What you are about as a public policy leader represents the fulfillment of his dream," said Mr. Jackson, who then likened Mr. Clinton to Babe Ruth, noting that Ruth was remembered for his home runs rather than his strikeouts.
"At the end of the day, what is your box score?" Mr. Jackson said. "That's how God judges us."

HEADLINE: Global Warming: Not a Fantasy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Jack Kemp and Fred L. Smith Jr. (Op-Ed, Jan. 13) use familiar bugaboos -- "unelected global authorities" and "immense harm" to the American economy -- to make their argument against the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. 
 There's no need for concern about "unelected global authorities." The emission-credit plan is a United States initiative, separate from, although similar to a provision of, the Kyoto treaty. Because it is an American law, there would be no role for "unelected global authorities." Moreover, while the Kyoto plan may hurt certain sectors of the American economy in the short term, the plan opens up new opportunities for green industry. While jobs are lost in one area, like petrochemicals, won't others open up in alternative-energy production and anti-emission technology?
There are many industries that have fallen prey to the march of time, but there are always new ones to take their place.

To the Editor:
Jack Kemp and Fred L. Smith Jr. (Op-Ed, Jan. 13) argue that the Kyoto treaty would mean "ceding power to unelected global authorities." In fact, the Kyoto treaty is an attempt to bring the political process to bear on a group of powerful, unelected global authorities: the fossil fuel and automotive industries. 
 Mr. Kemp and Mr. Smith breezily dismiss the abundant evidence that indicates a human impact on global climate. However, if the growing scientific consensus is correct, then a small group of unaccountable industries will, through their production of greenhouse gases, exercise a profound negative impact on the economic prospects, health and quality of life globally.

HEADLINE: Mayor Relents On Plan to End Methadone Use

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

 BODY:
Six months after saying he wanted to abolish New York City's methadone treatment programs, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has abandoned his plan to move all 2,100 heroin addicts at city hospitals into abstinence programs, conceding yesterday that his idea was "maybe somewhat unrealistic."
The shift came after a five-month city experiment aimed at moving heroin addicts into abstinence programs at the five public hospitals resulted in few successes, city officials said yesterday. 
 Only 21 of the 2,100 addicts have given up methadone, the synthetic drug widely prescribed to blunt the craving for heroin. Of those, five have relapsed into heroin use, the officials said.
Mr. Giuliani emphasized that he would continue to vigorously promote drug-free programs in the city, adding that he still believes local clinics rely too heavily on methadone. But he said his consultations with drug treatment experts had persuaded him not to eliminate methadone programs, which researchers across the country have described as the best hope for the vast majority of recovering heroin addicts.
"What I had proposed was doing away with it completely except for a very short transitional period," Mr. Giuliani said in an interview yesterday. "That turned out to be too frightening, too jarring and maybe somewhat unrealistic."
Those remarks were quickly applauded by state officials and drug experts who had been stunned by the Mayor's plan and by his attacks on researchers who embraced methadone programs. In August, Mr. Giuliani derided methadone supporters as "a politically correct crowd." And in September, he called Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House's drug policy chief, "a disaster."
But all the while, Mr. Giuliani and his officials were also moderating their policy, acknowledging at press conferences and City Council hearings that abstinence might not work for everyone. And on Thursday, Mr. Giuliani returned to that theme yet again in his State of the City speech, pulling back from his original proposal another degree.
"When I say that I want people off methadone and toward drug freedom, I realize that there's going to be a certain percentage where that can't be done but we've got to reverse the horrible situation we're in right now," Mr. Giuliani said in his speech. "So how about making a deal?" he continued. "Instead of doing away with methadone completely -- maybe this will calm everybody down -- suppose we reverse the percentages.
"Suppose instead of 63 percent of the slots being for keeping people chemically dependent, 63 percent of the slots were for programs that were for drug freedom," he said. "And we'll reserve 10, 15, 20, whatever we have to for methadone for those people who need to have a transition and for those people where drug-free programs just can't work."
Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees the city hospitals that had changed their treatment on the Mayor's orders, said the shift reflects a clearer understanding of the patients who struggle to battle addiction.
While he had originally estimated that most addicts could move from methadone to abstinence in three months, Dr. Marcos now says he would be pleased if 40 percent or 50 percent could make that transition over the next year or two. And he acknowledged that many drug experts would characterize even that estimate as optimistic.
"Frankly, after looking at the population that we treat in our public hospitals, three months detox was not realistic," Dr. Marcos said in an interview.
State officials say the public hospitals treat only about 6 percent of the 36,000 heroin addicts in methadone treatment programs in New York City; the others receive treatment in clinics financed by the Federal and state governments.
Mr. Giuliani can affect treatment only in the public hospitals, where the average patient has been relying on methadone for nine years. About 30 percent have also abused alcohol and other drugs. Seventy percent are unemployed and many suffer from mental illness and medical problems, Dr. Marcos said.
Under traditional methadone programs, addicts can take the drug indefinitely. Mr. Giuliani has argued that addicts on methadone simply substitute one dependency for another and advocated gradually weaning all addicts from methadone altogether after three months. He and his advisers now acknowledge that is unrealistic, and the hospitals will now instead simply encourage addicts to try abstinence.
Drug experts said yesterday that the Mayor's remarks would probably have little impact on methadone patients in city hospitals because City Hall's approach never had a chance of success. They say that the Mayor is simply acknowledging that reality.
Wendy Gibson, a spokeswoman for the State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, which had opposed Mr. Giuliani's plan to abolish methadone, said her office supported the city's policy shift.
"We're encouraged that the city understands that there are successes in all types of treatment, including methadone," Ms. Gibson said yesterday.
And Don C. Des Jarlais, the director of research for the Chemical Dependency Institute of Beth Israel Medical Center, echoed her sentiments, calling the Mayor's remarks "tremendously encouraging."
"It shows a much more sophisticated understanding of the problem of addiction," said Mr. Des Jarlais, an expert on heroin addiction. "It is important to provide methadone maintenance for those people who really need that treatment. But creating additional treatment options is likely to be beneficial, to the extent that patients can make their own choices about what treatment works for them."
Mr. Giuliani said he made his decision after reaching out to various drug treatment experts, including Joseph A. Califano Jr., the former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare who is now the chairman of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. And when those experts continued to express reservations about eliminating methadone completely, he reassessed his position, he said.
"I met with people, listened to the debate, talked to Joe Califano," Mr. Giuliani said. "I really do listen and read what people say and write. And there are times when I actually agree with them."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE OVERVIEW;
Exchange Controls Lifted; Brazil Stocks Rise by 33%

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 15

 BODY:
The Brazilian Government, reeling under a hemorrhage of dollars from its foreign reserves in a losing battle to defend the nation's currency, lifted exchange-rate controls today and allowed the currency to trade at market value.
The move sent markets soaring in this country and through much of Latin America. Stocks rose, too, in the United States and Europe. 
 The announcement that the Brazilian central bank would allow market forces to determine the value of its currency, the real, came 24 hours after the bank had ruled out such a step -- fearing it would send the currency plunging in value. The shift appeared to signal at least some conflict over economic policy at the top levels of government.
But investors were relieved that Brazil had abandoned -- at least for today -- its policy of spending dollar reserves to defend its currency from selling attacks by speculators betting it would fall in value. The real did fall, but its descent was not as sharp as had been feared.
In Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial center, the benchmark stock index rose 33.4 percent after two days of punishing losses, reflecting the attractiveness of stocks that were viewed as having become bargains because of the currency's reduced value.
The effects from that turnaround were a tonic to other markets, which had been unnerved by the heavy selloffs in Brazil since Wednesday that suggested a return to the global financial turmoil that began in Asia in mid-1997. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points, or 2.41 percent, recovering almost all losses the day before.
But the policy shift in this country raised fundamental questions about Brazil's previous reliance on a stable currency loosely pegged to the dollar to limit inflation in its economy, Latin America's largest. A few years ago, Brazil had been a captive of chronically high inflation and a weak currency.
In a televised speech to the nation late today, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said he had abandoned the defense of the currency only as a last resort. "I could not let reserves keep going out and leave Brazil undefended in order to take precautions afterward," Mr. Cardoso said.
A weak currency does, however, have some redeeming features. It can, for instance, help stimulate exports by making them cheaper abroad. But a weak currency also reduces the purchasing power of consumers, particularly when buying imports, and puts downward pressure on the currencies of neighboring nations.
Brazil's central bank had hoped to keep its currency stable by maintaining high interest rates, which increase the returns on assets denominated in reais, and by using dollars to buy reals when the Brazilian currency weakened. But interest rates were getting so high and it was spending so much money defending the real that on Thursday senior officials of the Clinton Administration and the International Monetary Fund warned Brazil that it could not maintain such a policy.
Tonight, Finance Minister Pedro Malan and the new central bank president, Francisco Lopes, flew to Washington to meet with officials of the I.M.F., which
has been aiding Brazil with a $41.5 billion bailout package from various nations and international agencies.
Earlier in the week, the central bank had widened the currency's artificial trading range, which was seen by financiers as undermining the purposes of the I.M.F. aid package. This in turn unnerved investors who had bet on a stable currency.
In a growing exodus of dollars from Brazil, $1.8 billion was withdrawn from the country on Thursday alone. Brazil's foreign reserves, $75 billion last summer, have dwindled to $31 billion, a main reason officials felt forced to change policy.
Today, an announcement from the bank said, "The central bank of Brazil will not intervene in exchange markets today," and adding that "another communique in this respect will be released Monday." I.M.F. officials in Washington planned to discuss Brazil's future monetary policy with officials there this weekend.
Within minutes of the lifting of exchange controls, the real fell to a rate of 1.60 to the dollar from the previous 1.32, settling by day's end around 1.43 to the dollar. The real closed down 10.4 percent for the day and 18 percent since Wednesday.
But there was little sense that any long-term equilibrium had been found. "I think we still have a messy time for two months or so," said John Welch, chief economist for Latin America at Paribas in New York.
The move also had a healthy effect on short-term interest rates, which reached 71.65 percent on Thursday. They fell in half, to 36.11 percent.
By 7 P.M., just $173 million had left Brazil's foreign reserves, which had lost more than $5 billion in the first nine days of the year. Some analysts suggested that come Monday, the Government would establish a new exchange rate based on the free-market value of the currency established today.
With investors relieved, the stock market, which had faced double-digit losses for days, began climbing. By day's end, the blue-chip issues had recorded their second-highest increase in a single day's trading. Markets rose throughout Latin America. In Germany stocks were up 1.5 percent, and in France 1.4 percent.
Brazil's efforts to protect itself from the turbulence roiling emerging markets has been a preoccupation for Washington and other industrial nations since last summer, when Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on some debts.
Representing more than half South America's population and 40 percent of its economic output, Brazil was considered the most likely candidate for ushering the troubles of emerging markets to the United States' doorstep, by dragging down economies throughout Latin America -- a key trading region.
The Brazilian Government's earlier success in selling investors on Brazil's commitment to ending hyperinflation and modernizing the role of government had encouraged foreign companies to increase their stakes in Brazil through the four previous years of the Cardoso administration.
In 1994, foreign direct investment in Brazil totaled $2 billion. Now, it accounts for more than $36 billion, thanks in part to aggressive privatization of state utility, mining and telecommunications companies.
Brazil is also considered the locomotive of Latin America, which in total buys about 20 percent of United States exports. And the Brazilians owe more than $228 billion in foreign debt, according to its letter of intent laying out the terms of its bailout by the International Monetary Fund this past fall.
The current crisis broke out after the Governor of Minas Gerais, a large and wealthy Brazilian state, announced a moratorium on paying his state's debt last week. That caused a wave of dissent among other state governors and undermined confidence in Brazil's ability to deliver deficit-cutting reforms and ultimately, to pay its debts.
Even before Brazil's reversal of course today, the Government's credibility had been strained because of difficulties in legislating civil service and pension reform.
Brazil had sought to keep its currency relatively stable by permitting it to drop 7.5 percent a year against the dollar. That approach, along with moves to open the economy to imports, had been successful in controlling inflation.
Abandoning the exchange-rate band represents a step into the unknown for the architects of that approach. In the Government's letter of intent to the I.M.F., written in November, it called "continued low inflation" the "priority goal of monetary policy," and added, "The current exchange rate regime is an essential means to this end."
But with the jolts to investor confidence from Asia over the last 18 months, Brazil became subject to attacks on its currency, and paid high interest rates to attract investors who would otherwise shun emerging markets in favor of safer investments offering lower returns. Basic bank rates over 40 percent aggravated Brazil's burgeoning budget deficit, now swollen to $65 billion, more than 8 percent of the gross domestic product.
With consumer interest rates upward of 100 percent, and money for capital investment in short supply, the economy screeched to a halt. Official unemployment jumped to a 15-year high of 8 percent, with little relief in sight, and in the Sao Paulo industrial area, nongovernment analysts estimated the jobless at 19 percent.
Today, business leaders welcomed the devaluation, which they predicted would revive industry by making exports cheaper. At a trade show in Sao Paulo, leather manufacturers said the devaluation would help recovery of Brazil's depressed shoe industry.
Here in Rio, shopkeepers wondered whether inflation would return, and in what form. No one knows whether the reflexes of a culture practiced at dealing with hyperinflation, which ended five years ago, would return. Some stores said that business was already so bad that they could not increase prices without losing the few customers who remained.
Alberto Homsi, 63, the owner of Micro Plant Computers here, had already marked up prices on computer supplies like printer cartridges. "Fear of inflation, I don't have," Mr. Homsi said, "but my back is hurting from bending over to see which items I really do have to raise my prices on."

HEADLINE: THE TRIAL OF THE PRESIDENT: BEYOND THE BELTWAY;
Editor of A.M.A. Journal Is Dismissed Over Sex Paper

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
The American Medical Association dismissed the editor of its leading journal yesterday, saying that he had rushed through a paper on whether college students think oral sex is "having sex" to influence President Clinton's impeachment trial.
Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the executive vice president of the association, said the incident, which led to a firestorm of protest among medical researchers and journal editors, had followed what he called a steady erosion of his faith in the editor, Dr. George D. Lundberg. 
 Although Dr. Anderson would not be specific, others said Dr. Lundberg had nettled many in the medical profession over the years when he published controversial articles.
The paper that proved to be Dr. Lundberg's downfall was by Dr. June Machover Reinisch, the former director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, at Indiana University. In it, Dr. Reinisch reported that in an eight-year-old survey of 599 students at an unnamed university in the Midwest, 59 percent said oral sex did not constitute "having sex." The article, will appear in Wednesday's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Dr. Anderson, said in a statement that he had dismissed Dr. Lundberg because by publishing Dr. Reinisch's paper now, Dr. Lundberg "has threatened the historic tradition and integrity of the Journal of the American Medical Association by inappropriately and inexcusably interjecting JAMA into a major political debate that has nothing to do with science or medicine."
At a news conference, Dr. Anderson said "there was an acceleration of the timing" in the publication of the paper. He added, "I don't question the material in there, but I do very clearly question the judgment in publishing that article in the middle of the Congressional proceedings."
"I happen to believe that Dr. Lundberg was focused on sensationalism here, not science," he said. "It grieves me greatly that that magnificent journal that should be about science and medicine has been used to extract political leverage."
In his statement, Dr. Anderson also said, "Over time, however, I have lost confidence and trust in Dr. Lundberg's ability to preserve that high level of trust and credibility."
Dr. Lundberg, reached at home, said he could not comment other than to say that Dr. Anderson called him at 8:15 yesterday morning and told him he was no longer editor of the journal. "My attorney has me under wraps," he said.
Dr. Anderson said that it was his decision to dismiss Dr. Lundberg and that he made it despite an outcry from his own editorial board. A member of that board, Dr. Jack D. Barchas of Cornell University Medical College, said he and others called Dr. Anderson to try to stop him from dismissing Dr. Lundberg.
"We were begging him to reconsider," Dr. Barchas said.
"Many of us feel anger, outrage, and a sense of betrayal by the decision," Dr. Barchas said. Dr. Lundberg, he added, "has been fearless in publishing papers, even controversial papers, based on the best tradition of science and the best tradition of peer review."
The journal, in Dr. Lundberg's 17 years as editor, has taken strong positions on subjects like the dangers of tobacco and on violence as a public health threat. It has also published articles that made some medical professional wince -- like a recent series of articles on alternative medicine; a paper claiming, with what some said was weak evidence, that eating fish slashes the risk of sudden death from heart disease, and an essay by an anonymous doctor who told of how he took it upon himself to kill a cancer patient to relieve her suffering.
The paper by Dr. Reinisch is different from other controversial articles, however, because it is not even a new study. The paper made it clear that the survey's main conclusions had been published; the oral sex part was, apparently, leftover data.
Dr. Reinisch did not return calls to the Kinsey Institute seeking comment, but she told The Washington Times on Thursday that she had decided it would be irresponsible not to publish her data on oral sex. So she sent a paper to the Journal of the American Medical Association in September.
It was accepted in December, after revision. The paper went through normal peer review, Dr. Anderson said yesterday. He said neither he nor anyone else at the association had "any veto power over articles published in the journal."
"That is editorial independence," he said, "and it will continue."
l It typically takes six weeks to six months from the time an article is submitted until the time it is published, according to a staff member at the American Medical Association. The ones published in weeks usually are not revised.
Of course, the paper has a certain news value now that it would not have had if it was published before or after the Clinton sex scandal, medical experts said. But the question remains: Why did Dr. Lundberg decide to publish it now?
Dr. Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton University who is a member of the editorial board at the Journal of the American Medical Association, said he could think of two reasons. Both are tied into the impeachment hearings.
"One is that he has a genuine belief that this is the most important political decision in this century and every bit of evidence on it should be published," Dr. Reinhardt said. The other, he said, is that the subject is suddenly of news value. And the journal, like others, he added, "loves being noticed in the media."
Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, which is the chief competitor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, said her journal would never have published the sex survey paper because "it is trivial -- who cares what a bunch of college students say," about whether oral sex is sex, she said.
"It also is irrelevant to the Clinton case," Dr. Angell said. "He wasn't asked the question in that context."
But, she said, the decision to publish the paper "is not a reason to fire an editor who's been there 17 years and by almost anyone's estimation has put a small society that no one took seriously on the map."
But Dr. Anderson said his office had been deluged by callers expressing support. One was Robert W. Seligson, who is the executive vice president and chief executive of the North Carolina Medical Society. Dr. Anderson, he said in a telephone interview, "was careful and decisive in doing the right thing."
Dr. Harry L. Greene 2d, executive vice president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, also supported Dr. Anderson, saying it was a publisher's role "to take action" if he felt the journal's integrity was threatened.

HEADLINE: Where Oil Is Plentiful But Cash Is Short

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: KUWAIT

 BODY:
Oil, for so long the source of so much easy wealth, is now fueling hard questions along the Persian Gulf.
It is not just that its price, in real terms, has plummeted to levels not seen since the mid-1970's. Nor is the concern limited to the fact that the Saudis and other producers, so adept at muscle-flexing in the past, have failed dismally to push prices higher. 
 What lies behind the bleak numbers is a gnawing sense of vulnerability. For a quarter century, oil has allowed the gulf states a self-sufficiency and political leverage far in excess of what comparably sized countries could hope to achieve, and has formed a dependable pillar of legitimacy for the region's six monarchies.
But now, after years of declining oil prices, the monarchies -- which depend on oil for three-quarters of their incomes -- have watched revenues plunge by 30 percent in a year, a loss of $25 billion. And there is no rebound in sight.
Suddenly the arithmetic of big budgets and big spending no longer adds up, and the situation looks so gloomy that Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia warned starkly in December, "The boom days are over, and they will not come back."
The reversal has led even politicians to recommend adjustments -- belt-tightening, borrowing or inviting foreigners to help -- steps that would end the old ways of showering citizens with beneficence while keeping outsiders at arm's length.
In countries already prone to domestic discontent, and with fast growing populations of young people schooled in a sense of entitlement, all those options carry the risks of instability and of accusations that past riches have been squandered.
As Ahmed al-Thani, a 19-year-old Kuwaiti, put it, "With all our oil, why should life be harder for us than it was for our parents?"
Together, the six monarchies control nearly half the known oil reserves, and their exports account for 10 percent of the current supply. Even now, a sense of economic woe is not immediately apparent in places like Kuwait, where the signs of wealth so visibly on display include the brand new Corvettes and BMW's that teen-agers race up and down the seafront corniche.
But the depth of the new strain can be measured on balance sheets.
In each monarchy, emergency measures announced last summer cut government spending, by as much as 20 percent. But nowhere has that been enough to close yawning budget gaps. With a 55-gallon barrel of crude oil selling for about $12, about half of what it was a year ago, the cost to governments of providing the lifetime jobs, low-cost housing and other subsidies has soared well beyond what they can earn.
In Kuwait, with just over two million people, the budget gap is expected to reach $8 billion, more than all the revenues the country will take in from oil. In Saudi Arabia, where the crisis seems to be the worst, the deficit is expected to be $15 billion, and has already forced the national oil company to borrow abroad.
Qatar, Bahrain and Oman have also been pinched, as has the United Arab Emirates, an oil and commercial giant regarded as the most resilient economy in the region.
In trying to stave off a deeper crisis, governments are scrambling to cut spending further. Even Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, is trying to prepare the ground for tougher times ahead.
In an address in December, Prince Abdullah told fellow gulf leaders meeting in Abu Dhabi that their people "must get used to a new way of life that is not based on total dependence on the state."
Other gulf leaders have begun to echo Prince Abdullah. To try to gain control over bloated government payrolls, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have tried to steer citizens toward more demanding and less lucrative private-sector jobs most often performed by foreign workers.
Kuwait has introduced legislation to promote privatization and to ease obstacles to foreign investment. The Saudis and others are also signaling a new willingness to court foreign investors.
But big obstacles stand in the way of change. Few industries apart from energy have demonstrated much potential for profit. And past successes mean that oil is now seen as so central that it could be difficult, if not impossible, for gulf countries to lure investment in other sectors.
In the United States in September, Prince Abdullah even met with chairmen of the biggest oil companies, dangling the prospect of a new role in the Saudi energy industry, which like most across the region was nationalized more than two decades ago. Then, in the heady days of oil embargoes and seemingly limitless cash, the foreign companies that had built the oil fields in the gulf region were driven out.
The reasons for the long decline in oil prices include a supply glut, brought on largely by new finds outside the Middle East. Advances in technology have allowed producers in the North Sea, Central Asia and West Africa to gain an increasing share of the market.
In the last year a number of passing factors, including a drop in Asian demand, have cut into prices further. And the prospect that ostracized Iraq, with the third-largest reserves, may one day resume full production has only added to the headaches.
By and large, however, governments in the gulf have continued to behave as they did when oil was king. Even now in Kuwait, for example, most citizens who work are employed by the Government, and the staggering costs of the salaries and subsidies account for the vast bulk of the Government budget.
For citizens and even foreign workers, health care is free. The price of electricity is a small faction of what it costs to produce. Upon marriage, citizens become eligible for a $230,000 interest-free housing loan.
And in one way or another, despite the talk of privatization, governments remain the dominant force. That means cuts in spending, like those rushed into effect last year, quickly translate into a broad economic slowdown and a crisis of confidence like one in Kuwait, where stock prices have falled 40 percent since July.
"In general, gulf governments have used their oil income as an excuse for inaction," said Henry Azzam, managing director and chief economist of the Middle East Capital Group, an investment bank based in Beirut, Lebanon.
Most private forecasters say oil prices will remain low at least at least through 1999. After the failure of their own efforts to push prices up, that view also seems to have taken hold among gulf governments.
But private economists worry that rather than make hard choices, governments will dither. "What we are telling the Government is that it must act now," said Rabah al-Rabah, a top official of the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce. "Otherwise, if there is delay, there will eventually be no other choice but to cut to the bone."
By any measure, the options for are unpalatable.
The easiest is to draw on foreign reserves. Kuwait, which has not taken that step since the Persian Gulf war in 1991, has already asked Parliament for permission to do so. But such a step risks adding to public uneasiness: the reserves in Kuwait are known as the Fund for Future Generations.
Another is to borrow, a step that Saudi Arabia has said it intends to take. But that could leave gulf countries even more strapped, and if it meant turning to foreign banks, it could require a degree of outside scrutiny with which the monarchies have never been comfortable.
A better course, economists say, would be for governments to seek foreign investment to revitalize their oil industries and to broaden their economic bases.
But despite the overture by Prince Abdullah, most governments still appear resistant to allowing foreign companies to reassert more than a peripheral role. One reason, particularly in Saudi Arabia, is that the Western military presence has ignited domestic criticism.
The best option would be realism -- to cut spending. But that could certainly provoke the kind of outcry that the monarchies do not appear eager to withstand.
"What is necessary will not be easy," said Amir al-Tamimi, president of the Economic Society of Kuwait. "Above all, it has become clear that these governments are going to have to find a way to cope with social pain."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Jan. 16 about the effects of low oil prices on the Persian Gulf region referred incorrectly to a standard unit of measurement. The barrel, used throughout the world to measure crude oil and other oil products, is defined as a volume of 42 gallons. It does not correspond to any actual container, and has no relation to the 55-gallon steel drums that are widely used for shipping liquids.

THE LIFE AND TIMES
OF PANCHO VILLA
By Friedrich Katz.
Illustrated. 985 pp. Stanford, Calif.:
Stanford University Press.
Cloth, $85. Paper, $29.95. 
 Though it raged for 10 shocking years, the Mexican Revolution has never been viewed as particularly central to the century that's about to end -- not like the Russian Revolution, or even the smaller-scale Spanish Civil War. Probably this is because Mexico's conflict blurred what we think of as the usual political divides.
The event that triggered it was straightforward enough: In 1910, President Porfirio Diaz, a quasi dictator who had "modernized" the economy with measures favorable to rich people and foreigners, went back on his pledge not to run for re-election one last time. (He'd already held office for 30 years.) Annoyance at this about-face turned into opposition, popular armies sprang up to fight the federal one and Diaz was forced to step down in 1911. So far so good, but what followed is much harder to describe.
After a brief period of promise, unity among the rebels went out the window. Leader after regional leader was assassinated, and even now, at a distance of many decades, it's hard to judge whether ideology or ambition or blood feuds were to blame. From such chaos -- part volcano, part musical chairs -- it's not surprising that the most celebrated fallen hero of the era should be the man with the simplest revolutionary program, and the clearest-cut record as a martyr. Emiliano Zapata fought on behalf of southern peasants to win back land that Diaz had taken away. His dream of a pastoral, proudly Indian Mexico was immortalized in utopian murals by Diego Rivera. His continuing relevance is obvious today in Chiapas, where a new band of rebels has taken his name.
But where does this leave Pancho Villa, commander of the greatest revolutionary army in the north? Once upon a time, he was the one who got top hero billing, with thrilling exploits that riveted people in the United States as well as in Mexico. If anything, Friedrich Katz's towering new biography, "The Life and Times of Pancho Villa," suggests that while he was alive Villa may have become too big a myth for his own good. To his adherents he was nothing short of a Robin Hood. To his enemies he was at best a mercenary bandit, at worst a bloodthirsty fiend, slicing through crowds with a machete. Katz calls these myths the Epic and the Black, and he finds both to be something of a stretch, but his own attitude toward Villa can hardly be called neutral. He is a historian by profession, and a rather passionate thesis runs beneath this book, to the effect that history has denied Pancho Villa his due.
Villa was a genius -- though his wild destiny was not as obvious in his youth as either myth would have us believe. Little is known about his early years. It's often said that he was driven to become an outlaw when someone raped his sister and honor demanded that he murder the rapist. Katz isn't at all sure that this tale is true; he's not even sure that the young Villa made such a great bandit. When war broke out in 1910, he was just another man corraled to fight the federal forces. Soon enough, though, he rose. Something he did made men want to follow him. Firsthand testimony invariably recalls his eyes, electrified with purpose. It's quite ironic, given the later prevalence of the violent Black myth, that early in his career Villa was famous for keeping impeccable order among his troops and safeguarding private property. Men wanted to fight with him, and villagers wanted his protection, because of all the leaders available he was the most responsible. (Not with women, though -- never with women. Villa coaxed countless lovers into bed by arranging fake marriages, and his courtship of at least one common-law wife was a quick, efficient rape.)
So what changed over the years? Villa reached his heyday in the second phase of the revolution, after the liberal president who replaced Diaz had been murdered in a coup. Loyal to the fallen man's memory, Villa led his huge northern army against the new illegitimate president and, soon enough, against competing factions in the revolution. Katz believes that several times Villa single-handedly saved Mexico from the reactionaries. At the same time, his heavy military responsibilities slowed the pace of political reform.
Compare Villa's task to that faced by Zapata in the south, for example. Zapata's fighters got to stay in their villages and fight in relatively minor local skirmishes. Villa's troops had to travel hundreds of miles and fend off heavy, constant federal attack. This was distracting, and required money. It also pushed Villa to postpone land redistribution, which he genuinely believed in, lest his hard-working troops miss out on the bounty. Add to this mix some meddling by the United States, a series of betrayals by men who had once been or even still claimed to be allies and Villa's utter failure to keep up with new military techniques, which put his troops in jeopardy. In psychological terms, Villa seems to have caved in to the stress. In pop psychological terms, you could say he "went bad."
As his power shrank, he misused it more. His judgment, never very steady, now spun like a roulette wheel. In a desperate (yet it has to be admitted, clever and daring) bid for attention, he reversed his pro-American policy and raided the small town of Columbus, N.M. And he became paranoid and punitive. For the first time in his career he began to kill large numbers of civilians, including women -- brutally, and in cold blood.
This is a very long book, at times repetitive in its obeisance to academic form. It should be noted, too, that Katz is Austrian by birth, and this book clearly is not written by a native English speaker. But the research here obviously represents decades of devotion, and it is formidable. Coming from the Eastern Hemisphere also appears to have given Katz a broader perspective on the revolution, one that is sorely needed. Partly owing to its uniqueness, and partly to neglect by the rest of the world, Mexican history can feel like quite an insular subject. Over and over, Katz strives to place Villa in a global context.
As a revolutionary who was written out of history by victorious rivals, Villa, Katz says, is a little like Trotsky vis-a-vis Stalin. As a guerrilla leader coming down from the mountains he can be compared to Fidel Castro. As the charismatic commander of a large army who grew overconfident in later years, he has something in common with Napoleon. His extreme loyalty toward his troops also calls to mind that tragically common 20th-century figure, the Latin American military dictator. What distinguishes Villa from Trotsky is that beyond thinking that a handful of rich ranchers had too much power, he was never terribly fussy about ideology. What distinguishes him from everyone else on this list is that he came up from peasant stock, he never really took advantage of his position to line his pockets (though corrupt sidekicks did, it's true) and on several occasions when he could have fought his way to the presidency he backed off. Villa didn't want unlimited power. All he wanted was to control his home turf in the north. This is important: Though he stopped short of greatness, he did have a curious sort of integrity.
His limitations must not be understated. Katz quarrels with the Black myth, but even if it's highly exaggerated, little about it is false. A rehabilitation of Villa simply cannot rest on the question of what he might have done if given the unlimited chance -- the question is too scary. But a rehabilitation can rest on questions of memory. At his height, Villa sparked the imagination more than any other revolutionary leader. His pivotal contributions are still celebrated in hundreds of popular ballads, but have been played down in history books.
In 1923, Villa went for a drive and was killed by a sharpshooter. His death was passed off as the inevitable downfall of a rascal with many enemies. In fact Katz convincingly implicates the president at the time, Villa's former military rival, Alvaro Obregon, in the murder, or at the very least in a cover-up. At this point, officially speaking, the revolution was over. Mexico had been reborn as a forward-looking, cooperative family. But even at this late stage, Villa represented some kind of possibility. He was a threatening potential, an open question. Debate over his legacy suggests that he still may be today.

EARTH ODYSSEY
Around the World in Search of
Our Environmental Future.
By Mark Hertsgaard.
372 pp. New York:
Broadway Books. $26. 
 Mark Hertsgaard'S reputation as an astute journalist was made in the 1980's when as a magazine and book writer he explored politics, the press and pop culture. His best-known work, "On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency" (1988), described the way the Reagan White House deployed raw power and conventional wisdom to intimidate Washington's television newsrooms. In the 1990's, his attention turned to the even more formidable: the ecological fate of the earth. Hertsgaard embarked upon a seven-year global tour to investigate the environmental future. The journey spanned four continents, 19 countries and hundreds of interviews. Hertsgaard spoke with Vaclav Havel in Prague, he talked with industrial workers in soot-choked China and retraced Winston Churchill's steps in North Africa.
Hertsgaard's central question in 1991 was "whether the human species would survive the next hundred years." By the time he returned in the late 1990's to write in a cabin amid a majestic grove of California sequoias, he was convinced the answer was yes. But he finds few other reasons to be optimistic: The pace of global population growth, rampant air and water pollution in the developing world and the weakening resolve of the United States to lead the environmental revolution it fostered spell big trouble for the quality of human existence.
This, of course, is hardly a novel message. But Hertsgaard is after something different from the annual compendium of trends in the planet's failing health put out by Lester R. Brown's Worldwatch Institute, or the eloquent assessment, in Bill McKibben's "End of Nature," of the risks to the environment and the economy posed by global climate change. Hertsgaard's focus is the human dimension to global ecological decline, and in "Earth Odyssey," he displays an authentic talent for storytelling. By taking care to explain the technical, by including just enough of himself and by giving full breath to select characters, he has transformed a daunting subject into a stirring contribution to the growing literature on the global environment.
The path Hertsgaard takes around the world is full of surprises and unexplored places. Just as important, he does not berate or moralize. His tone is generally that of an interested and accomplished reporter seeking to understand communities and assemble a foundation of facts from which to draw conclusions.
The chapters on China are especially satisfying. In Chongqing, a southwestern industrial city, Hertsgaard investigates a chlorine plant that officials say is closed, but continues to operate and pour a toxic waterfall of raw chlorine and other chemicals directly into the Jialing River, a drinking water source for millions of people. But this was hardly the worst pollution he saw there.
Though residents of China's cities rarely see blue sky because of air pollution caused by burning coal, and rivers are so choked by raw sewage and chemical wastes that fish cannot survive, China's 1.2 billion people are still motivated by one concern. They want to make enough money to escape poverty, joblessness and cramped living conditions that Americans would never tolerate. Western environmental concerns seem so inconsequential as to be almost laughable. "You may complain about our contributions to global warming or the ozone hole," Hertsgaard is told. "But how much pollution we make, how many trees we cut or dams we build is nobody's business but ours."
"Social forces have been set in motion that will not be contained," Hertsgaard writes. "Electricity, telephones, running water -- once humans experience these things, they want more of them, no matter the ecological cost. As well they might. It is easy for outsiders to warn against the long-term costs of damming Africa's rivers, ruining its scenery, or destroying its woodlands, but it is akin to a glutton admonishing a beggar on the evil of carbohydrates -- he lacks a certain moral authority."
Where "Earth Odyssey" falters is its recommendations. Hertsgaard's survey of the potential fixes for a world being disfigured by the passion for wealth -- technology improvements, more efficiently using resources, minimizing waste, even shifting taxes to penalize pollution -- is so bogged down in statistics and theory that it's like breathing through a dishrag. Hertsgaard could have remedied this problem by focusing more intensely on the solution he knows the most about: politics and government.
It's been little more than a generation since the United States invented and enacted the program that cleaned the air, cleared the water and safeguarded millions of acres of wild lands. Presidents of both parties and bipartisan Congressional action provided the political foundation for visionary people to do something great.
In the 1960's, for example, Stewart L. Udall, the Secretary of the Interior during eight years of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, established four national parks, six national monuments, nine national recreation areas, 20 national historic sites and nine national lakeshores and seashores. Udall also wrote the 1964 Wilderness Act, which preserved tens of millions of acres of wild land, and helped to gain passage of the 1968 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. He championed Rachel Carson's warning about toxic chemicals and set the stage for the pioneering environmental legislation of the 1970's.
The question Hertsgaard needed to address is why Washington turned meek. It's not enough to spend pages criticizing Vice President Al Gore for failing to act on a vow to make the environment the "central organizing principle" of governance -- the conclusion of Gore's best-selling book "The Earth in the Balance" (1992). Gore works in an economic and historic context that has shrunk the political comfort zone for courageous policy making. Business owners, lawmakers, the press and ultimately voters are apparently satisfied with mediocre governing. Until the political market for inspired ideas and passionate leadership reawakens in the United States, what Hertsgaard calls "the material striving of the entire human family" will never be reconciled with the carrying capacity of the planet's environment.

HEADLINE: TriBeCa Dissent: A 'Postmodern Hulk'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Block 214 Association represents the community living and working close to the development described on Dec. 6 in the "Posting" entitled "New TriBeCa Building Designed to Look Old."
We believe the building will impact negatively on this neighborhood, socially, economically and physically. In similar situations throughout the city, luxury residential developments have reduced a neighborhood's diversity, particularly by driving out artists and small businesses. 
 The surrounding neighborhood, designated mixed use, has a residential, office and studio population (representing all the arts), as well as a number of street-level businesses including shipping, restaurants and clubs.
Whatever the claims of the architect, the fact is that the building doesn't "fit into the neighborhood." Anyone who is at all familiar with the character of the neighborhood can see that while low- through mid-rise buildings line the north-south streets, the east-west streets, especially those between Hudson and Greenwich, are uniformly characterized by low midblock buildings. No. 3-9 Hubert Street will be the only midblock building in the neighborhood to rise above seven stories. With 12-foot ceilings (and 13 floors, including penthouse), it will be the equivalent of a 17-story building. On three sides of the site the buildings have ceilings of approximately 9 to 10 feet.
The proposed building is clearly out of character with the historic architecture of the area.
Many of us in the community are dismayed by the philistine concept of a new building having to emulate one from another period (the title of your article). Mr. Lombardi's dispiriting neo-Deco design (if that's what it is), is just another generic postmodern hulk, now all too familiar in downtown Manhattan.
The basis on which the Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the design is faulty. The premise that a new building is acceptable in a historic district because it "emulates" an existing one is specious. In fact, Mr. Lombardi's building will resemble no existing TriBeCa building.
In TriBeCa, a neighborhood that has so many styles from so many periods, covering at least 150 years of architectural history, there is no rationale for building a historical pastiche. We would much prefer a contemporary building by a fine architect, in scale with the district.

HEADLINE: FILM;
A Legend of French Film Whose Legacy Is Clarity

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR; Dave Kehr is a New York film writer.

 BODY:
ROBERT BRESSON, the doyen of French filmmakers, keeps his Paris apartment at the western tip of the Ile St. Louis. From the small park in front of his building, a favorite site for cinephiles on Parisian pilgrimages, there is a magnificent view down the Seine, still a working river with its traffic of barges and tourist boats.
To the south, almost hidden behind a rise of buildings, looms the Cathedral of Notre Dame. Perhaps Mr. Bresson can see it from his window, but somehow one assumes that he would prefer not to. Like the realm of the sacred in many of his films, it is something to be felt rather than seen, while our eyes remain focused on the brute reality in front of us, on the world's commerce and commotion. 
 Now a fragile 97, Mr. Bresson no longer appears in public and has not made a film since "L'Argent" 15 years ago. Yet a poll of critics and filmmakers would almost certainly name him the most important living director; for the always quotable Jean-Luc Godard, "Bresson is French cinema, as Dostoyevsky is the Russian novel and Mozart is German music."
Mr. Bresson's complete work consists of a mere 13 features made between 1943 and 1983 (plus one odd, unclassifiable piece of juvenilia, the free-form 1934 short comedy "Les Affaires Publiques"), all of which will be shown in a complete retrospective that begins on Friday and runs through Feb. 7 at the Museum of Modern Art.
The series, organized by James Quandt of the Cinematheque Ontario, features newly struck 35-millimeter prints with new subtitles, promising a clarity absolutely essential for this most pristine of film artists.
An artist was what Mr. Bresson always considered himself to be. From the beginning, with the tentative, cramped "Les Anges du Peche," filmed under the occupation in 1943, the director's difference was evident. The highly melodramatic story -- a nun (Renee Faure) struggles to save the soul of an insistently ungrateful delinquent (Jany Holt) -- was treated with a restraint and sobriety far beyond the Greer Garson-ish standards of the time. "Bresson's nuns are true," wrote Roland Barthes in a prescient early review. "They know how to wear the habit, how to walk, talk and pray." Said Sacha Guitry, France's leading man of the theater, "It's much better than a movie."
Mr. Bresson relied on literary sources for his first few films -- "Les Anges" was written by Jean Giraudoux and the subsequent "Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne" by Jean Cocteau. "Journal d'un Cure de Campagne" ("Diary of a Country Priest," 1951) was taken from a novel by Georges Bernanos. With each film, Mr. Bresson's style became more austere, his thematic focus tighter. But it was with "Un Condamne a Mort s'est Echappe" ("A Man Escaped," 1956) that Mr. Bresson broke through to something startlingly new.
He began by tossing out conventional notions of film acting: the forced emphases, the exaggerated expressions, the gestures of what he came to define as "filmed theater." Instead of actors, he would henceforth use "models," nonprofessionals who would be instructed to read their lines with as little interpretive inflection as possible.
Resisting the illusion of "wholeness" created by the classical, Hollywood style of filmmaking, Mr. Bresson discarded the unified theatrical space reproduced by long shots in favor of a fragmented vision composed of close-ups -- and close-ups not just of faces but of inanimate objects, hands and feet as well. The world beyond the tight visual field of Mr. Bresson's camera was imaginatively imported by the soundtrack.
"Un Condamne" works almost as a metaphorical presentation of Mr. Bresson's new method. Based on the memoirs of Andre Devigny, the film tells the true story of a French resistance fighter's escape from the notorious Fort Montluc prison in German-occupied Lyons. The point of view, while not strictly and naively subjective, is tightly linked to the protagonist; the film restricts itself to the range of his perceptions. The world beyond the prison is, like the space beyond the limits of the shots, evoked by sound, suggestion and intuition.
The film is constructed as a series of Chinese boxes: within the world there is a prison, within the prison a cell, in the cell a man, and in the man a -- what? Call it a consciousness, a spirit or a soul, it's an unnamable something that yearns for escape.
All of Mr. Bresson's subsequent films tell essentially the same story of an individual searching, consciously or unconsciously, for a way out. The individual need not be a saint; in fact, Mr. Bresson's one explicitly hagiographic film, the 1962 "Proces de Jeanne d'Arc" ("The Trial of Joan of Arc"), is one of his rare failures. More often, the Bressonian protagonist is a morally ambiguous figure, attracted to damnation as much as salvation, to evil as much as good.
In "Pickpocket" (1959), the central character is an unemployed student, Michel (Martin Lassalle), who turns to petty crime, at first to test an abstract moral theory (the film is distantly based on "Crime and Punishment"), but soon because of the rapturous state it produces in him. Driven to more and more daring feats, he tests the limits of this strangely spiritual, profoundly antisocial experience. But the pickpocket only finds release in the film's famous final image, as he looks through the bars of a cell at the woman he suddenly realizes he loves.
Seeing "Pickpocket" in 1969 inspired a young critic named Paul Schrader to write a highly influential book called "Transcendental Style in Film"; it also inspired him, as a screenwriter, to create the figures of Travis Bickle in "Taxi Driver" and Jake La Motta in "Raging Bull." But Mr. Schrader's most fully developed Bressonian hero is Nick Nolte's Wade Whitehouse in the current "Affliction," a small town police officer who becomes a martyr to his own inner violence.
"A Man Escaped" and "Pickpocket" both include sequences of breathtaking formal beauty; the sequence in "Pickpocket" in which Michel and his colleagues descend upon a train station achieves a grace and perfection in its balance of camera movement and gesture. These moments become more and more rare in Mr. Bresson's later work, as if he puritanically saw in them too much pride and worldly exuberance.
Yet Mr. Bresson was never the stony minimalist he is often made out to be. There is almost no camera movement in his 1966 film "Au Hasard Balthazar" ("Balthazar"), but it overflows with incident. Using the life of a donkey, Balthazar of the title, as its core, the film weaves half a dozen story lines into a vivid and desolate portrait of rural life. Surrounded by pain and relentlessly victimized, Balthazar endures and is rewarded with one of the most sublime deaths on film. Exhausted, the animal kneels in a sun-dappled field, surrounded by a herd of sheep, as the bells around their necks ring out an Angelus. Nothing retentive there.
In Mr. Bresson's most disconsolate films, suicide offers the only practical escape route: the heroine of "Mouchette" (1967) drowns herself by rolling down a hillside into a pond; "Le Diable Probablement" ("The Devil Probably," 1977) was forbidden to minors in France because officials feared its brutal climax might incite teen-agers to kill themselves.
Yet the deaths in these films are as much ceremony as tragedy. The heroine of "Une Femme Douce" ("A Gentle Woman," 1969) considers killing her husband but kills herself instead; the protagonist of "L'Argent" (1983) murders an old woman and walks off impassively to his execution. In both cases, Mr. Bresson withholds the psychological factors that may have motivated the actions; their gestures are accomplished with a blank automatism that suggests an ancient sacrifice, a yielding to the gods.
In 1977, Mr. Bresson published a slim volume of aphorisms titled "Notes sur le Cinematographe," which has recently been reprinted in English by Sun and Moon Press under the misleading title "Notes on the Cinematographer." The book remains the best introduction to Mr. Bresson's work, the embodiment of his style as well as the most acute analysis of it. In a passage cited by James Quandt in his introduction to the critical anthology being published in conjunction with the retrospective, Mr. Bresson writes, "It is with something clean and precise that you will force the attention of inattentive eyes and ears."
More clean, more precise the cinema does not get.

 BODY:
Nicholas Weinstock's article on the exodus of American entrepreneurs from Russia (Dec. 27) is a chronicle not of Russia's economic failure but of America's moral one. Does a country where the majority lack basic health care really need a Gold's Gym? Does a populace so impoverished that most cannot afford to buy meat need a pricey steakhouse?
 Instead of helping Russia get back on her feet, entrepreneurs geared their goods and services to the wealthiest Russians, then cut and ran with the earnings as soon as the market tumbled. This may be capitalism, but it's capitalism without any concern for the welfare of ordinary people. No wonder Communism is making a comeback.

Downtown Scarsdale Development Plan Advances

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

DATELINE: SCARSDALE

 BODY:
FOR more than 30 years, there has been endless discussion and analysis over what to do with two unsightly parcels of land on either side of Popham Road near this village's train station. Each lot measures about an acre. One has a nondescript retail building on it, the other an asphalt parking lot.
Several projects have been advanced over the years for the land, but all were scuttled because of concerns about the impact of any construction project on this affluent community's tranquil and prized quality of life. 
 "This land and what to do with it has been studied ad nauseam," said Mayor Edward Morgan. "I think everyone realizes that the time to do something is now. There's no going backward."
That sense of urgency, as well as several other compelling factors, have pushed a current project further along than any other before it, despite a campaign by those who oppose the plan and concerns voiced by the neighboring Town of Greenburgh.
Last Tuesday, the Village Board of Trustees approved by a 6-to-1 vote an environmental impact statement for a 90,500-square-foot project to be built on the two pieces of land, known as the Freightway and Depot Place parcels -- the former owned by the village, the latter by American Premier Underwriters, an insurance company based in Cincinnati. The company also owns the air rights over the track.
The project would include 45 to 60 housing units and about 30,000 square feet of shops and services in the two landscaped parcels. A 300-car underground parking garage would extend below both lots.
The board will now consider amending the zoning for the two sites to increase the permitted proportion of nonresidential or commercial use from 10 percent to 45 percent. "That will be necessary to achieve the right balance between something small enough not to create additional problems, yet big enough to have some critical mass in order to make something happen," said Dorothy Finger, a member of the board, who voted in favor of the project. "What's the point of just having another apartment building there, with little or no businesses. That wouldn't add anything."
The village center, which surrounds the train station, already has several apartment buildings with a total of 264 apartments, according to a citizen's advisory report on downtown development completed in 1995. "This project complies with all the principles set out in that report," said Amy Paulin, a board member. "We're using it to guide us in this process."
Among those principles were recommendations that the two parcels have a maximum of 100,500 square feet of development, with a mix of residential, retail and parking, and that they cover the tracks.
The approval process now moves on to site-plan approval, where questions of design and the actual positioning of buildings will be addressed. "I'd say we're looking at another year before this gets final approval," said Bradford Perkins, president of Perkins Eastman Architects, of Manhattan, which is principal architect on the project.
Mr. Perkins, who is a resident of Scarsdale, said he first got involved with redevelopment of the village's downtown in the late 1970's. "We were reviewing a prior proposal that got scrapped, but interest remained in doing something with the land because what's there now is so unattractive."
In a "fit of boyish enthusiasm," Mr. Perkins said, "I suggested combining the properties and developing them at the same time." This approach solved other inherent problems, as well, Mr. Perkins said.
"It has no frontage," Mr. Perkins said. "It's bounded by the railroad tracks and buildings and has no views." The solution, he determined, was to go over the tracks. "It's the only way out of that," he said. "Otherwise nobody would want to live there."
Development on the Freightway parcel would consist of retail, personal service and other similar uses at street level, and apartments in a building shaped like a U with one truncated arm that would span the tracks. The Depot Place parcel would be a shopping plaza with one-story retail, personal service and other uses fronting on Popham Road and Depot Place.
Zoning requires that at least 10 percent of the housing be designated for the elderly. "Other potential tenants would be corporate and diplomatic relocations," said Mr. Perkins. "There would probably be a few young families. But as a rule, families in Scarsdale don't live in apartments." This was a major concern to the board, Ms. Paulin said, due to potential overcrowding in the village's pubic schools.
IT has not yet been determined whether the apartments will be for-sale or rentals. "All we know is that they will be high-end, as will the shops," Mr. Perkins said. "The actual design has not yet been worked out in detail," Mr. Perkins explained, "but it will be compatible with the other apartment buildings downtown," which were built in the 1920's. "They're Scarsdale Tudor," Mr. Perkins said. "It's really what people think of when they think of Scarsdale. All of our buildings will have pitched roofs, and fit right in."
A landscaped plaza bridging the depressed railroad tracks will connect the two parts of the downtown, now divided by the tracks. The major connection now is the Popham Road Bridge.
"Trying to cross the bridge at almost any time of day, you're lucky if you don't get hit by a car," said Ms. Finger, the board member. "It's a mess. It wouldn't make any sense to build a project with an apartment building without the added dimension of allowing for pedestrian traffic to move back and forth."
Beverley Sved, who cast the sole opposing vote on the seven-member board, thinks that the project, rather than connecting the two parts of downtown, will provide more of a barrier. "It will have a wall-like effect, blocking out views from Garth Road," she said.
Paul Feiner, Supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh, has sent letters to Mayor Morgan outlining his concerns about the project's impact on traffic, especially along busy Ardsley Road. "If our concerns aren't addressed, we would consider litigation against the village," he said. "But we hope that it doesn't come to that and that we can find a solution such as having the developer pay for traffic improvements in Greenburgh."
A group called Scarsdale Responsible Citizens has also been critical of the project. The development would amount to "the urbanization of our charming village," said Michael Anastas, the group's chairman.
"We take exception to the board's approval of the environmental findings," he added. "We don't believe it has adequately studied what this project would do to the village."
Ms. Paulin, the board member, conceded that some problems still remain.
"We still have a number of concerns -- for instance, how the platform will look," said Ms. Paulin. "We still haven't gotten a list of all the development partners involved. That's probably the biggest open question."
The likely developers at this point is a partnership called the Scarsdale Depot Associates, which is comprised of Fairchild Properties, a real estate company based in Manhattan, and American Premier Underwriters. The company, formerly Penn Central, changed its name in March 1994 to reflect its role as an insurer, rather than a railroad. "We've been involved in this project in various forms for 15 years," said Sam Klein, president of Fairchild Properties.
Over the years, Mr. Klein said the project had been drastically reduced in size. The current scaled down plan "couldn't possibly be any smaller," Mr. Klein said. "As it is we need a few variables staying in place for it to succeed, such as today's low interest rates holding." He expects the completed project to cost around $17 million."
"Our next step is to present a formal site plan," Mr. Klein added. "We hope to have a shovel in the ground by the second quarter of this year. But realistically I know it could take longer."

HEADLINE: Another Stadium the State Still Needs to Fill Up

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
Is the Connecticut Tennis Center in New Haven a gigantic white elephant and monument to imprudent state spending -- or an ultramodern stadium that may yet fulfill its promise?
Whatever one's view, the center (which towers over the nearby Yale Bowl) was built on Yale University property with $18 million in state-issued bonds. The 15,000-seat center will be the site of a women's professional tournament for one week in August -- the only event scheduled so far this year. To many, it has become a grandiose venue built less than a decade ago for a tennis promoter whose weeklong men's tournament was lured out of the country -- two years after he had sold it to another promoter in what was regarded as a better financial deal. 
 At a time when many question the prudence of building a stadium in Hartford for the National Football League's New England Patriots -- at what is expected to be more than $400 million in state funds -- the track record of the Tennis Center may stand as a cautionary symbol.
"We can learn a lesson from what has happened," said Joseph McGee, a former commissioner of the state's Department of Economic Development and now a vice president of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association. "It shows that we have to hold sports operators to a much tighter standard in the future."
Mr. McGee did not elaborate, but he could have been alluding to negotiations between the state and Robert K. Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, which have produced what is generally acknowledged to be the best deal ever offered to a professional sports franchise.
Moira K. Lyons of Stamford, the state's new Speaker of the House, pointed out that if the Patriots decided to leave Hartford before their 30-year contract had expired, the team's owners would be obliged to pay "liquidation damages" (assuming the state had kept its part of the contract). Such money could be used toward the cost of the stadium. "A formula for that is being worked out now," said Ms. Lyons, who had initially expressed skepticism over the stadium plans.
No similar arrangement was ever established with the two tennis promoters in New Haven. "I expected the men's tournament would stay in New Haven for at least 20 years," said the New Haven Mayor, John DeStefano Jr., who was the first executive director of the Tennis Foundation of Connecticut Inc., which owns and operates the tennis stadium. When the Tennis Center was built in 1991, it was projected as a catalyst for rejuvenating a city whose image had been largely drawn by crime and poverty.
The tournament promoter, city officials, civic leaders and many others predicted that hotels, restaurants and other businesses would flourish with the coming of the Volvo International Tennis Tournament, which was first played in a temporary stadium alongside the Yale Bowl in 1990. But Volvo dropped out and Pilot Pen became the sponsor three years ago, and after last year's competition, the tournament left the city entirely, for Austria.
After William A. O'Neill, then the Governor, succeeded in luring the Volvo tournament from Stratton Mountain, Vt., in 1990 -- with the promise of building a state-financed stadium -- Paul H. Johnson, the first president of the Tennis Foundation, said he agreed with Mr. O'Neill that the tournament would have "enormous benefits" for the state. And John Daniels, then the Mayor of New Haven, predicted that the tournament would result in "great economic benefits" for the city.
In truth, while the men's tournament -- whose field was diluted somewhat each year because of a competing event in Indianapolis -- attracted media attention to New Haven, it had scant economic impact on the area. One reason, as several studies have shown, is that the vast majority of spectators have been from towns within about a 45-mile radius and rarely went to restaurants or bars in the city or stayed in its hotels.
Indeed, an economic impact study conducted by students at the Yale University School of Organization and Impact showed that during the tournament's first year in 1991, 85 percent of the $7.04 million in direct spending related to the tournament was spent at the new stadium itself.
That was far below the annual figure of $10 million that some members of the Tennis Foundation predicted would be generated for New Haven area businesses. Supporters had also estimated that the event would produce as much as $500,000 in annual tax revenue to the city from a 3 percent surcharge on tickets to the men's tournament. As it developed, the city has received far less.
Additionally, backers of the stadium proposal said that revenues from a 10 percent admission surcharge would be enough to pay the debt service on the 20-year general obligation bonds that, with interest, are expected to cost the state around $33 million. Over the first four years of the stadium's existence, revenue from the admission tax went to the legislature's general fund.
But at the request of Mayor DeStefano, then the executive director of the Tennis Foundation, the state agreed in 1993 (the year Mr. DeStefano was elected Mayor), to let the foundation keep all revenue from the 10 percent admission surcharge.
"If that hadn't happened, the foundation could no longer have operated," said Christopher Perillo, the current executive director of the Tennis Foundation and its lone full-time employe.
In the last year, Mayor DeStefano has asked the city's Board of Aldermen to waive the 3 percent surcharge so that the current promoter, Butch Buchholz -- who sold the men's tournament but plans to keep the women's event in New Haven -- does not have to pay the surcharge. (Such a waiver would, of course, deprive the city of tax revenue from the women's event.)
Mr. Perillo, Mayor DeStefano and the current president of the Tennis Foundation, Richard Nelson, all agree that the Tennis Center has been vastly underused. "We definitely have to expand the usage," Mr. Perillo said, and Mr. Nelson added, "We're always trying to get more events."
Before the bond issue was approved for the center, the promoter of the Volvo International, Jim Westhall, said his company, Jewel Productions, planned to stage several concerts each summer. But less than a dozen have been held, and none since 1994 when performers such as Patti LaBelle, Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor and Julio Iglesias appeared.
"We were hurt by the expansion of the Oakdale Musical Theater in Wallingford and by the opening of the Meadows" -- an outdoor concert theater in Hartford -- Mr. Perillo said. "And I can't see concerts being held at the Tennis Center again. For one thing, the costs of putting up a stage and erecting a sound system, among other things, make it prohibitive. But then you have to look around and realize that other tennis stadiums in the country are also just used for tennis."
The Tennis Foundation still has the Pilot Pen International women's tournament, which was held at the Tennis Center for the first time last year and drew an outstanding field of players including Steffi Graf and Lindsay Davenport.
But that is not enough. Mr. Nelson noted that the Tennis Foundation has considered staging volleyball games, boxing matches and professional figure skating.
Mayor DeStafano, a Democrat in his second term, said "Concerts never developed as we had hoped they would. But I think men's tennis will be back. After all, this is a great tennis facility, one of the best in the world."
The president of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce, Matthew Nemerson, said that "there have been some real lessons there for us to learn, but it's been a good training program. We thought we'd get more people from Fairfield County, but found out that it's such an appendage of New York, which has to get out of the shadow of New York City. And the stadium definitely was built too big."
Still, Mr. Nemerson and Mayor DeStefano are convinced that tournaments at the Tennis Center have focused attention on New Haven and been good for the city. "Building a tennis stadium is not going to cure poverty or end crime, but that's not what it was was postured to do," Mr. DeStefano said. "New Haven has a lot to offer, and the stadium is just one more part of a larger puzzle that includes Yale, the Shubert Theater, the Long Wharf Theater and the New Haven Symphony, among other things."
"As far as we're concerned, the investment made sense," the Mayor said. "It's helped create community pride and enhanced our quality of life." As for repayment of the bond money, Mr. DeStefano said, "There was never any commitment for us to repay the bonds. It was just assumed that revenues generated would raise enough tax money to make up for the bonds."
But that has not been the case.
Joseph McGee, Commissioner of Economic Development under former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and a strong proponent of the Tennis Center -- with its 22 field courts built or renovated at a cost of an additionl $3 million in state bonds -- said that the plan for the center "was not structured effectively."
"Everyone was overly optimistic, and it's certainly not turned out to be everything it could have been," he said. "But there's a learning curve here. Building the Tennis Center was not a mistake, but we learned that we have to keep a close eye on sports promoters in the future."

HEADLINE: The Turnpike in Mid-Life Crisis

BYLINE: By SUSAN BANFIELD 

 BODY:
SIX ex-governors, as well as the then-current Governor, Abraham Ribicoff, were present at formal ribbon-cutting ceremonies held in Greenwich and Killingly Jan. 2, 1958. Clergymen representing the three major faiths gave their blessings. And the Connecticut Turnpike was opened.
Governor Ribicoff hailed the new highway as "a great construction achievement" that would "spur the growth and development of a large area of the state and relieve traffic congestion." 
 Today, 41 years later, the turnpike, now named the Gov. John Davis Lodge Turnpike and carrying the Interstate 95 designation on its busiest stretch along the shoreline, is the source of countless commuting horror stories. The notion that it once offered relief from southern Connecticut's traffic problems is laughable.
The story of the turnpike's coming of middle age is one of the futility of trying to foresee all future needs -- and at the same time a testament to the perseverance of planners and state officials who continue to work on solutions for the state's most heavily traveled roads.
The building of the turnpike was a mammoth project, first conceived in 1942, the object of bitter political controversy for years -- Governor Lodge, for whom it was ultimately named, held office from 1951 to 1955 -- and finally, in what Governor Ribicoff described as an "impossible timetable," constructed from start to finish in less than three years.
Construction required the acquisition of 4,688 pieces of property, the building of 274 bridges, and the pouring of 2.3 million barrels of Portland cement. Initial construction costs came to nearly $500 million.
The hopes that rode on the new highway were as grand as the project itself. Route 1, the Boston Post Road, was choked with traffic, specifically post-war truck traffic banned from the Merritt Parkway when it was built in the 1930's. A typical truck trip from the New York State line to New Haven, via Route 1, took more than three hours.
Another, more ambitious goal for the new turnpike was to revitalize the economy of the areas it passed through. Normally, highway expansion follows economic growth. However, in this case legislators hoped a new turnpike would stimulate economic development, especially in the eastern part of the state.
With the decline of the textile industry, Windham and New London counties had large pockets of unemployment, and by 1950 their population had fallen to just 10.2 percent of the state's total -- half of what it had been 100 years earlier.
At first, it went like a dream. Congestion on the Post Road was greatly relieved. The towns along the new road also demonstrated impressive growth. Between 1960 and 1970, Stamford grew from a population of 92,713 to 108,798, Westport from 20,956 to 27,414, and Orange from 8,547 to 13,524. And the economy of the eastern part of the state made a noticeable turnaround.
A 1962 study by the University of Connecticut's Department of Agriculture entitled "The Connecticut Turnpike: A Ribbon of Hope" reported that manufacturing employment in the area served by the turnpike increased by 27 percent between 1956 and 1962, compared to no increase for the state as a whole. The motel and summer home business also grew dramatically in the area, with the total capacity of motels and cabin courts up 64 percent from 1957 to 1962. The study gave the turnpike much of the credit.
By the mid 70's, however, the wave of benefits flowing from the turnpike had crested, and problems with the road began to develop.
The economy and population of southern Connecticut had indeed grown -- so much so that the turnpike was operating at close to full capacity. (It would reach the full mark of 70,000 vehicles a day in 1983.) Yet the unprecedented growth of the entire northeast, southern Connecticut included, continued.
Several life style changes helped put even more cars on the road. Stuart Leland, the Connecticut D.O.T.'s director of inventory and forecasting, says these included a dramatic increase in car ownership (from a norm of one car per family in the 1950's to today's norm of a car for each adult) and the greatly increased number of women in the work force. More women working mean more people commuting to job sites.
The D.O.T.'s Fairfield County bureau chief, Harry Harris, adds that the growth of on-time delivery services like Federal Express, and a dramatic increase in other truck traffic as the railroads declined, have also had a major impact.
By the mid- to late 70's, toll plazas were clogged with vehicles, leading to accidents, air pollution and frustration at time lost. In 1983, galvanized by a seven-fatality accident at the Stratford tolls, and facilitated by the fact that the tolls had paid off the bonds used to build the turnpike -- more than a decade ahead of schedule, the toll plazas were taken down.
That led to some easing of congestion, yet at the same time paved the way for more. Trucks that had formerly used Interstate 84 to avoid the tolls switched to newly toll-free I-95.
In the mid-1980's, the D.O.T. conducted a study of transportation in the 40-mile corridor from Greenwich to New Haven. The study concluded that if current trends continued, in order to accommodate the travel demands of the 21st century, I-95 would need up to three additional lanes in each direction, and the Merritt up to two additional lanes in each direction.
In years past, this sort of obvious solution to traffic problems was viable and successful. In the 1930's, and then again in the 1950's, entire new highways had been built. By the late 1980's, however, such projects were no longer practicable. In 1988 officials from the state D.O.T. and the Federal Highway Administration declared the proposed widening of the Merritt unfeasible. In the case of I-95, even a -- by comparison -- modest construction project such as converting the shoulder to an extra travel lane was put on the back burner because of the time and costs involved. The estimated cost of such an expansion is nearly twice that of the entire initial construction of the turnpike.
Meanwhile, congestion on the turnpike continues to worsen. Currently, with more than 120,000 vehicles a day using it, the highway is operating at 185 percent of capacity. The accident rate, 1.94 per million vehicle-miles of travel, is 12 percent higher than the state average for six-lane urban expressways. There are at any given time half a dozen ongoing construction projects in process between Greenwich and New Haven.
"You can never count on being able to make even a short trip on 95 without running into some kind of delay," said Susan McGovern, a Milford resident who for a year commuted to New Jersey and who now commutes to Westport. "If it isn't rush hour, then there's an accident, or there's lane closures due to construction."
On a scale from A (best) to E (worst), the Connecticut Turnpike at rush hour has been given an 'E' rating.
Yet, state transportation officials and area business leaders have by no means given up on the situation. In fact, they are markedly optimistic.
Construction is inevitable on a 41-year-old road. "A road system is something that wears," said James Byrnes, the D.O.T.'s chief engineer. However, the DOT tries to schedule as much road work as possible during the night. Almost without exception, he said, the major construction projects that entail lane shutdowns are now being done at night. Some types of work have to be done during the day for technical reasons, and normal maintenance activities such as pot-hole patching are also done during the day. Still, 90 percent of road work is scheduled for the period from 8 or 10 P.M. to 5:30 or 6 A.M., Mr. Byrnes says.
There is, of course, a down side to the limited work schedules. That is, projects seem to go on forever.
Actually, the aim of much construction work is to make the highway safer. Fewer accidents mean less congestion. Head-on collisions resulting from cars jumping the barrier on the central divider have been virtually eliminated by replacing metal guard rails with far more effective Jersey barriers. Many rainy day accidents have been prevented by upgrading drains.
The installation of a new $20 million intelligent transportation system is playing a major role in reducing congestion due to accidents that do occur. "Since we're not building our way out of congestion, we're trying to better manage what we have," said Mr. Byrnes. "This allows people to respond more intelligently , more quickly to incidents."
Then too, since in recent years trucks have been involved in 25 percent of turnpike accidents, the state police have recently made organizational changes to make truck traffic safer. In early September, new legislation shifted responsibility for highway traffic from the central office to three local districts.
According to Sgt. Frank Sawicki, in charge of the truck enforcement unit for the Western Connecticut District, this has enabled him to bring in additional staff. The same new legislation also increased the operational hours of the Greenwich weigh station to eight eight-hour shifts per week. In addition, the district has established roving scale teams which set up randomly in parking lots and do inspections. "We're able to address more issues than we were before," said Sergeant Sawicki.
Currently, the accident rate on the turnpike compares favorably with those of other major urban expressways. For example, the 64-mile stretch of I-94 which runs from I-80 up through Chicago and then to the Wisconsin border -- an urban area similar to that traversed by the western section of the Connecticut Turnpike -- has a rate of 2.238 crashes per million vehicle miles. The turnpike's is only 1.94.
Accident prevention has been stepped up. Construction has been limited. But what can be done to deal with rush hour? In February 1998, the D.O.T. published a 14-point plan designed to reduce traffic in the Greenwich to New Haven corridor by 5 percent by the year 2002.
After years of analysis, it had become clear that there was no silver bullet solution for the problem. But state officials are convinced that if they can succeed in getting 8,600 vehicles off the road during rush hour -- the 5 percent reduction specified -- many problems would be solved.
"Five percent doesn't fix it so traffic at rush hour goes 60 miles per hour," said Joseph McGee, vice president for public policy at SACIA (the business council of southwestern Connecticut). "But there's a tipping point. Five percent really makes a difference."
One of the biggest items on the current wish list is to increase intra-state train commuters. Between 80 and 90 percent of commuting trips to New York City are already made by train. The problem is with commutes within the coastal corridor, only 6 percent of which are by train.
Various measures, including a $57 million program to increase railroad station parking, and revisions in the fare schedule that make intrastate commuting more attractive, are being implemented.
A program called the Guaranteed Ride Home program is also being introduced. Under this program, anyone who purchases a monthly, or even a 10-trip railroad pass will be driven home by taxi free of charge in the event of an emergency. The Guaranteed Ride program is designed to alleviate the very real fears of commuting parents about being stuck at work without a car when something happens to their child.
Other items in the Department's 14-point plan include increasing ridesharing and van pooling, increasing interregional bus ridership, increasing telecommuting and work schedule changes, and promoting the use of the new Long Island ferries for trips to Manhattan and La Guardia.
Will the plan work? "You've got to do them all to get this 5 percent reduction,' says Joe McGee.
"The train goal" -- to attract 1,750 new daily riders -- "is well achievable," says Harry Harris. "The one thing I get most concerned about is the level of commitment from the business community that is going to be required to make these things happen. Businesses don't like to interfere with the personal lives of employees -- for example, getting people to switch their hours, or getting people to work at home. There has to be a corporate culture that supports these things."
Another example that underscores the critical role of business involvement is a new Federal program called Transit Chek. Under the new program, employees who use public transportation to get to work can have their commuting expenses deducted from their paychecks before taxes. The catch is, a company has to be willing to set up such a program.
"If everyone did something other than drive their single-occupancy vehicle to work one day a week -- work from home, carpool, take the train -- we'd have a dramatic reduction in congestion," says Mr. Harris. "Traffic would flow. It wouldn't be perfect, but it would flow."

HEADLINE: Just Whose Millstone Is It?

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
INFLUENTIAL groups and public officials on the East End of Long Island are stepping up a determined campaign to close the Millstone nuclear power plant in Connecticut, even as its operators await permission to restart the second of its three reactors after a three-year shutdown.
But the people who probably stand most to lose from any Millstone accident -- the Connecticut residents who are the plant's closest neighbors -- are mostly absent from the campaign. 
 The Long Islanders insist that they are no Don Quixotes, but rather carriers of a compelling message to residents on both sides of Long Island Sound about a rogue nuclear plant that must be placed in mothballs before a catastrophe occurs.
"We are going to shut it down by June," said Dr. Helen Caldicott, a well-known opponent of nuclear power and the president of Standing for Truth About Radiation, or Star, a group based in East Hampton, N.Y. "We have to," she said. "It's an emergency."
The opposition from Long Island's rural, resort and agricultural East End is a sharp contrast to a general, if sometimes uneasy, acceptance of the plant in an area of southeastern Connecticut around New London where jobs are at stake.
"I don't think the people of Long Island have anything to fear," said Thomas A. Sheridan, the First Selectman of the Town of Waterford, where the Millstone complex is situated and many the the plant's 2,800 employees live. "Do they think the thousands of people who live and work around here would put their families at risk?"
But Long Island officials and groups said last week that a series of shutdowns at the 1,200-megawatt Millstone Three reactor that had occurred since July, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission allowed Millstone's operator, Northeast Utilities, to restart the reactor, showed it was unsafe and should be shut down immediately.
A spokesman for Northeast Utilities, Terrence V. McIntosh, said recent shutdowns showed the utility's heightened sensitivity to safety.
Neil A. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, also described the shutdowns as precautionary. "It's not unusual for a plant that has been down this long to run into a few bugs," he said.
Mr. Sheehan said none of the shutdowns had occurred when the plant was at or near full power.
But the Long Island groups and officials said the plant's continued operation and Northeast Utilities' plans to reopen the adjacent, 800-megawatt Millstone Two reactor later this year posed an extreme and largely unrecognized threat to southeastern Connecticut, eastern Long Island and beyond.
Dr. Caldicott said that even routine water and air emissions from Millstone may have contributed to higher cancer rates on eastern Long Island.
Mr. McIntosh, the Northeast Utilities spokesman, said environmental monitoring showed that the plant's emissions were no danger to the Sound or areas downwind.
William N. Smith, the executive director of Fish Unlimited on Shelter Island, said this was untrue. "They suck in a million gallons of water every minute and kill every organism, every shrimp, every plankton in it," said Mr. Smith, who said the plant also killed large numbers of juvenile flounders and blackfish.
The plant site on Millstone Point in Waterford is about 11 miles north of the North Fork of Long Island, and about 25 miles north of the South Fork. Northeast Utilities has pledged to inform Long Island and New York officials of plant incidents and has offered technical advice for an evacuation plan. But last week Representative Michael P. Forbes. whose Congressional district includes all the East End of Long Island, charged that the company failed to notify him about a Jan. 4 spill of 800 gallons of water containing low levels of radioactive tritium.
"I don't want to wake up one morning and read in the newspaper or hear on the radio that that we have a gigantic problem over there," Mr. Forbes said. "The fact is they have had four or five shutdowns, and that says to me they should not have gone back on line in the first place."
Last week Mr. Forbes wrote to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairwoman, Shirley Jackson, demanding that the plant be shut.
While Mr. Forbes and others on the East End criticized the commission, Representative Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat from Bozrah whose district includes Millstone, was confident that the commission "has demonstrated the utmost concern for safety," said his press secretary, Jon Lenzner.
Some in Connecticut were bemused by Long Island's reaction to the reopening of Millstone.
"I always thought it was curious that Long Island didn't wake up to the fact that there was a nuclear plant not too far away, and that they needed to be as watchful and careful as Connecticut communities," said Maura J. Casey, an editorial writer for The Day in New London.
Ms. Casey said most people living near Millstone appear to have come to terms with it. "The area around Millstone is replete with people who are highly sophisticated about the nuclear industry," she said. "They don't push the panic button here."
Maybe they should, suggested Dr. Caldicott, a pediatrician and founding president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize in 1985. She said that residents around Millstone had been seduced by tax benefits and inured to dangers. "People there have psychic numbing," said Dr. Caldicott. "They need our help. People here are not psychically numbed. Some of the most wealthy and influential people in the country are out here, and if they can be educated we will close the plant down."
Last week, Southampton became the second East End town to call for closing of the Millstone complex. The town board noted the plant's poor safety record and the absence of an evacuation plan for 110,000 year-round East End residents. (The Town of East Hampton passed a similar resolution last year.)
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission closed all three reactors in the Millstone complex in late 1995 and early 1996 because of safety violations and a pattern of retaliation against employees who reported safety problems.
The commission imposed a $2.1 million fine on Northeast Utilities and ordered an overhaul in safety programs and corporate culture before allowing Millstone Three to reopen. Its decision on reopening Millstone Two is expected during the first quarter of this year. Millstone One, the oldest of the three reactors, has been retired.
In a poll published in The Day last spring, half of New London County residents who responded said they thought Millstone Three was a safety threat and should not be reopened. But the poll also showed that more than two-thirds of respondents trusted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to assure the plant was safe.
Ron McKeown, director and founder of Friends for a Safe Millstone of East Lyme, Conn., said there was a widespread belief the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had corrected Millstone's problems.
"It is very clear the mainstream public now believes the N.R.C. is in firm control and that the page has been turned on Millstone," Mr. McKeown said. He said his group wanted contacts with Long Island opponents of Millstone. "We all want the truth, so it's silly not to communicate," he said.
Others read the mood in southeastern Connecticut differently. Nancy Burton, a lawyer from Redding representing Fish Unlimited, said she believed faith in the commission and support for Millstone was much thinner than plant supporters asserted. "Scratch the surface and people are scared," Ms. Burton said. "But they feel powerless because there is so much economic and political pressure applied to their communities."
Ms. Burton said she was delighted with Long Island's involvement in Millstone. "We are reaching our arms across the water to each other," she said.

HEADLINE: Conn. Nuclear Plant: A Cross-Sound Clash

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
INFLUENTIAL groups and public officials on the East End of Long Island are stepping up a determined campaign to close the Millstone nuclear power plant in Connecticut, even as its operators await permission to restart the second of its three reactors after a three-year shutdown.
But the people who probably stand most to lose from any Millstone accident -- the Connecticut residents who are the plant's closest neighbors -- are mostly absent from the campaign. 
 The Long Islanders insist that they are no Don Quixotes, but rather carriers of a compelling message to residents on both sides of Long Island Sound about a rogue nuclear plant that must be placed in mothballs before a catastrophe occurs.
"We are going to shut it down by June," said Dr. Helen Caldicott, a well-known opponent of nuclear power and the president of Standing for Truth About Radiation, or Star, a group based in East Hampton. "We have to," she said. "It's an emergency."
The opposition from Long Island's rural, resort and agricultural East End is a sharp contrast to a general, if sometimes uneasy, acceptance of the plant in an area of southeastern Connecticut around New London where jobs are at stake.
"I don't think the people of Long Island have anything to fear," said Thomas A. Sheridan, the First Selectman of the Town of Waterford, where Millstone is situated and many of the plant's 2,800 employees live. "Do they think the thousands of people who live and work around here would put their families at risk?"

Redeveloping a Polluted Raritan Center Parcel

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
FOR the last seven decades, a grubby swath of polluted land along Industrial Highway in the southwestern edge of Woodbridge Township has lain fallow and forgotten.
Now RPS Inc., a Pittsburgh-based small-package carrier, has started to clean up the contaminants from the 81-acre site and redevelop it into a 435,000-square-foot distribution complex that will eventually grow to 620,000 square feet. 
 The site's redevelopment is the result of six years of discussions involving RPS, local officials and the property owner, Federal Business Centers of Woodbridge. Recent changes in state law regarding the cleanup of contaminated sites that, among other things, provided buyers of such sites protection from liability helped cement the deal, as did a 30-year tax abatement the township granted the project in November.
"Tracts like this," said James E. McGreevey, the Mayor of Woodbridge, "will never become competitive unless the local or state government provides a financial incentive to offset the cost of the cleanup."
RPS -- whose parent is FDX, a holding company whose other subsidiaries include Federal Express -- broke ground in November for the initial phase of the project, estimated to cost $70 million. At its expected completion in 18 months it will become part of Raritan Center, the state's largest business/industrial park, which has three hotels as well.
The center, once part of an Army arsenal that served as a major munitions port in the two World Wars, covers 2,350 acres along the banks of the Raritan River in Woodbridge and Edison Townships in Middlesex County. Since its conversion to a commercial center 35 years ago some 13 million square feet of office, light industrial, warehouse and research space has been built at the center, which has a potential for an additional 4.3 million square feet.
RPS will lease the site for 30 years, with three 10-year renewal options, from Federal Business Centers, which owns half of Raritan Center; the other half is owned by Summit Associates of Woodbridge. The contaminant on the site is arsenic in silt dredged from the Raritan River from the 20's through the 40's and dumped on the site. The arsenic was used by the Army for rodent control. The cost of the cleanup, whose plan has been approved by the state's Department of Environmental Protection, is estimated at $5 million, which RPS will recoup as a result of the tax abatement.
The cleanup plan permits capping the site with an impervious surface. The foundation of the new building, along with the blacktop that will cover much of the site for parking, will serve as the cap.
RPS became interested in the site in 1992 because of its location. It is accessible to a host of highways, including the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstates 95 and 287. The site also is close to colleges, like Rutgers and Middlesex County College, which can provide a labor pool willing to work part-time and at odd hours, said James M. Maxwell, director of real estate for RPS. But "the environmental problems stalled us from moving forward," he said.
IN the intervening years RPS looked at about 75 other sites and winnowed the list to two, both free of environmental concerns. With those sites, however, "there was not as much municipal support as with the Woodbridge site, which provides us with the lowest operating cost because of the highway access," said Mr. Maxwell.
But getting the project to this point required all the economic redevelopment stars -- from financial incentives to regulatory changes -- to be in alignment for reclaiming so-called brownfields like the Woodbridge site.
From a real estate perspective "the site's location was so good that the parties involved were willing to work together," said Paul D. Cohen, executive vice president at SBWE Inc., a commercial brokerage with offices in Hasbrouck Heights and Edison, who represented RPS in the transaction.
There has been an ongoing effort in New Jersey to make the regulatory climate more flexible and offer more incentives to reuse land left from the state's industrial past. In the last 13 years the state has overseen the cleanup of 9,500 to 10,000 sites, according to the Site Remediation Program, which is part of the state's Department of Environmental Protection.
Yet nearly 10,000 contaminated sites -- excluding those on the Federal Superfund list -- remain. Of them, about 1,130 are brownfields -- which the state defines as former commercial or industrial sites that are underutilized or abandoned, contain known or perceived contaminants -- that are being cleaned and redeveloped.
The latest change in the state's environmental cleanup laws came last January with the passage of the Brownfields and Contaminated Sites Redemption Act. It provides, among other incentives, matching grants to small developers who test new technologies for sealing off or eliminating pollution, as well as reimbursement for up to 75 percent of the cleanup cost. Projects must generate new tax revenue that exceeds the cost of the cleanup to qualify for the reimbursement incentive.
But the most important provision of the 1998 law is that it protects buyers of tainted sites from private lawsuits related to past contamination problems if they agree to clean the properties according to state requirements.
Essentially, the state requires different standards depending on the planned new use of the site, with a residential reuse requiring a higher level of remediation than commercial or industrial uses. The standards also permit alternative methods, including impermeable caps to stop waste from seeping out instead of requiring the removal of such industrial residue.
Once the site is cleaned according to its standards, the state's Department of Environmental Protection will agree not to sue. The law also exempts buyers from any new cleanup costs once state environmental officials approve the cleanup job.
"The granting of a covenant not to sue is helpful in convincing lenders to lend and raising the consciousness that brownfields are O.K," said Richard Greenberg, president of Environmental Waste Management Associates, an environmental consulting firm in Parsippany.
FOR RPS, that safeguard was crucial in its decision to go forward with the Woodbridge project. "It gave us comfort that the liability issue would be manageable," Mr. Maxwell said, adding: "The law also lets us know exactly what we need to do to clean the site."
Jerry C. Swart, RPS's director of environmental services, said earlier changes in the state's regulations that permitted the capping of contaminants on sites also made the property's redevelopment more feasible.
Then the issue became making it more economically feasible. Six years ago the cost of the cleanup would have exceeded the value of the real estate, said Mr. Cohen, the broker. "The key to any of this is getting the economics to work," he noted.
The site is in an area Woodbridge designated in 1996 as in need of redevelopment. As such the township tapped an amended 1992 state law that allowed it to use the abatement to help develop projects in that area. The abatement on the property, which now generates $15,000 in annual taxes, is structured as a payment in lieu of taxes. That means Woodbridge will receive annual payments from RPS based on 15 percent of the fair market value of the rent for the building. Those payments are to begin at an annual $410,204 and increase to $717,009 over the 30 years of the lease, or a total of $16.9 million. Conventional taxes would have yielded $21.9 million over this period.
James M. Davey, business administrator for Woodbridge, said the $5 million difference will be offset by the fact that RPS will use that $5 million to clean the property, which when redeveloped will create 1,400 jobs and increase in value. In addition, he said, RPS has agreed to make a $1.5 million contribution to Woodbridge to support community projects.
The new RPS building, which will serve the New York metropolitan area, initially will process 35,000 packages an hour, and grow to 45,000 as the structure expands. It will be the largest "hub" in the company's network of 27 hubs and 343 pick-up and delivery terminals, most of them in the United States, with some in Canada. Mr. Maxwell said the first 435,000-square-foot phase will meet the company's expansion needs for the next five years.
The RPS parcel sits within a 600-acre redevelopment area, one of two such areas in the southern half of the township; the second comprises 200 acres. Both are polluted former industrial sites.
Mayor McGreevey said the new RPS building "has triggered substantial commercial interest in adjacent sites in the redevelopment area," adding that he was hopeful similar projects would follow.

The Movies Are the New Stars of the Mall

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
THE recent selection of developers for three state-owned properties that once housed retarded and mentally ill patients could bring hundreds of residential units and thousands of square feet of industrial and office space to western Suffolk County, where the three sites totaling 1,107 acres are situated.
The parcels -- all of which all contain former hospital buildings, some closed for years -- comprise 655 acres at the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in Islip; 408 acres at the Long Island Developmental Center, which straddles Melville and Dix Hills, and 44 acres at the former Central Islip Psychiatric Center. 
 "These properties, which have been sitting there doing nothing, will now be put into the hands of the local communities that will have the power to decide what they would like on the properties," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. The corporation, which is the state's economic development agency, is selling off surplus hospital sites throughout the state.
"We are returning mothballed properties, which are costing the state millions of dollars a year to maintain, back to productive use," Mr. Gargano said.
The state is selling off only the unused portions of the hospital properties. At Pilgrim, which covers a total of 778 acres, about 20 buildings will be kept for various uses including patient care.
At the 458-acre Developmental Center, 50 acres containing 34 group homes serving 350 mentally retarded people and the Sagamore Children's Psychiatric Center will also remain state property.
But in Central Islip, the sale of the 44 acres will mean the last phaseout of the psychiatric hospital, which once housed more than 10,000 patients on 1,000 acres. Most of its buildings were purchased by the New York Institute of Technology in the mid-80's for use as a college campus.
Developers for the three properties were selected in a bidding process. Reckson Associates Realty Corporation of Melville won the Pilgrim State parcel with a bid of $32 million and SBJ Associates, a partnership of the Benjamin Development Company of Garden City and Jobco Inc. of Great Neck, secured the Developmental Center for $16.1 million. Arlen Contracting Corporation, which is owned by Benjamin Development, made the $2.22 million high bid for the Central Islip site.
The total of $50.3 million will more than offset about $39 million in outstanding bonds on the three properties, which must be paid off. The sales still must be ratified by Empire State's board of directors, which is scheduled to meet next Thursday.
The properties are being sold subject to the existing zoning. The zoning at the Developmental Center site in Melville and Dix Hills allows one house on two acres; Pilgrim State in Islip has one-acre residential zoning and the Central Islip parcel is zoned for institutional use.
DEVELOPERS must also address environmental issues -- the Pilgrim State and Developmental Center sites are over groundwater recharge areas, for example -- and they must demolish existing buildings, most of which contain asbestos.
The $16.1 million offered for the 408 acres at the Developmental Center comes to just under $40,000 an acre in Melville and Dix Hills. "But you have to realize that this property is being sold on an 'as is, where is' basis, so our bid had to be structured based on our risks," said Michael F. Puntillo, Jobco's vice president.
The Pataki administration's program to dispose of the state's many surplus hospital properties was started last July, when 12 sites including the three on Long Island were offered for sale through a sealed bid process with a November deadline.
The 12 -- in 10 counties and all at one time used for long-term care -- total 3,200 acres and contain more than 10 million square feet of buildings. To date, only four bids -- the three on the Long Island properties and a fourth for the 131,000-square-foot Bernard Fineson Developmental Center Corona Unit on 1.22 acres in Queens, for which the high bid was $4.61 million -- have been accepted for ratification.
Two other bids, one for the Hudson River Psychiatric Center in Poughkeepsie, the other for the Wilton Developmental Center in Saratoga County are being reviewed.
The only other state-owned facility on Long Island, the 596-acre Kings Park Psychiatric Center in Smithtown, has not yet been approved for sale because extensive environmental reviews are still under way, Mr. Gargano said.
The Developmental Center in Melville and Dix Hills, which is surrounded by single-family houses, has been recommended for housing.
A task force for the Pilgrim property has recommended a mix of office, industrial and residential development along with recreational facilities. And in Central Islip, recommendations include, among others, educational facilities, a health-care facility, a nursing home and recycling the three existing buildings for housing for the elderly.
At the Pilgrim site, the one-acre residential zoning insures that a developer who wants to build anything other than low-density housing must secure approvals from the Town of Islip, said Thomas A. Isles, the town's chief planner and a member of a task force convened three years ago to study potential uses for the property.
The task force recommendation was for 500,000 square feet of office space, 360,000 square feet of industrial buildings, 90,000 square feet of commercial space, a million- square-foot recreational center, athletic fields and a nine-hole golf course, Mr. Isles said. A 100-acre portion of the 655-acre site lying east of the Sagtikos Parkway was proposed for up to 500 housing units.
The 70-year-old Pilgrim State Hospital, with its imposing but grim red-brick buildings, was once the largest psychiatric center in the Western world, serving as many as 13,875 patients at its peak in 1954. The hospital population is now just over 1,000. In 1983, considerable community controversy surrounded the conversion of one of its buildings to a prison. One of Mario M. Cuomo's campaign promises was to close the prison if elected, a promise he kept in 1985.
For Reckson, which specializes in office and industrial projects, the Pilgrim site offers tremendous opportunity, said Gregg M.Rechler, its executive vice president.
"This was the last major piece we have seen come on the market in western Suffolk since my grandfather purchased the 600-acre ITT/Radio Free Europe site in 1961," Mr. Rechler said. Now called the John V. N. Klein Industrial Park after a former Suffolk County Executive, it is now one of the largest industrial parks in the country.
MR. RECHLER declined to be specific about the company's plans for Pilgrim, citing the need to meet first with town officials and local residents.
But Reckson, which is a real estate investment trust, has announced it intends to invest about $250 million in the property, which is midway between Melville and Hauppauge. "Hauppauge is the best industrial market on Long Island, and Melville the best office market, so with this location a tremendous synergy could be created on this site," Mr. Rechler said.
Kurt Mohr, the vice president of Benjamin Development, also declined to discuss plans for the Central Islip and Developmental Center properties pending the ratification vote Thursday.
The Long Island Developmental Center, which opened in 1965 and housed 1,768 mentally retarded people at its peak in 1972, closed in 1993 with the exception of the small residential buildings on the eastern and western ends of the property and the children's hospital on the easterly end.
The property being sold is mostly open land with a heavily treed perimeter.
In 1993, the Cuomo administration proposed leasing 53.7 acres on the eastern end of the property to Olympus America, the camera company, which wanted to build a headquarters of up to 292,000 square feet. But the state withdrew its proposal in a settlement of a lawsuit filed by the Town of Huntington, which contended that it violated local zoning. Olympus ultimately built its headquarters elsewhere in Melville.
Subsequently, the Pataki administration gave residents, represented by the Triangle Civic Association in Melville and the House Beautiful at Dix Hills Homeowners Association four seats on a 17-member task force tostudy alternative uses.
Two plans developed by Saccardi & Schiff, land planners in White Plains called for about 1,200 units of housing, 85 percent of which would be for people 55 or older, with one including a golf course. Richard Machtay, the Huntington Planning Director, said he assumed that one of the two plans would be implemented. "But," he added, "until someone comes to the town with an application I don't know what will happen."
"What this story is all about," said Sheila Saks, president of House Beautiful, "is protecting your most important investment -- your home and your community.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In / Freeport, L.I.;
Maritime Breezes, Canals and Diversity

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
UNLIKE areas of Long Island that are homogeneous or nearly so, the maritime and suburban Village of Freeport on Nassau County's South Shore is a community that takes its identity, in part, from its economic and ethnic mix.
"This is basically a middle-class community of two-income households with a fairly high level of disposable income," said Mayor William F. Glacken. "At the same time I am proud to say we have 62 distinct cultures and everybody gets along. There's a cosmopolitan air that is very unusual for Long Island." 
 Longtime residents say Freeport is an upwardly striving village, a model community for ethnic harmony that is unabashedly rolling out the red carpet for newcomers drawn to a housing market that offers real bargains in detached homes, condominiums and co-ops.
The village is a place where the pale light of winter glints off canals and adds a deep, tawny gold tone to wide open wetland spaces, and where a village-operated power company charges rates that are half what most Long Island residents pay. Freeport also has its own municipal water company and village police force.
John Jeffries, the manager of the village's recreation center, described Freeport as "a multiracial community that, quite frankly, is always looking for people who can add something."
"It's the place of the future," he said. "It's how it's going to be and how it should be."
The message may be getting through. Larry Grebinar, a sales agent at Century 21 O'Connor & Matthews in Freeport, said the housing market was strong last year. "Prices are going up and most neighborhoods are improving," he said. "People are making big investments to update and improve their homes."
In the low to moderately priced housing market, detached houses predominate, in styles ranging from older, roomy colonials in inland areas to Cape Cods, bungalows, ranches and eclectics nearer the water, including some dwellings whose back doors open directly onto a canal's bulkhead.
Unlike many costly areas in Nassau where $200,000 buys virtually nothing, in Freeport it is still enough for a house with three bedrooms, one-and-a-half to two baths and a swatch of lawn.
According to village figures, there are about 1,000 co-op units, 240 condominiums and more than 2,000 rental apartments in Freeport.
A two-tier for-sale apartment market is divided between older former rental buildings near downtown, with two-bedroom units for as little as $55,000, and two-bedroom units for around $135,000 in newer co-ops and condominiums built in the mid-80's.
At one of the larger co-ops, the 160-unit, canalside Anchorage at Freeport built in 1985 on 14 acres with views over the Cow Meadow wetlands, a duplex sold in December for $159,500. Monthly maintenance of $711 includes real estate taxes.
The 17-building, gated complex includes a clubhouse, two tennis courts and an outdoor swimming pool. There are 80 boat slips with 24-hour security for residents only with an annual rent of $40 per foot of width of the boat.
The largest condominium is the 152-unit Wharfside Condominiums, where prices range from $80,000 for a one-bedroom unit to $130,000 for a two-bedroom.
SUNRISE HIGHWAY and Merrick Road, the main east-west thoroughfares, are fast-moving, nondescript commercial strips, but with a full array of retail services including a shopping mall, Meadowbrook Commons. There are more shops on Main Street, which runs north to south.
But these road corridors are far less evocative of Freeport's essence than Woodcleft Avenue's Nautical Mile. There, restaurants, marinas, and a slew of water-related enterprises line the canalside avenue, which ends at a scenic village park looking out to wetland islands.
There are ballfields, basketball courts and playgrounds at four village parks. Two of them -- Martin Luther King Jr. Park and Randall Park -- have outdoor swimming pools.
The village recreation center, a large complex that almost looks like a high school, has one indoor and three outdoor pools, a gym, saunas, an ice rink, community meeting rooms and a wealth of sports and other programs "from the cradle to the grave," said Mr. Jeffries, the manager. The annual family fee is $295 for residents and $460 for nonresidents.
Cow Neck Park, which is owned by Nassau County, has a nature trail with vistas reminiscent of a miniaturized Florida Everglades, minus alligators.
The park also has ballfields and handball, basketball and tennis courts. County residents pay $10 for a three-year pass to gain admission.
About 7,350 students attend Freeport public schools and there is a community night school for teen-agers with 236 enrollees.
The district has one high school, one junior high for grades 7 and 8, a separate school for grades 5 and 6, four magnet schools for grades 1 through 4 and one school for prekindergarten and kindergarten.
Some 87 percent of the 364 June graduates at Freeport High School went on to higher education. Average S.A.T. scores for the 1996-1997 academic year, the most recent scores available, were 456 in verbal and 448 in math, both about 40 points below state and national averages for that year.
The high school offers a science research program in cooperation with the State University of New York at Stony Brook and was state champion last year in Future Problem Solving contest, a title it has won every year since 1988.
The contest, which was initiated in 1973, engages students in solving community problems involving such matters as a cashless society, increasing life spans and medical ethics.
The high school was also a pioneer in establishing a distance-learning center enabling students to take courses at other high schools by television hook-up. It offers eight advanced placement courses, including calculus, computer science, biology and physics.
A magnet-school program allows parents to choose from among four elementary schools, each with programs built around distinct themes. The Archer Street School, for example, is called a Microsociety and Multimedia school where students produce videotapes, publish a newspaper and work in a general store that serves customers in "Archerville."
The Bayview School for the Arts and Sciences turns classrooms into studios, to encourage children to become professional artists and into laboratories designed to pique the curiosity of budding scientists.
The Leo F. Giblyn School teaches globalism, and the staff of the New Visions School of Exploration and Discovery is trained at the Brooklyn Children's Museum, whose consultants help the school develop special programs for young aspiring explorers. The overwhelming majority of children are accepted at the school parents select.
Beginning in prekindergarten, selected students take part in a dual language program in which Spanish-speaking and English-speaking students alternate learning separately and together. A goal is fluency in both languages for all students.
FREEPORT'S colorful history is on display at the Freeport Historical Museum on South Main Street, which is open on Sundays from April through December and by appointment. Admission is free but donations are appreciated.
In Colonial times, the Freeport area was a sparsely settled outback of the Town of Hempstead. It was originally called Raynor South or Raynor Town after the family that settled there in 1659. The current name was adopted in 1853 to commemorate the area's history as a free port of entry for vessels seeking to avoid landing fees in New York City and Sag Harbor.
"They found that if they sailed through Jones Inlet to Freeport then there was no charge," said Isabelle Drach, the president of the Freeport Historical Society. Jones Inlet is the most westerly inlet piercing Long Island's South Shore barrier islands to reach the Atlantic Ocean.
During prohibition, rumrunners in fast boats sped from the Woodcleft Canal through the inlet to meet suppliers.
By the end of the 19th century, wetland-filling on Freeport's low-lying and marshy southern edge had created home sites, and a system of canals was in place. The village incorporated in 1892.
Freeport was a favorite of vaudevillians, who founded the Long Island Good Hearted Thespian Society in the 20's, said Mrs. Drach, the historian. But the most fondly remembered celebrity-in-residence was the late Guy Lombardo, the legendary band leader who waved to children as he motored his mahogany speedboat, Tempo, from Woodcleft Canal to engagements at Jones Beach. A street along the east side of Woodcleft Canal is named for Mr. Lombardo, who died in 1977.
Playland Park, a smaller version of Coney Island, drew crowds until it burned down in the early 1930's.
After World War II, new housing and new residents, including many from Queens and Brooklyn, transformed Freeport. A period of decline in the late 60's and 70's struck the once-bustling downtown area, but even chronic flooding couldn't stem development in shoreline areas.
"I kind of resented the development," said Barbara Jagnow, owner of Otto's Sea Grill on Woodcleft Avenue. "It used to be you could see the Jones Beach tower from here. You can't anymore. But it's still the best place on Long Island. I wouldn't trade it."

What is planned, said Mayor William F. Glacken, is a $5 million project to raise the avenue by two feet, replace sidewalks with brick walkways and add ornamental lighting and a canalside esplanade. Business owners will be asked to do village-assisted improvement projects of their own. "Once it's all done it's going to revitalize the waterfront," said Mayor Glacken. He said a major project to revitalize the downtown area was next.

Furnishing a Home As a Scavenger Hunt

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL 

 BODY:
FURNISHING a place in New York City is not like furnishing a place in the suburbs. People don't zip over to the nearest megastore and load up their oversized vehicles with rugs, tables and chairs. Nor do they spend summer weekends cruising by yard sales in search of wicker chairs and mixing bowls. Like everything else, matters here are more complicated. And often more expensive. When a tiny table at a chic little joint on Bond Street is $600, the cost of living seems unfairly high. In the presence of so many objects costing so much, it is easy to feel impoverished, even on incomes that would be considered ample anyplace else.
But to Alec Massey and Diena ten Broeke, who live near Lincoln Center in a one-bedroom apartment on West 63d Street with their 2-year-old daughter, Elsie, furnishing their home is just a game, a big scavenger hunt in a place with great pickings. 
 It's not a matter of refusing to buy retail. For them, even wholesale is no bargain. They buy second-hand, choosing tables, beds, bureaus, clothes and the like that are in good condition but for whatever reason no longer wanted. Ms. ten Broeke, wearing black leggings that cost 75 cents and a striped turtleneck that cost a quarter, says she never buys new clothes. That's one of her tactics for saving money in a city that seems to suck $20 bills out of pockets like so much lint into a vacuum cleaner.
Another has to do with bypassing those small luxuries that add up. She would never, for instance, buy a cup of coffee at Starbucks, and not because she is rebelling against the homogenization of the urban landscape. It's simple economics. At $1.40 a cup, she says, she can do better buying and grinding her own beans.
Ms. ten Broeke, who works in the box office at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, and Mr. Massey, who sings opera with small regional companies and models for print advertising, say they spend between $5,000 and $6,000 a year on furniture, clothes, food, travel and entertainment -- basically, everything but rent. In exchange for the apartment, Mr. Massey works as the superintendent of the 25-unit building.
BECAUSE they spend so carefully, Ms. ten Broeke says, she has been able to invest about 70 percent of her $27,000 salary in mutual funds. (Naturally, when she goes to her brokerage company's office, or anyplace else that is not miles away, she walks. To her, buses, cabs and subways are an unnecessary expense.)
Recently, they discovered the glories of Loot, a newspaper costing $1 that offers hundreds upon hundreds of objects for sale, all listed at no expense to the seller. It's the Manhattan version of a yard sale, filled with possibilities for furnishing apartments cheaply.
"They're selling stuff that they would normally sell on the front lawn," Ms. ten Broeke says. From a recent issue, they managed to buy a new bedroom set for Elsie, with two beds and a bureau, for $500; a Murphy bed for their living room that folds down with one simple hand motion, for $800; and a marble-topped bistro table with two wrought-iron chairs, for $100. Their second child, a daughter, is due in March, and the Murphy bed has allowed them to create the space they will need in a living room that has only one object bought in a regular store: a Chinese rug purchased on sale at Macy's.
Getting what they want for less, Ms. ten Broeke says, "is very much part of a life style." When she was pregnant with Elsie, she posted notices in nursery schools looking for second-hand equipment, and was deluged with possibilities. "People wanted to give their cribs and bedding a good home," she says. They paid $150, rather than the $700 it would have cost new, for a crib and $20 for an almost-new stroller.
Clearly, the hunt is something they enjoy. Mr. Massey holds up a down jacket from London Fog that he found for Elsie for $5 at the Salvation Army on West 46th Street and 10th Avenue. "We call it the mall," Ms. ten Broeke says. When he has to wear a suit for modeling, Mr. Massey says, he dresses in a custom-made suit from Hong Kong that he bought for $45. "Everything we have is second-hand," he says. "There's no reason to buy new. I'll get a $250 sweater there for $8."
Is it any surprise, then, to discover that they met nearly a decade ago at a sample sale? Ms. ten Broeke was working as a sales clerk, and Mr. Massey was looking. He bought two sweaters that day, for $50 each, and they have been together ever since.

Pregnant (Yet Again), but Hardly Barefoot

BYLINE: By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
LET me make one thing perfectly clear. I am not having a baby.
My husband once entertained notions of raising a large brood, but that was before he became a parent. Once that happened and we saw what we were up against, we settled on one hard-and-fast rule: never let them outnumber you. 
 A lot of people, apparently, have not heard this rule. There's some major breeding going on in suburbia these days, at least in my little corner. Two summers ago, a woman on the other side of the street had her third baby. Last summer, the woman across from her had one. Another is due any day, and one more is expected this summer. That puts the fertility rate at this end of the block up to 2.6, meaning that we all have .6 of a child over the national average.
Now demographers tell me that it's hard to bump the fertility rate up like that -- at least when you talk about the entire United States. But if you look at the kind of people who live around me -- baby boomers in their late 30's or early 40's -- the increase in fertility is rampant. Stephanie Ventura, a demographer for the National Center for Health Statistics, crunched a few numbers for me and discovered an amazing thing. The number of third babies born to women aged 35 to 39 jumped 29 percent from 1990 to 1997, and the number of third babies born to women aged 40 to 44 jumped 57 percent.
In other words, the baby boom, which one might have expected to stop booming once it reached a certain age, booms on.
Now the only reason I can imagine these people are all producing third-borns is that their first two children are not sufficiently challenging. Either that, or they have not -- like myself -- long ago reached their level of incompetence. All I can say is that, if I had one more set of snow boots and mittens to be responsible for, I think I would just go berserk and take the whole family with me.
It could be that I am a bit too tightly strung to deal with children in vast quantities. (It could be that I am too tightly strung to deal with children in limited quantities.) I have noticed a sort of nonchalance that parents of large flocks exhibit. One friend of mine, who is expecting his third in March, called me up to relate a third-baby story he'd heard from another father of three. "If your first baby puts dirt in his mouth, you run to the hospital," he said. "If your third baby puts dirt in his mouth, your reaction is, 'It better not be my potting soil!' "
This very same expectant father talked my husband into going to a movie theater 30 minutes away -- just hours after a recent snowstorm. Although the snow had turned to slush, I was certain the expedition would end in both their deaths, and leave all those children -- born and unborn -- fatherless. When I asked his (pregnant) wife what she thought about the outing, she just laughed and said, "I'm not a worrier." You see?
Of course, these heavy breeders must have their reasons. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University who is an expert on New Jersey demographics, thinks it may be pent-up demand. You know, the dream deferred: all these women were so busy building careers in their 20's that their mothering instincts are now boomeranging. Michael Mulvey, an assistant professor of marketing at Rutgers, says it could be an upper-middle-class status symbol. The third child is "not exactly bought by money, but it says something about your financial status," he suggests.
But for a real expert, I talked to Gail Wagner, owner of an upscale baby outfitter in Upper Montclair called Baby Boom. When she started the store 10 years ago, babies were hot, but the trend was expected to peter out by the mid-90's. It didn't, thanks to people like my neighbors, who are having more children later in life. "Not just thirds," she says. "We see people having fourths."
Reasons? "Part of it's the economy," Ms. Wagner says. "Things are good." Then there are people with two boys hoping for a girl, and vice versa. Second marriages account for some of it. My favorite reason: it's a way to keep a full-time nanny. "It's almost better to keep having children so you can hold onto your help," Ms. Wagner explains.
One neighbor put it this way: "If we waited any longer, we'd probably never do it. And we weren't ready to decide that." I'm still trying to figure that one out. Of course, you can't really expect logic from people who voluntarily go back to the diapering stage when their kids are old enough to toddle downstairs by themselves on Saturday mornings and turn on the television.

HEADLINE: When Welfare Ends and Work Steps In

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
RHONDA McFADDEN rises before dawn, readies her children for school and, joining others in Yonkers who are on their way to work, walks with a sense of pride to the bus stop.
In Port Chester at the same early hour, Evelyn Rivera kisses her 12-year-old daughter's cheek, steps jauntily into her 1990 Pontiac Grand Prix and heads for a nearby Interstate, similarly pleased to be on her way to work. 
 Both women -- former welfare mothers -- used to rely on public assistance and Federal food stamps but recently joined the growing number of welfare recipients entering Westchester's work force.
The 29-year-old Ms. McFadden is one of 1,277 welfare clients who were required last year to find jobs under the county's newest effort to reduce its public assistance rolls. The mother of four began work last year as an administrative assistant earning $8.25 an hour.
"I have to keep reminding myself how I got here," she said. "I have to tell myself, 'Wow, I really made it off welfare!' "
Ms. Rivera, who is 32 and returned to school seven years ago under a county program designed to put welfare mothers to work, has since earned an associate's degree in accounting. Several years ago, she began work as an accounts payable clerk for ANS Communications, an Internet company in Elmsford, which has moved to Purchase and is now called Uunet Technology. She has received three promotions, so that she now earns $26,500 a year.
"I have been wanting this for a long, long time," she said recently.
Both women's stories follow President Clinton's decision announced in August 1996 to "end welfare as we know it" and a Federal law passed that December to limit public assistance benefits for most welfare recipients to five years. Some states, but not New York, have adopted more restrictive time limits. (Florida and Virginia limit welfare benefits to 2 years, and Connecticut has a 22-month limit.)
The county, hoping to remove another 1,335 public assistance cases to save taxpayers $10.4 million this year, recently announced that it would spend $3 million to hire three employment concerns that specialize in finding jobs for welfare clients.
The companies -- two private ones (America Works and Opportunity America) and a nonprofit one (Westchester Community Opportunity Program) -- were awarded performance-based contracts to provide job counseling, pre-employment training and job placement along with intensive follow-up programs to insure that people keep their jobs.
"The point is to teach people to be self-sufficient so they can get off welfare and stay off," County Executive Andrew J. Spano said. "Not only will these firms find people jobs but also they will teach them skills for life: how to prepare a resume, prepare for an interview, how to keep a job."
Mr. Spano described the county's latest program as "a get-tough policy with compassion." In addition to job training and placement, Westchester also provides transitional child care allotments for mothers returning to work and Medicaid benefits for up to a year after the start of employment.
The companies placing welfare clients in jobs will be paid in increments, with the final checks written by the county on a per client basis only when a person has remained on the job for six months.
"The good part is that this gives the vendor an incentive to be successful," said Dennis J. Packard, a deputy commissioner for the county's Department of Social Services. "You can't raise the flag and declare victory once they get the job. You have to make sure they keep the job."
Opportunity America placed 87 percent of its Westchester clients in jobs last year, saving the county about $607,000 in 1998. For this year, the county will pay Opportunity America $1.9 million to serve clients referred by the Yonkers, White Plains and Mount Vernon offices of the Department of Social Services. America Works will be paid $1 million to find jobs for welfare clients termed the most difficult to place. And the nonprofit Westchester Community Opportunity Services will be paid $100,000 to work with clients served by the Peekskill office.
"There's clearly a need for a strong and focused methodology enabling welfare clients to transition to jobs," said Richard T. Schwartz, Opportunity America's president and a former senior adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Schwartz designed New York City's welfare-to-work program before starting his own company two years ago.
Ms. McFadden, who began her employment training last year with Opportunity America, which is based in Manhattan and has offices in Mount Vernon, Brooklyn and Newark, was eventually hired full time by the company. As an administrative assistant, she answers phones, serves as a data entry clerk and does other clerical duties.
Like many other welfare mothers, Ms. McFadden never completed her high school education. She left high school after the 11th grade, giving birth to her first child when she was 16 and her second three years later. During those years, her main concern was whether her young family's food stamps would last until the end of the month.
Now, thinking ahead, she said, "Maybe someday my children will go to college and have even better jobs." She is married now and has two more children.
Ms. Rivera was raised by her mother, whose sole income was a welfare check. Now a single mother herself, Ms. Rivera returned to school seven years ago after a letter arrived from the County Department of Social Services, telling her that her case was being re-evaluated and that she must either go to school for career training or get a job. Her benefits were about to end.
As Kevin P. Mahon, the county's Commissioner for Social Services, explained it, his department's mission has been changing, with the overall number of those receiving public assistance dropping steadily since 1992. The goal no longer is to help the needy receive benefits but to help them not receive them, the Commissioner said.
Deputy Commissioner Packard said that in August 1992 there were 11,984 active welfare cases on the county's rolls; five years later in August, that number was 10,172. The latest count, for November 1998, was 8,695 cases.
Despite the county's position on welfare, which in effect says that everyone capable of working must do so, there will likely always be some unemployable people, Commissioner Mahon said. For example, the current caseload in the county's Mount Vernon, White Plains and Yonkers offices is 8,075, but of those, only 5,217 are considered active cases. Some welfare customers are in drug or alcohol treatment, some have medical or psychiatric problems and some have children younger than 1, rendering them ineligible for employment.
In recent years, part of the effort to reduce the welfare rolls has focused on reducing fraud. Statewide, New York's crackdown on welfare fraud has netted more than $440 million since January 1995, according to figures released in the fall by Gov. George E. Pataki.
Under New York's Fugitive Felon Match, a program of reform legislation begun in 1997, taxpayers in the state saved $10 million when nearly 1,800 people were taken off public assistance. The Fugitive Felon program also resulted in 255 arrests of felons and parole and probation violators.
Under that program, the state matches its welfare rolls against warrant lists compiled by the State Division of Criminal Justice Services. Names of people who are receiving welfare and are wanted as felons or are parole or probation violators are referred to the fraud units in their respective social services districts. Since the program began late last year, 1,787 people have had their cases closed.
Separate county figures for saving under the Fugitive Felon program were not available. But the state's fingerprinting system, which is used to ferret out those who are receiving benefits in more than one jurisdiction, resulted in 2,726 case closings and a saving of $5.9 million for Westchester, Jack Madden, a spokesman for the Governor, said recently.
Under another program, the Front End Detection System, which sends workers into the field to verify the eligibility of recipients, Westchester closed 1,867 cases, saving $10.6 million from April 1997 to last March. In a related effort, the county's Social Services Department also runs computer matches of its recipients with databases of agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and state unemployment offices.
The county's workfare program, which began in 1989, requires able-bodied welfare recipients not yet ready for full employment to spend 20 hours a week in workfare, or as it is more formally known, Pride in Work public improvement projects, to retain their subsistence eligibility.
Under state law, welfare clients can be ordered to help county, city, town and nonprofit organizations perform clerical, maintenance, security, painting, repair and debris removal jobs, among other things.
The philosophy behind the latest initiatives in Westchester to train able-bodied welfare recipients for employment is that rather that taking advantage of government largess "most people want to achieve independence and take pride in what they do," said Mr. Schwartz of Opportunity America.
Lee A. Bowes, chief executive officer of America Works, which has offices in Manhattan, Albany, Indianapolis and Baltimore, observed that in a tight labor market the newest laws requiring most welfare clients to work also benefit employers who are seeking access to a broader labor pool.

HEADLINE: Finding a Home Inside the Golden Door

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
BEAMING with pride of ownership, Jose and Paula Lora stood before their dark-red, split-level home in Teaneck, N.J., last weekend, a long way from the city of Santiago in the Dominican Republic and -- if not geographically, at least in their minds -- nearly as far from the cramped Bronx rental apartments in which they had lived since arriving in the United States a decade ago.
The house cost $170,000 and, after several years of saving, the Loras managed to make a down payment of $25,000. "It has four bedrooms, a study and a small basement for the kids to watch TV," Mr. Lora said, "you know, to do the mess, the games, the toys." Jorge is 9, and Ruth is 8. 
 The Loras occupy one band on the spectrum of experience faced by immigrants in dealing with the intricacies of real estate in the New York area.
In a three-story walk-up on Orchard Street in Manhattan's Chinatown, a 37-year-old man from China's Fujian province hides his face behind a newspaper. His name is Mr. Liu; he did not want to give his full name. Mr. Liu occupies a far distant band on the spectrum.
He is one of eight men who share a 12- by 12-foot space, sleeping on slapdash, raw-lumber bunk beds. Together, the eight men pay $640 a month for the room, as do eight men living in each of the two other rooms in the same apartment -- all sharing the filth-encrusted bathroom and kitchen. There are about 70 people living in the building's three apartments.
Mr. Liu has lived there six of his 10 years in America. "Not used to it," he said through an interpreter, "but what can I do?"
For all sorts of reasons -- both imposed and, to a degree, self-imposed -- some immigrants succeed in their quest for decent housing in and around New York City, some don't.
In effect, the tens of thousands of newcomers -- and their numbers are increasing -- must navigate a nuanced web of factors in finding a home: the language barrier, jarring cultural differences, the complexity of the rental and mortgage-acquisition systems, lack of credit histories, lack of banking services in their communities, incomes off the books, the driving urge for family reunification, loyalty to two countries, sending money home, being treated as intruders, racial discrimination and being cheated -- sometimes, even, by their own countrymen.
Through all that, more and more new Americans -- like the Loras -- make it.
In 1996 (the last year for which data were available), according to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, 37.7 percent, or 1,048,000, of the 2,780,000 households in the city were headed by immigrants. That represented an increase from 1991, when 33.2 percent, or 924,600, of all households were headed by immigrants. And over the same period, the number of immigrants who purchased homes increased from 257,000 to 276,000, so that, as of 1996, 26.3 percent of all immigrants in the city were home owners.
There are no numbers to gauge the impact of immigration on the city's suburbs. But one hint is that the Loras now belong to the year-old, dozen-member Dominican Home Owners Association of Bergen County, N.J. "We were living in the Bronx, near Lehman College," Mr. Lora said. "Our rent was $550. It went to like $650. Then we moved, and we paid there $720 -- the last rent we paid."
Like so many other tenants, Mr. Lora -- who in 10 years here has worked his way from restaurant cashier to accountant -- did the math and wondered: Why pay someone else? That was four years ago.
Not that it was easy securing a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 8.5 percent. "At the beginning, they made life impossible," Mr. Lora said of the lender. "We dealt with the mortgage company for five months."
Asked if he thought he was being discriminated against, Mr. Lora said, "I don't think it was that."
"It was the first time we bought a house," he said. "We didn't know how. At one point you think maybe because you are Mr. Lora, not Mr. Johnson, that they are making life impossible to give you the loan. Now that I know the process, I would know if they are trying to bother me or if they just need to know."
For lack of understanding of the system, Mr. Lora said, many immigrants "don't have the documentation together."
"They think the person they tried to get the loan from is trying to take advantage," he said. "I don't say that doesn't happen, but sometimes it's misunderstanding."
Or utter unfamiliarity.
"There is no tradition of mortgages in India," said Vanitha Venugopal, housing director in the office of Queens Borough President Claire Shulman -- a point made by representatives of other ethnic groups.
"We come from a cash-based economy," said Hugh Hamilton, a Guyanese native, speaking about members of the Caribbean community. "Most Caribbeans are unaware of the criteria that must be met in order to qualify for mortgages." Mr. Hamilton is legislative director for City Councilman Lloyd Henry, a Brooklyn Democrat.
In November, during a conference on immigrant housing at the New York University School of Law, one participant raised his hand to say, "When Latin American immigrants see 30-year mortgages, we get scared and limit ourselves to short-term loans" -- sometimes from unscrupulous lenders who, knowing that the buyer knows no better, charge exorbitant rates. Sometimes the real estate agent and the mortgage broker are in cahoots, and the guileless buyer appreciates what seems like one-stop shopping. Victor Morisete-Romero, executive director of the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans, a social service agency, said immigrants often pay 24 percent over a seven-year term.
Cultural norms "often clash with the American-dream mentality," he said. "In the Dominican Republic, when you buy a home the deal is done; there aren't additional expenses. Here, with taxes, water bills, fire inspections, boiler inspections, building regulations, amortizing the mortgage, they look at a $140,000 investment for 30 years at 7.65 percent, do the numbers and basically say they don't really own it."
That is, if they have got that far in the mortgage-buying process -- no mean feat for most immigrants.
Some newcomers, particularly professionals and established business people, arrive in the United States with considerable wealth, education, connections and access to the system.
Others, arriving for the raft of reasons that have impelled immigration to America for generations -- political, religious, racial persecution; yearnings for a better life, hopes of easing the economic burden of those in the old country -- come ill-equipped to deal with real estate. The difficulties are compounded, of course, if the immigrant is here illegally.
"There is no such thing back home as rent regulation," said Ms. Venugopal. "So, at least for the first few years, they may live in terrible conditions because they are unaware of the protections available to them."
A participant at the N.Y.U. conference, which was sponsored by the law school's Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, said that besides being unaware of the rental protections, many immigrants avoid filing a complaint, fearing that an appearance in Housing Court will leave them with a police record.
Christopher Kui, executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, a nonprofit community and housing development organization, pointed out that just as immigrant renters are unaware of their rights, "some Chinese landlords are ignorant of their responsibilities under the law, so housing codes are not enforced."
At the same time, Mr. Kui said, Chinese immigrants "often buy houses with basements to rent them, only to find that it is against the law, after they have calculated mortgage payments based on that income."
Many new arrivals must, of course, take menial jobs in factories or restaurants, where they are paid off the books, rendering it impossible to start building the credit histories indispensable for eventually working their way up the rental ladder and, perhaps, purchasing their slice of the proverbial American pie.
To save, they live together -- extended families and strangers alike -- doubling and tripling up, or crammed like Mr. Liu into barracks-like hovels. "I want to buy a house or rent a house," he said, "but not without my family."
Mr. Liu fled from the Chinese population police in 1986. "Because I have five children, the government gave me trouble," he said. "Before I got arrested, I went away." He has seen his family once in 10 years.
"I save to bring them here," he said.
Poorer immigrants forgo buying a car, going to the movies, medical insurance. Accustomed to all-cash economies, many keep their savings at home, exposing themselves to further risk. To pay the rent, they go to the Post Office and buy a money order.
Erika Rodas, assistant coordinator of minority lending in the Westbury, L.I., office of the Skyscraper Mortgage Company, told the tale of a Salvadoran couple with three children who kept $7,000 under a mattress in the dilapidated one-bedroom apartment for which they were paying monthly rent of $1,400. Ms. Rodas said the father, a pizza cook, could not read; the mother worked in a factory. They dreamed of a decent home.
"We prequalified them to see how much they could really afford for a house," Ms. Rodas said. "We took them to open a bank account. We finally found the house they needed -- a cape, four bedrooms, in a much better area of Westbury."
The house, appraised at $140,000, was facing foreclosure, Ms. Rodas said, "so they got it for $90,000 and they have a lot of equity now." The 30-year mortgage had a fixed rate of 8 percent.
Three months after the family moved out, fire gutted their old apartment house. "They were very grateful," Ms. Rodas said. "They would have lost their savings."
The immigrant housing quest can come up against "cultural quirks" -- Ms. Venugopal's phrase -- that sometimes act like ruts in the road, sometimes smooth the way and even on occasion profoundly change the communities in which the newcomers settle.
Some immigrants from the Indian subcontinent are adherents to Vastu Shastra -- a code, similar to Chinese Feng Shui, that guides one toward the most spiritually propitious way of laying out a home.
"I know one person who told a realtor he wanted the master bedroom facing east, so the morning sun will wake him," Ms. Venugopal said.
At the N.Y.U. conference, a man from Nigeria said that in his country most people live in inherited houses, or build their own, so buying someone else's home is a foreign concept.
Many ethnic groups, denied access to banking services, form networks of relatives and friends -- buyers' clubs, in effect -- to exchange information and pool their resources. Mr. Hamilton, the native of Guyana who is now a city official, said that in Caribbean communities such a network is called a "sou-sou" -- an informal system of rotating credit based on African tradition.
"Let's say six of us decide to set aside $200 every month," Mr. Hamilton said. "It would take six months for any one of us to get $1,200, but by pooling our contributions, each person is able to get $1,200 from any single pool." The contributors pick the order of beneficiaries. "In terms of buying a house, of course, you multiply it significantly, involving as many people as necessary."
The language barrier can literally change the face of the city.
It may be apocryphal but, by some accounts, Sunset Park in Brooklyn became a haven for Chinese immigrants after several settled there and put the word out: get off at the Blue Sky Station -- the BMT stop after the train comes out of the tunnel. "It illustrates the barriers people face when they can't read signs," said Mr. Kui of Asian Americans for Equality.
The No. 7 line from Flushing to Times Square is known by some as the New Orient Express.
AND in the 1970's, immigrants from Odessa, Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, chose to settle in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, because, like Odessa, it is by the sea -- sowing seeds for the still-blossoming Russian enclave in southern Brooklyn.
Among the more recent buds are Ilya and Inessa Rubenstein and their 4-year-old son, Samuel. The Rubensteins were fortunate: someone told them to start building credit soon after they arrived from the former Soviet republic of Belarus in 1993.
Mr. Rubenstein had worked for a Jewish organization in the city of Minsk. And when the collapse of Communism released pent-up right-wing extremism, he said, "it was, of course, anti-Semitic."
"Sometimes," he said, "we had letters that Jews should go back where they came from, threatening phone calls and many things that forced us to leave."
Relatives of Mrs. Rubenstein had already fled to the United States. "And the minute we came," Mr. Rubenstein said, "they told us to start our credit history. So I got credit cards almost immediately."
Six years later, the Rubensteins -- he now the administrative director of the Jewish Community Council of Kings Bay in Brooklyn, she working toward a degree in medical technology -- have passed muster with the co-op board of Sheepshead Bay Terrace, a 168-unit building, and are awaiting final approval of their mortgage from Chase Manhattan to buy a $45,000, two-bedroom apartment.
They are part of the burgeoning middle class of immigrants moving toward home-buying that developers like Joshua Muss, president of Muss Development -- a company that has built 20,000 housing units in the city since 1906 -- are tapping into.
"We're talking about probably a million immigrants who have come within the last decade," Mr. Muss said. "Many are improving themselves and aspiring to better housing, and there's nothing available."
After several Soviet emigres bought $200,000 to $300,000 houses at Captain's Quarters, a 270-unit Muss development in the Princes Bay section of Staten Island, "there was word of mouth and we started advertising, targeting them in Russian newspapers in Brooklyn," Mr. Muss said. "And of the last 100 homes, half went to former Soviet emigres."
Within months, he said, his company will begin construction of an 850-unit complex on the site of the old Brighton Beach Baths. And the company is considering construction of 1,200 units on a 100-acre expanse of downtown Flushing recently rezoned by the City Planning Commission. "The market there is enormous," Mr. Muss said, "a huge community of Korean, Chinese and Indian immigrants, very anxious for housing."
Immigrants are vital to the city's housing health, said Michael Schill, director of the N.Y.U. real estate center. "They maintain the city's population."
Between 1990 and 1997, according to Census Bureau estimates, the city's population increased modestly, by 0.3 percent, or about 20,000 people. And while the city experienced a net loss of 1,073,500 people to other parts of the country during that period, the city gained 677,200 people through immigration and 421,200 more by natural increase -- meaning more births than deaths. "So without immigration," Professor Schill said, "the city would have lost 9 percent of its population."
"That would have had a tremendous effect on the city's economy, its retail, the labor force and its neighborhoods," he said.
On one hand, immigration tightens the housing market and contributes to higher rents for all New Yorkers, Professor Schill said. But without it, he said, rents at the bottom of the market would be insufficient to enable owners to maintain buildings, "which would lead to disinvestment, tax delinquencies and, ultimately, abandonment."
"So, while immigration is a mixed blessing," he said, "in my view it is ultimately a positive because without it neighborhoods would be scarred by vacant and deteriorating housing."
Naomi Bayer is director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, the federally chartered funding source for issuers of mortgages. "Much of our work is aimed at breaking down barriers and providing the information immigrants need," Ms. Bayer said. In cooperation with the Queens Borough Public Library system, Fannie Mae has started a series of home-buying workshops in a variety of languages. It has adopted policies allowing lenders to use alternate forms of credit -- rent stubs, phone bills -- as parts of a buyer's credit record, and to accept "sou-sous" as an alternate down payment source.
It has also created low down payment products -- 3 percent for single-unit properties, 5 percent for a two-family and 10 percent for a three- or four-family home. And it has adopted a formula for two- to four-unit properties in which rental income can count far more significantly than in the past in allowing a lower-income family to afford a mortgage.
FRANK AND JENNY GAO are about to join the ranks of American home owners. Newly arrived from China in 1990, the Gaos first lived with relatives in Newport News, Va., then moved to a rental in Philadelphia, then doubled up with strangers in Flushing -- the "new Chinatown," Mr. Gao called it -- then moved into a second-floor bedroom in another Flushing home, sharing the kitchen and bathrooms with the owner.
"My landlord had a baby," said Mr. Gao, a shipping clerk for an import company, "so I need to get a new place." The Gaos took a homebuyers workshop from Asian Americans for Equality. Then, it all seemed so foreign. "In China, we don't need to buy," Mr. Gao said. "Government gave me the apartment; just pay like $3, a few peanuts."
At the buyer's workshop, "they taught me the difference between buying an apartment or a house, a condominium and co-op -- condominium you own the space, co-op just share the stock," Mr. Gao said proudly. "They say for a mortgage we need to pay no more than 30 percent of the expenses every month. They told me to save in the bank, and put in every month." On Wednesday, the Gaos will close on a two-bedroom, $50,000 co-op in Briarwood, Queens, with a 30-year mortgage at a fixed rate of 6.875 percent.
"I want privacy," Mr. Gao said. "I want space. I have lots of books."
The apartment is on the seventh floor, with a westward view. "I like this place," Mr. Gao said. "It's very beautiful from the living room. I can look at the Manhattan skyline."

City-Bound Traffic Hit Record Volume Last Year

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
Those who have come to expect to spend 45 minutes approaching the toll booth would not be surprised at a figure released last week by Port Authority of New York and New Jersey: the number of vehicles crossing the Hudson River from New Jersey to New York City grew by 2.9 percent last year to a record 121.4 million crossings.
There were 3.4 million more crossings of the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels in 1998 than the year before, said Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the authority. 
 Fourty-three percent of tolls were paid by electronic EZ-Pass last year, which may account for some of the increase, he said But, he added: "The biggest thing we can attribute it to is the economy." STEVE STRUNSKY

'Open for Business'

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
County Executive Andrew J. Spano has appointed William J. Mulrow of Bronxville, a managing director at Rothschild, a Manhattan investment firm, to replace Louis Heithaus on the Industrial Development Agency board. Mr. Heithaus, who resigned, was the chairman of the public-private agency, which sells low-interest bonds and offers tax abatements to businesses. Mr. Heithaus headed the agency for 11 years under the the previous County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke.
Mr. Spano also named new members to the agency: Vincent Rippa, a judge and Mayor of New Rochelle from 1975 to '79; Andrew J. Maniglia, director of finance for New York City's Educational Construction Fund and a former Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development in Yonkers, and William Wood of White Plains, a lawyer. 
 The new members replace John Bresnahan of Rye, Wayne McGrath of White Plains and Charles Simmons of Scarsdale. Larry Schwartz, chief adviser to the County Executive, said the appointments are part of Mr. Spano's plan to take an active role in business development.
"The County Executive has an Open for Business sign here in Westchester," Mr. Schwartz said. "He knows that good jobs are as much a part of the quality of life as open space and parks are. Westchester is a business-friendly county."
Remaining as board members are E. Virgil Conway, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Mr. Schwartz and Roy Barnes, a lawyer with the Teamsters union.

Bottom Creams, Top Prices

BYLINE: By ELLEN TIEN

 BODY:

Kate Spade and Prada turned the diaper bag into a $300 knapsack from a $20 tote. Now, diaper ointments are undergoing similar style and price inflation. Last month, Bubbe's Best, started by three mothers in Garrison, N.Y., came out with Special Cream for Special Tushies, touted to be made of the "purest, finest" ingredients. At $12.50 for three ounces (Zitomer, 969 Madison Avenue at 76th Street) compared with about $3.50 for a four-ounce tube of an old standard like Desitin, it had better be. This month, Burt's Bees introduces Baby Bee Diaper Ointment, a mere $7 for 1.75 ounces (800-849-7112). And Kiehl's, skin care's gold standard, offers a Soothing Diaper-Area Ointment at a platinum price of $18.95 for two ounces (at its store, Third Avenue and 13th Street). This spring, Origins will offer Diaper Service, $10 for a 3-ounce tube, and Bobbi Brown is starting a Baby Essentials line with a Diaper Balm, $14.50 for 2.5 ounces. 
 Are they worth it? "They're all just moisture barriers for the skin," said Dr. Philip Orbuch, a pediatric dermatologist at New York University Medical Center. "Provided the cream is free of fragrance and preservatives, it's a matter of personal preference. Frequent diaper changes are more important than what kind of cream you use." Bummer. ELLEN TIEN

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
When Doing Nothing Accomplishes Plenty

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVERY year around this time, the cry is heard on Capitol Hill: Let's put aside partisan politics and get down to dealing with the issues of real concern to the American people.
It is an especially forceful cry this year. Democrats are eager for a debate on any policy issue that will turn attention away from President Clinton's impeachment trial and all that led to it. And Republicans are petrified of going into the 2000 elections looking like a party with no agenda beyond hounding the President. 
 Clearly, when it comes to education, health care, the environment, national security and other pressing issues, Congress and the Administration have powerful reasons of both substance and politics to act, and act they probably will, no matter how the impeachment proceeding plays out.
But when it comes to a crucial economic issue -- what to do with the growing Federal budget surplus -- there's a case to be made that the best thing would be continued Congressional gridlock.
BY demanding last year that the spare cash be set aside until Congress and the Administration could agree on a plan to shore up Social Security, Mr. Clinton thwarted Republican attempts to use the surplus to finance a big tax cut. His "Social Security first" strategy also beat back demands from Democrats in Congress for more spending on social programs.
In the end, neither party could resist spending some of the surplus. In a flurry of last-minute deal-making, the White House and the two parties in Congress agreed to spend $20 billion out of this year's surplus for "emergencies" like aid to farmers and an overhaul of the Government's computers to avoid Year 2000 software problems.
But the surplus for the year ended last Sept. 30, some $70 billion, was left untouched, and the current fiscal year's surplus is now likely to be at least $76 billion, even after accounting for the spending spree. The bottom line is this: Washington appears to have left nearly $150 billion on the table over two years, reducing the Federal Government's borrowing needs and thereby freeing up more capital for private investment at lower interest rates.
Credit for this bit of serendipitous thrift is due less to well-thought policy than to the political system's difficulties in climbing out of a long rut of deficit-mindedness to embrace an era of surplus. Nonetheless, many economists, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, believe that it is just what the economy needs to improve productivity and promote more long-term growth.
If, in the aftermath of impeachment, the two parties remain unable again this year to agree on how to divide up the spoils of the nation's new-found fiscal health, so much the better, many economists say.
"We've got a political situation that is so evenly balanced between Republicans and Democrats that you can't really do anything unless you can get everyone to agree," said L. Douglas Lee, the chief economist for HSBC Securities in Washington. "That would be difficult to do under any circumstances, and right now you have an extremely partisan atmosphere."
The resulting decision by default -- to allow the surpluses to accumulate at the Treasury and begin eating into the $5.5 trillion national debt -- "may not be a political choice, but a happy accident," Mr. Lee said.
Continued deadlock over big tax cuts or spending increases could also prove to be good policy if the economy continues to hum along as it has for the last several years. Although most economists expect a slowdown this year, the buoyancy of the stock market and other indicators suggest that analysts may have again underestimated the resiliency of the expansion. In such an atmosphere, fiscal stimulus in the form of broad-based tax cuts or spending increases might be unnecessary or even harmful.
"By accident, we have the right fiscal policy in place by doing nothing," said Stan Collender, a budget analyst for Fleishman-Hillard, the consulting firm. "I'm not sure we could set up this policy if we tried, but since we've got it, we should go with it."
THE wild card this year is Social Security. Both the White House and the Republican leadership say it is still possible to reach a bipartisan deal on overhauling the retirement system so it is financially prepared for the aging of the baby-boom generation. However desirable such a deal might be on its own merits, it would mean open season on the surplus, with plenty of pent-up demand for tax cuts and spending increases -- good politics, perhaps, but not necessarily wise economic policy.

Warmth, but No Walls, in This Incubator

BYLINE: By WILLIAM R. LONG 

DATELINE: FORT COLLINS, Colo.

 BODY:
MAURY WILLMAN says her start-up ergonomics company is receiving valuable services from a local business incubator group, even if they don't include one usual benefit: office space at reduced rents.
The nonprofit group, the Fort Collins Virtual Business Incubator, started in March and is intended to nurture new companies and help create jobs in this city of 110,000 at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. Through it, Ms. Willman's company, Ergonomic Health Systems, obtains the services of a lawyer, an accountant and a marketing firm at one-fourth their usual fees, as well as free managerial advice and encouragement from volunteer experts and business people. 
 "That's why I got into the incubator, to surround myself with knowledge and excitement," said Ms. Willman, 41.
What she does not get from the incubator is a place to run her company. Unlike more traditional business incubators, which provide low-rent floor space, often in factories or warehouses left vacant after larger companies move out, the Fort Collins group is an "incubator without walls." It does not deal in real estate -- a policy that has resulted in both praise and criticism.
There are about 550 incubators in the United States, up from 12 in 1980, according to the National Business Incubation Association. It says the groups have nurtured nearly 19,000 companies that now employ more than 245,000 people.
To qualify as a business incubator -- as opposed to another kind of business development program -- a group must employ a manager, provide a comprehensive assistance program and require clients to graduate -- to operate eventually without the program's help. About 30 of the newest programs are incubators without walls, like the one in Fort Collins, said Susie McKinnon, the association's director of member services.
Ms. Willman and her partner, Robin Herron, a Colorado State University expert on ergonomics, develop and sell software to help companies improve workplace safety and prevent health problems like repetitive stress injuries. In November, the business moved from Ms. Willman's home into a 1,000-square-foot ground-floor office on a busy street, College Avenue, where the rent is $1,300 a month. Discount space from the incubator would have been a big help, Ms. Willman said. Still, she declared herself happy with the assistance she receives.
Kathy Kregel, director of the Fort Collins incubator, said she is glad she needn't worry about mortgage payments and empty real estate. "We are very selective," Ms. Kregel said of the committee that approves start-up clients for the incubator. "I have definitely turned down some candidates. If I was sitting on a big mortgage, I might not be doing that."
By not offering floor space, the virtual incubator is also avoiding the problems that shut the Eastview Technology Center, a high-technology incubator in Westchester County, N.Y. Its landlord, the White Plains school board, has sued the center's management company, seeking $450,000 in back rent. A countersuit, seeking $659,000, contends that the school district reneged on an agreement to provide adequate space. The start-up companies in the center had to move out last November.
THE incubator in Fort Collins is a joint project of the city, Colorado State University and the Fort Collins Economic Development Corporation. The city, the university, local businesses and the state have each contributed $15,000 to defray the first year's costs. But not everyone in town thinks the money has been well spent.
Donald C. Bishop, a high-technology recruiter and business consultant in Fort Collins, says the incubator is merely a channel for recruiting new clients for local banks and professional firms. A big problem for start-ups is raising capital for real estate, personnel and equipment, he said, but the incubator offers "no facilities, no real cash, so it is a major failure as an incubator."
Clients of the incubator disagree. Kristin Romberg, director of sales for Infusion Technologies, which makes custom software for call centers like those used by telemarketing and customer-service units, said the incubator's services were "a tremendous value" for the company. "They have even gone and talked to venture capitalists for us," she said. In September, she added, Infusion signed its first big contract with a call-center operator, for $375,000.
Frank Bruno, an assistant city manager in Fort Collins who wrote the original plan for the incubator, said he had initially hoped it would provide office and laboratory space, but there was not enough money to do so. Now the incubator is better off without real estate, he said, because "we're much more focused on the program."
A sharp focus has brought rapid growth to the Central Florida Innovation Corporation, a three-year-old virtual incubator in Orlando, with a 1999 budget of $1 million and a selective approach to helping technology start-ups. If prospective clients are not expecting annual revenues of at least $2 million in two years, "they're thinking small, and that's a disqualifier," said Richard Fox, the incubator's president.
Sponsors include the city of Orlando and the University of Central Florida. Three big companies that operate in the area -- Lockheed Martin, Thermo Electron and Nationsbank -- contribute to the budget. The incubator wants to help create businesses with $1 billion in revenue by 2002, Mr. Fox said.
It has raised $57 million in out-of-state venture capital, mostly for Triton Network Systems, which uses Lockheed Martin technology in a high-speed wireless system for transmitting data. In a year and a half, the company has grown to employ 77 people; it occupies 37,000 square feet of its own space.
Brick-and-mortar incubators still have fans. Jerry Donahue, executive director of the Boulder Technology Incubator in Colorado, with 15 resident clients in two sites, said, "I prefer to have them in our facilities, where I can do more for them, because you're seeing each other every day."
Dinah Adkins, executive director of the National Business Incubation Association, said another benefit of close proximity is that clients learn more from one another in a "synergistic environment." And the clients' rent payments, even if below market rates, are a useful flow of revenue, helping to keep incubators in business when subsidy sources dry up, she said.

HEADLINE: A Conga Line From Rio to Cafe Wha

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY

 BODY:
ON a doleful Monday night, so cold even the tourists were hibernating, a faint tropical beat cut through the wind in Greenwich Village. The rhythm led around a corner, down some stairs and smack into Carnaval in Rio.
Monday is Brazil Night at Cafe Wha, a cozy basement at West Third and Macdougal Streets. Beneath ceilings strung with Christmas lights, arms waved, hips swayed, bedroom eyes flirted and waitresses carried rounds of caipirinhas, the Brazilian cocktail of ice, lime, sugar and the national firewater, cachaca. 
 Brazilians and wanna-Brazilians came to drink, dance and listen to Rio jazz, Sao Paulo rock and Bahian drumming. After the first chords from the nine-piece band Brazilian Beat, the place erupted into a gyrating party. Inevitably, tabletops became dance floors. Not even a group of well-groomed Italian tourists could match the smooth undulations of the dexterous Brazilians, who made up the majority of the audience. Or so it appeared, as they sang along in Portuguese, acting like old friends.
"So many Brazilians have moved to New York," said Marianne Ebert, a singer with the Brazilian Beat. "Eventually, they end up at Cafe Wha. When I went to Brazil for Christmas, everyone knew everyone on the plane. It was a huge party. Like high school in the air."
Many in the warm and sexy crowd are part of a wave of talented young Brazilians who can't seem to get to New York fast enough. Musicians, artists, night-life promoters, filmmakers, designers, restaurateurs and boutique owners have all flocked to the city in recent years. Its once muted Brazilian presence has blossomed like an Amazon orchid.
Five years ago, the city's Brazilian culture was pretty much limited to the club S.O.B.'s, where Astrud Gilberto sang about that "Girl From Ipanema," and Little Brazil, a restaurant row on West 46th Street, where the most sizzling offering was often a limp feijoada, Brazil's national stew.
Today, however, a pipeline from Brazil to Manhattan of creative and ambitious young people has added a more authentic and prominent new flavor to the city's cultural mix. In 1995, the Zagat guide listed just four Brazilian restaurants in New York. Now, there are 17. They range from in-spots like Cafe Colonial on East Houston Street to upscale churrascarias like Plataforma on West 49th Street, a shrine to meat.
In addition to Cafe Wha, there are at least six bars in Manhattan featuring Brazilian parties, including weekend afternoons at Coffee Shop (on Union Square West) and Saturdays at the Zinc Bar (80 West Houston Street). A Web site that keeps track of the action includes information on Lambateria NY, a dance school; photographs of Brazilian parties like Bahian Music Mondays at the Elbow Room (144 Bleecker Street), and for the homesick, a virtual tour of Rio's Sugar Loaf Mountain: www.inergy.com/sambagirl.
The immigrants jetting back and forth between New York and Brazil are not doing so to escape poverty and despair. The shuttle of young, creative people began earlier this decade, a result of financial self-confidence in one of the world's largest economies. (It is uncertain how the devaluation of Brazil's currency last week, which sent economic jitters around the world, will affect emigration, but one possibility is that talent could continue leaving Brazil.)
Typical of this generation of hipster emigres are the Lee sisters from Sao Paulo, a triumvirate of Brazilian fashion, food and music. They have Korean surnames, Amazon-Indian first names, Portuguese accents, expensive cell phones and Manhattan addresses. Jupira Lee, a restaurateur, arrived in 1988. A year later, she was followed by her sisters, Iara, a record producer and film director, and Jussara, a clothing designer.
The three spoke over strong coffee and cigarettes at Casa, a spare Brazilian eatery that Jupira opened four months ago on Bedford Street. Primitive portraits by Geova Rodriguez, another Brazilian living in New York, decorate the walls.
The Lee sisters make adjusting to New York sound smooth as a samba. Their native Sao Paulo "is a city of attitude -- it's all about money, just like here," Jupira said, adding, "So, understanding New Yorkers is not hard for us."
Iara agreed that Sao Paulo is much like New York, except for the chill, both literally and figuratively. "What we miss is the social warmth," Iara said. "It's the complaint you hear most from Brazilians here, the lack of warmth. At least at first, New York is cold. But that's the price you pay."
The Lee sisters roll their eyes at stereotypes of their country. "We are more than just parrots and Carmen Miranda, you know," Jupira said. "People always come in and ask for avocado stuffed with shrimp. We don't eat that in Brazil."
What they do eat, she said, is Brazilian stroganoff and pan-fried pollack in coconut milk, two of Casa's specialties. "It's all home cooking," Jupira said. "It's all about Mama."
And capairinhas, one stereotype the sisters do embrace. They enjoy initiating New Yorkers into the ritual of the powerful sugary green drink at parties. They gave one for Casa's opening, and for the 1996 premiere of "Synthetic Pleasures," an independent film directed by Iara.
Iara, who is married to George Gund 3d, an arts patron and owner of the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League, also started a record label in 1997, named -- what else? -- Caipirinha Music. Her next film, based on a 19th-century Brazilian novel, will be shot on location in Brasilia.
The costume designer for her films is often her sister the designer. Jussara's line, is sold in her Greene Street store, which resembles a 19th-century hacienda. The current collection, inspired by Bahia, the predominately African region of Brazil, features skirts that wrap around the body and gauzy fabrics in earthy tones. The designs are surprisingly demure. "I want my clothes to convey the sensuality of Brazil," she said. "But not that overtly sexy thing, with tight leather and little cut-outs."
Jussara now has more competition from home. Last year, Tufi Deuk, a Sao Paulo designer whom Vogue magazine has called the "Calvin Klein of Brazil," expanded in New York. He has opened a showroom, and his line is available at Language, a boutique on Mulberry Street that carries unusual clothing and housewares from around the world and that has a gallery in back for artists.
"We are Latins who share the ethos of the American dream, only with a different flair," Mr. Deuk said. "There is certainly a degree of nostalgia and glamour associated with Brazil that just feels so right at the moment -- an exoticism and sense of style that is based on familiarity. Brazil can be seductive that way."
Such familiarity can be an obstacle for Brazilians trying to adjust to New York's frostier social clime. "New York went against my natural being for the first six months," said Lipe Medeiros, a co-owner of Language. "I had to learn not to be Brazilian to get by." Mr. Medeiros said that meant not looking people in the eye, and holding himself back from making faces at cute babies in the subway, which he once did, causing the mother to scream.
Mr. Medeiros is a Paulista, as Sao Paulo residents are known, who designs furniture from scaffolding equipment and sells it in the store, which he runs with his wife, Ana Abdul, a painter from Brasilia. Among the Brazilian items in the shop are feather and mother-of-pearl Amazon warrior masks and steel and nylon chairs, designed by two Brazilian brothers, that were recently on exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art.
Now, Mr. Medeiros worries that he is assimilating too much. "When I went to Sao Paulo, I looked completely like a gringo, with baseball cap and all," he said. "Everyone tried to speak English to me."
One language spoken fluently in both New York and Brazil is music. New York is where bossa nova landed 40 years ago. With the current nostalgia for 1950's cocktail culture, the smooth Brazilian lounge rhythms are again popular.
Andre Alves, a promoter, began Brazil Night at Cafe Wha two and a half years ago. "It became an instant success," he said. "They even know about Cafe Wha in Rio." He now has a New York-area mailing list of 18,000 people, about 80 percent of whom he says are from Brazil. Mr. Alves, 37, brings live Brazilian music to New York, and next month plans to start TBB magazine, a monthly roundup of Brazilian culture.
The new generation of Brazilian musicians includes Bebel Gilberto, who has performed at Lincoln Center, at the Bottom Line and at Cafe Wha. A soft-spoken, black-haired woman, she is cutting an eclectic album that mixes Brazilian acoustics with techno and other modern influences.
"Brazil is a bit conservative with its music," she said. "I wouldn't have the courage to do what I do here." Ms. Gilberto comes from a venerable Brazilian musical family; her father, Joao Gilberto, is a singer who was once married to Astrud Gilberto. "I'm the stepdaughter from Ipanema," she said. "When I'm there, I feel a lot of pressure to carry out that tradition. It's too much baggage. But in New York, I feel free."

What's Weighing on Buffett's Stock?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
WARREN E. BUFFETT, the investment sage, has often said he welcomes market declines because they put some good-quality merchandise "on sale," letting him shop for bargains.
These days, however, it is the price of Mr. Buffett's own company, Berkshire Hathaway, that has been reduced, and some people are wondering why. 
 It's not that they think that Mr. Buffett, 68, has lost his touch. But how to explain that Berkshire's class A shares have lost more than 7 percent of their value, falling to $65,000, in just the first two weeks of the year? And that they are down 19.7 percent from their all-time closing peak of $80,900 last June 19? (Class B shares, which give holders limited voting rights and are not convertible to A shares, have fallen at a similar pace, and are now at $2,128.)
Not to worry, say those who follow Berkshire most closely. Yes, two of its biggest holdings, Coca-Cola and Gillette, have suffered from economic turmoil abroad. But this is the wrong way to look at Berkshire, according to Robert Hagstrom, portfolio manager for Legg Mason Focus Trust and a Buffett aficionado. Indeed, Berkshire is often misperceived by casual investors, and even the arbitragers, as little more than its huge portfolio of publicly traded stocks, concentrated -- at last report, which means the 1997 annual report -- in eight issues. (In addition to Coke and Gillette, those are American Express, Freddie Mac, Wells Fargo, Disney, Citigroup and Washington Post.)
"It is not correct to analyze as a closed-end investment company," said Mr. Hagstrom, whose fund has 22 percent of its assets invested in Berkshire. The main business of Berkshire is property and casualty insurance; the "float" generated by these subsidiaries including Geico, the seventh-biggest auto insurer, is then invested elsewhere -- in stocks and directly into other Berkshire operating businesses.
Investors say Berkshire's relative weakness is mostly a temporary result of its $22 billion acquisition, announced last summer, of General Re, the giant reinsurance company. As it turned out, General Re stockholders did not jump at the chance to become Mr. Buffett's investment partners by exchanging their shares for those of Berkshire.
That has led to some weakness in Berkshire shares. Thomas A. Russo, a partner at Gardner Investments in Lancaster, Pa., which has long held sizable Berkshire stakes, said: "The real impact is from the massive rotation of owners. You're now asking insurance investors to own a company that has a lot of other things," including a portfolio of stocks now carrying high price-earnings multiples and an increasingly large stable of other interests ranging from candy to executive jets. In his view, the pressure on the stock from the exodus of these owners is temporary.
A Wall Street analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, however, estimated that only about one-third of General Re holders will wind up keeping Berkshire stock.
Disenchantment spread when Standard & Poor's chose not to include Berkshire in its 500-stock index, the widely used benchmark whose components are must buys for index funds. Lack of liquidity was seen as the reason -- expensive Berkshire shares do not trade much -- though rumors persist that S.& P. may reconsider. A spokesman for S.& P. declined comment on Thursday.
Another factor weighing on Berkshire's price is softness in the world reinsurance market as overcapacity forces down rates. But Mr. Hagstrom, Mr. Russo and others regard the acquisition of General Re as nothing short of a coup. General Re's huge size figures to add flexibility to Berkshire's insurance operations as well as to throw off huge amounts of cash that can be invested.
Geico, which flirted with bankruptcy in the 1970's, is thriving. As a low-cost provider of auto insurance, it could become the industry's second-biggest company, trailing only State Farm, in five to seven years, said Alice Schroeder, a Paine Webber analyst.
Christopher C. Davis, portfolio manager of Davis New York Venture fund and Selected American Shares, said the crucial variables for analysts sizing up Berkshire are how the insurance properties are valued and what opportunities exist for Berkshire to invest the float they generate. Mr. Davis has long admired Mr. Buffett without owning Berkshire itself. Now he counts himself a Berkshire bull and is keeping shares he received in exchange for General Re stock.
Martin Sosnoff, chief investment officer for Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital, has reservations. He argued recently in Forbes magazine that the collapse of oil prices had dimmed Berkshire's prospects by threatening political disruption in emerging markets, undermining their ability to buy Coke.
Buffett fans don't agree. "He'll make more money for his shareholders in a bad market," Mr. Davis said. "In a high-flying market he may have to bide his time."

HEADLINE: The End of the Line;
As the Swingline Factory in Queens Closes, Veteran Workers Wonder What's Next for Them

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
TO Sal Melendez, the Swingline stapler factory in Long Island City, Queens, has been, for the most part, like a benevolent parent. It has fed and clothed him for nearly 21 years. It has watched him mature from a shipping clerk with limited English to a supervisor shepherding the next generation of immigrants into the company. It even introduced him to his wife, Juana, an assembly-line worker he met in the company cafeteria.
But Mr. Melendez said that the good will ran out in the spring of 1997 when company officials announced that they planned to shutter the 50-year-old plant and move operations to Nogales, Mexico. 
 Juana Melendez was laid off in October, and Mr. Melendez expects that he'll be standing in line at the unemployment office next month. That, he said, is when he has been told the factory will ship its last boxes of stapler parts and staples.
A spokeswoman for the company, Wendi Kopsick, declined to give a closing date for the factory but said that the 225 employees still working there would be "gradually phased down" and that the factory would be shut by the end of May. About 225 other workers have lost their jobs in the last 18 months.
"I got nothing against the company, because it gave me a wife and a good-looking kid," Mr. Melendez said, referring to his son, Sal, 14. "But right now they're not treating the people there -- good, decent people -- with dignity." He was especially bitter that even as the company laid off workers, it assigned others to work overtime. "People are working their last days there, and they just keep pushing and pushing them like slaves," he said.
When Swingline closes completely, 450 jobs will be gone. That is the largest single job loss in New York City from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, the 1994 pact that lowered trade barriers among the United States, Mexico and Canada. Since 1994 about 800 workers from 17 companies in the city have registered with the Federal Department of Labor for unemployment and retraining benefits related to Nafta.
When officials from Swingline's parent company, Acco U.S.A., in Wheeling, Ill., announced that its Queens factory had become too costly to maintain and said the only way to increase profits was to move to Mexico, where labor and overhead are much cheaper, Mayor Giuliani declared that New York could do without a company that did not want to pay workers a decent wage. "The city comes out of this quite well," he said, adding that new companies were sprouting up and expanding in Long Island City and that Swingline workers probably would not have trouble finding new jobs. At the time, the Mayor was running for re-election, and his critics called his comments about the Swingline workers' job prospects insensitive and overly optimistic. Today, as hundreds of those workers grapple with unemployment, many complain that the Mayor painted far too rosy a picture. They worry that few companies will hire middle-aged, unskilled factory workers, and that even if they find new jobs, working back up to their old pay, an average of $10 an hour, will be next to impossible.
"The only jobs they have at unemployment are for fast food and for a foot massager, and that's at $5.50 an hour," said Nancy DeWendt, 48, who started at Swingline some 20 years ago, attaching staplers to their bases. "When you're used to a certain standard of living, that's like taking a gun and shooting me in my head."
For Sal and Juana Melendez, losing just one of their two Swingline incomes has already seriously shaken the routine and order of their lives. While Juana Melendez, 41, who is recovering from a slipped disk, will soon return to school to study English as a second language, Mr. Melendez, 46, has begun sniffing around for another job. Despite more than a decade of management experience at Swingline's loading bays, he said, his prospects were not good.
"I already asked around at a few warehouses where they might need someone with shipping experience, but they don't want someone like me," said Mr. Melendez, who immigrated from El Salvador when he was 17 years old. "It's going to be hard, because they're always looking for younger people."
His son, he said, has had to make sacrifices. "I explained what's going on at work, and I know he's not asking me for things he wants because of that," Mr. Melendez said. Last fall, to save his parents money, Sal enrolled at Queens Vocational and Technical High School in Long Island City instead of continuing in parochial school.
The Melendezes said they never minded putting in long hours at Swingline because it always meant more money for rearing their son. "Our main goal is him," Mr. Melendez said. "Always has been. But I worry for him, because you have to know 10 times more than me in order to survive now."
 
Small Manufacturers Opening and Growing
While Swingline's closing represents another major blow to the old-style heavy manufacturing that once dominated Long Island City, the neighborhood has experienced a recent industrial rebound with the opening and expansion of a number of smaller manufacturers.
Mana Products, for example, a cosmetics manufacturer across the street from Swingline that makes lotions and powders for high-end retailers like Neiman Marcus as well as make-up for K-Mart and private beauty salons, has grown to more than 500 employees from about 200 five years ago. And Schick Technologies, a nearby company that makes computerized dental X-ray machines, started with three workers in 1993 and now has more than 450.
If anything, local officials say, the shutdown of Swingline's assembly line runs counter to an overall trend in job growth. The number of manufacturing jobs in Queens increased to 50,300 in early 1998, from about 49,400 in early 1997, they say.
Thomas P. Knierim, executive director of the Long Island City Business Development Corporation, said that after decades of local job losses, as familiar manufacturers like Silvercup Bakery closed for good and others, including Eveready, Sunshine Biscuits and Chiclets, shuttered plants and moved elsewhere, the neighborhood has recently experienced something of a renaissance.
"As space gets too tight in Manhattan, many firms that are growing look at Long Island City because of its traditional role of being a premier industrial neighborhood that's just outside Manhattan," Mr. Knierem said. Long Island City's appeal, he said, lies in its quick access to highways, which makes it easier to transport goods, and the six subway lines and many bus lines that converge there.
Smaller manufacturers seem to be lining up to take over Swingline's industrial space. Lawrence T. Smith of Sholom & Zuckerbrot Realty, the broker handling the leasing of the Swingline buildings, said he expected leases to be signed within the next month. He would not give any details, but said that several smaller manufacturers were likely to move into the main building and that one company was to take over the annex building across Queens Boulevard.
 
Years of Climbing, Loss of the Ladder
Many Swingline workers like Elsa Vega are unskilled, lack a high school education and speak little English. They are wary of the new companies cropping up because they typically offer nonunion jobs, often without health benefits. And they dread starting again at the minimum wage.
Even those who are skilled see themselves as footnotes to a time when assembly-line jobs were plentiful and workers could expect to spend all their productive years at one company, moving up to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay.
Most of the workers found out about jobs at Swingline through friends and relatives, and the vast majority are immigrants from South America, Haiti, India and Russia. There is also a sizable community of Southern blacks who moved to New York in the 1960's for the work the company offered.
Aston Diedrick, a die maker who operated the machines that molded molten metal into stapler parts, has scoured newspapers for job openings since he was laid off two months ago. "I don't think there is anything like this left in New York," he said. "There's no more die casting in the city, so I don't know what I'm going to do."
Mr. Diedrick shakes his head in frustration as he ponders how he will support the five children he left behind in Jamaica nine years ago to take the Swingline job. "At the unemployment office, they only bring up this thing called Nafta," he said. "They talk about giving you two years of retraining, but what's your family supposed to do for two years while you're out of work?"
Besides retraining, the Government provides workers whose jobs have become casualties of Nafta with a year of unemployment benefits in addition to the six months most laid-off workers are entitled to get. Yet, while unemployment pays up to $365 a week, Swingline workers brought home an average of $650 a week with overtime, said officials of Teamsters Local 808, which represents about 400 Swingline employees.
The company spokeswoman, Ms. Kopsick, acknowledged that closing the plant has been "a difficult and emotional process for everyone," but insisted that it could not be avoided because in recent years, "Swingline had become only marginally profitable." She declined to give specific figures.
The union local's secretary, Chris Silvera, argued that when the plant closing was announced in 1997, internal company documents showed more than $10 million a year in profits. "They never lost any money," he said. "They told us at the time that it was simply they wanted to make a greater profit."
Workers say that stapler production in the factory's main building, on Skillman Avenue in the shadow of the elevated No. 7 train, stopped about a year ago. Since then all but the basement and third floor have continued operations, mainly producing stapler parts that are shipped to Nogales for assembly. Staples are still being made and packaged in the annex building.
Mr. Melendez said that in the days when the assembly lines were at full power, 20 to 40 people worked at the various stations, many shouting in different languages over the plop-plop-plop of machines spitting out stapler parts. "It was like the United Nations," he said. "Now when you walk through there, all you hear is quiet."
Swingline workers became experts on loading machines that make and piece together stapler parts or that shape 90-pound spools of wire into neat rows of staples. But now that many of them are middle- aged, they are skeptical that going back to school or enrolling in retraining programs will really help them compete with people half their age who probably have twice their energy and many more times their promise.
"I'm too young to retire and too old to start over," said Ms. DeWendt, who has been on disability since she threw out her back during a shift in late 1997. As a union shop steward, she has followed the factory's gradual closing very closely. She says Nafta retraining hasn't meant much to people laid off. Many hoped retraining would mean a chance to learn a trade. But most have been sent into courses to earn a high school equivalency degree or to learn English as a second language. "And before they do that, they make you take all these tests that are something else," she said.
Betty Gorham, who worked at Swingline for 20 years, took those tests. Despite finishing the 11th grade before moving to New York from North Carolina in 1965, she was told that before testing for a high school equivalency degree, she would first have to take literacy and basic math classes. So for the last year, the 52-year-old former assembly-line leader and production clerk has been going to school three hours a day, five days a week to relearn things as basic as addition and subtraction and what constitutes a long and short vowel sound.
"It's hard sitting there and trying to get all this stuff in your head after 34 years out of school," she said.
And after a lifetime of 12-hour work days, rearing two daughters and making a home for her family, Mrs. Gorham said, sitting down at night to write a 200-word essay about the city she lives in or to calculate square roots has proved to be much more of a challenge than she ever expected.
"Your mind don't function like it did when you was younger," she said. "But I do my homework and I do it good."
Mrs. Gorham said she opted to take the Nafta training because after all her years on the job, "I thought I would go to school to better myself and rest for a while."
Dave Engelhardt, her teacher at the Goodwill Industries Family Learning Center in Astoria, where she attends classes with two other Swingline workers, said that she entered with fourth-grade reading and math skills and after a year had progressed to an eighth-grade level. "Betty grew up at a time when people were routinely moved up in school strictly for a quota's sake, and lots of students were forgotten," he said. "But she's moved very quickly."
Mrs. Gorham hopes to earn her high school equivalency degree in May, which is about when her Nafta benefits run out. Besides basic education classes, she also has been taking some computer training classes. Shortly before being laid off, she had been entering stapler orders into a computer, so she hopes to find some kind of computer data entry work. But failing that, she said she would look for a job monitoring children on a school bus. "I figure I'll just watch the newspapers, but I know there ain't no jobs out there like there used to be," she said. "I'd come out of school right quick if I could find a job."
Mrs. Gorham said she has managed on unemployment benefits -- less than half of her Swingline take-home pay -- by careful budgeting. She lives in Jamaica with her husband, one of her daughters and three grandchildren. "My husband works in construction," she said. "But he counts on me, too; they all count on me."
As tough as surviving on unemployment benefits may be, Ms. DeWendt noted that Swingline's wages were hardly lavish. Many people worked 30 years to get to $10.75 an hour. But almost everyone routinely worked about 18 hours of overtime each week, she said, staying an extra two hours each day and working Saturdays when possible.
"Some people would do double shifts if they could get it," she said. "That's how people would get over and make money. That's how a lot of us could come to own a house and have a decent life."
Most workers have slowly come to terms with the upheaval. Julia Edge, who started at Swingline one week after moving to New York from North Carolina in 1965, figures that because of seniority she'll be one of the last workers at the factory. Mrs. Edge started in the packing room, worked her way up to the assembly line, then to the shipping room and to customer service. She spent the last 18 years as a supervisor. "I really don't know what I'll do when the factory closes," she said. "I'm just going to take it one day at a time.
"It was a family," she said of her co-workers. "There were husbands and wives, aunts and uncles, sisters and brothers who all worked there, and I had looked forward to retiring there with all my friends, but what can you do? When it's over, it's over."

HEADLINE: Saying Goodbye, Good Riddance To Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: MENLO PARK, Calif.

 BODY:
UNTIL last year, Geoff Goodfellow was a Silicon Valley Wunderkind, a pioneer in the field of wireless electronic mail. Now, as a resident of the Czech Republic, he wakes up each day and gazes from the balcony of his loft over a jumble of rooftops at the Prague Castle on a nearby hill.
Half a world away from Silicon Valley, Mr. Goodfellow has become a member of a small fraternity of engineers and entrepreneurs who have dropped out and walked away from ground zero of the Internet economy. 
 Mr. Goodfellow's departure is an exception to the popular notion that working in Silicon Valley, the world's high-technology capital, is its own reward. He left with a darker vision of life there and a disdain for the corrosive human effect of the region's workaholic, dollar-obsessed culture.
"In the Valley, it's all about power and money and work, work, work, work, and this expectation among your peers that you're going to do the next big thing," he said recently. "Eventually I saw that was a false god."
The different path taken by Mr. Goodfellow and a handful of others who have left Silicon Valley is particularly striking, because for the best and the brightest, dropping out or even retiring early has become increasingly rare.
Making a huge fortune in a high-flying Internet or semiconductor stock, which would be a life-changing event for most Americans, has in Silicon Valley become merely an occasion for, say, buying a new house or car and then transferring to a new start-up company.
In this former agricultural region, it has become typical to find "serial entrepreneurs" -- hardware engineers, scientists, marketing managers and software programmers who often feel that they work not for a given company but rather for Silicon Valley Inc. Changing jobs has become as simple as turning into a new driveway when you head for work.
And for many of these people, each successive job demands an intense commitment that squeezes out any outside life, whether it is family or recreation. Like the Apple Macintosh team of the 1980's whose members wore T-shirts that read "Working 90 hours a week and loving it," many people who work here now wear this workaholism as a badge of courage.
The modern role models are those who have founded a string of successful companies, like Jim Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics and Netscape Communications, or Federico Faggin, a former Intel engineer, co-inventor of its first microprocessor chip and founder of the Zilog Corporation and Synaptics Inc.
Indeed, the popular Silicon Valley career goal has become graduating to "corporate angel" status -- wealthy enough to emulate the venture capitalists who have long been the lifeblood of the Valley. Entrepreneurs like Andreas Bechtolscheim, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems who is now a computer designer at Cisco Systems, and Mark Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, have become start-up investors while keeping their day jobs.
To find the Valley's most celebrated dropout, by contrast, it is necessary to reach back more than two decades. Robert J. Widlar, a legendary chip designer at the National Semiconductor Corporation, quit and moved to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, in the 1970's, saying he "didn't like the water" in Silicon Valley. His idyll was cut short in 1991, when, at the age of 53, he died while jogging on a Puerto Vallarta beach.
It was Steven P. Jobs, a college dropout, who brought to Silicon Valley the mantra that "the journey is the reward."
Mr. Jobs was a co-founder of Apple Computer in 1976. After leaving Apple in 1985, he founded Next Computer and almost simultaneously bought Pixar, at the time an ailing supercomputer company.
A decade later, Mr. Jobs had transformed Pixar into a digital animation studio and became a billionaire overnight when he took it public. Then, in late 1996, he returned to Apple as interim chief executive and has orchestrated a stunning turnaround.
So it is that, with technologies advancing at the headlong pace known as Internet time, one accomplishment can often blur into the next.
"When you think of Jean-Paul Sartre's observation that there are no second acts in life, you realize that it simply doesn't apply in Silicon Valley," said Fred Hoar, a longtime public relations executive and a founder of the Band of Angels, a group of independent private investors in the Valley.
For some people, however, Silicon Valley's rewards come at an unjustifiable cost. Most of them share a passion for the technology that sustains the industry, but somehow lose their sense of fun in this work. They also become alienated from a culture driven by values they consider shallow.
Following are the stories of three men whose second act was to walk off the stage.
 
An Epiphany
In Heaven, in a Loft In Beautiful Prague
For Geoff Goodfellow, 42, a tall, thin man with short blond hair, life after Silicon Valley unfolds far from the world of endless business meetings, late nights and 90-hour weeks.
As a teen-ager, after discovering the Internet's predecessor, called the Arpanet, Mr. Goodfellow asked for free access to the computers of SRI International, the Menlo Park research center that helped give birth to the Internet, and began spending time there, helping to maintain the SRI computer systems. He became a computer hacker, dropped out of high school, never to return, and in 1988, from a spare bedroom in his Menlo Park apartment, started the Radiomail Corporation with the goal of providing nationwide wireless electronic mail.
But in 1996, after working first as chief executive and then as chairman, and after a long struggle with his investors, Mr. Goodfellow left Radiomail. Although his shares in the company had not made him fabulously wealthy, he walked away with enough money to live well. Working as a consultant, he immediately made plans to start several new companies, each of which he thought could grow into new industries related to music and the Internet.
Then, last year, while on vacation, Mr. Goodfellow, who is single, made a brief stop in Prague that changed his life. It was, he said, like meeting someone and knowing immediately that this was the person he would marry.
"When you have found the most beautiful and cultured city on the planet, it changes your view of the world," he said. He reflected on his life and work in Silicon Valley, and even though he had a network of friends there, he sold his home and rented a loft in a city he had visited for only a few days. "I've arrived in heaven," he said, "and I didn't have to die first to get here."
Mr. Goodfellow's disaffection with life in Silicon Valley had been building for some time. In 1996 he moved to a loft in San Francisco and began commuting to the Valley, spending his evenings frequenting the city's fine restaurants and taking in the underground music scene.
Life in Prague has changed his outlook on many things, he said. "In the Valley there are these nervous battles for power and money," he said. "And the hype -- it is a culture that has no culture."
Not that Mr. Goodfellow has totally abandoned his old world. He typically wakes at 6 A.M. and shuffles to his portable computer. By then it is 9 P.M. in Silicon Valley, and he catches up on technology developments by way of E-mail and a complex set of electronic tools that monitor the news services.
Still an inveterate news hound, he reads four newspapers each morning on the Internet and at lunch catches up on two more, The International Herald Tribune and The Financial Times.
He left Silicon Valley a wealthy man, by Czech standards, and in Prague he has become a full-time investor, with the booming United States stock market making him richer. He returns home from lunch by 3:30 each afternoon to track before-hours American trading and then uses the World Wide Web to do research and to make investments until leaving at 6 or 7 for dinner. Later each evening, he returns to monitor the New York market close.
He now calls Prague home, has a new set of mostly Czech friends and says he is far more at peace with himself.
"If you can imagine life with zero hassles, zero bureaucracy and zero conflict," he said, "that's the environment I live in."
He still believes that "the journey is the reward," but with a twist. "That was my goal," he said. "But sometimes when you start a journey your goal changes in midcourse and the currency in the reward can change as well."
 
A Re-evaluation
When Happiness Is A Suburban Forest
Steven Edelman is more philosophical than bitter about the intense world he left behind six years ago.
Having succeeded in two eras of the personal-computer industry, Mr. Edelman lives today in a forest in Beaverton, Ore., a suburb of Portland. His decision to leave Silicon Valley, after founding and successfully running a disk-drive and graphics company, was prompted partly by a desire to get away from the urban bustle. But in a sense, Mr. Edelman, 45, who once had a waist-length ponytail but now favors short hair, jeans and T-shirts, was dropping out even when he arrived in the Valley.
For him, as for Mr. Goodfellow, computing began as a passion and only later became a profession.
Mr. Edelman, a native of Long Island, graduated from Cornell and then got into the personal-computer industry on the East Coast in the mid-70's, when it was still a business for hobbyists. Just as Steve Jobs had phoned David Packard, then chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, to ask for parts for the original Apple computer, Mr. Edelman called Mr. Faggin to ask him for a microprocessor chip to help get him started.
His first company, Ithaca Intersystems, sold an early microcomputer and software. But the hobbyist era of computing was soon over. And as the industry started growing rapidly, Mr. Edelman, fascinated by new design tools for developing ever more complex semiconductor chips, moved to Silicon Valley.
With a small amount of savings to survive on, he spent his days at the electrical engineering department at Stanford University, often sitting in on courses on the design of advanced circuits. He was there so often that Stanford officials mistook him for a junior professor. After learning that he had no official ties to the university, they tried to persuade him to become a graduate student, but ultimately gave up and provided him an office and access to a computer in exchange for the work he was doing in designing chips.
In early 1984, while he was involved in yet another design project at Stanford, Apple introduced the Macintosh. "I went to a friend's house, and we took it apart," he said. "I thought to myself, 'My God, this machine can be upgraded!' "
The AST Research Corporation was already thriving as a maker of peripheral equipment for I.B.M.-compatible personal computers, and Mr. Edelman knew there would soon be a similar peripheral market related to the Macintosh. He became a co-founder of Supermac Inc., and it grew rapidly by selling components like expansion disks and graphics adapters for the Mac.
Over the next five years the growth of Supermac made Mr. Edelman a multimillionaire, but it also left him disenchanted about a world that seemed to have much in common with the power and wealth of New York and Los Angeles. For him the Valley seemed to be the new Hollywood, full of stars and with its own pecking order that forced people to play social games that didn't interest him.
"Silicon Valley had become the kind of place where if you wanted to be somebody you had to be wildly successful," he said.
When the Macintosh market began to lose ground to Windows and Intel-based PC's, Mr. Edelman's company did not make the leap to the PC-compatible market and began to shrink, eventually merging with Radius Inc., another Silicon Valley company. He decided that it was time to re-evaluate more than just his business. "So many people were making so much money I found myself wondering how I was doing," he said. "I began to wonder, 'Is this a good way to spend my life?' "
His answer was no. So he and his wife, Hyun Suh, who is a physician, moved to the forest near Portland.
He now spends part of his days as an entrepreneurial investor, freely discusses business ideas with callers and still does some tinkering with computers. But he does not miss the rat race, or what he sees as the Silicon Valley idea that your worth is measured by the success of your last start-up. Instead, he has a life, with lots of time to rub shoulders with the nondigerati while engaging in activities like hiking, water-skiing -- in a wetsuit, no matter the season -- and white-water kayaking.
"Getting away from the Valley," he said, "gave me a fresh appreciation of the fact that there are a lot of Americans who make $22,000 a year and they're worth something."
 
A Distant Freedom
Redoubt With Crane In the Swiss Alps
Like Steven Edelman, John Walker, founder of Autodesk Inc., the software publisher based in San Rafael, Calif., has his roots in the first personal computers. But eight years ago, he left the country because he had decided that the prospect of starting another company "wasn't fun."
A first-generation computer hacker, one who helped create the personal-computer industry, Mr. Walker, 49, was co-founder of a microcomputer business, Marinchip Systems, in the 1970's. But by 1981 an industry shakeout was under way and Marinchip was running short of capital.
So, in 1982 he and a small group of programmer friends struck on the idea of creating Autodesk Inc. Their flagship product, Autocad, grew out a pooled investment of $60,000 and became a general-purpose drafting and engineering program.
Along the way, he became worried about his weight problem, leading him to write a book called "The Hacker's Diet: How to Lose Weight and Hair Through Stress and Poor Nutrition." In the introduction, he noted that he had gone from 215 pounds to 145. Today he looks the part of the studious computer researcher, with dark-framed glasses and a pale complexion.
Autodesk blossomed into a multibillion-dollar enterprise, with several thousand employees, and it still holds a commanding share of the market for a variety of design tools used by engineers and architects. Mr. Walker, though, remained involved in the day-to-day management only through the company's first years, and readily acknowledges now that he had no particular skill or interest in managing such a large company. In 1986, a year after the company went public, he stepped down as chief executive.
Several years later, he also relinquished the role of chairman; around that time, his Autodesk holdings were worth more than $30 million. In 1991 he left California and took up residence in Switzerland with his wife, Roxie, and three dogs, two cats, a horse and an undetermined number of goldfish. They live near Zurich in a house adjoining a former hydraulics factory that he has converted into an office-workshop, a rambling space that came with everything from a generator that could power a small city to an industrial-strength crane. "Until you have a crane," he said recently, "you never knew that you needed one."
At first, he tried to run a remote research and development laboratory for Autodesk from his hydraulics castle, but an effort to help the company enter the factory design and automation software field fell short.
As a prolific writer, and with a wide range of technical and scientific interests, he has dabbled in a variety of projects. He maintains a Web site (www.fourmilab.ch) that offers everything from his history of Autodesk to his diet book (which he says has been downloaded 4.6 million times) to an Internet telephone program called Speak Freely that he wrote after the Internet took off.
Mr. Walker keeps his connections to the original Silicon Valley hacker community, returning for the annual Hackers Conference, which is attended by some of the nation's best programmers.
He has also engaged in a wide variety of personal projects, including using the World Wide Web to test theories of parapsychology. He is not a believer but takes a scientific interest in this field, with one current test trying to determine if humans sitting at computers connected to the Internet can exchange messages through mere thoughts.
Like both Mr. Goodfellow and Mr. Edelman, he maintains that his distance from the Valley has given him a freedom he would never have had amid the intense competition there.
Mr. Walker says he does not understand the passion that drives many in the Valley to start over again and again, whether they are successes or failures. He still remembers the struggle of starting Autodesk in the early 1980's and being turned down, he says, by every venture capitalist in California.
"What surprises me, is the compulsiveness of it," he said. I didn't find it enjoyable enough that I'd want to do it again."
And what about all those who keep coming back for more? The answer may be that the Valley is an ego-driven place and that many simply cannot tear themselves away.
As Paul Saffo, an industry consultant at the Institute for the Future, a research center in Menlo Park, put it: "There is this pressure to prove yourself over and over again in Silicon Valley. People wonder, 'Was it me or was it luck?' "

Learning to Ride the Brazilian Roller-Coaster

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE lesson of Brazil's two devaluations last week is simple: If you are invested in emerging markets, accept the roller-coaster ride and make them only a small part of a well-diversified global portfolio. Or get out and stay out until you are sure that the uncertainty and volatility have settled down to a manageable level.
But what happened in Brazil last week is precisely the kind of reversal that tempts some investors to ignore such advice. 
 Yes, that's right, two devaluations: A limited, 9 percent devaluation on Wednesday, which sent the Brazilian stock market down 14.5 percent in two days. And a full devaluation on Friday, allowing the real to float freely. That made investors believe that Brazil's high interest rates could fall, opening the way to a 33.4 percent rebound.
It's anyone's guess what happens from here, though it is clear that Brazil's problems are not over.
Desmond Lachman, the director of emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney, said the full devaluation was positive, because lower interest rates would slow the economic decline that has started in Brazil. Even so, he said, the Friday rally was in part a pop, because investors were caught expecting the stock market to fall further. The future, he added, depended on whether the Government could impose the spending cuts and tax changes still needed to reorganize the economy.
Brazil is in a position to build upon this devaluation, Mr. Lachman said. "But can they deliver on the budget?" he asked. "Can they get the implementation process back on track?"
There is also uncertainty about how the United States and the International Monetary Fund will react. The devaluation violated Brazil's agreement with the I.M.F. that brought the country $41.5 billion in aid last fall. But the I.M.F. did say on Friday that letting the real float freely was better than trying to defend a limited devaluation. The devaluation also raises the threat of debt defaults, because it increases Brazil's repayment costs.
Warren Howe, vice president of the international equities division of Bankers Trust, said he and his colleagues were waiting to see what happened next. "You certainly don't want to do it in a rush," he said of jumping backing into Brazil and the rest of Latin America. But then, Bankers Trust decided some time ago to reduce its exposure to the region.
That process began in June and July of last year. At the time, Mr. Howe said, $250 million was invested in Latin American stocks through Bankers Trust's international, emerging-market and Latin American-focused funds. Now the amount, aside from funds dedicated exclusively to the region, is down to "very little."
While Bankers Trust money managers were getting out, mutual fund investors were fleeing, too. During the same period, there was a net outflow of $661 million from Latin American funds followed by AMG Data Services. That was 40 percent of the total decline in assets in those funds. The rest was from the plunge in the stock markets.
Both Bankers Trust and those risk-averse mutual fund investors looked pretty smart until October and November, when Latin American stock markets began to rebound in the wake of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and the assembling of Brazil's big rescue package. Both moves helped stave off what investors worldwide feared the most at the time: a devaluation of the Brazilian currency.
And up those Latin American markets went. The Morgan Stanley Capital International index of Latin American funds surged 38.7 percent from its low on Sept. 10 to Jan. 7, the day Brazil's stock market began the collapse that resulted in last week's currency devaluations. Brazil's Bovespa index of 56 stocks climbed even more -- 54 percent.
But in the six trading days through Thursday, Brazil was off 31 percent.
Then there was Friday. But don't kick yourself too quickly for missing the 33.4 percent rebound. That rally was in Brazil's suddenly cheaper currency, the real. In dollar terms, the Friday gain was 23 percent. Or, put another way, the Brazilian market on Thursday was down 31.7 percent in dollar terms for the year -- and after Friday's rally was down just 16 percent.
So Mr. Howe and many mutual fund investors who got out of Latin America still look smart. "It's been a very good move in the end," Mr. Howe said. But he acknowledged that "we were hurting in October and November, when the markets moved up 40 percent or 50 percent."
There was another twinge on Friday, but he still said, "I don't think you should have gotten too excited."

Burping Cows and Space Toilets. Beam Me Up, Mr. Speaker!

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
PEOPLE just tuning in to Washington over the past year of sex, pizza and judicial racing stripes could be forgiven for wondering: Is Government usually this diverting?
Of course, it's all in the eye of the beholder. But don't decide for yourself until after you've sampled the one-minute House floor speeches of Representative James A. Traficant Jr., Democrat of Ohio. 
 One-minute addresses are a House tradition, affording members the opportunity at the beginning of the day to hold forth briefly on any topic they wish -- yielding a sound bite and added verbiage for the Congressional Record regardless of whether anybody present is paying much attention. The speeches will resume shortly when the new Congress takes up normal business.
When they do, rest assured that Mr. Traficant will rise to be recognized. Over his more than 11 years in the House, the pro-labor, pro-school-prayer ex-county sheriff has turned the short address into his trademark, a verbal blunderbuss loaded with inanities to blast what he sees as Washington's absurdities.
Usually he punctuates his remarks with a request to be "beamed up," a la "Star Trek," to someplace where there's more intelligent life. Here are excerpts. TOM KUNTZ
 
On the Economy
 Let us tell it like it is: When you hold this economy to your nosey, this economy does not smell so rosy. If there is any consolation to the American workers, I never heard of anyone in America committing suicide by jumping out of a basement window. I yield back all of the propaganda on this great economy.
--June 10, 1997
 
On Nike's Asian Factories
 Mr. Speaker, I say it is time for the American consumers to tell Nike to take a hikey and buy some American shoes before, so help me God, we are all working in some sweatshop.
--Aug. 2, 1996
 
On Nafta
 Mr. Speaker, the White House says Nafta the North American Free Trade Agreement is creating new and exciting jobs. I did some research on those jobs: zipper trimmer, brassiere tender, jelly roller, bosom presser, chicken sexer, sanitary napkin specialist and a pantyhose crotch closer machine operator. That is what I call exciting jobs, Mr. Speaker.
--May 13, 1997
 
On Regulation
Mr. Speaker, the Lord's prayer is 66 words, the Gettysburg Address is 286 words, the Declaration of Independence is 1,322 words. U.S. regulations on the sale of cabbage -- that is right, cabbage -- is 27,000 words. Now, if that is not enough to give Hulk Hogan's dictionary a hernia, check this out. Regulatory red tape in America costs taxpayers $400 billion every year, over $4,000 each year, every year, year in, year out, for every family. Beam me up.
--July 29, 1998
 
On Foreign Policy
 Let us check this out: China gets $60 billion in M.F.N. most-favored-nation status from Uncle Sam. Russia gets $15 billion in foreign aid from Uncle Sam. In exchange, Uncle Sam gets nuclear missiles pointed at our cities, two tape decks and three cases of vodka. Beam me up. I say our national security brain trust needs a proctologist on staff.
--April 1, 1998
 
On China
 Mr. Speaker, I think it is time to tell it like it is. When it comes to China, we have gone from "Speak softly and carry a big stick" to "Take the fifth and carry a toothpick." Beam me up.
--June 22, 1998
 
On Reinventing Government
 Mr. Speaker, the Vice President said America needs to reinvent Government. To find out why, the G.A.O. called the R.T.C., the I.T.C. and the P.M.S. They did not know.
The G.A.O. then called the D.O.D., the D.O.T. and the D.D.T. They did not know. The G.A.O. then called the C.I.A., the D.I.A., the E.P.A. and the I.U.D. They did not know. Then they asked the O.M.B. to find out. The O.M.B. created a whole new program called the Government Analysis Service, known as GAS.
--Sept. 3, 1993
 
On God
 Mr. Speaker, a new report says only 7 percent of scientists believe in God. That is right. And the reason they gave was that the scientists were "super smart." Unbelievable. Most of these absent-minded professors cannot find the toilet. Mr. Speaker, I have one question for these wise guys to constipate over: How can some thing come from no thing?
And while they digest that, Mr. Speaker, let us tell it like it is. Put these super-cerebral master debaters in some foxhole with bombs bursting all around them, and I guarantee they will not be praying to Frankenstein. Beam me up here.
--Aug. 3, 1998
 
On Space Toilets
 Mr. Speaker, space. The final frontier. The search for new life, new civilizations and now new toilets. That is right: NASA has a $30 million space toilet. You strap yourself in and 12 high-pressure air jets aid your relief. . . . Mr. Speaker, I say is time to call out the Roto-Rooter man. . . . Beam me up, Scottie, nature is calling.
--Jan. 23, 1993
 
On Russia's President
Mr. Speaker, in 1993, Boris Yeltsin fell off a stage in Germany. In 1994, Boris could not get off his plane in Ireland. In 1996 Boris came up missing for seven consecutive days, unexplained, before an election. In 1997, he forgot about a meeting with Vice President Al Gore. Yesterday, he fired his entire Cabinet. The White House says they are monitoring it. . . .
I say monitor this. Boris Yeltsin does not need monitors. Boris Yeltsin needs Alcoholics Anonymous. I say let us save our foreign aid and let us sent some counselors over to take care of this guy.
--March 24, 1998
 
On Flag Desecration
Mr. Speaker, in many cities and towns across America it is illegal to kiss in public. It is illegal in some places to ride a skateboard. It is illegal to burn trash or leaves. It is illegal to yodel or sing in public and it is illegal, Mr. Speaker, to tamper with a mailbox. However, in America, it is completely legal to burn the flag, completely legal to desecrate the flag. It is even legal, Mr. Speaker, to urinate on Old Glory. In the words of a Russian comedian, "America -- What a country."
--June 7, 1995
 
On Belching Cows
Mr. Speaker, talking about garbage, the E.P.A. is spending $210,000 to study cow belching and its effects on global warming. Here is how it works.
Cows will wear backpacks and have hoses connected to their mouths.
Tell me, Mr. Speaker, what happens if the backpack is so tight and instead of an oral emission, Elsie goes 7.0 on the Richter scale? Will the President declare a garbage emergency . . .? Or how about maybe appoint a Congressional Bovine Burp Task Force. Or maybe the E.P.A. will require -- think about it -- scrubbers on udders, bag hoses on nostrils. I think we ought to take a cattle prod to the E.P.A.
--Sept. 26, 1991
 
On Radioactive Beagles
 Madam Speaker Barbara B. Kennelly, the Connecticut Democrat filling in as Speaker , the remains of 800 beagles and 1,700 tons of their radioactive urine and feces will be buried at a nuclear site in the State of Washington.
The dead dogs have been in freezers since 1950. They were part of a study to assess the damage of radioactive fallout. The study is now conclusive: Radioactive fallout is fatal, and canines subject thereto died. But the point is, Madam Speaker, the funeral is going to cost $22 million.
Tell me, are they going to ship the bodies by limo? Are they going to have gold tombstones for every hound?
With 37 million people in America without health insurance, 9 million people unemployed, I would like to say that our Government is spending $22 million to erect a giant fire hydrant as a mausoleum to dead beagles.
I think that says it all, Madam Speaker: America's domestic priorities have gone to the dogs.
--Oct. 9, 1991
 
On the Government Shutdown
 Mr. Speaker, something does not add up. . . . Experts say, "Don't worry, America. If the Federal Government shuts down, only nonessential workers will be furloughed." . . .
Now the dictionary says nonessential means not necessary. Now, if that is the case, did anyone around here ever stop to think that if Congress did not borrow money to hire nonessential workers, Congress would not have to borrow more money to pay nonessential workers and Congress would not have to shut down?
Beam me up, Mr. Speaker. Maybe, just maybe, the Congress of the United States is a little nonessential.

HEADLINE: The World: A Case of Open and Shut;
As the World Takes a New Look, It's the Same Old Cuba

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
AS he traveled from one end of Cuba to another a year ago, often with Fidel Castro at his side or sitting attentively in the audience, Pope John Paul II had one overriding message. In its most succinct form it was that Cuba "needs to open herself to the world, and the world needs to draw closer to Cuba."
Since then, the world has heeded the Pontiff's directive, often using his words as justification; even the United States took a few modest steps in that direction on Jan. 5, making it somewhat easier for Americans to send money and food to Cuba. 
 Mr. Castro and the Cuban Communist Party, on the other hand, have largely ignored the first half of the papal exhortation.
Early this month, Mr. Castro marked the 40th anniversary of his seizure of power with a speech in which he defiantly maintained that "the revolution has just begun." Under him, Cuba's human rights record remains dismal. Economic reforms like those carried out by China are stalled too; this promises only additional austerity for the average Cuban, and it has made the country less attractive to foreign investors.
After the Pope's visit, Mr. Castro freed more than 300 people held in Cuban jails, and at the time optimists suggested that the move might be the start of a relaxation. But as is so often the case when Mr. Castro is involved, there was less to the action than met the eye.
Many of those released were common criminals, not political prisoners. And many, human rights groups say, were freed on condition they leave Cuba, a procedure the authorities often apply against dissidents after a spell in prison.
Furthermore, 18 months after they were arrested on charges of sedition, Cuba's most prominent political prisoners remain in jail, still awaiting trial and refused habeas corpus. Felix Bonne, Rene Gomez Manzano, Vladimiro Roca and Marta Beatriz Roque, leaders of the Internal Dissidence Working Group, were jailed after publishing a document titled "The Homeland Belongs to Us All," in which they urged Mr. Castro and the Communist Party to allow "an independent and impartial legal system that would protect the liberties and rights of the individual and the practice of political pluralism."
OTHERS, who were released after having been held on trumped-up charges, could face jail again, since Cuba's legal system continues to lack even the most elemental guarantees of due process and no effort is being made to provide such protections. Hector Palacios Ruiz, for instance, had been imprisoned for possessing "enemy propaganda." His crime was to attempt to distribute copies of a declaration Mr. Castro signed at a Latin American summit meeting, promising steps toward full representative democracy.
"I do not see any will, sign or political gesture showing that the Cuban authorities are willing to move forward to make some serious progress," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch in the Americas. "The harassment against dissidents, human rights activists or anyone else attempting to exercise the most basic rights of association and expression continues exactly the same."
Even in the area of religious freedom, where some progress has taken place, significant restrictions remain. Mr. Castro's decision to allow the celebration of Christmas was treated by the state-controlled press as an act of revolutionary generosity. But such gains for religion result from case-by-case negotiations, not a blanket recognition of a right to worship freely. Parish priests find many local authorities still unwilling to allow processions on the feast days of saints.
Nor has the Government offered much latitude for the incipient private sector that the Clinton Administration said its new measures are intended to help. In 1996, more than 200,000 people were officially listed as "self-employed," and Government officials were suggesting that hundreds of thousands more would be encouraged to take that course.
Since then, though, the number of people working for themselves with the official approval of the Government has declined substantially, perhaps by nearly a quarter, and some occupations that were formerly approved for free enterprise have now been proscribed. Confiscatory tax policies have been used to drive out of business many of those who were beginning to compete with the state, like owners of small private restaurants called paladares.
"They've let everything play out, but they have not added any new openings," said Philip Peters, author of "Islands of Enterprise," a study of the Cuban private sector. "Certainly, there is no interest in letting it expand, at least not immediately."
THE obsession with control helps explain the strongly negative reaction to the Clinton Administration's limited initiative. Jose Luis Rodriguez, the Minister of the Economy, initially dismissed the moves as "crumbs," as if to deny their significance. But Ricardo Alarcon, head of the rubber-stamp parliament and Mr. Castro's favorite mouthpiece on relations with the United States, later described the measures as a "subversive and counterrevolutionary" attempt to destabilize the Cuban Government by going around it -- "a way of manufacturing traitors."
Based on the oration Mr. Castro delivered in Santiago on Jan. 1 to mark his 40 years in power, Cubans have no choice but to look forward to more of the same. Of Cuba's 11 million people, 7 million have been born since 1959, Mr. Castro proudly pointed out in the speech. But they are led, as he also noted, by someone "who dresses the same, who thinks the same, who dreams the same" today as he did when he came down from the Sierra Maestra."

HEADLINE: The World;
Brazil Topples Off the Verge

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes
Goes "Aaah"
--"The Girl From Ipanema"
LIKE the sensual strains of that old bossa nova tune, Brazil enchants. And it has been attracting treasure hunters of all stripes for centuries. 
 From the Portuguese who colonized Brazil between 1500 and 1822 to the Wall Street money managers who made the country a darling of emerging market investors during the last several years, Brazil's economic promise is a perennial lure. But, as Brazilians like to joke, theirs is the country of the future -- and always will be.
Brazil's most recent bid for economic stardom ended in disappointment last week. On Wednesday, the country devalued its currency, the real, and announced the resignation of its central bank president, as it continues to struggle with excessive debt, sky-high interest rates and fiscal austerity measures mandated by the International Monetary Fund.
In so doing, Brazil became the latest victim of the global financial contagion that broke out in Southeast Asia about 18 months ago and spread to Russia last summer. As was the case when those economies went into a tailspin, Brazil's travails touched off international concern about whether its problems will spread to Argentina and Mexico and ultimately damage the United States economy.
By the end of the week Brazil's stock market, showing all the effervescence of a bottle of champagne, had bubbled back up again. Even so, this huge, resource-rich country, which shares a border with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador, never quite seems to realize the gilded dreams imposed upon it.
"The quest for El Dorado has been a feature of Brazilian life ever since it was controlled as a colony by Portugal," said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a research group in Washington. "Every generation there are miraculous expectations for the Brazilian economy. Brazil's financial barons have shared these dreams, but they haven't been based on economic reality."
Although Brazil is home to the world's eighth-largest economy, it is hobbled by widespread poverty and unequal distribution of wealth. And Brazilians, long accustomed to Government corruption, typically expect little from the grand economic schemes launched over the years.
Back in the 1970's, when the Nixon Administration trumpeted Brazil as the next great superpower, huge state projects sponsored by the World Bank and others were seen as one way for Brazil to tap its hidden riches. For example, the Trans-Amazonian Highway, stretching from coast to jungle, was built to exploit the wealth of the interior. But it was rammed through without regard for its impact on the rain forest or the indigenous population. And those Brazilians who migrated to the interior on the highway found largely useless tracts of land.
EVEN with such huge miscues, Brazil enjoyed relatively robust economic growth from about 1965 to 1980, when oil price shocks and the Latin America debt crisis helped bring an end to Brazil's flirtation with superpower status. Foreign investment shriveled and the Brazilian Government continued to run up huge debts as inflation spiraled out of control, soaring as high as 2,400 percent in 1993, according to Jeffrey Schott, a specialist in international trade at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
With inflation strangling the economy, the newest method for realizing Brazil's economic promise was unveiled in 1994, when the Government effectively pegged the real to the dollar. The idea was to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on the money supply. Tight money, Government cutbacks and open markets, of course, constitute the miracle cure being peddled all over the world by American politicians and financiers. But while inflation has been brought under control in Brazil, some economists see another ill that has been overlooked time and again -- wealth inequality.
DESPITE decades of economic experimentation, much of Brazil remains desperately poor. The wealthiest 10 percent of Brazilians receive about 48 percent of the country's income, according to the World Bank, while the poorest 10 percent receive less than 1 percent.
And Brazil has tied its weak domestic economy to exports and fickle overseas investors -- a dangerous dependence in a world in which financial crises are quick to take hold.
"Brazil has changed a great deal superficially, but for the poor, who represent the bulk of the population, life has changed very little," said Gillette Hall, an economist at the University of Oregon in Eugene. "Economic liberalization for Brazil, as for many other developing countries, has meant an increasing dependence on world export markets and international capital flows. That in turn has left it prey to the vagaries of the global economy, which are now coming home to roost."
Brazil found itself in a corner last fall after the Russian economy collapsed. Investors fled Brazil and speculators took aim at the real. Brazil raised interest rates to defend its currency, choking domestic growth and causing its foreign exchange reserves to dwindle.
Brazil hopes that letting the real fall against the dollar will boost exports and bring interest rates down. The flip side of this strategy is that Brazilian borrowers owing dollar-denominated loans will find it more expensive to pay off debts, raising the specter of messy defaults.
So, for now, Brazil's vaunted economic promise is as it has always been. Elusive.

The Case of the Spies Without a Country

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT this murderous century, diplomats and dreamers have envisioned a world in which nations would transcend their boundaries, dispel their differences and band together to preserve peace against dictators and despots.
This vision of world federation helped create the United Nations. And it engendered the United Nations Special Commission, charged with disarming Iraq after the 1991 gulf war. The commission, known as Unscom, became an international intelligence service for the new world order. It was the first of its kind -- and, it now seems, maybe the last. 
 For the more secret its work became, and the more estranged the enforcers of disarmament grew from each other, the less Unscom could withstand accusations of serving the last superpower, its main supplier of spycraft: the United States.
More than 7,000 weapons inspectors from around the world served Unscom over seven years, spying on Iraq, surveying its military and industrial plants, trying to do what smart bombs could not: destroy nuclear, biological, chemical and missile programs hidden by Saddam Hussein.
Ideally, intelligence can achieve victory without war. But espionage is a uniquely national enterprise. While nations may share interests, spy services rarely do. "There are friendly states, but no friendly intelligence services," notes a spokesman for Russia's foreign intelligence agency. When spies from two countries shake hands, they are often trying to pick one another's pockets.
When the going got tough for Unscom, it sought American spy technology. American intelligence gladly provided it but would not share it with the world. The more secretive Unscom's work became, the less open it could be with its member nations.
"If secret information is open to all member states, it won't work," said Gordon C. Oehler, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency's Nonproliferation Center. "If you let in the French, the Chinese, the Russians -- that would kill it."
So much for international cooperation. In March the special commission adopted an American eavesdropping system so secret that only a handful of Americans, British, Australians and New Zealanders had full access to it.
This, understandably, led to tensions, notably between the Americans on one side and the Russians, the Chinese and the French on the other.
The special commission began as a unique experiment. It was assembled quickly after the 1991 gulf war, when Iraq was shattered and powerless and the world seemed united in the determination to disarm that country. It assumed unconditional power to do its work. "It brought together communities -- intelligence, military, non-proliferation -- from around the world, and it brought new thinking about how to do inspections," said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, who served as a nuclear-weapons inspector in Iraq. Its leaders thought they could disarm Iraq in no time -- "possibly as little as a year," its chairman, Richard Butler, said last week.
But, as Mr. Butler conceded, "it has taken eight years, and the job is still not completely finished."
Not until 1995 did the inspectors understand that Iraq had an extraordinary system to hide its secret weapons programs. Now three more years have gone by trying to pierce that shield. And as it turned out, the secret weapons -- the foundation of President Hussein's power, the ace in the hole with which he might someday trump the world -- were hidden by the same soldiers and spies whose duty it is to make sure that the Iraqi dictator dies peacefully in bed. That made piercing the Iraqi veil far more difficult than anyone had expected, and prompted the Americans to roll out the particularly sophisticated and sensitive equipment that yielded a a product they were reluctant to share too widely.
"Iraq is a sovereign nation, and there are limits to what you can do if that nation wants to hide things from you," Mr. Oehler said. "The best you can do is make it very painful for them if they won't go along." Iraq has endured great pain -- including perhaps $150 billion in lost oil revenues -- to defy disarmament.
"The lesson is you can't disarm a country unless you're willing to occupy it and forbid them the trappings of a sovereign nation, such as a military force and the right to built that force," Mr. Oehler said.
But no one has been willing to conquer Iraq in the name of world peace. And America's French and Russian partners on the Security Council are increasingly eager to resume business with Baghdad, which owes them billions of dollars.
Now the international coalition assembled by President Bush for the gulf war has dwindled to two nations: the United States and Britain. Their four-day attack on Iraq in December was "the first time in history that a nation has gone to war to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction," said Joseph Cirincione, director of the nonproliferation project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
If so, it failed, said Scott Ritter, the former marine who resigned from Unscom in August to protest what he called a lack of American support. His accusations have helped raise suspicions that the Americans used information supposedly gathered for Unscom to precisely target Iraqi units closely linked to Saddam Hussein.
THE attack was a final blow with which "the U.S. killed Unscom," Mr. Ritter said. "The U.S. brought its own credibility and objectivity into question. And the U.S. lost a lot of its moral authority to lead on this issue."
Now Unscom is banished from Iraq and bloodied by international infighting. The United States is back to taking potshots at Iraq, playing Globocop, a role that alienates it from much of the rest of the world. America's allies in the region are fed up with Mr. Hussein, but their patience for American bombing raids is wearing thin.
Mr. Butler bravely hopes for a new and improved Unscom. But now the French and the Russians are proposing lifting the oil embargo on Iraq in exchange for a new system of overseeing Iraqi weaponry -- and the Russians want to abolish the special commission altogether. The United States is against those proposals. In any case, Iraq will not submit to more inspections unless it is freed entirely from the eight-year-old economic embargo.
The experiment in international intelligence is over. No one knows how a new arms control regime can be installed in Iraq. And no one knows how much more pain Iraq is willing to endure to hide its secret cache.
Today, on the eighth anniversary of the launching of the gulf war, Iraq's chances of rebuilding a secret arsenal look good. The future for world federations devoted to disarmament looks bleak.

HEADLINE: The World: Raising the Stakes;
American Pay Rattles Foreign Partners

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
AS the global economy spawns more mergers of American and foreign companies, inequities in the pay of top executives quickly become apparent. In the spirit of compromise that marks a new marriage, the lower-paid officers see their pay rise to the levels of their better-paid colleagues -- almost always the Americans -- and American-style capitalism claims a little more foreign turf.
The American way of compensating top executives -- with opportunity for tremendous riches from bonuses and incentives tied to a rising stock price -- certainly pays better. Some experts view American-style pay as a vitamin that can jump-start the performance of sluggish economies abroad. But others see it as a virus that spreads greed and excess. 
 A growing number of companies are joining the experiment. When Daimler-Benz announced in May that it would acquire the Chrysler Corporation, the chairman of Daimler, Jurgen E. Schrempp, was earning much less than Robert J. Eaton, his counterpart at Chrysler, a substantially smaller company. Last week, Daimler-Benz announced a new system for paying its top 250 executives: About 25 to 30 percent of their compensation would be fixed and the rest would be in performance bonuses and other incentives.
Many companies are grappling with the issue. Last year, Bertelsmann, the German publisher, acquired Random House; Amoco agreed to a takeover by British Petroleum; Deutsche Bank made a deal to buy Bankers Trust, and Scottish Power agreed to buy Pacificorp.
These foreign buyers generally have little choice but to adopt American ways of compensating all their top executives. Key executives from each of the merging companies expect to get roughly the same pay. Chrysler executives, for example, would quickly start job-hunting around Detroit if they were forced to take a cut.
In a sense, the richer executive payroll for foreign companies is the price of entry for joining the United States economy, where Daimler-Benz and others presumably expect to get better returns than if they had invested elsewhere.
These simple economic explanations certainly help foreign executives deflect suggestions that they may be motivated to merge with an American partner to help boost their own pay. But many consultants who advise companies on compensation matters say that many foreign executives are uneasy about the shift, even though they may benefit personally.
"There is movement, but there is resistance as well," said Robert J. Freedman, a compensation expert at Towers Perrin, a consulting firm.
Proponents of American-style pay packages for top executives say they are a big reason the American economy and the stock market have been so vibrant this decade. Executive pay is high, they typically concede. But chief executives in the United States, like professional athletes, generally have short careers. And talented executives, they argue, can often add so much value to a company that their outlandish pay, in the grand scheme of things, amounts to a small tip.
"If you pay your management with stock-based incentives, they will be very motivated to do everything they can to get it right," said Ira T. Kay, the head of the global compensation practice at Watson Wyatt, a consulting firm.
An implicit message in this model, however, is that an honest day's pay for an honest day's work is not enough to get executives to do their best; they have to have a gold carrot dangling in front of them.
IN fact, many companies, in their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, justify high compensation for top officers with that argument. For example, McDonald's executive compensation program, according to a recent filing, "has been designed to attract, energize, reward and retain superior talent." If the pay packages were any smaller, this language suggests, the executives would somehow be less energized, and more willing to bolt for a higher-paying competitor.
Some public companies have tried a different way. Ben & Jerry's, the ice cream company, and Herman Miller, a maker of office furniture, used to say that there should be a limit to the gap between the highest- and lowest-paid workers (at the ice cream company, it was 7 times higher back in 1994; at Herman Miller, it was 20 times higher in 1996). But they have since tossed out these rules and joined the bidding war for executive talent.
The cult of the American business superstar, which has delivered hundreds of millions of dollars to professional managers (who, in some cases, send the tab for personal financial planning advice back to their company), has historically offended the sensibilities of people in many foreign countries, where the best and the brightest pursued careers in fields other than business.
In Britain, for example, executive pay has moved further toward the American system than most other countries. A study of the 20 largest companies in the United States and Britain by William M. Mercer, a consulting firm, found, among other things, that the base salaries of the top American executives were 38 percent higher, bonuses were more than five times higher and the value of their stock options was incomparably higher.
"There's a lot of widespread public unease about the levels of pay in the U.K.," said Tony Groom, a principal in Mercer's executive compensation practice. Business, after all, has not historically been considered a particularly high calling there.
OXFORD University, for example, only recently built a business school, over objections from many quarters that the quest for an M.B.A. was not a legitimate scholarly pursuit.
There are many reasons why executive pay is lower in other countries. Careers and performance, for example, tend to be measured over a much longer term than at American companies. Stock options that last 10 years are called long-term incentives in the United States; many foreign companies use a decade to measure short-term goals.
There is also less jockeying for pay raises outside the United States. James A. Hatch, a partner at Arthur Andersen, recounts the story of a United States office of a Japanese company, where the American secretaries and support staff found that their Japanese bosses were soft touches for tales of personal financial hardship. Pretty soon, Mr. Hatch said, many of the workers were getting salaries two and three times those of workers in other offices.
On a global scale, the marketplace for executives remains quite skewed. But even with pay rising for foreign executives, it seems unlikely that it will catch up to American levels, which are setting new records every year.
"The notion of closing the gap is laughable," said Graef Crystal, editor of the Crystal Report, a newsletter on executive compensation. "When you're 200 laps behind and driving a supercharged Audi, how do you catch up with an American car with 5,000 horsepower?"

HEADLINE: The Gas Company as Social Worker;
Brooklyn Utility Tries Softer Approach to Pursue Unpaid Bills

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Joy Chatel appeared in Civil Court in Brooklyn to account for her $7,000 unpaid gas bill. A contractor had bilked her out of $40,000, she told the judge, forcing her to close her beauty parlor. She had no income and four grandchildren to raise. When her husband died about this same time, she had to barter two years of free hairstyling for a proper funeral.
The judge instructed the lawyers from Brooklyn Union Gas Company to work out a payment plan with Ms. Chatel, and the lawyers handed her account to Kristen Yontz. Ms. Yontz, though, is not a bill collector. She is a social worker, part of the utility's experiment in getting people to pay their bills by helping them straighten out their lives. 
 She has met regularly with Ms. Chatel, advising her on low-interest loans, enrolling her in a support group for grandparents, steering her to Federal emergency heating funds and, significantly for Brooklyn Union, placing her on a flexible repayment plan. Ms. Chatel is still struggling, but she has reopened her beauty parlor and soon plans to rent the top two floors of her building.
"They help me manage," Ms. Chatel said.
Utilities, which for decades have operated as regulated quasi-governmental entities, have offered some aid and emergency help to their low-income customers. Many provide fuel funds, which are emergency grants for customers about to be cut off, as well as weatherization programs and other services. But in these last few years of shrinking government benefits, Brooklyn Union and a small group of other utilities across the nation have gone one step further, into a realm once reserved for nonprofit social service agencies.
At Brooklyn Union, Ms. Yontz is one of four certified social workers in what the utility calls its On Track program; in three years, its clients have reduced their arrears by an average of 27 percent.
In Wisconsin, which has one of the nation's first and most extensive welfare-to-work programs, Wisconsin Gas works with nonprofit agencies to offer a variety of social services for low-income customers in Milwaukee.
And since 1994, a staff of 15 at Baltimore Gas and Electric, including several social workers, has offered counseling, job referrals and other services to about 3,000 low-income Maryland families every year. "As the social service community began to scale back in some of the services they had provided, we began to develop some of the needed assistance programs," said Don Dasher, the utility's director of customer assistance.
But if these initiatives are admired, they are not necessarily imitated. Nationally, as the industry undergoes deregulation, many utilities that once operated as regional monopolies are now cutting costs to prepare for competition. Because low-income programs often do not pay for themselves, some utilities are quietly eliminating them.
Michigan Consolidated Gas Company in Detroit recently discontinued a program much like the one now offered by Brooklyn Union, in part, a company official said, to prepare for deregulation. Last year, the New York State Electric and Gas Corporation, an upstate utility, proposed eliminating one of its two low-income programs.
After criticism from advocacy groups, the New York Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, required the upstate company to continue and expand the program. But advocates for low-income customers warn that other utilities could also try to eliminate such programs.
"What could happen is that an outside supplier of natural gas who is located in, say, Texas, is not committed to the people Brooklyn Union has been serving for the last 20 years," said Jim Benfield, executive director of Campaign to Keep America Warm, an advocacy group for the poor in Washington. "In order to stay competitive, Brooklyn Union is going to have to get out of the social service business."
Despite a buoyant national economy, advocates say, large numbers of low-income customers continue to struggle to meet their utility bills, particularly during the bitter cold of winter. For competitive reasons, Brooklyn Union refused to release the dollar amount of unpaid bills due the company. But in Ohio, which collects such statistics on a statewide basis, the dollar amount of unpaid bills by all low-income utility customers has risen to about $110 million in 1998 from $48 million in 1994.
One explanation, advocates say, is Congress's cuts in the Federal emergency relief program for the poor, known as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Its funding has fallen to $1.1 billion this year from $2.1 billion in 1986.
Brooklyn Union, which supplies natural gas to 1.1 million customers in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, began On Track in late 1995 as part of a rate agreement with the Public Service Commission that also created the utility's current holding company, Keyspan Energy. Before On Track, company officials commissioned an internal study in 1992 and 1993 that found that 43 percent of the company's delinquent residential customers were considered low income, or about 150 percent of the Federal poverty level.
Today, On Track is two-pronged: 1,500 delinquent low-income customers are selected each year. Most of these customers receive telephone counseling, money management advice, a video cassette recorder, a series of instructive videos and a magenta box to help organize their bills. As an incentive, participants in the program are forgiven $400 against unpaid bills. Of the overall group, 250 customers, usually with debts greater than $1,000, are assigned a social worker.
The program costs slightly more than $1 million a year, said James M. Jacob, the manager of Brooklyn Union's consumer advocacy division. He said the program essentially pays for itself by reducing the company's overall collection costs. Under the auspices of Keyspan, Brooklyn Union merged last year with the Long Island Lighting Company, and has since taken the On Track program to Long Island.
Consolidated Edison, which serves three million gas, electric and steam customers in New York City and Westchester County, does not offer a similar program for its low-income customers. Con Edison is the only utility in the state that does not participate in a low-income fuel fund, though company officials say they are considering one.
Ms. Yontz, the 27-year-old daughter of an Illinois farmer, knew very little about utilities when she joined Brooklyn Union in October 1995. She had decided to become a social worker after a job in a soup kitchen, and was completing her master's degree in social work at Columbia University when she heard about the job at Brooklyn Union.
"It's really strange," Ms. Yontz said. "I feel like I say all the time, 'Yes, I am a social worker, and yes, I work for the gas company.' "
She now rattles around Brooklyn in a company sedan, calling on about 50 "clients" in a job that seems equal parts cheerleader and trouble-shooter. Usually, the people she meets hover just above poverty line: grandparents on fixed incomes or people like Ms. Chatel, whose modest income falls short of her monthly expenses.
"The goal is to teach people not to live in crisis, and maybe learn different behavior so they are not living crisis to crisis and month to month," she said.
Ms. Yontz describes part of her duties as "advocating," or navigating the social service system, whether Government or nonprofit, to find any and all benefits that a client might qualify for without knowing it. In the case of Ms. Chatel, Ms. Yontz recently brought her an application for the Federal emergency assistance program, which should earn her a few hundred dollars to meet winter bills.
In her role as adviser, Ms. Yontz says she often has to help people make difficult decisions. When she and Ms. Chatel discussed ways to earn more income, they decided to rent the two floors atop the beauty parlor to help meet the mortgage. But doing so meant telling Ms. Chatel's 26-year-old son to move out and find a job.
Gerald A. Norlander, deputy director of Public Utility Law Project, an advocacy group for low-income customers based in Albany, commended On Track as a responsible collections program. But Mr. Norlander said the Public Service Commission needs to place as much emphasis on rate reductions for the poor as on collection programs. In Massachusetts, he said low-income customers qualify for rate reductions of up to 25 percent.
"Fundamental affordability is a major issue that must be addressed, and it has not been addressed by the Public Service Commission," Mr. Norlander said. "They're only giving it lip service." The commission has planned a two-day forum in late April to discuss the potential problems facing low-income customers in a deregulated marketplace.
Dave Flanagan, a spokesman for the commission, said that officials were aware of the possible effects of a deregulated environment on poor customers, adding that the commission was experimenting with pilot programs in two upstate counties to find ways to hold down rates.
For Ms. Yontz, deregulation and its potential problems are just distant, unheard noise by the people she serves. Last week, she visited Samuel Wilson, a 92-year-old Jamaican immigrant, now an American citizen, who lives alone in a small apartment in Canarsie, Brooklyn. Mr. Wilson had received $129 every month in food stamps for more years than he can remember when, last year, the benefit inexplicably stopped.
Ms. Yontz intervened, discovering that Mr. Wilson had either failed to fill out necessary paperwork or the form simply had not been sent. She quickly organized his application and appeared at the welfare office on his behalf. While Mr. Wilson waited two months for his food stamps to be restored, Ms. Yontz and social workers from an agency for the elderly arranged for meals from a food pantry.
When Mr. Wilson's landlord recently sold the Canarsie row house, Ms. Yontz helped Mr. Wilson navigate the social-service bureaucracy, finding him a subsidized studio apartment in Far Rockaway, Queens. He will probably move later this month. "You can't imagine how happy I am to have you here today," Mr. Wilson told Ms. Yontz before she left last week. "I wish you were here all day to talk to, to cheer me up."

HEADLINE: After Whittling Income Taxes, Whitman Turns To Popular Cut

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
When Christine Todd Whitman was trying to decide between seeking an income tax cut or property tax relief during her 1993 gubernatorial campaign, her top political advisers said lowering property taxes would earn the most points with voters.
But her economic advisers, including her childhood friend, the publisher Steve Forbes, pushed for the income tax cut, arguing that it would best help the state recover the jobs lost to the recession. 
 Mrs. Whitman's plan for a 30 percent income tax cut helped her win the election that year and made her the darling of the national Republican Party. But her decision not to provide direct property tax relief during her first term angered enough voters that she nearly lost her re-election bid four years later.
By proposing last week to use $1 billion from the state budget to reduce local property taxes over the next five years, Mrs. Whitman said she had now addressed voter concerns well enough that she might just ask for a recount. Yet, she said, she has no regrets about adopting the income tax cuts first and waiting to propose the more politically popular property tax relief plan.
"It certainly would have made my life easier 18 months ago," she said in an interview at her State House office. "But the time is right now. It is because of what we have done over the last five years that we are in a position to do something more. The economy is doing well. The state is doing well."
From the moment Mrs. Whitman proposed cutting New Jersey's income tax rates in 1993, supporters and critics have debated the role that tax cuts play in stimulating the state's economy. The Governor herself concedes that the booming national economy played a major role.
"Absolutely, the national recovery helps," Mrs. Whitman said. "There is no question about that. I would be the last person to ignore that or claim that it did not have a role. But what you have to look at is the relative positions of the states, and that their internal policies and tax policies make the difference."
She pointed out that by June 1997, New Jersey had recovered all the jobs lost in the recession, something New York did not achieve until a year later.
Economists agree that Mrs. Whitman's tax cuts, including reduced corporate taxes, reinforced her message that New Jersey was "open for business."
"It is clear that New Jersey has led the region in terms of job growth and recovery," said John L. Wieting, regional commissioner for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "The reasons are multiple and varied. It is very difficult to separate out the factors that contribute to growth. But something like tax cuts would give a perception that it is a friendly place to do business."
Joseph J. Seneca, chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisers and a vice president of Rutgers University, said that all economic indicators, from personal income growth to retail sales, have been up in the last two years.
"It is difficult to disentangle the causes of the state's strong economic performance," he said. "But there is no question that the improvement in the business climate, broadly defined, has been a significant, positive factor in the strength of our economy. The income tax cuts were an important component of that."
Jon Shure, a former top aide to Gov. Jim Florio who now runs a public policy group, New Jersey Policy Perspective, takes a different view. He said the national economic boom was coming to the state, regardless of New Jersey's income tax rates.
"When she cut the income tax, she fixed the one tax that wasn't broken," Mr. Shure said. "That helped the politician's image as a tax cutter, but the income tax in New Jersey was never so high that cutting it would have had any large economic impact."
Mr. Shure said that Mrs. Whitman should have addressed the state's heavy reliance on property taxes for local school costs. The state now pays a little more than 40 percent of the cost of public education. The national average is 50 percent.
That is the approach that Mr. Florio adopted. He raised state taxes by $2.8 billion, poured money into local schools, and found himself in the midst of a taxpayer revolt. Property taxes remained low for a couple of years, but then they began to increase.
Despite dire predictions from Democrats that Mrs. Whitman's income tax cuts would lead to skyrocketing property tax increases because fewer state dollars were going to cities, towns and schools, property tax collections statewide have slowed in the last few years. Even so, the average property tax bill in New Jersey is $4,000, the highest in the nation. There are many contributing factors, including the longstanding tradition of home rule: 566 municipalities, 611 school districts, 21 counties and 188 fire districts.
Mrs. Whitman said she decided to send rebate checks directly to homeowners rather than to dole out extra state dollars to local governments because she wants to keep pressure on them to reduce their costs.
To pay for her income tax cuts during her first term, Mrs. Whitman used several fiscal maneuvers, like a massive pension borrowing program, which raised questions among some Wall Street analysts and conservatives about the state's fiscal management.
But New Jersey, like many other states, is now flush with cash from the booming economy. The state is expected to end the fiscal year on June 30 with a budget surplus exceeding $800 million.
So both state officials and Wall Street analysts say that the Whitman administration can probably afford to pick up the cost of the property tax rebate checks in the new fiscal year.
But the size of the program raises questions about whether the next governor and future state legislatures would be able to afford it. Mrs. Whitman's second term ends in 2002, two years before the five-year program is to be fully implemented at a cost of $1 billion a year.
Under Mrs. Whitman's proposal, which is similar to the Pataki administration's property tax rebate program in New York, the average check to 1.9 million homeowners would be $600 a year, beginning in 2004. The plan would also provide tenants with an average check amounting to $100. There are no income limits. In New York, homeowners do not get rebate checks; they get a credit on their property tax bill.
Mrs. Whitman promises that if the Legislature approves the plan by April 15, she will send out the first checks by Labor Day. This year the average check would be $120, 20 percent of what a homeowner would get once the plan is fully phased in. The amount of the rebate checks would increase by 20 percent each year until 2004. The amount of local school taxes paid determines the size of the rebate checks.
The cost to the state budget begins at about $200 million in the coming fiscal year. It climbs by $200 million each year until it reaches the full cost of $1 billion annually by 2004, about 5.5 percent of the state's total budget.
Despite concerns about paying for the plan in future years, Democrats and Republican lawmakers are expected to adopt it.
Economic analysts seem to approve.
"Given the economy, and the structure of the tax system, they are generating pretty large surpluses," said Timothy Blake, vice president of Moody's Investors Service. "They seem to be disposing of the surpluses prudently. We changed our outlook from negative to stable in September 1998 and that was in reflection of the fact that structural balance has improved."
Mrs. Whitman said she did not think future lawmakers and governors would consider eliminating the rebate checks. "I believe that this is going to be a priority for state government because it is going to be a priority for the people," she said.

HEADLINE: Thomas Binford, 74, Executive Who Guided Indianapolis 500

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
Thomas W. Binford, an Indianapolis businessman who was a co-founder of that city's Urban League and who helped steer the Indianapolis 500 through two crises, died on Thursday in Indianapolis. He was 74.
The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage. Mr. Binford was stricken on Wednesday at the downtown Indianapolis office of Binford and Associates, his management consulting firm, and died at Methodist Hospital. 
 Mr. Binford, an Indianapolis native, was one of the city's leaders in civil rights, education and downtown development. As chairman of Indiana National Bank, which was purchased in 1992 by NBD Bancorp of Detroit, he saw it through a rocky period in the mid-1970's caused by failed real-estate loans.
After helping establish the Urban League of Indianapolis in 1965, he was its chairman twice, and also was chairman of numerous companies.
From 1956 to 1969 he was president of the United States Auto Club, which was the Indianapolis 500's sanctioning body, and was chief steward of the race from 1974 to 1995. In each role, he helped keep the race going.
After an accident killed more than 100 spectators during the 1955 24-hour sports car race in Le Mans, the American Automobile Association decided to end its role as overseer of auto racing competition in the United States. The pullout left the Indianapolis 500 with no sanctioning group to set the rules and see that they were enforced. To fill that void, the United States Auto Club was formed, with Mr. Binford as one of its founders.
Mr. Binford was called back to the Indianapolis 500 after the chaotic, rain-delayed 1973 race, which included crashes that killed two drivers and a crew member and injured 11 spectators. Public sentiment ran strongly against the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, with some newspaper editorials questioning whether the track should be shut down. The blame fell upon the chief steward, Harlan Fengler, although the speedway itself had safety shortcomings outside his control. Six days before the 1974 race, Mr. Binford was chosen to replace Mr. Fengler.
Mr. Binford made procedural changes that, along with upgrades to the track, eased safety concerns. And he did not hesitate to make decisions that might cause an uproar, as two episodes demonstrated.
The day after the 1981 race, Mr. Binford penalized the apparent winner, Bobby Unser, one lap for an illegal pass, a ruling that gave the victory to Mario Andretti. It would have been the only time since the race began in 1911 that an apparent winner had his victory taken away. But in October of that year, Mr. Binford's ruling was overturned on appeal, and Mr. Unser was reinstated as the winner.
"It wasn't hard to call," Mr. Binford said later of the penalty, "except you knew the minute you called it you were in for a lot of problems."
In his final race as chief steward in 1995, Mr. Binford gave a black flag to the leader, Scott Goodyear, with a handful of laps remaining after Goodyear passed the pace car too soon. That gave the victory to Jacques Villeneuve and brought bitter criticism from Goodyear. Videotape replays supported the ruling.
Mr. Binford is survived by his wife, Kai; a son, Wilson C. Binford of Zionsville, Ind.; a daughter, Florence W. Kichler of Carmel, Ind.; a stepdaughter, Linda Kai Miller; a stepson, Bryan Irwin, and a sister, Virginia Binford Turner.

HEADLINE: Double-Edged Economic Crisis Whipsaws Brazil Workers and Companies

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil, Jan. 16

 BODY:
For 22 years and 4 months, Luiz Porfirio Diniz reported daily to the bustling Ford do Brasil automotive plant here, where three different car models are manufactured. But then just before Christmas, he got the bad news he had been fearing ever since Brazilian interest rates shot to nearly 50 percent four months ago: He was one of 2,800 assembly-line workers being laid off.
Employees took over the plant on Jan. 5 to protest that move, so Mr. Diniz still spends his day on the plant floor, playing dominos with his fellow workers. The stoppage means that Ford is no longer producing its daily quota of 1,000 cars, but the company has not moved against the workers -- perhaps because car sales are declining so dramatically in Brazil that Ford has the equivalent of nearly two months of production stockpiled in storage areas here. 
 "Everybody wants to work, so all they have to do is give us the word," said Valdecir Aparecido de Souza, another laid-off worker. "But if nobody is spending any money, management is not going to take us back, and we're not going to be able to find jobs anywhere else. It's a real mess."
The crisis that has shaken Brazil in recent months, culminating this week in a 21 percent devaluation of a country's currency, the real, is first and foremost a threat to workers and their families. But for that very reason, it also represents a growing danger for the hundreds of multinational companies that have flocked to Brazil and invested billions of dollars in recent years, lured by a market of 165 million people with sustained growth and stable prices.
Though all of Brazil is now reeling, the once-flourishing automobile industry, centered here in the industrial suburbs south of Sao Paulo, which produced as many as two million vehicles a year at its peak, was hit early and particularly hard. Car sales in Brazil, the world's seventh-largest auto market, slumped 27.5 percent last year, falling from 1.64 million to 1.19 million, with Ford registering an even larger decline, 33.8 percent.
James R. Cain, a Ford spokesman in Detroit, said the elimination of a shift at the factory here and the resulting layoffs were driven by the conclusion that "we did not believe there would be any substantive improvement in the market in 1999." The company lost money in Brazil in 1998, Mr. Cain said, and it indicated to Wall Street analysts at a briefing on Jan. 7, even before the major devaluation announced Friday, that it was unlikely to earn a profit in Brazil this year either.
Brazil's top car maker, Volkswagen, is also suffering from a sharp decline in demand, but last month negotiated an agreement with its workers here to reduce pay by 15 percent rather than cut jobs. .
For Brazil's 275,000 auto workers, once considered the elite of the working class, that means hard times after years of hard-won improvements in their standard of living. "Yesterday, I was dreaming," reads the bumper sticker on a car parked outside the Ford factory here. "Today I can't even sleep."
Mr. Diniz, 44, who is married with two children, is typical. Born in the impoverished northeastern state of Paraiba, he, like millions of others hoping for a better life, came to Sao Paulo as a teen-ager, and by working hard and scrimping, he managed to buy his own house and car.
"I love Ford and think of it as family," he said as he other workers gathered at the Bar do Pascual, outside the plant's gate. "I grew up with this company, so being in this situation is enough to make me cry."
Recent years had been especially good, he and other workers said. The Government's Real Plan, announced in 1994, tied the value of Brazil's currency to the dollar, forcing a level of fiscal discipline that cut inflation from over 1,000 percent a year in the early 1990's to single digits.
"Bringing down inflation made it easier for people like us to buy food, clothing and appliances," said Adailton Coelho dos Santos, 55, who works on the same line as Mr. Diniz and also came from the northeast. "For the first time in our lives, we were able to figure out what our money was worth."
As a result, millions of Brazilians could finally afford to buy televisions, refrigerators, furniture and other consumer goods, secure in the knowledge that their monthly payments would not outstrip their wages. But measures taken by the Government over the past six months, especially the dramatic interest rate increase, have driven the Brazilian economy into recession and forced consumers to economize.
"We have lots of members who can no longer meet their rent or mortgage payments, let alone think about buying appliances," said Luiz Marinho, president of the metalworkers union of Sao Bernardo, which represents auto workers. "We have guys who have had to postpone their weddings because they don't have a cent to spend anymore."
For American companies, the belt-tightening by working-class Brazilians is nothing but bad news. Brazil is the United States' 15th-largest trading partner, and in recent years it has been one of the fastest-growing markets for American-made goods, importing more than $14 billion in 1997, ranging from equipment for heavy industry to potato chips.
American banks also have a heavy exposure. As of mid-1998, they had about $16.7 billion in loans and other assets outstanding in Brazil, with Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Bank and BankAmerica each reporting more than $3 billion in assets here.
The situation is especially alarming for the estimated 2,000 American businesses operating in Brazil, which has Latin America's largest economy. American concerns have more than $27 billion invested here, giving them a higher profile here than in other troubled areas like Russia or Southeast Asia, and weak results this year, now expected to be the general rule as a result of this week's economic turmoil, could affect their profit statements back home.
Whirlpool and General Electric, for instance, manufacture appliances like refrigerators, stoves and microwave ovens. Companies like Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble make a wide variety of toiletries and cosmetics.
At their factories north of Sao Paulo, Motorola, Lucent, Qualcomm and other companies turn out telecommunications equipment like cellular phones, whose availability has increased dramatically as the result of the privatization of Brazil's telephone system last year. With the market for computers here having grown by as much as 30 percent a year recently, computer makers like Compaq and Dell have also installed themselves in Brazil.
But the sudden and dramatic downturn raises the question of whether American, European and Japanese companies that have flocked here in recent years may now have too much manufacturing capacity installed in Brazil. Or as Pedro Reis Correa, a 39-year-old assembly line worker, put it: "If all of us are unemployed, who is going to buy the products these companies make?"
For Christmas, Mr. Correa, who earns a salary of about $1,000 a month, had planned to buy a computer, mostly for use by his two children, ages 8 and 11. He had even obtained a bargain price through a nephew who works for a computer manufacturer and saved up the down payment that would have allowed him to buy the $1,600 machine on an installment plan.
But when he received the layoff notice, he had to tell the children that "this is going to have to wait for some other time," he recalled sorrowfully. "I am trying to cut expenses as much as I can, and that means no more car trips to the interior on weekend or movies or candy bars for the kids."
Antonio Carlos Santos knows only too well the effects of decisions like that. For the past four years, he has parked every day outside the entrance to the Ford plant here, and from the back of his beat-up station wagon, sold items like kitchen knives, watches, videocassettes and toys to the workers, with gross sales of about $1,300 a month.
"My sales are down 50 percent in the past month, so of course I am very worried," he said on Friday morning, as a constant drizzle added to his woes by driving his few potential customers indoors. "If the money of the workers here dries up, then people like me are going to go bust. This situation affects everybody."
Mr. Santos said his family too has begun economizing, anticipating that the situation is going to worsen before it improves. "We're eating less meat and more rice and beans, buying cheaper brands of shampoo and soap, doing everything we can to save a penny here and there," he said.
That is not what companies like Coca-Cola or Nabisco, which derives about 17 percent of its worldwide sales from Brazil, want to hear. Brazil is Coke's second-largest overseas market, accounting for about 5 percent of its worldwide profits.
As recently as 1995, Coke's sales in Brazil expanded by a spectacular 34 percent. But growth was estimated at only 1 percent for last year, and with people like Mr. Santos and his family determined to drink less, the most optimistic projection for this year is flat sales. Furthermore, the money Coca-Cola takes in here is earned in the now drastically devalued local currency.
It is not clear how Friday's decision by the Brazilian Government to allow the real to float freely against the dollar will affect other companies. In theory, the long-urged devaluation of the real should make Brazilian exports cheaper across the board and therefore more attractive than those of competitors, while also encouraging investment by making Brazilian companies available at bargain prices to foreign purchasers.
But economists have expressed concerns that the devaluation of the real could set off a chain reaction across Latin America and the rest of the developing world, with country after country trying to gain a competitive advantage by lowering the value of its currency. In addition, the price of the components, raw materials and finished goods that Brazil buys will now go up, fueling inflation here and cutting consumer purchasing power further.
Thousands of Brazilians who bought cars on installment opted for financing terms pegging monthly payments to the exchange rate between the dollar and the real. They now must pay much more each month or try to sell their cars before they are repossessed, and the crisis is likely to drive many potential buyers out of the market altogether.
"When the population is frightened and stops consuming, things can only get worse," Mr. Marinho said. "That's what we are confronting right now, a moment that threatens to erase all of the gains we have made."

Kelly Maintains Loyalty as Twins Disintegrate

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
A few years ago Jim Leyland grew tired of losing with no break in sight and parlayed his unhappiness into a World Series championship and then a $2 million-a-year job. Tom Kelly is no less tired of losing than Leyland was, but as loyal as Leyland was initially, Kelly has remained so loyal he is going down with the ship.
It's not a Viking ship. The Vikings are the successful Minnesota team, the one playing in a conference championship game in the Twins' ball park today. Kelly didn't plan to be at the game, but it wasn't a case of sour grapes. 
 "Many years ago Jerry Burns and I were pretty close friends," Kelly related, referring to a former Vikings head coach. "I used to go to all the games. The last game he was coaching, they were playing the Packers and both teams were around .500. It was the man's last game. The Packers were ahead, 20-0, at the end of the first half, and the Vikings, in my mind, didn't show up. I thought that was a sad display of football. I left the building and never went back to another game. I just had a bad feeling that day. I couldn't understand the effort that day."
Effort has always played a major role in Kelly's style of managing. It will be an even bigger component during the coming season.
"There's still a lot to be said about playing the game the right way, doing things right on the field," Kelly said. "We're going make sure we do all of those things. I don't know if that's going to put people in the building, but the ones who show up deserve that."
The Twins, who last season had the third-poorest won-lost record in the American League, aren't expected to fare any better in 1999. Kelly, whose 12-year tenure in Minnesota is the longest of any current professional manager or coach, could have thrown himself on the mercy of the owner, Carl Pohlad, and asked out. But he did not.
"Some people call it stupidity; some call it loyalty," Kelly said. "I haven't decided which it is with me."
To make the manager's plight even more dire, his team became worse not long after Kelly reaffirmed his intention to remain with the Twins.
"A couple weeks after the season, the owner asked me to stay," the 48-year-old Kelly said. "He outlined a little plan he had. It was my understanding we were going to keep the shortstop, and we didn't do that. That was the only thing I was disappointed about.
The shortstop is Pat Meares, who last year had a $2.5 million salary and would have gained about a $1 million raise through salary arbitration. But when the Boston Red Sox gave Jose Offerman, a free-agent infielder, $26 million for four years, the prospect of a much bigger raise prompted the Twins to sever ties with Meares, who has yet to sign with another team.
A hefty salary for their shortstop would have made it impossible for the Twins to reach Pohlad's desired payroll level of $10 million to $15 million. That was the "little plan" the owner outlined after the season for Kelly, who said he understood the reasoning. Their $24.5 million payroll didn't get the Twins anywhere last season, and raising it to $30 million or so would not have made a difference, Kelly said.
So why did he decide to keep his job?
"We're comfortable here," Kelly said, referring to himself and his wife, Sharon. "We enjoy it here. My wife has family here. My son lives here. Personally I have a lot of money tied up here. My people explained if I move, I'm going to lose a lot of money that's tied up in bonds and different things. So you add it all up and ask is it economically important to move? No."
Yes, Kelly acknowledged, he probably would have a better chance to win elsewhere. But, he added, "I weighed everything and decided we'd stay here and do what the owner asked me to do."
But he really would like to have had Meares's stabilizing leadership in the infield. "I'll try to remedy that situation," Kelly said. "I'll see what we have in spring training."
Kelly, who also has lost Paul Molitor's overall team leadership, will have plenty to scrutinize in spring training. Will Denny Hocking, a good utility player, be able to replace Meares on an everyday basis? Is Doug Mientkiewicz ready to play first base regularly? How about Corey Koskie at third? Can Torii Hunter win the center field job?
Perhaps most important of all, can Marty Cordova, who has salaries totaling $6.75 million the next two years, find the bat that made him rookie of the year in 1995 and an even better hitter the next season but has deserted him the past two years?
Then there's the team's No. 1 pitcher, Brad Radke, whose record plummeted from 20-10 to 12-14. The Twins have been reported to be considering trading Radke, but Kelly said Terry Ryan, the team's general manager, had not said anything to him about such a plan.
"He might be afraid to," Kelly said, still able to joke in the face of adversity.
 
Mystery Buyer He Isn't
 The anonymous telephone caller to the sports department of The New York Times said he knew who bought the $3 million baseball, the one Mark McGwire hit for his 70th home run that had been auctioned the night before. Who was it? Allan Byer, the called said.
Because the person who made the winning bid -- via telephone -- had chosen to remain anonymous, this tip was worth pursuing.
Allan Byer is a limited partner in the ownership of the San Francisco Giants. He also owns a clothing company and is in real estate. A call was placed to his home in the San Francisco area. His wife answered and said he wasn't home. Did she know if he bought the McGwire ball?
"If he did," she replied, obviously amused by the idea, "he hasn't told me. That's funny, but the answer is no. I'm sure he hasn't gone completely insane over baseball, just a little."
Another call was then placed to Byer's son, Alex, who also is a Giants limited partner.
"You got to be kidding me," Alex Byer said, laughing. "Oh, that's absurd. That is outlandish. Maybe if the ball was 100 bucks."
When Allan Byer was finally reached, he didn't laugh but said it was not he who won the bidding. Why would someone think he could be the $3 million man?
"I collect baseballs," Byer said. "I have about 900."
To put his collection in economic perspective, Byer said he had never determined the value of his collection but added, "If it's $100,000, that would be a lot."
His baseballs, he explained, are mostly from the 1940's through the 70's, the time when baseball most magnetically held his interest. His most valuable ball ($5,000, he estimated) is one with Mel Ott's autograph.
"For me," he said, "that's an expensive ball. I'm not about to spend $3 million for a baseball. Even if I could afford it, I wouldn't do it. It doesn't make any kind of sense."
At least Mrs. Byer knows her husband.
 
A Jordan 2-Pointer
 Michael Jordan will be remembered for far different reasons, but he may have an unusual position in sports history: He most likely is the only player to retire from two sports during labor disputes.
Although Jordan didn't announce his basketball retirement until after the lockout had ended, he knew during the work stoppage that he would not resume work when the league did. Nearly four years ago, he retired from his short-lived baseball career during the players strike and as a direct result of it.
Jordan went to spring training with the Chicago White Sox minor leaguers in 1995, but he became increasingly uncomfortable because it appeared he would be labeled a replacement player, a designation and a reputation he wanted no part of.
"That's just not what I'm here for," Jordan said on his first day in camp when the subject of replacement games arose. "I've always said I wouldn't be a replacement player. I don't consider myself one being here. I consider myself a minor leaguer. That's why I'm here."
But as exhibition games approached and it became clear that major league players would consider anyone who played in them replacement players, Jordan decided it was time to go. And he went -- back to the National Basketball Association, whose commissioner, David Stern, nearly four years later tried to frighten the locked-out players by threatening to use replacement players.
 
Phillips Fallout?
 Ever since their general manager was accused of sexual harassment in November, a charge Steve Phillips denied, the Mets have been ultra-sensitive. They recently conducted employee seminars, for example, on club policies, including sexual harassment.
There was also a rumor last week that the Mets plan to ban sex magazines, including the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, from their clubhouse. David Howard, the club's senior vice president for business and legal affairs, declined to confirm or deny the rumor.
"I cannot comment," he said, "about how our policies would be applied in any instance."
If the Mets do plan a ban on sex magazines, they most likely will encounter opposition from the Players Association.
Asked if the union had a position on such club actions, Gene Orza, the No. 2 official, said: "If magazines of any kind were allowed previously, if one of their working conditions was that magazines were allowed, this would be a change and would have to be negotiated with the union. They can't stop serving free food or not allow employees to have cell phones. They can negotiate those things with us, but they can't make unilateral changes."
The players could always sneak the magazines into the clubhouse and read them under cover of politically correct periodicals.

HEADLINE: Brazilian, in I.M.F. Talks, May Ask for Early Aid

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Brazil's Finance Minister began talks here today with the International Monetary Fund and said he might ask for early release of the next round of international assistance to the country to help stabilize its economy.
The Finance Minister, Pedro Malan, spoke a day after Brazil dropped efforts to defend the value of its currency, raising fears of another bout of global financial turmoil and economic hardship.
I.M.F. officials said they had no comment on the meetings today.
Mr. Malan and other members of Brazil's delegation will also meet on Sunday with Clinton Administration officials, including Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, to review plans for addressing Brazil's economic problems and carrying out a strategy for managing its currency, the real.
Mr. Malan said Brazil would unveil a new approach to stabilizing the currency on Monday. Options range from allowing the real to float in response to market forces, creating a range of values that the Government would try to maintain, to fixing the currency at a specified level.
Officials from the United States and the fund have made clear that they will press Brazil to take rapid steps to reduce its huge budget deficit through tax increases and spending cuts as a first step toward restoring international confidence. The faltering pace of efforts to improve the country's fiscal condition was behind the intense market pressure to devalue the currency.
Mr. Malan reiterated that President Fernando Enrique Cardoso remained committed to the fiscal program Brazil agreed on with the fund, despite intense political opposition at home. Doubts about Mr. Cardoso's ability to carry out the program came to a head this month when the new Governor of Brazil's second-largest state, Minas Gerais, imposed a moratorium on his state's payments to the federal Government.
About $9 billion of the $41.5 billion aid package to Brazil has been disbursed, and $9 billion more could be released next month if the fund and donor nations, including the United States, agree that Brazil is making progress toward its fiscal goals.

HEADLINE: Growth of Gambling on Tribal Land Starts Trek Back Home by Indians

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: LAC DU FLAMBEAU, Wis.

 BODY:
Coming home to Indian country from suburban life after 16 years, Carl Edwards recently lifted his young daughters through a window of their new house on Gunlock Lake here, and let their little feet prance on the stiffening concrete, leaving symbols of permanence.
"This is your house," Mr. Edwards, a Chippewa, told his daughters, who he has promised to teach to hunt on this reservation, and to sprinkle tobacco around the fallen prey, a sign of thanksgiving to the Creator. "These are your woods. That is your lake." 
 The tribal economy here was lifeless as stone in the early 1980's, when Mr. Edwards fled this backwoods pocket of Wisconsin, certain that survival would mean existing on crumbs from the Government.
He joined the Marines for a stint, then settled near Milwaukee, where as a construction worker he earned enough to buy a small house and become familiar with the trappings of middle-class life. But he never quite felt comfortable in the mall-and-traffic rhythms of suburbia.
So the growth of tribal gambling in recent years, which created 120,000 jobs on reservations and an additional 160,000 spin-off jobs, breathing a whisper of prosperity in the nations of Indian country, meant homecomings for people like Mr. Edwards.
"I never thought it would be possible to come home," said Mr. Edwards, who works at the Lake of the Torches casino here, and just last November finished building a knotty-pine house. "There was nothing here when I left, and there was no reason to think there was ever going to be anything here. So you left."
After more than a century of American Indians leaving reservations for cities and towns, many tribes have started to experience a reversal in the trend, said Tim Giago, a Lakota writer and former publisher of Indian Country Today, the nation's largest American Indian newspaper, with main offices in Rapid City, S.D.
"This is really the biggest story in Indian country," Mr. Giago said, "people actually starting to come home for jobs."
Numbers on such homecomings are hard to come by, partly because the trend is so new. Even with gambling, many tribes still struggle mightily with poverty in conditions that are often much worse than those found in the poorest of urban neighborhoods, but there is plenty of reason for rejoicing over the turn of events in Indian country.
Mr. Edwards, 34, who earned about $50,000 a year as a construction worker, and is regarded here with awe for his service as a marine in Beirut, also rejoices over his return. "Look at the stars and the moon -- it's like daylight," he said, awe-struck. His view of the heavens had been obscured for years by the neon and sulphur glow of city lights.
In his new job, which does not pay as much as his old trade, Mr. Edwards trains workers at the casino for jobs ranging from card dealer to dishwasher. Some of the workers have reached their late 30's without ever having earned a paycheck.
"I grew up on that hill across the road," Mr. Edwards tells the recruits. "I know what life on the reservation can mean."
Growing up on the Lac du Flambeau reservation, Mr. Edwards learned to harvest wild rice in the late summer and to dance at the powwow, where his godfather, David Careful, gave him the name Little Fawn. Living just 100 steps from Lake Pokegama, he learned to fish in the darkness with flashlights and nets, to clean walleye, to shoot, gut and dress a deer, and to sprinkle tobacco in thanks.
He also knew the feeling of going to bed hungry. His mother was so sickened with alcoholism that she could not care for a baby. He became a ward of the state and was placed as a foster child in his Aunt Flora's two-bedroom house, a ramshackle place on the hill that was already crowded with eight other people.
The Indian children attended Lakeland Union High School, about 15 miles from the reservation. A majority of the students were white.
"There were people whose houses you knew you didn't go inside," Mr. Edwards said. "Some of my friends, you know, they'd be kind of embarrassed and say, 'Sorry, but my parents just don't like Indians.' "
There were plenty of fights. He was short, and not so quick with his fists. So he lost some battles, Mr. Edwards said, and at times he was confronted by mobs. He endured black eyes, fat lips, bloody noses and "sore ribs from the boots," Mr. Edwards said.
He went to school wearing ill-fitting, throwaway corduroy trousers that were laughably out of style. He never owned a pair of blue jeans. He saw his mother occasionally at family gatherings, depending on how she was feeling. His father, a fishing guide, walked past the boy without a word or a glance because he suspected that Carl's mother had been unfaithful, and so refused to acknowledge him as a son.
"My children will always have a mother and father who love them," said Mr. Edwards, as he played with his daughters, Joelle, 5, and Kendra, 1, on a murky December day at the reservation, while his wife, Lisa, 32, fixed a pizza. "And I will never wear a pair of corduroys."
Mr. Edwards and his wife, who is not Indian but grew up near the reservation, met in high school and married after he left the Marines.
It was Mr. Edwards's father who unknowingly inspired him to join the Marines, where he served in Beirut after the attack on the United States Embassy in 1983. The father was known around the reservation as At Ease, a reference to his long-ago service in the Army.
"I guess I wanted to one-up the old man," Mr. Edwards said. His father died a few years ago. And Carl, who had known such cold rejection, drove home anyway to attend the funeral and pay his respects. Some people wondered why. "He gave me his name," Mr. Edwards said.
With his own children, he has many plans. "I'm going to teach them to hunt for deer," he said.
He will also teach them how to cope with people, like an old study hall teacher, who Mr. Edwards said showed disrespect for the Chippewa way of hunting and fishing.
Mr. Edwards recalled that the teacher had become enraged one morning when he, as a teen-ager, dared to lay his head on his desk in study hall. The teacher stood over the young Carl Edwards and began to bellow in a sarcastic voice, mocking the tribe's method of fishing.
"Go spearing last night?" Mr. Edwards said the teacher had asked. "That why you're tired?"
"No," the boy replied truthfully.
"Yes you did," the teacher pressed. "I'll bet you and your father went spearing last night." The taunt cut like glass to a boy who, for all of his 17 years, had longed for a father who would take his son hunting and fishing.
The boy glared back at the teacher, then screamed a profanity. Mr. Edwards said he stood up from his desk and challenged the man to a fight.
He was suspended from school for a week.
When Mr. Edwards told his employer that he would be moving back to the reservation, his boss asked. "Why on earth?"
"Because it's home," Mr. Edwards replied.
Joelle was almost ready to start school. And Mr. Edwards did not want his children growing up with stereotypes and falsehoods about his people. More than that, he wanted his daughters to grow up in the culture of their ancestors.
The forebears of Mr. Edwards were among the Chippewas who resisted Government efforts to force the tribe to move west. The Chippewas, who would not be starved or frozen into submission, clung to the ancient homelands that circle Lake Superior, a region dotted by thousands of freshwater lakes and forests of quaking aspen and sugar maple, teeming with elk, deer and bear.
As he walks the grounds of the reservation these days, he is likely to see old friends or relatives. The other day, he saw his boyhood pal Hank Schuman.
He gets to see his sisters, Ann, Donna, Patty and Mary, and his brother, Archie.
And one recent Sunday, his mother visited. She has been sober now for nearly 20 years, and her eyes shine like sunrise when she hears Joelle call out to her.
"Grandma," says the little girl, words that make the older woman grateful.
Mr. Edwards was playing with his daughters one recent afternoon. A smile danced across the face of Joelle, who delighted in pleasing her father. She began to recite words she had learned in her new Ojibwe language class.
"Makwa," she called out, the Chippewa word for bear.
"Say deer," her father urged.
"Waawaashkeshii," she answered.
"Rabbit," he challenged.
"Waaboos," she responded.
Mr. Edwards, with the hardened muscles of a man who hauled 180-pound bundles of drywall for a living, swallowed hard and bent to engulf his daughter in his arms.
"You want something so hard, for so long," he said, "and you don't think you're ever going to get there."

HEADLINE: Still Locked in Storm's Horror, Hondurans Are Fearful of Future

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: SANTA ROSA DE AGUAN, Honduras

 BODY:
Mirtha Martinez Arriola returned to her home on a recent Sunday and wept when she saw her husband's hat floating in brackish water beneath the roofless frame house where they once lived.
She wept not for the things they had lost, not for the years they had worked to build their home and found a family, but for him and for three of her children, who were all swept out to sea in October and drowned in the worst hurricane of the century. 
 "I would like to go far from here, to forget all this," she said. "Somewhere where there is a future."
Around her lay the detritus of broken houses and derailed lives, left there by the wrath of Hurricane Mitch. Half of this coastal village of 6,000 people -- more than 80 houses -- was swept out to sea or submerged under the engorged River Aguan during three days of floods, gales and rain so hard it felt like a thousand whips. Forty-one people perished in a desperate attempt to reach higher ground.
Where once there was a road into the village, there is now only a wide expanse of dirt-brown water, with the wreckage of two school buses peeking from the waves. The grade school and high school have been wrecked, along with the bus station, the library and several businesses. Dozens of houses not swallowed up entirely by the sea have been reduced to piles of rubble.
The storm even changed this sleepy village's geography. More than 200 yards of land disappeared under the relentless pounding of the surf. The narrow river that once ran through the village has been moved a quarter of a mile from its original course and has expanded to four times its normal size. Part of the community has been turned into a sad island of devastated homes that will never recover.
More than two months after the hurricane struck, little has improved. Power and phone lines are still lying on the ground. There is no potable water. Many children are sick with diarrhea and unexplained fevers.
Although some shipments of food and medicine have been ferried in by charities and the Government, two large containers of aid from a New York City group are being held up in port by customs officials.
And though it was always remote and impoverished, the village is more isolated than ever. To reach Santa Rosa, one must travel more than two miles on a dirt road, cross a swollen river in a canoe where there was once a ford, then travel 11 more miles to the edge of the village, where a canoe or launch can carry the traveler to the town's center a mile across the water on the other side of the Aguan River.
Founded in 1887, Santa Rosa de Aguan has never had much political influence in the capital, Tegucigalpa. Only in the last few years was electricity brought in, and requests for a paved road and a bridge to link the town to the outside world have been bogged down for decades.
 
The Heartache
Sad Songs Are Sung For a Lost Family
One reason is cultural. Like many coastal communities in Honduras, the village is dominated by the Garifuni, descendants of slaves and Carib Indians from the island of St. Vincent who were exiled to Central America in 1795 after a revolt there. The Garifuni, of African descent, have never wielded as much political power as lighter-skinned Hondurans of Spanish and Indian ancestry.
Many of the people appear to be still inshock from the hurricane. Like shipwrecked sailors, some spend their days scavenging wood from the wreckage to build temporary shelters. Others who lost family members have fled to live with other relatives in nearby towns like Trujillo and La Ceiba, unable to bear the place any longer. But most of the villagers were born here and say they want to rebuild their small town.
One is Robert Blanco, who spent 23 years working on tracks for the Metro North railroad in New York before returning four years ago to retire on a pension. Mr. Blanco's house is under the river, along with all his belongings.
"So many people say they are going away, and others say they will rebuild in a different spot," he said. "I'm going to build me a little house over here because I don't want to leave the place. I was born and raised here."
Others say they would leave if they could, but they have nowhere to go.
Ms. Martinez Arriola's mother, Hilda Arriola Arouz, runs a soda shop and outdoor restaurant on the side of town that was largely swept away by the river. She used to live with her youngest daughter, Nori Esperanza, but the 32-year-old woman has lost her composure completely and can no longer bear to be in the village. She becomes hysterical each time she returns, Mrs. Arriola Arouz said.
Mrs. Arriola Arouz is 67, and a widow. So many people have abandoned the village there is no business for her restaurant. Her son-in-law and four grandchildren are dead. Her surviving daughters are both having trouble coping with the tragedy. The twisted roof of her house lets in the rain now and she has no way to fix it. The house seems dark and empty to her, bereft of children, who are the light of the world, she says. Although she puts on a brave face, she too says it is hard to confront each new day.
"Most days I pass in sadness," she said, "because all the grandchildren that I lost lived most of the time in my house. Now I'm sad and there is nothing but this sadness."
For many people here, the grieving appears to have just begun. Some seem still in a state of denial. It is a measure of their reluctance to talk about what happened that no Mass has been yet been held for the victims of the storm, and though the municipal authorities are supposedly planning one, no date has been set. Still, the families have begun to grieve in private ways.
On a recent night, Mrs. Arriola Arouz, her mother and a cousin from the United States, Maria Guity, who had come to visit, sat up late around a fire and sang sad songs of the Garifuni. Although she has trouble talking about what happened, Mrs. Arriola's voice is full of pain when she sings. In the clear and nasal lilt can be heard the echoes of slavery, of revolts against planters, of great storms, and all the hard history of her people.
Besides singing songs, people have begun to tell the story of the storm, again and again.
On a recent afternoon, Mrs. Arriola ran into two acquaintances as she walked through the part of town on the west bank of the River Aguan. Both women had lost their houses in the flood and were living like squatters in a half-finished Catholic church with borrowed clothes and a few sticks of furniture.
Soon the three women were telling one another how they had survived. Their voices rose and their hands flailed the air in describing the force of the rain, the immense pounding of surf, the rising river. Then the conversation died down, like a storm passing, and the women's eyes went daydreamy and still.
"All of us from this neighborhood are left without homes," said one of the women, Enriqueta Martinez. "It takes years to build a house and it is destroyed in a few seconds."
 
The Hardship
A Farmer's Family Sinks Into Poverty
Other victims of the storm say they find it hard to talk about it. One woman, Isabella Arriola, 32, a schoolteacher who is not directly related to Mirtha, was swept out to sea and survived for five days by clinging to the remains of a wooden roof before being picked up by a ship. Her husband and children perished.
Mrs. Arriola wears sunglasses these days and black dresses. Whenever she appears here, the townspeople crowd around and offer condolences and small gifts. When she was approached by a reporter, she first maintained she was someone else from another town and had not been in Santa Rosa during the storm. When confronted with her identity, she said it was too painful to recount what had happened to her. "I don't want to talk about it," she said.
Even those whose families were unscathed have trouble understanding the extent of what has befallen them. Before the storm, Omar Lopez was a successful dairy farmer by local standards. He and his wife had saved enough to build a spacious home for about $7,500. He ran 200 head of fine dairy cattle on 150 acres inherited from his father. Unlike most of the villagers, he owned a modern launch with an outboard motor.
Now, a third of his farm lies under the river. The house was swept out to sea, with all his belongings. Worse, he lost all but 10 of his cattle. "Everything was invested in the farm, and I didn't have any insurance," Mr. Lopez said.
Hundreds of cattlemen in this river valley lost their stock -- some 20,000 head in all. Even those whose livestock survived have trouble getting their beef to market because of the damage to roads and bridges.
Mr. Lopez, who is 30, has rented a house on the edge of town and has moved his wife and their five sons into it. They are living with borrowed furniture. His children, once among the best dressed in town, now run around barefoot in tattered clothes given them by charities.
Rebuilding his business at this point is a pipe dream, Mr. Lopez said, unless he and other farmers like him obtain some sort of low-interest loans or grants from the Government. Interest rates on bank loans are now close to 34 percent, and he has nothing to put up as collateral. It would take more than $10,000 to replace his stock, he said.
For now, he said, he and his family depend on food from charities and the United Nations. The children have been sick with diarrhea. "We are completely dependent on what they send us, because we can't produce anything," he said. "One maintains hope that perhaps the Government will do something."
So far, however, the Government's response to Santa Rosa's crisis has been minimal. The power and telephone lines are still down, the schools closed.
Military helicopters have delivered about 20 tons of food aid from the United States and Canada and a few trucks from the United Nations and various Catholic charities have managed to get through the river ford. In addition, five tons of aid arrived from a group of Hondurans in Houston.
But at least two containers full of aid gathered by Hondurans in New York City were bottled up in the port of Cortez in December, where customs agents demanded $740 in duty before they would let them into the country. The Mayor, Biato Gonzalo Castillo Guity, made a three-day trip over damaged roads and severed bridges in an effort to free the hostage cargo.
"We just don't have the money," said Cruz Castillo, the chairman of the village's emergency committee. "If the Government doesn't help us, it's possible we won't be able to bring those containers in."
Local officials said they were negotiating to buy several acres of land to parcel out to people whose houses were inundated. "We have to move everyone," Mr. Castillo said. "We have to find a place for them to live."
But Mr. Castillo said these measures did not begin to address the larger problems of unemployment and economic ruin.
 
The Prospects
Many Lack Work, And a Future
Most of the villagers worked as hired hands on fishing boats or on one of the local cattle ranches. Now the boats are largely destroyed, the cattle drowned. Many see no future. On a recent afternoon, Hilberto Sanchez, who is 40, was trying to build a house from bits and pieces of wood he had salvaged from the debris that was once his brother-in-law's house. His own home had been washed out to sea. A friend gave him permission to build on a small plot in the section of the village that survived.
He has put up a rickety frame on the sandy soil, salvaging even the nails he used to hammer it together. He says he knows it will be a temporary dwelling, a flimsy house that will not withstand the first tropical storm, but he has no choice.
"We can't stay in the church any longer," he explained, surveying the wreckage with weary eyes. "We have to keep fighting because after everything we can't just cross our arms and wait."
It has been more than two months since Mr. Sanchez worked on the fishing boats or farms. He has nine children. Asked what he will do once the house is finished, he shrugged in an expression of utter despair.
"For this I am the most worried," he said. "Because here we have no source of work."

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL;
Derrick Coleman Could Be the Next to Cash In

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
You can take unlimited salaries out of the new agreement, but you apparently can't stop the owners from overspending. If the Nets' Jayson Williams's deal (seven years, $100 million) was not a signal, the deal Derrick Coleman is about to sign in Charlotte is another indication of wild economic times ahead.
Though figures were not released, Coleman was expected to get $40 million over five years from the Hornets. Perhaps no player made out like the former Net during the lockout. The 76ers bought out the remaining year of his old contract for $5.67 million on Aug. 1, meaning he was one of the few players during the labor dispute to be paid. 
 "With the buyout and the new deal, let's just say Derrick is doing O.K.," said Coleman's agent, Harold MacDonald. Williams's deal is still the most impressive, though. Coleman signed a $37 million deal with the Nets in 1993. Five years later, the guy Chuck Daly relegated to the bench is making twice as much as Coleman in guaranteed money over the next six years.
Meanwhile, Derek Harper is most likely not coming back to New York. After showing initial interest in returning during the lockout, the former Knicks point guard has apparently narrowed his choices to Miami, Indiana and the Los Angeles Lakers.
As for Latrell Sprewell, Miami appears to have the inside track on Indiana and San Antonio because it can offer the Golden State Warriors several backcourt players. Brent Barry is the main catch. His open-court flair and Bay Area ties -- his father, Rick Barry, carried the franchise in the 1970's -- make him an instant gate attraction.
 
Art of the New Deal
 What you will not see when the National Basketball Association's free-agent madhouse begins: anyone signing a contract for $126 million. What you will see: a number of deals worth $80 million to $100 million.
Kevin Garnett's big score in 1997 may be an anomaly, but already Williams, a role-playing forward/ center, has commanded $100 million.
When the lockout is lifted and training camps open on Tuesday, signings are expected to come spilling out of the N.B.A.'s offices like candy out of a pinata. With more than 200 free agents suddenly able to sign contracts, a flurry of activity is expected to significantly alter the league's power structure.
The players' concession on salary limits was supposed to help the league's fractured economic system. Well, even an aging, injury-prone center like Rik Smits is expected to sign for more than $10 million a year with Indiana, while Luc Longley, who helped the Bulls to three straight N.B.A. titles, may sign with Phoenix for about $4 million a year, less than half of what Smits may receive.
"You're going to see a great disparity among players with similar talents," the agent Marc Fleisher said. "One will sign for $5 million a year, the other will sign for $12 million. They're two almost identical players, but it doesn't matter. It's really which teams have the money and whether they like you."
The dismantling of the Bulls is about to begin in earnest when Scottie Pippen leaves for either Houston or another playoff contender. But it is unclear how many premier free agents will actually change addresses -- especially because their own teams can pay them more than any other franchise.
Antonio McDyess of Phoenix, Damon Stoudamire of Portland, Tom Gugliotta of Minnesota and Rod Strickland of Washington -- some of the bigger names available -- may end up staying put. McDyess, for example, could receive no more than $67.5 million over six years from a new team under the new labor agreement. But the Suns could offer him a contract of $86.6 million over seven years because he is their free agent.
The other reason several franchises may not go after that special someone this week: a more attractive special someone could be available this summer. Stephon Marbury, Antoine Walker, Marcus Camby, Ray Allen and Allen Iverson, who all will be free agents after this season, represent a younger, more potent future for many clubs.
"Some teams might be saving their money when a better class of free agents becomes available," said Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' president and general manager.
 
Bracing for a Chilling Effect
In the wake of the players association's decertification of Steve Woods, an Atlanta-based agent who blasted the union during its negotiations with the N.B.A., several other agents were concerned about their involvement in the labor dispute and how it would affect their relationship with the union.
Woods, who said, among other things, that he would not trust Patrick Ewing, the union president, to organize a company picnic, was notified of the decertification on Thursday in a letter. It said Woods's "inaccurate statements indicate that you are not qualified to represent members of this union in individual contract negotiations with N.B.A. teams." The union's action prevents Woods from negotiating contracts for N.B.A. players.
 Woods has since filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board against the union. The charge will be investigated next week.
Woods has only two clients, Kevin Willis and Willie Burton. Willis is under contract with Toronto, but Woods has written the union a letter requesting that he be allowed to negotiate a deal for Burton.
The union declined comment, but the action taken against Woods could signal disciplinary action for agents like Harold MacDonald and Norman Blass, who also openly criticized the union.
The agent Leonard Armato, even though he did not publicly criticize the union, was seen as a nettlesome presence during the labor negotiations, and not many agents engendered as much ill will among their peers. But the union probably will not scold Armato, because of the stature of his only client, Shaquille O'Neal.
Acting as a liaison for Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, and N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern, Armato arranged a secret meeting between the two at his Los Angeles office on Dec. 23.
Claiming his friendship with Stern made him privy to how the commissioner thought, Armato tried to soften the union's hard-line stance toward the league during a conference call with other agents.
Arn Tellem, the agent for Kobe Bryant and several other stars, took to calling Armato "Tessio," after the character in "The Godfather" who betrays the Corleone family.
The day before the agreement was signed, Armato, frustrated with the lack of progress, was poised to lead a group of agents in a minirevolt against the union. But he disagrees with the notion that he was going behind Hunter's back.
"I was a facilitator of communication at first and then I became sort of a mediator at the end," Armato said. "I pulled the parties together. I would not have been willing to let the league blow up. If I could be helpful in any way in fashioning a compromise, I've done my job."
Not all his peers agreed, though.
"Well, let's see, Shaq's his only client and he gets about 4 percent of Shaq's $15 million, which is zero if you don't have a season," the agent Keith Glass said. "Sure, Leonard was concerned about the integrity of the game."

HEADLINE: The Governor-President

BYLINE: By Jacob Weisberg; Jacob Weisberg is a contributing writer for the magazine. His most recent article was about Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.

 BODY:
As a 10-year-old glued to the TV through the summer of Watergate, I remember the air of gravity that hung over the proceedings, the sense that it was a dreadful necessity to put a President on trial. I don't recall authority figures having to explain that it was a national crisis -- even to a kid, that was pretty obvious. One of the oddest things about the impeachment weekend just before Christmas was the constant stream of reminders that the country was again experiencing such a crisis. Throughout the ordeal, legislators and commentators tried to come up with more dramatic ways to frame the events taking place. Bill Clinton was about to become only the second President ever impeached. He would be our first elected President ever impeached. All through the holidays and on into January the tone remained the same: we were having the first Senate trial of a President in 130 years. Watching TV was like having someone grab you by the lapels and shout, Don't you understand this is supposed to be historic!
 Bill Clinton's impeachment is historic in the sense of it being an event historians will puzzle over in decades to come. But what those historians will have to ponder is not how it shook the country, but why it didn't. They will have to explain how the country experienced the form of a constitutional crisis without the content of one, how an impeachment could drive a President's approval rating up instead of down. They may be better disposed than contemporary observers of the Clinton scandal to look beyond the Dow Jones industrial average for an explanation. For Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal represents something that is truly historic -- a break in the way the American Presidency functions. 
 For the 60 years or so that preceded Clinton's election in 1992, the nation lived through what might be described as the heroic phase of the American Presidency. Not that all modern Presidents have been heroes, of course. But beginning in the late 1920's, the country was enveloped in a succession of crises -- the Great Depression, the Second World War and the cold war. We measured our Presidents against their roles in these great events. Thankfully, we're now living in different times. The nation is at peace and growing more prosperous, not merely or even mostly as a consequence of executive decision-making, but as a backdrop to it. This places a different and in some ways more difficult burden on the leader of the free world. An American President now has a more diffuse and bewildering job. He must focus on a series of comparatively minor problems at home, make sense of internation-al confusion and compete for the public's attention with more captivating forms of entertainment.
 Clinton has not failed to keep his public entertained. To some it has seemed like a tragedy, to others a sitcom. Following the pattern of his career in Arkansas and of his accident-prone 1992 campaign, Clinton as President has repeatedly toyed with ruin, practically digging his own grave, only to pop back up, Houdini-like, after everyone thought he could no longer be breathing. With his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, his dialogue with disaster has reached what is likely to be its final phase (though another eruption is always possible). The debate is no longer over Clinton's continued viability as a politician, because he faces no more elections. The stain of impeachment cannot be washed away by what he does in his remaining time in the White House, because part of what his impeachment means is that the House of Representatives is no longer much interested in doing business with him. A conviction in a Senate trial would make Clinton history sooner rather than later, but whether he is convicted, acquitted or censured as a result of some Senate-White House deal, it does not seem too soon to try to characterize his Presidency. Bill Clinton is the President who, for better and worse, turned the White House into a governor's mansion.
Bill Clinton was worried about his legacy long before he learned, a year ago, that the world was about to learn about Monica Lewinsky. In his book, "Behind the Oval Office," Dick Morris described a Sunday- morning phone conversation in August1996 on the topic of how Clinton would rate in the history books. Clinton agreed he wasn't a top-tier President, but wondered what he could do to make it into the ranks of Morris's second tier, with Harry Truman, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan. (Morris said he'd have to do three big things: make welfare reform work, balance the Federal budget and smash international terrorism, on top of some littler things.)
 Though the word "legacy" has a positive cast, Presidential historians often use it to convey a more neutral meaning. A legacy is properly understood as a mark left on the country for good or for ill. Popular democracy is Andrew Jackson's legacy. The national park system is part of Theodore Roosevelt's. The New Deal, which molded the modern Federal Government, is F.D.R.'s. Watergate is Nixon's. There are legacies of neglect, like Ronald Reagan's bequest to his successors of a vast Federal budget deficit (offset by his affirmative legacy of drawing the cold war to a surprising and successful close). Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, to name three of our last five Presidents, arguably left no major legacy at all. The same is true of the late-19th-century Presidents who populate the murk between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.
 We know something else about Presidential legacies. Matters that loom large now will diminish in retrospect. Clinton's popularity, and by extension his survival as President, do rely heavily on the extraordinary strength of the economy, now in the eighth year of what will soon become our longest known peacetime expansion. But over time, even that impressive statistic is likely to fade in importance. A lousy economy can define a Presidency, as it did for Herbert Hoover. But the simple fact of a good economy tends not to make a legacy. If it did, Eisenhower, Johnson and Nixon would be considered greater Presidents than F.D.R. and Truman.
 There is already a rough consensus among historians that Clinton is a significant President. He stands to be remembered, most obviously, for causing a big scandal and getting impeached, but also for getting re-elected, something no Democrat since F.D.R. had done. But Clinton, I think, will also be remembered for reforming the Federal Government and for reshaping his party. Most strikingly, Clinton, like Andrew Jackson and F.D.R., has changed the very nature of the American Presidency. Where those two Presidents expanded the role and importance of the Presidency, Clinton has downsized the office, both in the negative sense of stripping away some of its dignity and in the positive one of making adjustments demanded by the historical moment.
 Coming to the White House from the governor's mansion in Little Rock, Clinton has recast the Presidency on the more modest model of his previous job. Unlike Presidents, governors have few opportunities to be visionaries. Instead, they do what Clinton has done -- a job of crisis management, political accommodation and governmental reform.
 In one way, the public doesn't expect much from a governor; in another way it expects a great deal. A governor is expected to address whatever issues arise, from upgrading the skills of his state's work force to reducing traffic congestion on its highways. Financial constraints deny governors the possibility of grander schemes. Within the confines of balanced and limited budgets, however, they can distinguish themselves with creative social policy ideas. In smaller states, the governor is a familiar figure whose blunders and foibles are as well known as his cartoon caricature. If the governor proves himself intelligent and capable, people tend to be willing to indulge a fair amount of rascality on his part. As flawed as he may be, he's all that protects them from a Legislature that's inevitably far worse than he is.
Governors, of course, don't shape foreign policy. There's no doubt Clinton will be remembered as primarily a domestic President and perhaps the first in a line of domestic Presidents who followed the cold war. Clinton ran on domestic and economic issues in 1992, in answer to George Bush's international focus. His platform, "Putting People First," the most detailed policy statement ever issued by a candidate, elaborated a series of ideas about how to make government more effective. Clinton has improved a range of Federal agencies and programs. But what may stand as most significant is not just that he mended broken policies, but that he restored the feeling that domestic government could work.
 From his first Presidential campaign, Clinton was guided by a revised philosophy of government's role. Probably the most underappreciated thing Clinton's did during his first year was expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program by which the Federal Government supplements the income of low-wage workers. Clinton's notion was that if you work full time, you shouldn't have an income below the poverty line. A government commitment to this principle exemplified his reform liberalism. As a successor to the New Deal-Great Society archetype of ever-expanding social benefits, Clinton proposed a more modest, reciprocal model, one based on what he has described as an exchange of opportunity for responsibility, and hence a model based on more limited expectations of what the Federal Government can do. During his 1992 campaign, Clinton characterized this notion, in a phrase coined by Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy Institute, as the "New Covenant."
 Clinton's subsequent successes, like national service and welfare reform, have come from applying this notion of a limited social contract. His early failures occurred when he strayed from it, relapsing into the older pattern of delivering new Federal benefits from on high. Most notable was his failure in health care.
 It's possible that a better-designed and more politically astute plan could have placed his Presidency on stronger footing. But Clinton botched the design and marketing of his plan, setting himself at odds with moderates in both parties whose support he needed. Considering himself a centrist reformer, Clinton didn't see the potential for his "managed competition" scheme to be portrayed as an oldfangled liberal spending program.
 What Clinton didn't yet get was the depth of the discontent with the way government was working. When he took office, trust in government had been steadily eroding for a quarter century. In 1964, 76 percent of Americans told pollsters they thought they could trust government to do the right thing all or most of the time. In 1994, the year Clinton's plan for health-care reform fizzled, the number who said they trusted government bottomed out at 15 percent. The nature of this disillusion is a debate of its own, but it was based at least in part on the failures of government in welfare and public housing, in worsening crime and deteriorating public education.
 This loss of confidence easily attached itself to Clinton's attempt to award the Federal Government another vast responsibility. Clinton was regarded as someone who had promised change and failed to deliver. This frustration came to fruition in 1994. Not until the ascendancy of the Gingrich Congress did Clinton fully grasp the depth of disenchantment with Washington. But from that point on, Clinton began to understand that he had to grapple with this corrosive skepticism. Michael Waldman, Clinton's chief speech writer, remembers sitting with him in the White House residence working on last year's State of the Union address. At one point, according to Waldman, Clinton paused and remarked that "F.D.R.'s mission was to save capitalism from its excesses. Our mission has been to save government from its own excesses so it can again be a progressive force."
 The idea of Clinton as the savior of liberal government will strike many as perverse. Following the 1994 election, Clinton faced tremendous criticism, not just from Republicans but also from Democrats who felt he was trying to jettison, in an effort at conciliation, the party's bedrock beliefs. The lightning rod for this anger became his nefarious political consultant Morris, whom Democratic traditionalists saw as pulling Clinton not in the direction of reform, but toward a dead centrism derived from opinion polls. Clinton was much ridiculed for proposing microinterventions like free walkie-talkies for neighborhood watch groups.
 But what Clinton was beginning to understand was that government's failures weren't arcane managerial issues; they were questions of public trust. While devising gubernatorial-scale programs that encapsulated his New Covenant approach, he proceeded to address the two biggest causes of that mistrust. First, Clinton agreed to the Republican goal of a balanced budget. But where the G.O.P. long supported a balanced budget as a means of downsizing government, Clinton saw it as a way to reinvigorate government. From his first economic plan in 1993, Clinton regarded the deficit as a problem serious enough to warrant putting many of his pet projects on hold. What he subsequently discovered was that by operating within the context of a balanced budget, he could argue for expanding spending in certain areas, like school construction or national service, without being accused of fiscal irresponsibility. The Federal budget had become like a state budget. Only if government was convincingly limited in size could it hope to get away with activism.
 His second and arguably more important decision was following through on his campaign promise to end welfare "as we know it." Many liberals mistook Clinton's interest in the subject as political; they saw the subtext as race baiting. In fact, Clinton saw welfare as disruptive of the proper relationship between government and its citizens. The system's unpopularity was not just because of its being counterproductive or a waste of resources, but because it offered something for nothing.
 Members of Clinton's cabinet objected strenuously to his decision to accept a modified Republican bill based on the idea of block grants, and a few of his own policy makers resigned in protest over the issue. The smoke of battle obscured the fact that Clinton was following through on his New Covenant notion of welfare reform and not merely acceding to a punitive rollback. Clinton could also see that the country's governors, already embarked on a variety of welfare-reform experiments, were in the best position to know how the system might be fixed. Only in the last year has it become evident that Clinton did reform welfare largely in the way he said he would with pretty much the results he anticipated. Welfare rolls have declined from five million families in 1995 to three million in June 1998. A downturn in the economy could curtail this progress by making it harder to place people in jobs, but at the moment the national picture is one of drastically declining levels of dependency with scant evidence of increased misery.
 These promising signs have been accompanied by progress in other areas in which government has failed. Under Henry Cisneros, the Department of Housing and Urban Development actually began breaking up pockets of concentrated poverty by tearing down parts of the worst urban housing projects and moving to voucher-based subsidies. Cities have also benefited from two changes that may have been largely incidental to Clinton's agenda -- a big drop in crime and the end of a long-term increase in out-of-wedlock births. Together these developments have begun to have a tipping-point effect for America's urban centers. It's too early to say that these improvements have restored the 30-year slide in faith in government. But from its low in 1994, confidence in government had recovered more than 20 points by early 1998. Impeachment has driven it down a bit -- but to nowhere near its lowest level.
As collections of disparate interests and ideologies, political parties are never fully agreed or united. But there are times when disagreement within parties is stimulating and productive rather than harmful. Unresolved differences get put aside for the sake of more important common goals and are subsumed under the aegis of a popular and effective leader. In recent years, we have seen this happen twice, once to the G.O.P. in the 1980's under Ronald Reagan and again to the Democrats in the 1990's under Bill Clinton.
 Before Clinton was elected in 1992, conventional wisdom held that the Democrats faced a crisis. After 12 years of G.O.P. White House rule and defeat in five of the previous six Presidential elections, the party had seemingly ceased to become competitive at the Presidential level. Peter Brown's 1991 book, "Minority Party: Why Democrats Face Defeat in 1992 and Beyond," was one of several arguing the thesis. White working-class and suburban middle-class voters, according to the conventional wisdom, were abandoning the party in droves because of its excessively liberal positions on crime, welfare, foreign policy and "values" issues. How could the Democrats become politically competitive again in an era when what the party once stood for -- an expanding Federal role -- was proving less and less popular? The party itself was deeply divided over how and whether it should evolve. On one side was a group of centrist reformers clustered around the Democratic Leadership Council. On the other was a rump of liberal traditionalists, including labor unions and minority groups who viewed D.L.C. positions as treasonable to their basic beliefs.
 Clinton has faced the problems of his party -- at least at the Presidential level -- methodically, systematically and effectively. To a remarkable degree, he has succeeded in making once seemingly incurable ailments vanish, while giving back to the Democrats the kind of well-oiled national political machine they had before 1968.
 His first task was pulling thorns from the party paw. Asked which party did a better job handling crime, voters chose the G.O.P. by a margin of 18 points in 1991. Clinton reversed this pattern by jettisoning Dukakis-era positions like opposition to the death penalty while exploiting the one aspect of the issue where public opinion diverges from the dictates of G.O.P. interest- group politics: gun control. Clinton doesn't have much of a basis for claiming that it's his policies that have reduced crime rates over the past several years, but he has put away the charge that Democrats don't like punishing criminals. Recent surveys show the parties polling essentially even on the issue.
 What's most remarkable is not that Clinton has taken crime and other reliable wedge issues away from Republicans. It's that he has done so while unifying a party that was itself divided over these issues. In 1992, both the New Democrats and the traditionalists supported Clinton in the belief that he was, at heart, one of them. Perhaps inevitably, both sides were disappointed in the way he governed. For much of his first term Clinton was out of favor with the center or the left of the party, or both at the same time. In his first two years, the D.L.C. saw Clinton as swinging left with his health-care plan and tax increase. In his second two years, liberals griped over Clinton's accession to a balanced budget and welfare reform. But by the time of the 1996 election, Clinton had again forged an alliance.
 Many people are puzzled about how Clinton has been able to appease liberal constituencies while flouting their principles -- confronting unions with Nafta, poor blacks with welfare reform, teachers with charter schools and feminists with Paula Jones. The simplest explanation is that he has restored a model last seen among Democrats during the Presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when those joining his coalition get to experience victory and taste power. Clinton has created a sense of partisan pride powerful enough to quell the narcissism of small differences. This thrill of putting up a good fight against a common enemy -- something Presidents as different as Reagan and F.D.R. have created and used -- has overcome ideological and sometimes moral scruples. Democratic activists have taken the advice he gave a group of them in 1981: "When someone is beating you over the head with a hammer . . . take out a meat cleaver and cut off their hand."
 It hasn't always been pretty, or even, perhaps, ethical. Since 1992, Clinton's style has been to dispense with qualms and play politics in as ruthless and relentless a way as the G.O.P. In the 1980's, Reagan and Bush were charged with relying on polling to an unprecedented degree; Clinton has gone them one better, market-testing his rhetoric then deploying it with a numbing repetitive precision. He answered the slick fabrications of Michael Deaver with the more subtle and compelling mythography of Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. He dug deeper for dirt on his opponents, devised more effective 30-second attack ads and showed great ingenuity in exploiting loopholes in the campaign finance law.
 The biggest change is financial. In the 1980's, the G.O.P. advantage in fund-raising was as high as 5 to 1. In the 1992 election cycle, Clinton and Ron Brown, then chairman of the Democratic National Committee, whittled it down to 3 to 2. In 1996, Clinton and Harold Ickes nearly caught up in the chief corporate category, so-called soft money, bringing in $123 million to the G.O.P.'s $138 million. They did this with willful blindness about the sources of these funds. Clinton's attitude is that because the rules aren't enforced and Republicans are preventing him from creating a level playing field he is free to fight as dirty as they do.
Since the Lewinsky scandal, various sectors of the ideologically disgruntled Democratic "base" -- those who might be thought to be less than keen about Clinton's small-bore, poll-driven, corporate-friendly centrism -- have been the President's staunchest supporters. Black leaders disappointed with Clinton over matters ranging from the balanced budget to welfare reform have flocked to his defense. Among blacks, Clinton's approval rating remains as high as Ronald Reagan's rating was among conservative Republicans. This is a testament in part to the real feeling Clinton evinces over racial issues, as well as to black sensitivity to prosecutorial unfairness and sympathy for victims of persecution. But it also speaks to a different kind of party, one in which members are willing to settle for half a loaf.
 Republicans, on the other hand, now face the problem of a radical base that has lost its willingness to postpone gratification. The adage that Democrats look for heretics while Republicans seek converts has ceased to apply. To a remarkable degree, the parties have switched places.
 Clinton's political formula is now almost universally regarded as a winning one for Democrats. All of the serious contenders for the 2000 Democratic nomination have indicated their desire to continue in the same basic direction. Al Gore, Bill Bradley and John Kerry have all positioned themselves as Clinton Democrats. The potential contenders who do not fit this profile -- Paul Wellstone and Jesse Jackson -- are running as protest candidates. Clinton's "Third Way" formula has an international following as well. From a historical viewpoint, the question is whether a Democratic successor will be able to carry off Clinton's balancing act within the party. There is a worrisome analogy in the G.O.P., where Reagan became a successful two-term President by appeasing the religious right while reaching out to moderate voters. George Bush's efforts to sustain this equilibrium made the Republican right truculent to the point of self-destructiveness. Today the G.O.P. remains badly divided, looking back to the Reagan years as an irretrievable golden age. Clinton's successor, almost certain to lack his political gifts and perhaps his ruthlessness, faces an enormous challenge in maintaining the Clinton coalition. Yet it is what happens to his party after he leaves the scene that will determine whether remaking it constitutes a major aspect of Clinton's legacy.
Clinton's policy and political successes will still have to be weighed against his personal reputation. Even if his impeachment continues to be seen as disproportionate punishment, it will be remembered that Clinton gave his enemies the sword they used against him. Assuming he is not convicted by the Senate and finishes his term, impeachment will still be in the first paragraph of Clinton's obituary.
 At some level, Clinton can't escape becoming a historical joke. He is now and forever our priapic President, who takes his place alongside our drunken President, Ulysses S. Grant, our napping President, Calvin Coolidge, and our treacherous President, Richard Nixon. Whatever else he does in office, Clinton will not be able to keep this out of his capsule biography: he's the one who had oral sex with a 21-year-old intern in the Oval Office, got caught, lied, caused a national spectacle and saw it undermine his second term. This story line may be tempered with sympathy. In a longer view, Clinton's libido may not differentiate him from Franklin Roosevelt (who died with his mistress, not his wife) or John Kennedy (who arranged orgies in the White House swimming pool). But it will be hard to avoid the view that there was something more reckless about Clinton, because he had no basis for thinking the press would protect him, as it did his predecessors.
 Nor can Clinton escape his reputation for being slippery. He is not the first President to lie, or lie under oath. But he will surely be remembered as someone who habitually played games with the truth. Clinton is the President who said he never inhaled, who told a national audience, "I did not have sexual relations with that woman" and considered it true because his definition of sexual relations did not include receiving oral sex. The most evasive of these lines, like "It depends on what the meaning of the word is' is," are destined for inclusion in Bartlett's. Clinton is to hairsplitting legalisms what Yogi Berra is to tautological absurdities; he seems nearly to have invented the form.
 It will also be recalled that he was disloyal to friends and took advantage of people who worked for him. Early in his Presidency, Clinton failed to stand by nominees in trouble, even when they were old friends like ZRated PG-13e Baird. He has taken advantage of faithful aides, using and disposing of them when convenient, as with Harold Ickes, whom Clinton threw overboard after Ickes finished the dirty work involved in getting him re-elected. His sexual incontinence was itself a betrayal of people who spent years working for him, some of whom faced their own legal problems because they helped protect him. He led subordinates like his former press secretary Michael McCurry to damage their own professional reputations by amplifying his lies. Clinton will be remembered as, among other things, a cad.
 But more significant than what the impeachment episode says about Clinton's character may be what it tells us about national mores at century's end. Contrary to the prediction of many reporters, myself included, the scandal not only did not end his Presidency; it actually made a President re-elected on a "values" agenda more popular. When the scandal first broke a year ago, Washington reporters were still dealing with the issue of whether to protect the public from information they assumed it was too unsophisticated to handle. Few suspected how much the rest of the country had changed in the previous decade. The America of today is no longer the America of 1987, the year that Gary Hart was driven from a Presidential race by the Donna Rice scandal and that Clinton decided not to go for the nomination after his aide Betsey Wright presented him with a list of ex-lovers capable of sabotaging his candidacy.
 Clinton is not simply the beneficiary of the arrival of a more tolerant moral standard; he is personally responsible for its application to politics. He was the first Presidential candidate to publicly acknowledge that he had committed adultery. Some have argued that, based on the famous "60 Minutes" appearance, in which he acknowledged causing pain in his marriage, there was an implicit bargain between Clinton and the voters. If we elected him, he promised to sin no more. But the real proposition was direct and explicit: Clinton stood for office on the basis of what he could do rather than who he would be. Unlike previous Presidents, he proposed to be hired on the basis of his abilities and his approach to government, not his qualities as a moral exemplar. He was promising to be a good governor.
 Such a promise is built into Clinton's own view of government. The notion of a New Covenant implies a transformation in expectations. Washington no longer delivers solutions to our problems; it merely helps us to solve them. Not looking to government as an all-purpose savior implies no longer putting politicians on a pedestal. To perform their new role, leaders don't have to be ideal human beings, superior projections of ourselves. They merely need to understand our problems and help us grapple with them. If they hold up their end of the bargain, by governing well, we won't go beyond ours by judging them harshly for inevitable human failings. While he has surely tested our commitment to this pact, Clinton has held up his end of it.
 The compact that Clinton embodies has emerged as our country's de facto standard of political morality. We are still less dismissive of marital infidelity than, say, the French. But like the Europeans and Canadians, we now distinguish public from private in the lives of our leaders, and forbear from judgments about the latter. The new rules have not taken hold everywhere yet. Much of the press has yet to assimilate the concept that most of the public no longer considers intrusive reporting about private lives relevant to democratic decision-making. Nonetheless, a President with a rare ability to compartmentalize his psyche has ratified a new attitude toward the private lives of public figures.
 You can go further than that and say that the Lewinsky scandal says something not just about the development of American political morality, but also about American morality in general. A quick survey might leave one with the impression that the 1990's were the decade that Puritanism died. Since Clinton has been President, homosexuality has gained public acceptance; legal gambling has swept the country; pornography has become ubiquitous; and vice has been redefined as disease. Meanwhile, the public has become unshockable about sex and unconcerned about Presidential adultery. These changes imply that traditional morality has receded.
 But something more complicated is going on. The same public that has forgiven Clinton his trespasses holds to a strict personal morality and has endorsed Clinton's emphasis on "values" in government programs -- what Prof. Michael Sandel of Harvard calls Clinton's repudiation of "moral neutrality" in public policy.
 The harmonization of these seeming contradictions may be arising from the increasingly subtle distinction Americans are making between the public and private realms. One striking thing the sociologist Alan Wolfe shows in his book "One Nation, After All" is that while American suburbanites are far from relativistic in their own moral views, they shrink from judging the private behavior of others, and dislike moralizing when they see it practiced. At the same time, they want government policy to support their values.
 The Lewinsky scandal writes these distinctions large. Few approve of Clinton's behavior. Yet the vast majority object even more to casting stones at the President for mistakes in an area where he is answerable to his family and his God, not to voters or the media. Though these mistakes may make it impossible for Clinton to talk about values any longer, voters care more about how he applied his views in public -- welfare reform, for example -- than how he violated them in private. Clinton didn't devise this ethic, but his election and survival encapsulate it. He leaves behind an electorate that wants its values embedded in public policy, but that no longer moralizes about private behavior.
One historical issue about Clinton's impeachment may be a simple extension of the current mystery: why a Republican Congress pursued it. Scholars of the 21st century will recall that removing a popular President from office was very unlikely, that it wasn't dictated by the Constitution and that demanding it was obviously harmful to the G.O.P.'s public standing. The episode will undoubtedly be measured, as it already has been, against Andrew Johnson's impeachment in 1868. A historical consensus now views Johnson's impeachment largely as a mistake that grew out of the aggravated passions of the Reconstruction Era. The deeper fight was over the terms under which the Southern states would be readmitted to the union. In 1999, we have a similarly overheated political environment, yet it's hard to see what the fuss is really about.
 This time, the prime motivating factor in impeachment seems to be personal. There's a simmering hatred of Clinton, which has boiled hotter and hotter through his time in office and bears little relation to the passions people ordinarily bring to politics. What explains it? Historians examining this phenomenon years hence might ask first if Clinton-hating came from interests threatened by his policies, following the pattern of F.D.R. But Clinton has hardly been a foe to the moneyed classes. On policy grounds, Republicans might be expected to embrace a President who shares their views on big issues including free trade, balancing the Federal budget, crime and welfare.
The most common explanation is that hatred for Clinton is an expression of "a culture war." The idea here is that in their strenuous dislike of the President, conservatives are fighting a battle over the 1960's and its legacy. Clinton is the first baby-boomer President, the first who dodged the Vietnam draft and admitted to smoking marijuana. His conservative opponents, including many members of the same generation, see such a figure as a threat to the moral order. During the impeachment fight, Tom DeLay, the House Republican whip, described it as "a debate about relativism versus absolute truth."
 But the culture-war argument doesn't do justice to an antipathy that goes back to Clinton's candidacy. I think there are three separate psychological profiles of Clinton-hating, which have blurred together at times. The first type of Clinton-hater is liberal, and he does derive his hatred from the 60's. His is the view that Clinton is a fundamentally disingenuous and inauthentic person who uses public interest as a cover for private ambition. This opinion, which is manifest in much of Clinton's press coverage, does not draw a line between the personal and the political. The problem isn't that Clinton committed adultery or that he lied about adultery. Indeed, these lapses have inclined liberal critics to support him. What they object to is that Clinton cares about winning more than he cares about principles; that he has thrown overboard such worthy causes as civil liberties, intervention in Bosnia, human rights in China and campaign finance reform.
 A second kind of hostility to Clinton is neither liberal nor conservative but comes from the Washington establishment. Sally Quinn, the journalist and Washington hostess, has written that the Clintons "dissed" Georgetown society -- a culture she approaches not merely as an anthropologist -- by neglecting its advice and avoiding its company. This is true, but the falling out goes well beyond a mere social snub. By downsizing the Presidency and ushering in an era of a less ambitious Federal Government, Clinton has made Washington and its establishment less important. By turning away from both foreign affairs and big-ticket domestic programs, Clinton has made Washington less central to the concerns of the nation than it was in the days of SALT treaties. Turning the Presidency into the country's biggest governor's job is contrary to the political establishment's sense of the office and their relation to it. By allowing the Lewinsky scandal to happen, Clinton has turned the American Presidency (and by extension those who feed off it) into an international laughingstock. "Clinton acted . . . as if he does not recognize what it means to be President of the United States," wrote David Broder, a Washington Post columnist, after Clinton's first nationally televised mea culpa.
 The third and most potent kind of Clinton-hating is conservative, but is related to the liberal kind in its aversion to a Democrat who plays politics to win. Instead of being pleased that Clinton has enacted parts of their agenda, Republicans are furious at him for co-opting the best bits of it. With the end of their monopoly on such issues as crime, welfare and balancing the budget, Republicans are forced to contend with Democrats over issues where their positions are distinctly less popular: education, the environment, Social Security and social issues like abortion and homosexuality. Clinton's seizure of the center has driven the G.O.P. to the right, empowering the radicals who want either to legislate on the basis of a narrow moral code or drastically curtail the Federal Government's role, or both. To conservatives, Clinton didn't win the center legitimately. He stole it from them.
 Clinton himself is most focused on the Republican opposition. A year ago, he invited a group of historians to meet with him for a private talk. This was just before he was to give his deposition in the Paula Jones case. After a discussion about the Progressive Movement and past Presidents, Clinton held forth to a smaller group clustered around him. The right, he inveighed, controlled most of American politics. They had both houses of Congress, the think tanks and the big money. He was all that stood in the way of conservative control over the whole apparatus of government. Republicans would never accept him as legitimate, one of the participants remembers the President thundering at nearly midnight, because he was blocking their ascent to power. A few weeks later, the First Lady described her husband's opponents as a vast right-wing conspiracy."
 The question of Clinton-hating finally transcends conventional political analysis. It's personal and aggravated. Detestation of the President is worsened by the phenomenon of sustained public support for Clinton, which his opponents find baffling. Why does this man's approval rating rise in the teeth of humiliation? At one level, Clinton's supporters have made a pragmatic judgment that he governs in their interest. But at another level, he draws on a reservoir not of love, not of respect even, but of identification.
 This identification works in two directions. It is partly the public's identification with Clinton, the perpetual underdog who refuses to ever quit fighting. To a public that consumes quantities of confessional entertainment and self-help advice, Clinton's turmoil seems not bizarre, but familiar. His cyclical progress through stages of sin, denial, contrition and forgiveness has humanized him like no previous President. To a public that had already accepted Clinton with his faults, the Starr report arrived not as a shocking indictment, but as a juicy soap opera with footnotes. As with other celebrities, Clinton's screw-ups are a comforting reminder that he isn't any better than the rest of us and doesn't think that he is.
 But possibly more important is the way Clinton himself identifies with regular people. No one who has ever seen him work a rope line or entertain questions at a town meeting can fail to be impressed by the way that he engages with ordinary people. In public forums, Clinton is not just indefatigable, requiring his aides to forcibly pull him away from people who want to shake his hand at the end of an evening. He is, unlike any other politician of this generation, in his element with a crowd -- black, white, religious, academic -- it almost doesn't matter. Clinton moves an audience by empathizing with its feelings and concerns. The way he draws sustenance by relating to strangers is part and parcel of his political talent.
 Clinton-haters of all kinds often describe the President's caring about the problems of regular folk in terms of fakery. They think his "I feel your pain" act is exactly that, a fraud, rather than an expression of natural sympathy. There is in their anger at him something of the mystification with which the liberal intelligentsia beheld Reagan's popularity with the rest of the country. It's as if Clinton's bond with the public was based on some kind of black art. In Reagan's case, this was chalked up to the mesmeric power of his acting (a power never attributed to him during his screen career). With no ready explanation of how Clinton does it, conservatives like William Bennett have often taken the route of becoming infuriated with the public for falling for such a charlatan.
 In both the popular defense of Clinton and the elite attacks upon him, one hears the echoes of the passions evoked by two former Presidents: Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt. Jackson, like Clinton, was twice elected President on the basis of a powerful mutual identification with the public. Conservatives suspected and feared Jackson's popularity, because it represented a different version of democracy from the one the founders had envisioned, a kind they saw as close to mob rule. F.D.R. had a similar bond with ordinary people, which opened up a well of class resentment. People who called Roosevelt "that man" felt that as a patrician populist he was a phony and an opportunist. Many of Clinton's critics see him likewise as a beneficiary of meritocratic privilege who has seduced the heartland. They fear him, as they feared Jackson and F.D.R., as a demagogue.
 Clinton's bond with the public is based less on economic unfairness than was Jackson's or Roosevelt's and more on a kind of post-ideological pragmatism. He has devised an idiosyncratic populism, based on the sense of him as a personally flawed but public-spirited and highly intelligent leader ready to fight to his last breath for the people who elected him.
Redefining Government's role will never make Clinton beloved in the way F.D.R. is beloved. But he may well be remembered as a President who squarely faced the big problem presented to him with the resources at his command. Someday, the loathing that Clinton provokes may be understood in the context of his role in creating a post-cold-war Presidency. Americans may recognize that liberals objected to a narrower role for government, that the Washington establishment resisted his diminishing its stature and that conservatives objected to his substituting prudent downsizing for radical deconstruction.
 Knowing Clinton as it has known no other incumbent President, the public has nonetheless refrained from judging him -- or at least has been willing to judge him in his complexity, separating his private behavior from his record. I expect historians will continue to draw the distinction in one way or another. Clinton is likely to remain an equivocal figure, a man of significant accomplishments and flawed character, who created gratuitous troubles but defined a social transformation in surviving them. He may come to be remembered as the most paradoxical President: an undisciplined man who reformed government and in so doing restored trust in it, while inspiring almost none in himself.

 CORRECTION:
An article on page 30 of The Times Magazine today about President Clinton's legacy includes an outdated reference to possible contenders for the Democratic nomination in 2000. On Jan. 9, after the article had gone to press, Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota announced that he would not seek the Presidency.

A Brazilian Shot Heard Round the World

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
With Brazil as the fulcrum, the world's financial markets seesawed last week, plunging day after day, only to swing back up joyously on Friday, once the Brazilian Government decided to quit defending its currency, the real. Hoping the move will lead to falling interest rates, it will let the real float.
 
 Analysts said the Brazilian economy had a better chance of reviving, once the Government stopped throwing good money after bad defending the real. "There's less fear of a domino effect, of one emerging market after another collapsing," Michael Schroer, chief investment officer at Renaissance Investment Management in Cincinnati told Bloomberg News.
 Brzil's benchmark Bovespa index surged 33.4 percent on Friday but was still off 1 percent for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 219.62, or 2.4 percent, on Friday, closing at 9,340.55. Even so, it was down 3.1 percent for the week. Markets in London and Frankfurt were similar to those in New York - surging on Friday, but not enough to overcome the week's losses. Like the Dow, they had reached highs the previous week. In Tokyo, where the market was closed for a holiday on Friday, the Nikkei 225 index was up 2.5 percent for the week.

Click for Customer Service. Then Wish You Hadn't.

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
IF on-line retailers steamrolled their way into the spotlight during the past holiday season, one thing is clear: They crushed a few toes along the way.
Consumers have long lamented the state of customer service on line, but perhaps never as vociferously as in the last two months. Stories abound of vendors that shipped products late, sent the wrong item and then ignored complaints, or that required customers to pay the cost of returning goods and then tacked on restocking charges. And then there's the loathsome E-mail "auto response," with advice on everything but what the customer asked about. 
 Asked to summarize on-line customer service in a word, David Cooperstein, senior analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm, responded: "Pathetic."
Web sites have the powerful advantage of making companies seem accessible and easy to interact with. It's an appearance that all kinds of companies, not just retailers, can have trouble living up to. Brightware, an E-mail software company, reported in a study released on Thursday that when it tried to reach the 100 largest American public companies by E-mail, 26 either did not accept E-mail or made it so difficult to find the E-mail forms on their Web sites that the surveyors gave up trying. Of the remainder, only 15 responded within three hours; 10 didn't reply at all.
Matthew Garelick of Somerville, Mass., knows the frustration of unrequited E-mail. In early December he ordered the movie "Out of Sight" on DVD from Bigstar Entertainment, an on-line retailer. Between Dec. 28 and Dec. 30, Mr. Garelick sent E-mail to Bigstar three times, asking why the movie hadn't arrived. "I would've been fine with an auto response," said Mr. Garelick, who eventually received the disk in January. "I just wanted an assurance that they were at least working on it. From now on, I'm not doing business on line with anyone who doesn't have a phone number."
Having a number to call was small comfort to Duke Nguyen of Cincinnati. Mr. Nguyen said he ordered three items from the Internet site of Intuit in early December and then tried to change his order by phone. "Every time, after 20 or so minutes of waiting, I gave up," he said. He tried faxing in his order change. But, he said, the original items were delivered. "Finally, I called and just put on my speaker phone while I waited," he said. After an hour someone answered and he was able to arrange a return. But then Intuit credited him for less than the full value of the goods, he said. He tried a new E-mail button on Intuit's site but got an automated response suggesting, among other things, that he call customer service.
"I'm computer literate," Mr. Nguyen said. "But when it comes to service, these things scare the heck out of me."
Analysts and industry leaders say problems often occur because companies rush to get products and prices onto their Web sites while underestimating the time and resources needed for customer service.
But David Levipsky, executive vice president of Bigstar, said that wasn't the case with his site. The company had anticipated a holiday rush by installing a "very cutting-edge" E-mail system, he said, adding, "So it's surprising to me that this happened."
As for Intuit, Larry Wolfe, senior vice president for the company's tax software division, said the company does the best it can. "Often in December and January, there are times when people wait longer than we'd like them to wait," he said. "But we take it very seriously, and we work very hard to keep call times down."
Analysts say poorly designed Web sites draw complaints. "If a site is designed well, most of the complaints don't happen," said Mr. Cooperstein of Forrester, noting that many sites fail to offer enough information so that customers can help themselves.
THE good news for consumers, analysts say, is that Internet merchants are learning two lessons: that ignoring E-mail is the best way to turn customers into enemies, and that improving Web sites is more cost effective than dedicating battalions of employees to answer complaints.
"The E-mail deluge everybody was worried about we looked at as a total gift," said Matt Hyde, director for on-line sales at REI, a retailer of outdoor goods. "We've made hundreds of changes to our site based on customer service data."
A result: The ratio of E-mail to orders at REI dropped sharply, he said, and so did payroll costs for customer service.
Dell Computer uses both software and employees to answer most of its 10,000 weekly E-mails within a day of receipt, said Manish Mehta, a senior on-line support manager. Its Web site features self-service information like technical support tips.
Shoppers are becoming less tolerant of poor service from on-line retailers. "Consumer expectations have definitely grown, because certain sites have set a high standard," said Jakob Nielsen, a site design expert and publisher. "Fair or unfair, other sites have to live up to that standard."
Perhaps so. But Kent Krueger, co-founder of the Sitstay GoOut Store, said sites that are honest with consumers can weather service problems. Sitstay, which sells specialty products to dog owners, was the only Web site to get a five-star rating for customer support among 500 rated in December by Bizrate, a market research company that surveys on-line shoppers. "We started selling doormats with little Yorkies on them and got a huge number of orders that we weren't prepared for," Mr. Krueger said. "So we got in touch with everyone and told them who we were, what had happened, and we were working on it." As a result, he said, no customers canceled orders.
"The fact is, if you're honest and have a little fun, people will have a good attitude," he added. "But it could also be that dog owners are just a different breed."

HEADLINE: Just What Constitutes a Consumer Stranglehold?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The Microsoft trial is a high-stakes exercise in legal warfare and the witnesses are foot soldiers. On each side they are advocates, committed to winning and thoroughly coached.
And no one expects that honesty will be presented in its undiluted form -- "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth." Instead, the witnesses generally offer their facts and opinions selectively. 
 So when a moment of unbiased honesty occurred at the trial last week, it seemed almost endearing.
The Government's final witness, Franklin M. Fisher, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, was asked if there was any present harm to consumers as a result of Microsoft business practices.
That is difficult to measure, Mr. Fisher replied. But after pausing a moment, this Government witness added, "On balance, I'd think that the answer is no up to this point."
Later, Mr. Fisher did say that he thought that Microsoft's restrictive contracts with computer makers and Internet service suppliers had the effect of reducing choice in the market for software used to browse the World Wide Web by unfairly blocking its rival, Netscape Communications, from key channels of distribution. Yet his main point was that most of what he believes will be the damage to consumers -- in higher prices and reduced choice -- from Microsoft's actions will come in the future.
Still, Mr. Fisher's comment did underline where the two sides differ on key issues. The Government contends that Microsoft has a "choke hold" on software distribution and that consumers will be harmed unless it is reined in. Microsoft replies that the Government has produced no real proof on either front.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson must sift through the conflicting assertions and evidence from both sides to reach a verdict, guided in large measure by antitrust doctrine and the case law that has built up around it. The challenge, though, is that just how the doctrine and the case law apply to the Microsoft case is by no means clear cut.
Take the issue of consumer harm. Microsoft's leadoff witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management, testified last week that there was no evidence of consumer damage from Microsoft's conduct and the suggestion that there might be in the future was "sheer speculation."
In court, the Government did produce evidence showing that the price Microsoft charges computer makers for its Windows operating system had increased in recent years, even as the price of other PC components had declined. But Windows still accounts for less than 5 percent of the price of most PC's and, as Microsoft asserts, it has improved Windows over the years.
Showing measurable harm to consumers, antitrust experts say, is less important in a Federal antitrust suit than it would be in a private case. The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft, unlike a private plaintiff, are not seeking financial damages. Instead, they are seeking court-ordered sanctions to curb what they say is Microsoft's abuse of its monopoly power.
To do that, the Government must convincingly show "the power and conditions from which injury can be inferred," according to Herbert Hovenkamp, a University of Iowa law professor. "Under antitrust law, we assume that markets operate more efficiently for the benefit of consumers under competition," said Mr. Hovenkamp, a consultant to the Government in the Microsoft case.
The Justice Department charges that Microsoft's contracts with computer makers and others unfairly limited Netscape's access to key channels of distribution. Microsoft replies, as Mr. Schmalensee testified, that it does not have "any significant market power over software distribution," noting that Netscape distributed more than 100 million copies of its browser last year.
Exclusive distribution deals, in most cases, are not illegal providing they do not foreclose rivals from a significant share of product distribution. Microsoft's argument is that despite its deals, Netscape could widely distribute its browser over the Internet, by direct mail and in its own deals.
A Federal appeals court ruling in 1997, Omega Environmental Inc. v. Gilbarco Inc., does seem to support that stance. The defendant, Gilbarco, a leading producer of gas pumps, had exclusive deals with nearly 40 percent of the nation's gas pump distributors. But in ruling for Gilbarco, the court noted that gas pump makers had other possible channels of distribution, like selling directly to gas stations. If competitors can reach consumers by other means, it wrote, "it is unclear whether such restrictions foreclose from competition any part of the relevant market."
The Government, however, argues that when a company, like Microsoft, has a powerful monopoly position,the prosecution does not have to show the company tied up, say, 40 percent or more of the distribution. For monopolists, the Supreme Court in 1985 endorsed a stricter standard, ruling in Aspen Skiing Company v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corporation that a contract is illegal if it "unnecessarily excludes or handicaps competitors."
The Government also asserts that expense, difficulty and quality of access to distribution are issues in determining whether Microsoft's contracts unfairly exclude rivals. Downloading a browser for an hour from a Web site is an alternative distribution channel, but it is no match for getting a browser bundled with Windows on a new PC.
"Microsoft is pointing to all the other paths of distribution and undoubtedly takes comfort from the Gilbarco case," said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. "But its contracts could still be found to be significantly anticompetitive. The law is by no means absolutely clear."

HEADLINE: Martin Luther King Jr.'s America

 BODY:
For many young Americans, the heroic life and tragic death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. are historical artifacts from the turbulent 1960's, distant chapters in the multi-volume history of the American experiment. In the decades since then, the ranks of those with vivid memories of the human rights struggle Dr. King waged in the South and up North have thinned. Yet neither of these circumstances should nudge Americans toward allowing each year's observance of his birthday to morph into another three-day get-away weekend.
Today's religious ceremonies and commemorative speeches have value in and of themselves. But in the long run, it is more important for Americans of all classes, colors and creeds to recommit themselves to Dr. King's unfinished human rights agenda. From Jasper, Tex., where a black man was dragged to death behind a pickup truck to the abyss between whites and blacks in income and wealth, one does not have to look far to find the damage done by intolerance and discrimination. 
 It is not possible to divine how Dr. King would assess these United States in 1999. Yet his words remind us that continuing to inch toward a color-blind, equitable society requires so much more than court rulings and laws. In a 1968 essay, published posthumously and entitled "A Testament of Hope," he dissected the riddle that bedevils American society to this day.
"Why is the issue of equality still so far from solution in America, a nation that professes itself to be democratic, inventive, hospitable to new ideas, rich, productive and awesomely powerful?" Dr. King asked. "The problem is so tenacious because, despite its virtues and attributes, America is deeply racist and its democracy is flawed both economically and socially. All too many Americans believe justice will unfold painlessly or that its absence for black people will be tolerated tranquilly."
Fresh evidence of the persistence of racism is visible in the predicament of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi. The Senate majority leader has fumbled numerous opportunities to clarify his links to the white separatist group called the Council of Conservative Citizens. Rather than apologize for giving speeches to a racist organization or explain why he allowed the Mississippi group to use his name, he chose the path of obfuscation.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Lott said he had "no firsthand knowledge" of the C.C.C.'s thinly veiled white supremacist agenda. Mr. Lott's uncle, Arnie Watson, said otherwise. Mr. Watson told The Times's John Kifner last week that his nephew, the Senator, was "an honorary member" of the group and had spoken at its meetings. Others with ties to this group include Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi and Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, both Republicans. Representative Bob Barr of Georgia has also been criticized for speaking before the group.
After a month of questions, Senator Lott released a statement that broadly condemned bigotry, declaring "I have made my condemnation of the white supremacist and racist view of this group, or any group, clear. . . ." His shifting explanations suggest that he knew it was wrong to appear before the group, but did so to curry favor and political support. To preserve respect for his office, Senator Lott needs to repudiate the C.C.C., a direct descendant of the Citizens Councils that opposed the Supreme Court's 1954 school desegregation decision. Until he does so, he will inevitably raise questions about his fairness in leading the United States Senate, an institution that ought to be wholeheartedly committed to Martin Luther King's unfinished agenda.

HEADLINE: 'Pentagon Maverick' Sounds Alarm

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Not much has changed in the small office in the Pentagon where Franklin C. Spinney has worked ever since he gained a bit of notoriety in the 1980's with this jolting argument: All the money President Ronald Reagan was pouring into defense would not make the military any stronger.
Congress held hearings. His bosses made him a celebrity by trying to quash his views. Time magazine called him a "Pentagon Maverick" on a cover in 1983. Still, Mr. Reagan's military spending spree went on. 
 Now, nearly two decades later, President Clinton has proposed the first increase in the Pentagon's budget since 1991 and the largest since those heady days: $12 billion in new spending in 2000, and $110 billion over the next six years. And Mr. Spinney, still a mid-grade analyst in the Pentagon's Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation, is once again raising an alarm.
"This is a horrible thing that's going on," Mr. Spinney said in an interview in his cramped, cluttered office deep inside the Pentagon's concentric rings. "All it's going to do is reward the pathological behavior that's creating the problem."
In the weeks since Mr. Clinton announced his plan to raise the Pentagon's budget, criticisms like Mr. Spinney's have been rare, exceedingly rare within the government.
At a recent hearing before the Senate's Committee on Armed Services, no senator spoke out against the increase. In fact, the loudest criticism of Mr. Clinton's proposal on Capitol Hill has come from Republicans who have argued that the President needs to pledge more to defense.
"I don't understand what all the crowing is about," Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, said at the hearing.
Before the Administration and Congress open the defense spending spigot, though, Mr. Spinney and a diverse group of advocates and analysts have begun to make a case against an increase.
Some of them argue that increasing defense spending is unnecessary since no new threat like the Soviet Union has emerged. Others say new spending will ease pressure to cut the Pentagon's inefficiencies and waste. Still others say that in a time of relative peace, the nation should devote its resources to education or other social causes.
A group called Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities began broadcasting a 30-second television commercial calling for just that. The first advertisements appeared on Friday and more are scheduled to run on Monday and Tuesday, coinciding with Mr. Clinton's State of the Union message to be delivered on Tuesday evening.
Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., a longtime critic of large defense budgets and one of the leaders of the group, said the White House, the Pentagon and the Congress were spending money as if the cold war had never ended.
"The United States is now, literally, in an arms race with itself," Mr. Cohen said.
Mr. Clinton's proposal, which will be outlined in detail when he submits a budget proposal to Congress early next month, would increase the Defense Department's budget to about $268 billion in 2000.
That is only $4 billion more than the currently projected level of $264 billion, but Mr. Clinton has also agreed to let the department keep an additional $8 billion in savings freed as a result of fuel savings and lower-than-expected inflation.
Mr. Clinton, a Democrat who has had an uneasy relationship with the military, agreed to an increase after Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and the nation's military commanders warned that dwindling resources since the collapse of the Soviet Union had strained the military's "readiness."
Mr. Spinney and other critics say that a political consensus has formed around having an increase, even though there has been very little debate about the need for one.
Andrew F. Krepinevich, executive director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research organization in Washington, said the Pentagon's budget still reflects a military preparing for major regional conflicts with the most advanced jets, tanks and ships.
Future enemies, however, are not likely to match the United States technologically. Instead, he argues, they will confront American forces with cheaper weapons, like missiles or mines, that are harder to counter.
"To me, the greatest challenge isn't a budgetary one," Mr. Krepinevich said. "It's a strategic one."
What makes Mr. Spinney's criticism unusual is that it comes from inside the Pentagon, where politics, bureaucracy and military obedience discourage most public dissent.
Mr. Spinney's argument -- his apostasy -- is that the Pentagon plans to spend billions of dollars to build new weapons that have become so complicated and costly that it cannot buy enough of them to replace today's arsenal. That means tomorrow's military will have to get by with fewer new weapons, while relying on older weapons to last longer. Meanwhile, the cost of operating the advanced new weapons keeps rising.
He calls this the "defense death spiral."
Mr. Spinney does not dispute reports that the armed services face readiness problems caused by backlogged repairs, shortages of parts and growing wear and tear. Instead, he blames the underlying strains caused by the increasing costs.
"Spending more money the same way isn't going to fix anything," Mr. Spinney said.
Mr. Spinney, 53, has broken with orthodoxy almost from the day in 1977 that he arrived at the Pentagon's Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation, an office first conceived by Robert S. McNamara in 1961 to provide independent assessments.
His own career began in the military, making him an unlikely firebrand. He spent eight years in the Air Force after graduating from Lehigh University in 1967 with a degree in engineering.
Early on, though, he fell in with a band of like-minded people, who became well-known on Capitol Hill and in the media for challenging conventional wisdom at what Mr. Spinney calls "Versailles on the Potomac."
At the peak of President Reagan's buildup, he argued that the Pentagon persistently underestimated the future costs of weapons, thus saddling the nation with ever-growing defense budgets. After appearing before the House and Senate, he lost his parking permit and, for a time, access to budget figures, but his notoriety and civil-service rules protected his job.
The end of the cold war allowed the Pentagon to reduce the size of the military and its budgets. Mr. Spinney, like others, believes the Pentagon did not take full advantage of the opportunity to reconsider plans to modernize its arsenal with weapons originally conceived to fight a superpower like the Soviet Union.
The Air Force, he says by way of example, now plans to spend $35 billion to build 339 F-22 fighter jets, even though there is no real challenger to America's best jets today. By comparison, the force spent only $45 billion to build 1,094 F-15 fighters, which are still considered to be among the best jets in the air. Likewise, he argues that the Navy has retired aging, though still usable attack submarines to make room for fewer, more expensive versions.
Within the Pentagon, Mr. Spinney has little official influence. He is rarely called on to provide officials with critiques of programs. One official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said he had made the same arguments for so long that it was easy for officials in the hierarchy to dismiss them.
"They basically ignore me," Mr. Spinney said.
Still, he gets his views out -- by E-mail. His electronic critiques on budget and other matters ricochet around the Pentagon and Congress. Christopher Helman, senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information, another research group that has opposed the spending increase, said Mr. Spinney's critiques had a purpose nonetheless.
"He serves to generate some critical dialogue that would not otherwise occur," Mr. Helman said.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Is Dome Plan For West Side Doomed?

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
BEFORE discussing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's new plan for a domed stadium next to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, I should disclose a conflict of interest. Three years ago I proposed using that West Side waterfront for a different urban renewal project: the New York XXXposition Center.
That proposal, to create a red-light district by moving all of the city's adult businesses into the Javits Center and the adjoining land, was not immediately greeted with public enthusiasm. At the time, I wondered if it was too bold and impractical, but now I see that the XXXposition proposal was too timid. The project seems pitifully mundane compared with the Mayor's. 
 Mr. Giuliani last week proposed erecting a domed football stadium, plopping a new and bigger Madison Square Garden alongside it, and extending a subway line to it. He didn't bother estimating its cost, but he was sure it would make money. The stadium would be linked to the Javits Center, Mr. Giuliani explained, and used to hold enormous conventions that "alone would pay for the cost of this development."
The convention angle was a good public relations move, because stadiums purely for sports can be a tough sell. Voters have often rejected them in referendums, and studies by both liberal and conservative economists have demonstrated that new stadiums provide few, if any, economic benefits.
But convention halls are not necessarily any better. The typical convention center is empty more than half the time, and even the busy ones don't provide enough benefits to justify their costs, said Heywood Sanders, a professor of urban studies at Trinity University in San Antonio.
Although the Javits Center is fully booked, it still barely covers its operating expenses, leaving taxpayers stuck with the debt incurred in its construction. The multitude of hotel rooms and restaurants it was supposed to bring to the neighborhood still aren't there, in part because many of the people attending the shows come in only for the day.
Javits officials say the solution to their problems is to add more exhibit space, which would enable New York to attract bigger shows and more visitors from afar. It is the same strategy being followed at convention centers in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and Boston -- and a formula for still bigger losses, according to Dr. Sanders.
"The amount of convention space on the East Coast is going to at least double in the next few years," Dr. Sanders said, "yet the convention business isn't growing. It's been essentially flat for five years. Before they make another bad investment, New Yorkers ought to consider what happened to Los Angeles. It expanded its convention center expecting to double attendance, but the numbers have stayed about the same."
Mr. Giuliani may dismiss these other cities, believing that New York has special advantages in attracting convention business. But the city also has special disadvantages. "Conventioneers don't like New York's $200-a-night hotel rooms," Dr. Sanders said. "The convention centers doing the most business are in resorts with plenty of cheap hotel rooms, like Las Vegas, Orlando and New Orleans."
ANOTHER skeptic concerning the Mayor's proposal is William J. Stern, who oversaw the construction of the Javits Center when he was chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation. Mr. Stern now considers Javits a waste of money, and opposes the Mayor's idea of financing the domed stadium with a tax on Manhattan businesses.
"The Mayor wants to take money away from all these other companies," Mr. Stern said, "and put it into the convention and sports business. Since when is Rudy Giuliani a smarter investor than everyone else in New York?" The Mayor should at least choose an industry with a good track record, Mr. Stern said sardonically. "Why not use that land on the West Side for a tax-free corridor for Internet companies? Instead of building a stadium, pay Yahoo a billion dollars to move there."
The problem with that, of course, is that there's always a chance that people's enthusiasm for Internet companies will prove to be a passing infatuation. Computer programmers may not be any more dependable investments than pro athletes or conventioneers. But when you consider something that all of them have in common -- a longstanding interest in sex -- what could be a safer investment than the XXXposition Center?

HEADLINE: For Blacks and Jews, Hopes for Renewed Link

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
The words spoken at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem yesterday morning were probably much like those delivered from many pulpits on the day before the Federal holiday honoring the nation's most celebrated civil rights leader.
"The situation of the poor in America is our plight, our sickness," the speaker said, quoting a close friend and ally of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. "To be deaf to their cry is to condemn ourselves. Martin Luther King is a voice, a vision and a way." 
 What was unexpected for a Baptist church setting became clear as the quotation continued:
"I call upon every Jew to hearken to his voice, to share his vision, to follow in his way. The whole future of America will depend upon the impact and influence of Dr. King."
That call was first delivered on March 25, 1968, by Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel in a talk to a meeting of rabbis 10 days before Dr. King was assassinated. The words were reiterated yesterday by Rabbi J. Rolando Matalon, who along with Rabbi Marcelo R. Bronstein and 100 members of Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, the Conservative synagogue on the Upper West Side, snapped up the limited number of seats reserved for them at the Harlem church.
They had come in response to an invitation issued on Jan. 9 by the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the church, when he delivered a sermon to the synagogue as a possible first step in forging an alliance between the congregations to fight racial, social and economic injustice.
"At last there is a chance, maybe not to stretch hands across the sea but to begin to close a chasm," one of the synagogue's members, E. M. Broner, a writer, said as she stood in line outside the church yesterday.
The B'nai Jeshurun rabbis and Mr. Butts repeatedly invoked role models for cooperation in their talks from the pulpit. They cited Dr. King, who would have turned 70 on Jan. 15 and whose birthday celebration provided the theme of the service, and Rabbi Heschel, the Jewish theologian who marched with Dr. King in Selma and who persuaded him to become involved in protests against the Vietnam War. Rabbi's Heschel's 26th yahrzeit, the anniversary of his death, was observed last week.
In his sermon, whose title, "Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity," was taken from Rabbi Heschel, Mr. Butts said, "This church celebrates Abraham Joshua Heschel, who helped to guide Martin Luther King, and now we have the opportunity to move forward to better the city, the state, the country, the world.
"Martin Luther King and Abraham Joshua Heschel were hit by the spirit, and they joined hands. They knew the storm troopers were out there. They knew there was a bullet that had King's name on it, but the spirit of audacity brought them together."
In his talk on Jan. 9, which won a standing ovation, Mr. Butts said of the two men he called prophets: "It didn't matter that one was a rabbi and one was a Christian clergyperson. What mattered was that they shared the same experience with God and were willing to run the risk of facing violence arm in arm in Selma on the bloody Sunday when marchers were beaten into the ground."
"Do we have to do that again?" he implored. "Do we have to stand in the face of that kind of ugliness? Eventually, if not today, we're going to have to start walking together."
But will the impassioned words delivered in sermons translate into tangible action for onetime allies whose relationship has been sorely tested?
"Many of us have for a long time felt the cooling off of black-Jewish efforts," Rabbi Matalon said the other day. "There was a time when blacks and Jews collaborated in significant projects bringing about social change. Then a number of factors divided and separated those communities, all sorts of issues, some having to do with affirmative action, South Africa, the Middle East and the emergence of a vocal sector in the Jewish community that is much more politically conservative. The majority of American Jewry fell into silence and acquiescence. Now it is time to rebuild those coalitions to move forward together."
Robert E. Pollack, a professor of biology at Columbia University and the president of the Jewish Campus Life Fund, who described himself as "probably the only member of B'nai Jeshurun to know Reverend Butts longer than I know my own rabbis," seemed optimistic.
"I met Reverend Butts 15 years ago when I was the dean at Columbia College and he was the mediator to end the blockade of Hamilton Hall protesting the investment in South Africa," he recalled. "This is not merely a political event between blacks and Jews, but is a coming together of serious Jews and serious Christians. This morning is a statement of shared commitment."

HEADLINE: More Realistic Defense Budgeting

 BODY:
President Clinton wants to increase military spending by $110 billion over the next six years, the first significant increase in the defense budget since Ronald Reagan's cold-war buildup of the mid-1980's. Congressional Republicans want to spend even more. But soaring spending is unnecessary to assure that America's armed forces remain strong, decently paid and appropriately equipped for the battlefields of the 21st century. Most of what the Pentagon legitimately needs can be paid for by trimming pork from acquisition programs, closing unneeded bases and reducing America's nuclear arsenal from excessive cold-war levels.
For next year, Mr. Clinton will request $269 billion. That is $4 billion more than he originally planned to seek. But he will also let the Pentagon retain and spend an additional $8 billion in savings from lower than expected inflation. Although a detailed breakdown is not yet available, the White House has already indicated that $2.5 billion will go for well-deserved pay and pension increases, an additional $2 billion will support peacekeeping in Bosnia, and most of the remainder will be used for spare parts and recruiting. In the five following years, most of the new spending will be for new weapons programs, including $7 billion to be set aside for possible later construction of a limited missile defense system. 
 In the future smart weapons will shape the battlefield and defense priorities will include shielding vulnerable computer and telecommunications networks and protecting civilians from biological and chemical attack. Unfortunately, much of the new money Mr. Clinton seeks will go to advanced fighter aircraft and nuclear attack submarines, areas where the United States is already far ahead of any prospective foe.
Under the 1997 balanced-budget agreement, any increase in defense spending must be paid for by tax increases or reductions in domestic programs. The White House hopes to get some defense money from a new cigarette tax. But if the Republicans approve such a tax, the money should be used for health programs. Meanwhile, the Administration has failed to identify any domestic programs it would cut. Some compensating savings will have to be found, and the first place to look should be elsewhere in the defense budget. New weapons spending should be cut back. America does not need three separate advanced fighter plane programs. Two would be more than enough. The production of additional attack submarines, which serve no current military need, could be slowed.
Congress has blocked two more rounds of base closings proposed by the Pentagon that could save as much as $2 billion a year. Legislators also shamelessly fatten defense budgets to benefit home districts, last year adding $5 billion for weapons, research and military construction the Pentagon had not requested. Further savings can be achieved by reducing America's nuclear arsenal to the target level of 2,500 warheads Washington seeks in the next arms reduction agreement with Russia. Even without a treaty, financial pressures will lead Russia to match America's cuts. Together, these savings could finance more than half of the increased spending President Clinton is proposing.
The post-cold-war world has not turned out to be as peaceful as Americans originally hoped and the United States needs to maintain a strong and ready military. But it should do so by reallocating existing defense spending, not by raiding already threadbare domestic spending programs.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Free-for-All in Philadelphia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Appearing here recently as the Wizard in a stage show of "The Wizard of Oz," Mickey Rooney stopped in at City Hall to present Mayor Edward G. Rendell with a special souvenir.
As he accepted a ceremonial key to Oz, Mr. Rendell took a moment to congratulate the 78-year-old actor for a lifetime of charitable work. Mr. Rooney was taken aback by the Mayor's remarks. "I'm not through yet," he insisted, prompting Mr. Rendell to cut him off. 
 "I keep telling people here I'm not through yet, either," Mr. Rendell said.
Embarking upon the last of his eight years as Philadelphia's Mayor and foremost cheerleader, a period of major economic and psychological turnaround for the city, Mr. Rendell, a Democrat, hardly seems ready to relinquish his reputation for drawing a spotlight to cities as the economic engine of a metropolitan region. (Mr. Rendell cannot run for re-election; Philadelphia has term limits.)
There is a budget to balance. Policing strategies under a new commissioner are still evolving. Thousands of untrained and illiterate people are coming off the city welfare rolls this year. Public schools need more money. And the city still needs to attract businesses to sustain seven years of economic development.
"These are the five things I want to do this year," the Mayor said in an interview the day after Mr. Rooney's visit, finishing off a blueberry muffin in his cluttered office.
But if Mr. Rendell's achievements reflect a job well done, they also stand as a formidable challenge for his potential successors.
Five Democrats and one Republican are searching for issues to run on this year while not appearing critical of a politician so popular and effective that investors who watch municipal bond ratings are beginning to wonder if his successor can match his performance.
"No one wants to distance themselves from what has happened over the last six or seven years," said John F. Street, who resigned as City Council president last month, after 18 years on the council, to run for mayor.
For all the candidates' desire to continue the momentum built by Mr. Rendell, the election comes at a critical time for Philadelphia, whose population, 1.47 million, reflects the loss of nearly 90,000 people to the suburbs and beyond since 1991.
Like other big cities with eroding populations and constant social-service needs, Philadelphia is learning to do more with less. It also finds itself competing with cities in the same predicament for new industries, Federal grants, even conventions.
Philadelphia's successful pitch for the Republican Party's Presidential nominating convention in 2000, beating out New York and several other cities, was considered a major victory for a city with a strong Democratic Mayor, a Democratic majority in the City Council and more than three times as many registered Democrats as Republicans.
Philadelphia won the prize in part because of its enormous economic development in recent years: the new hotels, restaurants and cultural institutions that have bloomed throughout the downtown and waterfront areas. This year alone, 13 big hotels are scheduled to open.
But with those projects in the works, along with others like a planned Disney entertainment complex and renovations for Independence Mall, Mr. Rendell's successor is not likely to have as many glamorous ventures to promote. The next mayor is almost certain to confront decidedly unglamorous issues like revamping the public school system, expanding downtown development into neighborhoods and figuring how to accommodate the 60,000 city residents who will begin to lose welfare benefits this year.
"Ed Rendell needed to be part cheerleader," said Charles P. Pizzi, president of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. "But now the ship is under wind, and the next mayor is going to have to go below the deck to make sure it's still sailing."
As Mr. Rendell's partner on countless initiatives over the years, Mr. Street has won the Mayor's endorsement, which makes him one of the favorites in the Democratic primary this May.
But just as Mr. Rendell conceded that "any of the candidates would make a good mayor," the Democrats, at least, are expecting a lively battle over the next few months. As the lone Republican, Sam Katz, an expert on municipal finance, has no opponent in his party's primary.
For the most part, all the candidates are focusing on improving the school system and public safety and on lowering a hated wage tax. And the ways they approach those challenges are not altogether different.
As a result, they are largely selling experience and leadership qualities as much as solutions.
Mr. Street, 55, who was council president for the last six years, presents himself as Mr. Rendell's partner in the city's leap from an accumulated deficit of more than $200 million in 1991 to six consecutive years of surpluses, each a city record, including the current $169 million. Mr. Street shepherded through many major pieces of legislation that changed the city's physical as well as fiscal condition.
But other Democratic candidates contend that they have skills that are just as valuable. Happy Fernandez, 59, the only woman running, has been a member of the council since 1991. She describes herself as "a valued member of the Rendell-council team" responsible for the city's fiscal recovery.
Martin Weinberg, 61, is a former city solicitor and was a close adviser to former Mayor Frank Rizzo. Now the head of a large law firm, he has made the overhaul of the school system a priority, proposing that the school board become more accountable to the mayor. He also wants to give police officers more training and educational opportunities.
As the only state legislator in the Democratic field, Dwight Evans, 44, has also made the school system a priority. He claims to have the best leadership skills among all those running, pointing to his role in inviting the former New York City police commissioner William J. Bratton to Philadelphia to discuss crime fighting. The invitation ultimately led to the city's hiring last year of John F. Timoney, Mr. Bratton's deputy, as its commissioner.
The other Democrat, John White Jr., 49, has served in a variety of public service roles. He has been a member of the State Legislature and the City Council and most recently was the executive director of the Philadelphia Housing Authority.
Now an executive with a real estate development firm, Mr. White has made improvements to the school system a cornerstone of his campaign, promoting safety, after-school programs and an education guaranteed to prepare students for a job or college.
Mr. Katz, 49, who was a financial adviser to Mr. Rendell in his first term, is facing the daunting task of becoming the city's first Republican mayor since Bernard Samuel won election in 1947.
Mr. Katz is an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Rendell. But he points out that the city's population decline reflects problems that have to be corrected, especially the crime rate and the underperformance of children in the public school system.
Mr. Katz lost in previous races for mayor and governor. But, pointing to Republican mayors like Rudolph W. Giuliani in New York and Richard J. Riordan in Los Angeles, he contends that the time is right for a Republican in Philadelphia.
"People say all the time that a Republican can't win here," he said. "That's silly, self-serving Democratic poppycock. You put the better candidate out there, and it won't matter what the party label is."

HEADLINE: Trade Trash For Culture? Not Virginia

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Virginians are struggling to decide what odors wafting out of New York City smell more foul -- mushrooming mounds of garbage or uppity pronouncements from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Nostrils flared across the Old Dominion last week at news of a possible tripling of deliveries of New York City garbage. Up to 2.2 million tons a year, Virginians learned, could soon be plodding up the James River, bound for landfills in a state that already is embarrassed to place second (behind Pennsylvania) as America's top garbage destination. 
 Noxious as the news was -- Gov. James S. Gilmore 3d called it "highly unacceptable" and spoke of his duty to ban garbage barges on state rivers -- its perceived toxicity was quickly exceeded by the Mayor's statement about why non-New Yorkers have garbage obligations.
In exchange for the top-drawer culture that visitors soak up in New York, the Mayor asserted, they should be willing to bury some trash back home. A "reciprocal relationship," he called it.
In this state where people take pride in their manners, that reasoning has incited widespread outbreaks of incivility. Long-simmering suspicions about Yankees -- their arrogance, their pushy politicians and the unspeakable nature of their garbage -- are suddenly boiling over.
"Now let me see if I got it right," said State Senator William T. Bolling, a Republican and longtime critic of out-of-state trash. "I come up to New York and I spend my hard-earned money and somehow in exchange for that privilege, I am supposed to take your trash? This represents a certain arrogant attitude that is not consistent with the way we do business in Virginia. I can't think of a single issue that has made my blood boil more than this."
In an interview today at the governor's mansion, Mr. Gilmore, a Republican, said he was offended by the Republican Mayor's reasoning, which he described as "really an outrageous statement."
"To come out and basically try to further the discussion by saying we had a moral obligation because some Virginians from time to time visit New York is not proper," he said.
The Governor said he was concerned that the image of Virginia was being unfairly maligned by the trash issue.
"We are very much on the rise and we don't want anyone to get the impression that Virginia is only good as a garbage repository," Mr. Gilmore said.
The Mayor's office has dismissed such comments, which resounded here in the state capital during last week's opening of the General Assembly, as mere carping from "pandering politicians trying to achieve their own agenda."
Not just politicians are peeved. Business leaders with multimillion-dollar investments in garbage importation speak bitterly of the public-relations disaster they say the Mayor has created.
"After this past week, when people here say Yankee trash, they think it's redundant," said Charles H. Carter 3d, an 11th-generation Virginian whose family owns Port Tobacco at Weanack, a state-of-the-art facility for containerized garbage on the James River.
Mr. Carter finds it hard to believe that Mr. Giuliani is entertaining thoughts of running for national office. "Giuliani couldn't have said anything that could have harmed his own cause more," he said. "He is definitely not presidential material."
If Virginia's Governor and the Legislature follow through on last week's threats to ban garbage barges on the river (and there are constitutional reasons why such a state ban might not hold up in court), Mr. Carter stands to lose lots of money. He says his family does not have the resources to take the state on in a long court battle.
Mr. Carter's advice to the Mayor: "We'll take the trash, but keep your mouth shut."
The largest company that disposes of New York's garbage in Virginia is Waste Management Inc. of Houston. It has invested $15 million in Port Tobacco and had planned to begin barge shipments there in April. Asked whether the Mayor had helped Waste Management in its delicate negotiations with the Governor and the Legislature, a company spokeswoman, Christine Meket, who has been dispatched to Richmond for damage control, said, "No."
For years, environmental groups, investigative reporters and a few lawmakers in Virginia have tried to raise public awareness of what they see as the ecological and road-safety risks of the state's rapidly increasing importation of garbage. The business has boomed here in the last decade, creating giant landfills located mostly in land-rich, cash-poor African-American communities in central Virginia.
New York City, driven by the legal deadline in 2001 to close its landfill at Fresh Kills on Staten Island, has become Virginia's fastest-growing source of garbage.
Garbage-truck accidents, complaints about putrid odors and state records documenting the arrival of untreated syringes and vials of human blood have all raised public awareness here about trash rolling into this state from New York. A poll released last week by Virginia Commonwealth University's Center for Public Policy found that 87 percent of Virginians want to cap trash shipments into the state.
But Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani, said today that at least some Virginians welcomed New York's trash. "Simply put, this is a business that creates jobs and generates economic activity," he said. "New York City has already been contacted by a number of communities in Virginia that want this trade." He would not say which communities wanted the city's garbage. But he said that the city had no choice but to find alternatives to Fresh Kills, which it is committed to closing by Dec. 31, 2001.
Judging by comments this weekend from shoppers at a mall outside Richmond, Mr. Giuliani has been uniquely effective in crystallizing attitudes toward big-city garbage in the minds of average Virginians.
"I had not been thinking about it until Giuliani made his remarks," said Kitty Jones, 55, a school secretary from Henrico County who was having lunch on Saturday outside the Chick-Fil-A booth in the food court at Virginia Center Commons mall in suburban Richmond.
Since reading about the Mayor in the papers and watching him on television in the past week, Ms. Jones said she had found herself wondering why Mr. Giuliani would say such a thing and what kind of town would support such a man.
"When you think of New York, you think of arrogance," Ms. Jones said, adding that it was probably unfair to judge a whole city on the basis of its Mayor's behavior. "I'm sure they are all not like that, are they?"
In the Virginia Legislature this year -- an election year here -- garbage is emerging as the hot-button issue. On one side, there are quality-of-life complaints, especially from lawmakers in affluent Northern Virginia, where highways in the Washington suburbs are inundated with out-of-state garbage trucks.
On the other, there is the deepening dependence of central Virginia counties on revenue from landfills. In Charles City County south of Richmond, $32 million in revenue from a landfill that takes New York City garbage has allowed county supervisors to build a new school system and an industrial park and to cut property taxes by 40 percent.
Adding to the legislative mix, according to state records, is an increasing flow of campaign money from waste industry companies.
Given the volatility of the garbage issue, state legislators on both sides of the aisle here said they were stunned by both the content and the timing of Mr. Giuliani's remarks.
"The Mayor should realize that this is a hot political topic and the general approach should not be to fan the flames," said Delegate Kenneth R. Plum, chairman of the State Democratic Party. "But this is effectively what he has done."
Down in Charles City County, whose 934-acre landfill is operated by Waste Management, school leaders and county planners reacted more in sadness than in anger to the Mayor's theory of interstate garbage-culture reciprocation.
They said that the county, which has a population of about 7,000 people, 62 percent of whom are black and who are among the poorest residents of Virginia, simply cannot afford a huge, politics-driven reduction in the amount of garbage coming into the landfill. It is ready to begin receiving New York garbage from the new port on the James River -- if the barges are not banned by the State Legislature.
"The landfill is the biggest boon to Charles City County in modern times," said Bill Britton, the county planning director. "Every tax since 1988 has either stayed the same or has been lowered. At the same time, we have been able to build a whole school system -- not just one school -- but a $21 million school system."
The county's school board chairman, Charles E. Giles, agreed wholeheartedly with Mr. Giuliani's statements last week that any attempt by Virginia to ban barge shipments of garbage would be overturned by Federal courts.
"We don't want anyone to interfere with interstate commerce," Mr. Giles said. "It is a constitutional right."
Both he and Mr. Britton declined to comment on the Mayor's invocation of a garbage obligation in this state.
Mr. Carter, managing director of the family-owned port that faces financial ruin if garbage barges are banned on the James River, had no such reticence.
He said that before last week's comments by the Mayor, he had heard sketchy reports of a similar public-relations debacle in New Jersey. In December, the Mayor surprised and infuriated Gov. Christine Todd Whitman with a plan to ship trash to transfer stations there.
"Is the Mayor always such a wonderful and wise person in all his comments?" Mr. Carter asked.

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Dotting the I's Hard; Camps May Open Late

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Just when you thought the National Basketball Association was back in business, the league and the players' union are dueling again.
Lawyers for both sides are continuing to work on putting the terms of the new collective bargaining agreement into writing, but a disagreement over a crucial economic issue now threatens to delay the start of training camp and the free-agent signing period on Tuesday. 
 "There are a lot of issues still open," Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer, said yesterday. "We're trying to get it done by Monday night, but I don't know if that's going to happen."
Neither the league nor the union would give specifics, but officials on both sides said the biggest stumbling block was over the maximum length of contracts under the mid-level salary exception.
The exception starts at $1.75 million, rises to $2.25 million by the third year and becomes whatever the average salary is in the league in the fourth year.
The union contends that the two sides agreed that mid-level contracts could be signed for up to six years.
The league says the length of mid-level contracts was not settled at the 12-hour negotiating session that saved the N.B.A. season from cancellation 10 days ago.
The management has proposed that players be able to sign a contract for three years under the exception.
These are among the other issues the two sides are still haggling over:
*The definition of basketball-related income, which is split between the league and the players.
*The sharing of television revenue.
*Several conduct issues, including the details of a new antidrug program.
The lockout remains in effect until an agreement is signed, meaning that training camps and the signing and trading period may not begin until later this week.
 
Kerr Talks With Spurs
 Steve Kerr, a 3-point specialist and free agent who was an important member of three consecutive Chicago Bulls championship teams, is near a deal with the San Antonio Spurs, his agent said yesterday.
"We haven't agreed to anything," the agent, Mark Bartlestein, said. "Nothing is done as of yet. We're close, but there are some things we're trying to finalize.
"The Spurs are a team we're really interested in. We're working hard and something could happen."
Several teams have shown interest in Kerr, a 10-year veteran who is one of the most proficient 3-point shooters in National Basketball Association history.
"I wouldn't say the other teams were out of the loop," Bartlestein said. "We're just seeing if we can finalize a deal with the Spurs."
Kerr's departure is just another sign that the Bulls are preparing to break the team up after Michael Jordan's retirement last week.
The free agents Scottie Pippen, Luc Longley and Dennis Rodman are also expected to leave the Bulls, which was dominant team of the decade. A Spurs spokesman did not return a call seeking comment yesterday. (AP)
 
Geiger Near Deal With 76ers
 Matt Geiger is close to signing with the Philadelphia 76ers in a six-year contract worth $54 million.
Geiger, who played the last three seasons with Charlotte, is expected to make the deal as soon as the new collective bargaining agreement is put into writing, which would be as early as Tuesday, someone close to the negotiations said on Saturday.
Geiger would get the maximum salary allowed under the new labor deal with the signing. (AP)

HEADLINE: BORROWERS BEWARE: A Special Report;
Suits Say Unscrupulous Lending Is Taking Homes From the Poor

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
By all appearances, the loan agreement Gloria Knight signed in 1995 was a classic transaction between savvy mortgage salesmen and an unsophisticated borrower in a poor Brooklyn neighborhood.
Ms. Knight, a retired teacher, says the salesmen who knocked on her door persuaded her to put her house up as collateral for an $88,000 loan, at 13 percent interest, to help with bills and a previous loan -- even though she had no income and no way to make the $973 monthly payments. 
 But when she defaulted on her loan, leading to eviction notices last year, she ended up in the grip of something far larger than Delta Funding, a relatively obscure Long Island mortgage company that solicits business from poor homeowners. Delta's partner in trying to take her home is Bankers Trust Company, America's eighth-largest bank.
High-interest lending in poor neighborhoods has long produced high profits for lenders and, often, equally high burdens for homeowners. But the entry of big banks like Bankers Trust is part of a growing trend in such lending and has changed the equation. Over the last several years, Delta has converted hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of its mortgages into securities much like bonds, which it sells to investors through Bankers Trust.
In turn, Bankers Trust has provided Delta with hundreds of millions of investors' dollars, allowing it to make more loans and become a major player in high-interest lending in New York and 21 other states.
But there is a problem: a high percentage of the homeowners can't afford Delta's mortgages. Many say they were duped into taking the loans and now may lose their homes as Delta and Bankers Trust try to reclaim the money for their investors.
Delta and Bankers Trust defend their activities. But Delta's business has recently produced civil lawsuits in three states, and advocates for the poor and social-services agencies say the company has generated more complaints of abusive lending than any other high-interest lender in New York City. They contend that Delta has taken advantage of scores of homeowners and violated Federal and state laws.
Ms. Knight, 55, who has since been found to be delusional by a psychiatrist for the city's Protective Services for Adults, cannot even afford electricity. She keeps warm with a kerosene heater and cooks over a makeshift grill in her backyard. But she had something that made her attractive to lenders like Delta: her row house in East New York, which was fully paid for and which served as security. Legal Services lawyers say she will now almost certainly lose it.
Last month, Chief Judge Charles P. Sifton of the Federal Court for the Eastern District of New York stopped the foreclosure sales of homes of three people who defaulted on Delta loans, because, he wrote, the mortgages "on their face" violated Federal law, and so the borrowers showed a good chance of winning their lawsuit.
The homeowners have sued Delta and Bankers Trust, claiming they violated, among other laws, a Federal prohibition on making loans based solely on equity in a house and not on a homeowner's ability to repay. The suit seeks to represent tens of thousands of other Delta borrowers who lawyers say are in similar circumstances.
Officials with Bankers Trust, which is being acquired by the German banking giant Deutsche Bank, declined repeated requests for interviews. On Friday, William McBride, a bank spokesman, said in a statement: "Bankers Trust's sole responsibility in these situations is to safeguard the interests of investors. We have no other connection to these actions."
Marc E. Miller, Delta's general counsel and a son of its founder, vigorously denied that the company engages in deceptive lending, saying it made no sense financially for the company to make loans it knew would fail. "There is sometimes this myth that's spread around that lenders do make money" from foreclosed properties, Mr. Miller said. "And it is a myth."
While refusing to comment on cases that are in litigation, he added that "if a loan simply doesn't make sense for a borrower, we won't do it."
But city real estate records show high foreclosure rates on Delta mortgages in some neighborhoods. In Brooklyn, where the company is most active in the city, a search of records found that 48 of 363 loans made by Delta in 1995 -- or about 13 percent -- have ended up in default, and Delta has begun foreclosure actions. For 1996 loans, the records show, the figure is 99 of 923 -- more than 10 percent.
In its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Delta reported that 4.65 percent of all its loans were in foreclosure, calculated by the dollar amount of the loans.
According to Inside B&C Lending, an industry newsletter that reports statistics from several large lenders, about 2.65 percent of the high-risk loans nationwide, by dollar amount, were in foreclosure as of September 1998, the most recent date for which information was available. An additional 1.9 percent were 90 days delinquent and in danger of foreclosure.
Delta's critics contend that the company has devastated the lives of many working-class homeowners, most of them elderly. "These folks not only lose their homes, but lose every dime of equity they have built up, and in most cases this is all they have to show for years of hard work," said Josh Zinner, a lawyer with the Foreclosure Prevention Project for Seniors, a branch of South Brooklyn Legal Services set up last year to pursue claims of abusive lending.
Anna Dawson, a 67-year-old Brooklyn widow who is fighting Delta and Bankers Trust in state court for her home, may get help from prosecutors. The Brooklyn District Attorney's Office is investigating an independent broker who refers business to Delta and who, she contends, falsified her mortgage application without her knowledge to make it appear she could afford a $99,000 mortgage with monthly payments of $1,017. In reality, her only income was roughly $700 a month in survivor's benefits from her late husband. But her application included a letter saying she was an office manager at United Equities in Brooklyn and a lease that made it appear she rented out a floor of her home. The company does not exist at the address on the letter, and Ms. Dawson said she has not worked in more than two decades. She has no renter. And the signature on the lease is not hers, she said.
Her loan became part of $340 million worth of 1997 Delta mortgages put into a trust managed by Bankers Trust and sold to investors.
In a lawsuit filed in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, her lawyers contend that the mortgage broker and a home-improvement contractor came to her house uninvited several times, persistently pushing her to get a loan for repairs to her house.
In the end, she was unable to make her payments, and Delta and Bankers Trust have begun to foreclose against her. Meanwhile, she said she was left with almost no proceeds of her loan -- after paying Delta's fees, settling a previous low-interest loan and paying the same home-improvement contractor, who she said did little work.
The Growing Trade
Of High-Risk Loans
High-interest lending became a big business in low-income neighborhoods nationwide after 1986, when a change in the Federal tax code gave a break to homeowners who took out second mortgages. But complaints about abuses began almost immediately. Unscrupulous finance companies often singled out homeowners, many of them elderly, who had substantial equity in their homes; in case of default, lenders could recoup the loan by taking the home.
In 1993, New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs reported that finance companies, usually working with crooked home-improvement contractors, had "fleeced thousands of lower-income and minority New York City homeowners" out of equity in their homes by tricking them into loans for repairs. The report added that the lenders often researched homeowners before approaching them, studying credit reports to determine whether they had paid off their first mortgage.
Many finance companies resold their mortgages to big banks. But Delta -- founded in 1982 in by Sidney A. Miller, a former planner for insurance companies -- was one of the first to see a vast untapped resource beyond the banks: the investment market. By converting loans into securities and selling them to investors, finance companies could generate a faster profit and have access to much more capital, and make many more loans.
Over the last decade, the market in asset-backed securities like those issued by Delta has grown from $9 billion to more than $140 billion, as investors pursued the rapidly expanding trade in high-risk auto loans, credit cards and home-equity loans. The size of the high-risk home-loan industry alone reached more than $120 billion in loans issued nationwide in 1997, according to industry estimates.
Recently, big lenders like Chase Manhattan, Norwest, Nationsbank, General Electric, Keycorp, Countrywide Credit Industries and others have expanded their involvement in high-interest lending.
Delta began selling loans as securities in 1991, giving investors the right to share in mortgage interest payments, and Bankers Trust's California branch soon began to manage the trusts that held these securities. Delta's business zoomed. In 1994, it made about $100 million in loans. By last year, according to its Federal securities filings, its loans increased to more than $1 billion. It grew from about 150 employees to more than 1,000. In 1996, it went public, on the New York Stock Exchange, and in 1997 it reported profits of more than $30 million.
William J. Brennan, a lawyer for the Atlanta Legal Aid Society who specializes in lending abuse cases and is familiar with lawsuits against Delta, criticizes Bankers Trust as Delta's "enablers."
"Bankers Trust would never make these kinds of loans themselves," he said, "but they put themselves in the position of enhancing the power of Delta Funding to engage in abusive lending. And they do it because there's lots of money to be made."
But in the view of Marc Miller, whose family runs Delta, based in Woodbury, N.Y., "there are many people who want and need a loan and can't get one. From that standpoint we fill a very legitimate niche in the consumer finance field."
 
An Incompetence Ruling, And Then Default
 Gertrude Menzel, an elderly Queens woman who had lived in her two-story row house in Ridgewood since she was a teen-ager, took out an $81,000 Delta mortgage in the summer of 1994, when she was 78. Five years later, Bankers Trust and Delta say Ms. Menzel owes more than $123,000 in principal and interest, and they are trying to take her house.
There is no dispute that Ms. Menzel signed the loan papers. But little else is clear, including her motivation, since the first mortgage on the house was paid off and she appeared to have no debts. Her lawyer said that she was talked into the loan by an acquaintance who had previously taken financial advantage of her and ended up taking the proceeds of her loan for himself.
But questions remain about whether she was competent when she closed the mortgage in Delta's offices. Workers at a Queens center for the elderly, who saw her almost daily, said they noticed memory lapses and confused behavior well before the summer of 1994. By Thanksgiving, six months after she got the mortgage, she "was wearing house slippers out into the cold and was not taking care of herself," said Thomas Crossman, who ran the Ridgewood Older Adult Center at the time.
In 1995, according to court papers, two psychiatrists hired by the center found symptoms of dementia and memory loss. One reported that she "does not have any knowledge of her assets or income."
By May 1995, Ms. Menzel was ruled legally incompetent in State Supreme Court, and she later defaulted on the mortgage.
But Bankers Trust argued in court papers that her mortgage was valid because Ms. Menzel had not been ruled incompetent before the closing. Partly for that reason, a State Supreme Court judge, Edwin Kassoff, declined to let Ms. Menzel out of the mortgage. Bankers Trust and Delta continue to fight her in court.
Delta's critics say that the company commonly works with aggressive, often unscrupulous mortgage brokers and home-improvement contractors who canvass poor neighborhoods, looking for elderly homeowners willing to put up their homes as collateral for loans to help with bills or home repairs.
A search of court records and Delta loan documents found that at least two people who have referred loans to Delta -- John Gizze, the owner of a mortgage consulting firm in Hempstead, N.Y., and Gary Feldman, a Queens home-improvement contractor -- have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud in Federal court in cases unrelated to Delta. Both men admitted in court that they had falsified papers to exaggerate the income of borrowers.
Mr. Gizze's lawyer, Allen Drezin, said Mr. Gizze has subsequently had "some dealings with Delta Funding," but they "have been up to the standards of the industry." Mr. Feldman is now a defendant in a Federal civil suit filed by Mary Lewis, a Queens woman who claims he and Delta deceived her when she took out a home-equity mortgage in 1997.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Feldman said that he has closed few loans with Delta, and denied engaging in deceptive lending practices in his dealings with the company.
Delta officials said they were unaware of the criminal past of either man, but they added that they do not routinely perform criminal background checks on brokers.
"Dealing with thousands of different brokers," said Mr. Miller, the general counsel, "it would, frankly, be impossible for us to stay on top of every broker at every instant."
The company is now the target of at least four Federal civil suits, three of which seek to represent classes of thousands of homeowners who lawyers allege were deceived or mistreated by Delta.
The suit filed late last year in Federal District Court for the Eastern District, which includes Brooklyn and Queens, accuses Delta of consistently lending to people based on the equity of their homes and not on their ability to pay, a practice the plaintiffs' lawyers say has led to scores of foreclosures.
The suit also accuses Delta of breaking Federal law by charging exorbitant extra interest once a loan goes into default. (A review of Delta loan papers for several borrowers found that the interest commonly jumps to 24 percent after default. In New York, interest rates over 25 percent are prohibited by criminal usury laws.)
Delta and Bankers Trust, represented by a single law firm in the case, have not yet responded to the allegations in court.
In Mississippi and Georgia, two Federal civil suits allege that Delta is one of many high-interest mortgage lenders paying fees to mortgage brokers, which would violate Federal law. The suits allege that these fees are, in reality, a kickback to brokers for steering borrowers to the lenders, even though it may not be in the borrowers' best interest.
Delta officials deny the accusations. But in a similar Federal class-action case in New York, Delta recently settled with the plaintiffs in a confidential agreement, according to reports Delta filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Miller said in a written statement that all such suits contain "accusations, rather than fact" and have been filed "solely for the purpose of delaying or preventing Delta Financial from protecting its rights."
 
Allegations of Deceit And Finder's Fees
But Delta has not always been successful in challenging claims of abuse. In November 1991, Theresa Leonardi went into the hospital with thyroid and heart problems, only a month after the death of her husband of 50 years. Three days after she was released from the hospital, according to a lawsuit she filed against Delta, she was taken to the lender's offices, then in Great Neck, N.Y., by a stockbroker who later pleaded guilty to mail fraud against her in a separate case and served time in prison.
Mrs. Leonardi took out a $95,000 mortgage on her home in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, but she said later in a lawsuit against Delta that she was never told she was signing loan papers and believed she was signing investment papers.
The papers described her as a 68-year-old self-employed investor making $7,000 a month. In fact, she was almost 73 and was living mostly on Social Security.
In giving the loan to Mrs. Leonardi, according to court documents, Delta waived its written policy stating that income tax returns should be used to verify the income of loan applicants.
In the end, her lawyers say, all her mortgage proceeds went directly to the stockbroker, and Mrs. Leonardi never made a single loan payment. By December 1992, the bank began a foreclosure.
Carl Felsenfeld, a former Citicorp vice president who was an expert witness for Mrs. Leonardi, said in a deposition that the case showed "clear and convincing evidence of Delta's participation in the fraud perpetrated on Mrs. Leonardi."
Delta denied the accusations and pointed out that Mrs. Leonardi had chosen the unscrupulous stockbroker herself. "It is a sad commentary on our society," Marie Klasa, a Delta vice president, wrote in a letter in 1995, "that people must seek to blame others for their own errors in judgment."
But as the trial approached last summer, Delta agreed to pay Mrs. Leonardi $200,000 -- more than twice the amount of her mortgage -- in a confidential settlement in which Delta admitted no wrongdoing.
Mr. Miller said the company settled because it believed it would be less costly than pursuing an appeal.
"The actual facts," he said, "are that Delta made a loan that made sense at the time to a woman who knew what she was doing at the time."
Mrs. Leonardi remembered it differently. "At no time did any of these people explain to me that I was signing papers for a mortgage on my home," she stated in court documents. "They merely pointed to the lines, and I signed or initialed as directed. At the time I was so weak that I couldn't walk without assistance and could not read any of the papers that I was asked to sign."

HEADLINE: Dead Dream: Brazil's Plan Is Blocked

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Jan. 17

 BODY:
On the trading floor of the Sao Paulo stock exchange, it led to a breathtaking buying spree. In Washington, officials were relieved. But in Brazil, the Government's decision to stop protecting the currency that beat hyperinflation signaled the end of a celebrated monetary plan that promised to transform Latin America's biggest country into a modern nation.
The dream has been personified by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a multilingual former sociology professor and finance minister who has roamed world capitals and financial centers for the last four years, selling his vision of a modern Brazil, intent on reform and backed by a stable currency, the real. 
 He told Brazilians, most of whom had never lived without runaway prices, that inflation was the cruelest tax of all, striking the poor whose salaries lost value by the hour.
It complicated long-term investments and planning, so industry failed to modernize, relying instead on trade barriers to keep out cheaper imports. Brazilians rewarded Mr. Cardoso for his Real Plan's success in beating hyperinflation by voting him President twice -- a first for Brazil.
Foreign investors signed on, seeing in Brazil a huge, untapped market of 160 million for everything from telephones to refrigerators, and a potential base for exports to the rest of South America. Direct foreign investment, $2 billion at the start of the Real Plan, totaled $36 billion by last year.
On Friday, Mr. Cardoso stood before his nation on television for just two and a half minutes, to say that he had done all he could to protect the real by intervening on currency markets, but could no longer spend foreign reserves that had dwindled to $30 billion from $75 billion in five months. The real would be free to float on world markets.
The immediate reaction was frenzied buying, which gave the Sao Paulo Bovespa index its second-biggest rise in a single day, 33.4 percent.
Significantly, the only higher increase, 36.05 percent, occurred on Feb. 4, 1991, when the second phase of former President Fernando Collor de Mello's economic plan was announced. He left office one step ahead of impeachment.
Now, while economists and industrialists debate the size of price increases likely to hit stores this week and the possible nature of "Real Plan II," there is little disagreement about the cause of the current failure.
The Real Plan foundered on the same rocks that sank a half dozen other plans to transform Brazil over the last 15 years: the Government's inability to maneuver reform past vested interests that enjoy benefits and breaks Brazil cannot afford.
Mr. Cardoso said a year ago that his predecessor, Mr. Collor de Mello, was drummed from office not so much for corruption as for angering the elite by going too fast with reform. This President learned the lesson, and navigated reform measures through Congress cautiously.
Ten months into office, he turned his attention to winning a constitutional amendment to permit his re-election, a complicated process that cost political capital needed he would need later. In doing so, he put off the further economic and political change needed to make Brazil the modern nation of his vision.
Now, Mr. Cardoso has been brought up short by the refusal of a political rival, Itamar Franco, Governor of the second-largest of Brazil's 26 states, to make his state's payments to the Federal coffers. Mr. Franco's default has whipped up a wave of discontent among opposition governors, who are now demanding that the Federal Government renegotiate the terms of their debts.
Much as Mr. Cardoso and his Government may try to portray the move on Friday as a simple shifting of gears to juggle the concerns of those who favor growth and those who want a stable currency, there is little sign that the President had any option but to surrender stability he could no longer sustain.
On Friday, the financial markets appeared pleased that Brazil would no longer drain foreign reserves to bolster its currency. But there was a sense of betrayal among those who had believed Brazil's leaders when they repeatedly ruled out devaluation. What other elements of his vision will Mr. Cardoso surrender?
"Unfortunately, it's the emperor has no clothes syndrome," said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Programs at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
To be sure, the Cardoso administration has made important progress. It pushed through measures to force Government to lay off public workers if a state's payroll exceeds 60 percent of its budget, and has had partial success adopting laws that should trim the deficit left by pensions that are more generous than the state can afford. It has privatized state-owned mining, telecommunications and utility companies, and cleaned up state-owned banks notoriously used as political kitties by state Governors.
But the heart of the Real Plan, indeed its raison-d'etre, was its goal of curbing inflation that topped 2,500 percent a year before the plan's creation in July 1994. Brazilian administrations in the last 40 years had either proved powerless to fight inflation or embraced it to kindle growth, or at times its illusion.
Mr. Cardoso's dream for Brazil grew more expensive each year that it remained unrealized, because -- without the fig leaf of inflation -- the Government has had to borrow to cover its overspending.
Before the Real Plan, the Brazilian Government had no deficit to speak of, Demosthenes Madureira de Pinho Neto, the Central Bank's director for international relations, said in October. Government agencies would rely on inflation to cure shortfalls, delaying adjustments in salaries for inflation and using money saved to cover overspending elsewhere.
Without inflation, the budget deficit has ballooned, lumbering now toward $65 billion, or 8 percent of the gross national product.

HEADLINE: Why Won't Clinton Cut Taxes?

BYLINE: By Bruce Bartlett; Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis, was a Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
One of the main things that frustrates President Clinton's enemies so much is his skill at identifying the issues Americans care about. So it is somewhat surprising, given the budget surplus and the magnitude of the current Federal tax burden, that Mr. Clinton has not moved to co-opt the Republicans in this area, as he has in so many others, by proposing a big tax cut.
A consequence of a long economic expansion is that taxes tend to rise. As real incomes grow, as unemployment declines, as corporate profits hit record levels, individuals, households and corporations inevitably expand the Federal tax base. Indeed, many families find themselves pushed up into higher tax brackets in the same way that inflation caused bracket creep in the 1970's. As a result, almost every measure of taxation shows Federal taxes at record levels. 
 * In the third quarter of 1998, total Federal receipts hit 21.8 percent of the gross domestic product, according to the Commerce Department. This is the highest level recorded in American history, exceeding even the percentages reached in World War II (19.9 percent), the Korean War (20.1 percent) or the Vietnam War (20.7).
* According to the Census Bureau, the average household paid 24.9 percent of its income in combined Federal, state and local taxes in 1997, up from 22.2 percent in 1992 and 21.8 percent in 1983. Of this, by far the greatest component was Federal income taxes, which consumed 14.9 percent of its income, $9,445 on average, more than twice what the average household paid in 1985. As recently as 1992, the average household paid just 12.1 percent of its income in Federal income taxes.
* According to the Treasury Department, a four-person family with the median income -- $54,900 -- will pay 30.3 percent of each additional dollar it earns to the Federal Government this year in the form of income and payroll taxes. Although down from the peak of the early 1980's, this is a sharp increase from the 19 percent marginal tax rate such families faced in the early 1970's.
To be sure, there does not appear to be any great popular clamor for tax cuts, as there was 20 years ago. Nevertheless, voices not known for being fervent tax cutters are saying that a major tax cut is needed at this time. This is true even among some liberal economists, who have traditionally argued that higher government spending, not lower taxes, is the way to spur economic growth.
For example, the liberal Jerome Levy Economics Institute has warned that policy makers are not factoring into their forecasts the contractionary effect of budget surpluses. Unless the surplus is quickly eliminated, either through tax cuts or spending increases, the institute believes that the economy will quickly run out of gas.
So why doesn't Mr. Clinton propose a broad-based tax cut? There are several reasons. First is that budget rules adopted in 1997 make enacting a tax cut prohibitively difficult. Under the so-called pay-go provision of the budget law, all tax cuts must be offset either with increases of other taxes or cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare. The law specifically prohibits use of the budget surplus or appropriated spending programs like the military to pay for tax cuts.
The "pay-go" law is, in fact, the main reason that most of Mr. Clinton's latest initiatives have involved tax credits, like that for long-term care, rather than direct spending. Such initiatives can be offset by the proposed increase in cigarette taxes, thus avoiding the budget caps on appropriations and the pay-go provision.
Mr. Clinton's second problem is fear that opening the door to an across-the-board tax cut would open a Pandora's box of tax initiatives from Congressional Republicans. A small Clinton tax cut might quickly grow into a large bipartisan tax cut that he would be powerless to forestall.
Finally, Mr. Clinton is still boxed in by his demand that the surplus be used first to "save" Social Security. Absent a plan to accomplish this, he will look like a hypocrite if he now proposes to use the surplus for some other purpose, even though he in fact used a big chunk of last year's surplus for various "emergency" spending programs, like more money for the International Monetary Fund.
It would be clever politics for Mr. Clinton to pre-empt Congress and call for across-the-board tax relief. If forced to choose between a popular tax cut and pressing forward with a politically unpopular impeachment trial, there is little doubt Republicans will select the former over the latter. A tax cut could become the President's secret weapon.

Nomura Securities Posts a Loss Tied to Japan's Economic Woes

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 18

 BODY:
The Nomura Securities Company, Japan's largest brokerage firm, said today that it lost money in the last three months of 1998, as Japan's economy and stock market sagged.
The Daiwa Securities Company, the second-largest brokerage firm, and the Nikko Securities Company, the third biggest, said one-time gains from two of Japan's biggest-ever stock sales helped them avoid a similar fate. 
 Daiwa managed the sale of a block of shares for the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, and Nikko co-managed the listing of NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc., the mobile phone company.
Nomura had a loss of 7.656 billion yen ($67 million) for its fiscal third quarter, after a 7.1 billion yen profit the previous quarter.
Daiwa earned 11.9 billion yen, and Nikko had profit of 8.98 billion yen for the period. Both companies lost money during the previous quarter.
All three brokers reported a fall in stock trading commissions for the nine months through December. Nomura said stock commissions dropped e 27 percent from last year. Daiwa reported a 72.6 percent fall and Nikko a 41 percent decline.
"One-time factors helped tide the brokers over, but I'm not sure they're on track," said Sadateru Nishimura, an analyst at Fitch IBCA in Japan. Stock commissions, which had been a major source of profits, "aren't even covering costs."
Daiwa said it would take a 115 billion yen ($1 billion) charge for the year through March to cover losses at three nonbank affiliates.
Overseas, Daiwa said it posted a total pretax loss of 50.3 billion yen in the nine months. In the United States, Daiwa lost 24.4 billion yen on bond trading and 1.7 billion on severance pay and other restructuring costs. In Europe, Daiwa lost 19.1 billion yen on emerging market bonds and 2.4 billion yen on restructuring.
Nomura said current profit fell 33.7 percent, to 14.23 billion yen, in the nine months to December.
Nomura said it lost 21.4 billion yen overseas in the third quarter. The figure includes 15.4 billion yen in the United States.

HEADLINE: NYC;
Culture City Talks Trash To Visitors

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
THERE is a way to keep the Great Trash War from spinning out of control and landing in court as Giuliani v. All States:
Insist that visitors to New York take their garbage with them when they go back home. The city could even make money on the deal. 
 This and other revenue-generating ideas percolated yesterday, the holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. No disrespect, but on the day of tribute to the martyred civil-rights leader, many New Yorkers were more interested in tax deals that they could get on clothing purchases than in his reflections on the human condition.
They took advantage of another week of tax-free shopping, and looked forward to a permanent reduction of more than 50 percent, scheduled to go into effect in December on sales under $110. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani would like to eliminate every last tax on clothing, and it is hard to imagine many New Yorkers' putting up an argument.
But since pendulums tend to swing, what will happen when the economy heads south, causing store sales to slump, retail jobs to shrink and municipal revenue to sag? The day may yet come when city and state governments wish they had not waved goodbye to that sales tax.
Although recommendations on fiscal policy are not normally the province of this department, the battle over New York's garbage exports inspired a thought or two, offered here free to municipal planners.
Virginians, as you may have heard, got their noses out of joint just because the Mayor said they should be thrilled to bury our trash in their soil. We give the outlanders Broadway and the Met, and what do they do? They add to our mountains of garbage. There should be more give and take, Mr. Giuliani suggested, a call for a "reciprocal relationship" that fell on many deaf ears in Virginia.
How about a different tack?
If Virginia and other states refuse to help out, why not impose a garbage-handling fee on the 32 million visitors a year to the city? You could start with a small surcharge, say, $3 a day, on each of the city's 60,000 hotel rooms, which are filled these days almost to capacity.
Three dollars would entail no hardship for guests already paying close to $200 a night on average. But the fee could produce about $65 million, roughly 10 percent of the Sanitation Department's annual budget.
True, it does smell like a new tax, which may cause the Mayor to wrinkle his nose. In that case, to return to the idea at the top, why not make visitors cart their garbage home?
Trash bags could be handed out at airports and train stations, with prominent signs informing arriving out-of-towners what is expected of them. Since most Americans consider themselves more polite and, over all, more virtuous than New Yorkers, they could be counted on to comply. They could be charged 25 cents or so per bag, an inconsequential sum that should cover the cost of the program and just might yield a profit.
AND if the city only breaks even, there will be other benefits.
When the guests are ready to return home, many will inevitably ask hotel attendants, apartment-house doormen, taxi drivers and airport skycaps to help them carry the filled bags. That means extra tips and more money for New Yorkers. The result could be an income-tax bonanza.
But even if they do not declare these tips, thousands of workers will have more to spend, which means more sales-tax revenue and smaller municipal budget deficits in hard times. Everyone benefits.
Please note that New Jersey, too, has crudely told New York what it can do with its trash. "Drop dead," Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said.
Does she not know that two can play that game?
New Jersey drivers are notoriously aggressive, and every day thousands of them bring their road rage into Manhattan, blaring horns and brushing back pedestrians in the crosswalks. They are easily identified by their license plates. Why not order a police crackdown? Public safety and the municipal treasury would both be better off.
Perhaps the most vexing part of the trash wars is a suggestion from some in Virginia that Mr. Giuliani has been acting a bit loopy. That is a slur. Maybe it would help if an affirmation that the Mayor makes sense, and New Yorkers support him, were written into any garbage-disposal contract.
Yes, Virginia, there is a sanity clause.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
A Global Rally as Worries on Brazil Recede

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Receding worries about Brazil's economic problems touched off a global rally in stock markets today as the country's central bank announced it would continue to float Brazil's currency, the real.
The steepest gains took place in Europe, with London's blue-chip Financial Times Stock Exchange index up 3.08 percent, or 182.9 points, to 6,123.9. Other world markets, however, remained volatile. 
 "There is still a lot of uncertainty out there, and I would not advise people to be investing in shares right now; these gains are simply not sustainable," said Michael Derks, senior market strategist for Nomura Securities in London.
Brazil caused a panic in world financial markets last Wednesday when it devalued its currency by 8 percent, setting off fears that the country could succumb to an Asian-style currency crisis. A crisis in Brazil's economy, the largest in Latin America, could drag down other countries in the region. Today, however, the Brazilian stock market rose 5.43 percent, or 366.58 points, to 7,113.32.
Stocks made strong gains across Europe and North America. The DAX index in Frankfurt rose 2.07 percent; the Paris CAC 40 index ended 2.39 percent higher; the Mibtel index in Milan rose 2.41 percent, and the IBEX-35 index in Madrid was up 4.95 percent.
The Mexican stock market rose about five-tenths of 1 percent, or 20 points, to close at 3,637.77.
Market watchers credited the gains to a recovery last week on Wall Street and other world stock exchanges after moves by the Brazilian Government to stabilize its economy.
United States financial markets were closed today for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.41 percent when it became apparent that Brazil's Government would stop spending its dwindling foreign reserves defending its faltering currency.
Asian exchanges opened sharply higher today, although many fell back by the end of trading.
Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei stock index was higher at the start but lost much of its steam, finishing up about half of a percent.
The Hang Seng index opened sharply higher in Hong Kong. By the end of trading, the blue-chip register had soared 2.51 percent.
And the Korea composite stock price index in Seoul closed up 1.27 percent.
Markets gained a hefty 4.4 percent in Manila; the Straits Times index in Singapore was up 2.7 percent, and the NZSE-40 capital index in New Zealand advanced 2.2 percent.
One weak spot was China, where the two stock markets opened largely unchanged. Traders said prices could fall because of growing numbers of Chinese companies warning of low profits.
Shares in Taiwan also ended lower on profit taking after.

HEADLINE: State of the Agendas

 BODY:
By tradition and the tense circumstances of the moment, this is President Clinton's day. In the evening, Mr. Clinton will march into a House chamber torn by emotion and partisanship over impeachment to deliver his seventh State of the Union speech. The address is to follow, by a few hours, the opening of Mr. Clinton's defense in the Senate. The President is not the only figure on the spot, however. Today the Republican Congressional leadership must begin a year of engaging a President with high approval ratings on something more than his personal scandals.
Mr. Clinton has always seemed most at home in these addresses, and the White House has skillfully leaked details in advance. There will be aid for the elderly, disabled and schoolchildren, with tax credits the preferred mechanism. Projected budget surpluses should be set aside to "save Social Security first," a mantra that proved effective last year in fending off Republican tax cuts. The speech is to call for more teachers, more strict Federal education standards, more police and more money for military readiness and to preserve open spaces, but not too much more money. It all has a familiar centrist ring. Riding the crest of a gravity-defying economic boom, Mr. Clinton must feel that there is no sense in abandoning what works politically. 
 As they brace for an address centered on these issues, the Republicans are a picture of fractious internal dissent. Dennis Hastert, the genial but untested House Speaker, has yet to articulate his priorities, beyond declaring that he is not Newt Gingrich. In the last couple of weeks, alarmed Republican leaders have been hit by new polls and complaints from top fund-raisers that voter impatience with the impeachment process has sent the party to its lowest standing in a generation. They know that they must put together their own legislative agenda as soon as everyone can agree on what it is.
Republican strategists say they want this Congress to concentrate on five broad areas: tax cuts, primary and secondary education, crime and drugs, national defense and Social Security. But the word is that they will try, at least at first, to be conciliatory to the White House and see if some agreements can be reached on things like school construction and aid for special education. Some party leaders seem to fear that the wounds will be so raw after the Senate trial and verdict on Mr. Clinton that they must seize on something, anything, to show they can cooperate with the White House.
Whether Mr. Clinton will be in a mood to cooperate and compromise is another question. Some Democrats will advise the White House that more confrontation with Republicans will better position the party's candidates in the 2000 election. Social Security is certain to be the early test. Last week Democrats and Republicans said a Social Security deal, leaving the system basically intact but making room for voluntary private investment accounts, is already being discussed.
Mr. Clinton, for his part, would like to prove wrong those who are predicting that the impeachment process will leave him politically immobilized even if it leaves him in office. He seems to want to settle the Social Security problem first, rescuing the system from insolvency as baby boomers start to retire in 15 years. The Administration wants a commitment on using some of the projected budget surpluses -- $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, by some measures -- to keep Social Security functioning, and later decide whether to make additional surplus money available for other priorities, like tax cuts. Republicans are likely to want tax cuts to be a part of any Social Security deal.
Mr. Clinton has an excruciating balancing act to pull off tonight. But so do the Republicans. They are now at war over impeachment. Soon they will have to decide whether to continue that war on the legislative front.

EUROPE
 
GERMANY: U.S. TO HAND OVER SPY FILES -- The United States has agreed to hand over East German foreign intelligence files believed to include lists of the names of agents who spied for East Berlin, the German Government said. The files were bought by Central Intelligence Agency agents nearly 10 years ago in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin wall. Bonn has repeatedly asked the agency to return the files, which it says are vital for identifying public figures who spied on their fellow citizens. (Reuters)
 
RUSSIA: ENVIRONMENT IMPROVES -- Environmental conditions in Russia have improved in recent months because of the fall in industrial production since the August financial crisis. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, head of the state committee for the environment, said industry now gives off 35 percent less air pollution than in 1991, and 15 to 18 percent less water-borne and other pollutants. (Reuters) 

NORTHERN IRELAND: BLUEPRINT BACKED -- Taking opponents of the Belfast peace accord by surprise, a strong majority of Protestant and Catholic politicians in Northern Ireland's new legislature voted to support a blueprint for a compromise government. The 74-to-27 vote endorsed a document presented by two politicians, David Trimble, a Protestant, and Seamus Mallon, a Catholic. It details 10 new government departments, with Protestants and Catholics sharing top posts equally. (AP)
 
BRITAIN: EARLY FREEDOM FOR PRISONERS -- Britain is seeking to control its soaring jail population by releasing thousands of prisoners early with electronic tags to monitor their movements. The first prisoners will be released on Jan. 28, a Home Office spokesman said, and up to 4,000 petty criminals will be freed over the next few months. (Reuters)
 
TURKEY: KURD STILL AT LARGE -- The Italian Prime Minister, Massimo D'Alema, said Turkey had lost out by rejecting an international trial for the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan, who left Rome over the weekend for an unknown destination. The Russian Government said it was checking reports that Mr. Ocalan had passed through Russia en route to a third country. (Reuters, Agence France-Presse)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: FOREIGN INVESTMENT FALLS -- After several years of steady growth, foreign investment in Israel fell 40 percent in 1998 from the previous year, the Bank of Israel reported. Total foreign investment in Israeli companies, including purchases in concerns listed on stock exchanges in the United States, fell to $2 billion from $3.45 billion in 1997. (Agence France-Presse)
 
KUWAIT: TRIP TO ISRAEL DEFENDED -- The editor of the Kuwaiti newspaper al-Seyassah, Ahmad al-Jarallah, defended one of his journalists who was detained for visiting Israel, telling prosecutors he would have gone. The reporter, Hamid Buyabis, was released last week on $3,500 bail after state security officials questioned him for three days. Kuwait's Parliament and the Journalists Association condemned Mr. Buyabis's visit to Israel, with which Kuwait is technically still at war. (Reuters)
 
YEMEN: MORE FOREIGNERS KIDNAPPED -- Two British and four Dutch citizens were kidnapped Sunday in northern Yemen, an Interior Ministry official said. Less than three weeks ago three Britons and an Australian were killed when Yemeni soldiers tried to rescue 16 Western hostages. (AP)
 
ASIA
 
INDIA: FUROR OVER CRICKET -- While militant Hindus in New Delhi, left, demonstrated against the Government's decision to let Pakistan's cricket team play in India later this month, a rampaging mob in Bombay attacked the offices of the Cricket Club of India, breaking windows and smashing furniture. Authorities believe the assailants were members of Shiv Sena, an ultra right-wing Hindu political group. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
JAPAN: OPPOSITION LEADER RE-ELECTED -- The opposition Democratic Party of Japan re-elected its popular leader, Naoto Kan, by a wide margin. Mr. Kan, who tops polls as the politician Japanese would most like to see become Prime Minister, easily beat out his only rival, Shigefumi Matsuzawa. (AP)
 
NORTH, SOUTH KOREA: NEW TALKS STARTING -- The fourth round of talks between North and South Korea, China and the United States to hammer out a formal peace for the divided peninsula are set to resume in Geneva. They follow inconclusive discussions last weekend about access to a North Korean underground center suspected of being the site of nuclear weapon activity in violation of a 1994 agreement. (NYT)
 
MALDIVES: MOSES MOVIE ATTACKED -- The Indian Ocean nation has banned the Hollywood animated movie "The Prince of Egypt," calling its portrayal of Moses offensive. Officials said the account of the flight of Jews from Egypt to Israel was based on "pure biblical propaganda" and ran contrary to the teachings of the Koran. Muslims consider Moses and Jesus prophets. The Maldives previously banned "The Ten Commandments" and "Ben Hur." (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
ZIMBABWE: EX-PRESIDENT SENTENCED -- Former President Canaan Banana was sentenced to 10 years in jail, nine of them suspended, for sodomy and indecent assault. Mr. Banana, 62, was convicted last November, but fled before he could be sentenced. The former Methodist minister and Zimbabwe's titular President for seven years, returned home on Dec. 15. Mr. Banana was given leave to appeal. Suzanne Daley (NYT)
 
CONGO: PEACE PACT REPORTED -- Leaders of countries involved in the civil war in Congo have agreed to sign a cease-fire to end five months of fighting, President Sam Nujoma of Namibia said. But rebels battling Congo's President, Laurent Kabila, expressed skepticism about a breakthrough. Neither Mr. Kabila nor the rebels were invited to the talks in Namibia. Chad, Namibia and Zimbabwe are fighting alongside Mr. Kabila against a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda. (Reuters)
 
CONGO REPUBLIC: CUBAN FIGHTERS ARRIVE -- Some 300 Cuban mercenaries have arrived in Brazzaville to support President Denis Sassou Nguesso, the Vatican news agency Fides said in Rome. The agency said the Cubans were siding with Government troops already backed by Chadians and Angolans. (Agence France-Presse)
 
SOMALIA: THE STARVING ABANDON HOMES -- Thousands of people fighting hunger in southern Somalia have abandoned their homes and are heading to towns or border areas in search of food, aid workers said. Rates of malnutrition among children have risen to more than 20 percent in the drought-stricken Bay and Bakool regions, Somalia's traditional breadbasket, where fighting between militia groups has added to the crisis. The United Nations says 300,000 people are at "very high risk" of starvation in the area. (Reuters)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
GRENADA: VOTERS GO TO POLLS -- Facing allegations of corruption and defections from his party, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell went to the polls against a loose and fraying coalition of opposition parties. Voters turned out before dawn. Mr. Mitchell was forced to call the election 18 months early after he lost a majority in Parliament. (AP)
 
MEXICO: 5 MILLION CHILD WORKERS -- At least five million children are working in Mexico, and about half of them have dropped out of school, according to a study by the Legislative Assembly's Employment and Social Welfare Protection Commission. About 70 percent of the child laborers work between five and 14 hours a day, the daily La Jornada reported. (AP)
 
VENEZUELA: A WARNING TO CONGRESS -- President-elect Hugo Chavez warned that he might dissolve Congress if it blocked his plan to call a referendum to create a popular assembly with the power to rewrite the Constitution. The former paratrooper, who scored a landslide victory in presidential elections last month, attacked legislators who argued that his proposal required a previous constitutional reform. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Bennett Harrison, 56, Urban Economist, Dies

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Bennett Harrison, a leading radical economist, vocal critic of United States economic policy and the co-author of the 1983 book "The De-Industrialization of America," died at home on Sunday of complications from cancer of the esophagus. He was 56 years old and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
Professor Harrison was professor of urban political economy at the New School for Social Research and had just completed the latest of a dozen books that shared one common message: the need, in his view, for Washington to play a bigger role to counter what he saw as the dark side of the Wall Street economy. 
 A native of Jersey City, Professor Harrison grew up in an atmosphere of ethnic tensions; his father changed the family name from Horowitz to Harrison to get a job at a radio station. An ambitious student, he relied on scholarships -- first at Brandeis University, then at the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a Ph.D. in economics in 1970.
In his heart, though, he never entirely left Jersey City. His academic career reflected an interest in the fate of cities and their inhabitants, especially blacks.
His first book was about economic development in Harlem, and his latest academic research, mostly financed by the Ford Foundation, concerned community development and job training.
He helped found the Union of Radical Political Economists in the late 1960's but revered the progressives of the 1930's rather than Marx.
A lively teacher and a popular thesis adviser, he spent most of his career as a member of the urban studies and planning department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He only gave up his full professorship there to follow his then-wife to Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh in 1991.
Professor Harrison was very much a public intellectual. For upward of 30 years, he played this role mostly in a duet with his best friend and frequent collaborator, Barry Bluestone, an economist at Northeastern University in Boston. Mr. Harrison devised economic development plans for a series of left-leaning Democratic Presidential contenders, starting in 1972 with Senator Fred Harris of Oklahoma. The plans addressed segments of the economy where in his view Government could play a greater role -- public works, environmental clean up and mass transit. His prescription scarcely changed in subsequent campaigns and with subsequent candidates. While he believed that markets could produce wealth efficiently, he doubted that they could share it equitably, and he believed that government somehow could.
A writer with a breezy style and an eye for big ideas, more popular with readers of editorials than with members of the economics fraternity, Professor Harrison was one of the first to articulate the middle-class malaise, a recurring theme of the 1980's. In "The De-Industrialization of America," written with Professor Bluestone during the deep recession of 1981-82,, he argued that plant closings and layoffs, not the strong dollar, were weakening American manufacturing and the blue-collar communities that depended on factories. By urging Washington to follow Tokyo's lead and adopt a policy of subsidizing favorite industries like autos and aircraft, he helped stimulate a national debate. The New York Times reviewer, an economic adviser to the Carter Administration, called the book intensely irritating but important.
Five years later, in 1988, Professor Harrison, again in tandem with his best friend, turned his attention to inequality, a topic that was to become hot during the 1992 Clinton-Bush contest. In "The Great U-Turn," Professor Harrison argued that the gap between high- and low-wage workers was exploding largely because of shrinking factory employment and the collapse of the power of the unions.
While Professor Harrison's analysis was not widely accepted -- economists pretty well agree that inequality reflects the growing demand for educated workers by an economy increasingly dominated by services -- he had once again succeeded in striking a nerve.
Known for his willingness to engage people of varying views in friendly debate -- from the competitiveness guru Michael Porter to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo -- Professor Harrison was not afraid to change his mind.
While he and Processor Bluestone were routinely introduced as Drs. Doom and Gloom in the 1980's, his penultimate book, "Lean and Mean," celebrated the vitality of large corporations like I.B.M. and Intel. And his last book, which Professor Bluestone was promoting in Europe last week, is a paean to America's resurgent economy. Still, says his co-author, a central theme is that only Washington, not the private sector, can insure that the wealth is spread around.
Besides economics, Professor Harrison's passions were baseball and jazz. In college, he pitched for Brandeis by day and played tenor saxophone in cafes around Boston by night. At one point, he dropped out of school for a year to tour jazz clubs around the country. He was delighted to get a job offer from the New School in 1996 partly because it meant he could immerse himself in the New York music scene. When he learned he was dying, he arranged to donate his instrument, a 1939 Martin, to the New School's jazz program to pass along to a younger, impecunious musician.
Professor Harrison is survived by his wife, Joan Fitzgerald, an urban planner at the University of Illinois at Chicago, whom he married just days before his death; his father, Leo of Springfield, N.J.; his sister, Deborah Kuperman of Highland Park, N.J., and his former wife, Maryann Kelly, a sociologist in Washington.

HEADLINE: Clinton's School Plan Praised for Goals, if Not Means

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
President Clinton's proposal to use Federal education money to hold public schools accountable drew a mixed reaction from Republicans and educators yesterday. While almost all said they shared his goals, some opposed his means: the increased role of the Federal Government in local schools.
The proposal, expected to be prominent in Mr. Clinton's State of the Union speech tonight, would financially reward school districts that adhere to Federal guidelines that will be drafted on the training of teachers, enforcement of classroom discipline and an end to the the promotion of unqualified students. Schools that fail to meet the guidelines would be penalized. 
 Accountability has become the focus of many politicians and educators who favor increasing money for schools that produce results. But the President is likely to run into strong opposition from many Republicans who argue that the Federal Government should leave these matters to the states and local school districts.
"The President has proposed a national school board," charged Lamar Alexander, the former Education Secretary and Tennessee Governor, who is expected to seek the Republican Presidential nomination in 2000. "But we should go exactly in the opposite direction -- liberating the schools, not regulating them. We should send the money to the parents and let them choose where their children attend school."
Linda Chavez, president of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity and a former senior official in the Reagan Administration, disagreed. She said it was a good idea to tie accountability to financing, because it is generally the schools that fail that receive more aid, not those that succeed.
"I like to see success rewarded, and I say that as long as there are Federal dollars going in to the school system, keeping it accountable is a good idea," she said. "I don't see any point in being overly ideological on this question of local control. I would urge Republicans to do what they did with welfare control -- seize on it and take it further."
Last year, President Clinton failed to persuade Congress to authorize uniform testing of fourth and eighth graders and money for fixing up schools in disrepair, in both cases because Republicans argued that these issues should be handled locally. On the other hand, they agreed on a plan by the president to spend $1 billion to help local districts hire 100,000 more teachers by compromising on how the money would be distributed.
Federal aid to education is quite limited, amounting to about 7 percent of overall spending on schools. It comes largely through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, first passed in 1965 and due to come up for renewal this year.
The debate over renewal is likely to be contentious. Some $8 billion is disbursed to poor schools through the act, and conservatives have expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the program.
Like Mr. Alexander, some conservatives have been arguing that the public school system needs to be drastically altered through the expansion of charter schools and the use of school vouchers.
Adam Urbanski, a vice president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Mr. Clinton's proposal was an effort to combat the growing voucher and charter movements by improving all public schools.
"Vouchers and charters are most likely to thrive when there is no accountability, when there is no way to determine whether public schools are succeeding," he said. "President Clinton is sending the message that public schools are salvageable. The best way to restore confidence in public schools is to get better results in public schools. And that comes about through tough love."
The President's proposal calls for schools to meet several criteria, among them:
*States would have to distribute to all parents annual report cards for each school and school district;
*Schools would have to end what is called "social promotion," or moving pupils to the next grade irrespective of their performance;
*Schools would have to increase the quality of teachers by insisting on ongoing training for experienced teachers and high scores on tests for new ones;
*And schools would have to adopt tough discipline policies such as uniforms, enforcing truancy laws and imposing curfews.
A number of states have already adopted some or all of these approaches, and the President's advisers say his plan aims to complement those efforts. "We're saying that states and school districts must be accountable in helping all students reach high standards," Secretary of Education Richard Riley said at a Washington briefing yesterday. "It's really a way to help states and school districts see that that's done."
Marc S. Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a strong advocate of national standards, said the argument over local control seemed to have little meaning as long as the Federal government is spending money.
"As long as the Federal government is providing billions of dollars to schools, taxpayers will reasonably ask what they are getting for their money," he said. "This should be a proposal that Republicans who are so interested in results can embrace."
But Charles L. Glenn, a professor of education policy at Boston University, who for 21 years directed urban education for the state of Massachusetts, said there was good reason to be concerned about more Federal regulations on local schools. "It sounds like a terrific idea but unanticipated consequences crop up," he said. "I consider Federal funds to be an awkward instrument for these policies. This will tie the hands of folks at the local level."
Chester E. Finn, Jr., an assistant secretary of education under President Reagan, said he did not see how the Federal Government could "micromanage 15,000 school districts." He added, "The test of this debate will be to see whether Republicans have a better idea how to do this."

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE LENDERS;
Approval of Rate Policy, But No New Financial Aid

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund and the United States said today that they were heartened by Brazil's pledge to keep interest rates high and slash its budget deficit. But they offered no new financial aid and made clear that Brazil's economic fate is largely in its own hands.
As they shuttled around Washington seeking to explain and build support for their Government's decision to allow its currency to float in value, Brazilian officials said they had heard the message and were prepared to do what it took to re-establish the country's credibility in the ultimate court of economic policy, the financial markets. 
 Even before Brazil's central bank announced tonight that it was increasing overnight interest rates, Pedro Malan, Brazil's Finance Minister, told a news conference here that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration was determined to take whatever steps necessary to avert a crippling new round of inflation. And he said the Government would intensify efforts to push through a package of tax increases and spending cuts intended to bring the budget deficit under control.
"We know additional measures may be required" to improve the country's fiscal condition, keep the economy on track and maintain the confidence of investors, Mr. Malan said.
Mr. Malan met today with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary.
Afterward, a senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a "shared judgment that the most important thing in Brazil was the pursuit of strong policies, which especially meant carrying through on deficit reduction measures, strong anti-inflation monetary policies and continued structural reforms."
The American official said Mr. Malan "made clear his own determination and President Cardoso's determination in a very complex political environment to carry through effectively; that was certainly something we welcomed."
Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, also offered encouraging words. "I am personally very satisfied with the conversations that I.M.F. staff and management have had over the last weekend with Minister Malan and the Brazilian team," Mr. Camdessus said.
Mr. Malan said after arriving in Washington on Saturday that Brazil might ask the I.M.F. and individual countries, including the United States, to speed planned aid payments due to Brazil under a $41.5 billion assistance program negotiated last fall. The next set of loans, about $9 billion, is scheduled for release next month.
Brazilian and American officials said today, however, that there were no discussions about granting the loans ahead of schedule. Economists said that since Brazil was no longer daily defending the value of the currency, the real, the country had less immediate need to bolster its foreign currency reserves.
But Brazil, which took the first steps last week toward abandoning its old stable exchange rate policy without informing the I.M.F. and the Clinton Administration, will now have to accept closer scrutiny by the international lending organizations and the countries providing it with aid, including the United States.
In a statement issued here today, Mr. Malan said Brazil would "intensify its dialogue" with the organizations and countries providing aid and would "establish new and more intensive procedures of continuous consultation" with the I.M.F., including the possible opening of an I.M.F. office in Brasilia.
With financial markets around the world reacting favorably again today to Brazil's new currency strategy, and with the United States and the I.M.F. providing their stamp of approval, Brazil appears to have come through what could have been a disastrous collapse of its old strategy without any serious damage.
But the true test will come only when the country hits its next economic bump, as it inevitably will, or when an outbreak of the financial turmoil that has plagued the world since mid-1997 next sweeps through the markets.
Economists and policy makers see two possible outcomes for Brazil. Under the optimistic version, a temporary increase in interest rates and quick action to rein in the budget deficit restores confidence in the markets, allowing the currency to stabilize without dropping much further. Interest rates then come down, and the devalued currency allows Brazil to export more easily, helping economic growth without fueling inflation.
Under the pessimistic version, continued downward pressure on the value of the currency forces the central bank to keep interest rates cripplingly high. The economy stalls, forcing politicians into an agonizing choice between weathering a painful recession or reducing rates, a move that could send the currency plummeting and inflation sharply higher.
In 1992, Britain abandoned a policy of keeping the pound stable in value relative to the other main European currencies after a speculative attack of the sort that has become increasingly common in countries with underlying economic problems. Britain's finance minister at the time said the collapse of the stable exchange rate policy had him singing in the shower because it allowed him to reduce rates and give a boost to the domestic economy without worrying about the currency.
Given its history of hyperinflation and doubts among investors about its willingness to deal with its fiscal deficit, Brazil does not have that luxury. Mr. Malan, to the relief of the I.M.F. and the United States, explicitly said as much in his statement today, a message reinforced by the central bank's quick move to raise interest rates to help prop up the currency.
"In the new exchange rate regime, fiscal and monetary policies will have to play an even more crucial role in insuring price stability and conditions for sustained economic growth," Mr. Malan said.

HEADLINE: In Race to Develop Blue Lasers, Japanese Star Surges Ahead

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
A lone Japanese inventor has outrun some of the world's largest and most advanced high-technology corporations in the race to develop a new generation of short-wavelength lasers. The achievement is likely to hasten the introduction of high-definition digital video disks, higher-resolution laser printing and inexpensive and highly efficient light bulbs for use in the home.
The inventor, Shuji Nakamura, is a semiconductor researcher who has worked for more than a decade in relative isolation and has excelled in finding innovations in material science. Last week his small company, Nichia Chemical Industries, announced that it had begun shipping sample quantities of violet lasers with a life span of 10,000 hours, the level of reliability required by consumer electronics companies. The samples are going to a variety of companies planning to develop prototype products. 
 Such lasers, in the blue and violet part of the spectrum and with a shorter wavelength than the infrared or red light that is now commonly used to read compact disks, have been pursued for years by companies including United States and Japanese giants like 3M, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and Toshiba. In digital storage, such an advance is particularly impressive because each time the wavelength of laser light is halved, the beam can then store four times the data.
That the race has so far gone to Nichia (nih-KEY-uh) is a payoff for its long-term investment in pursuing this technology, which many corporations deemed a high risk. It may also indicate how Japanese and United States companies have reversed roles in recent years. Officials of United States companies said yesterday that they still thought they could win the race to incorporate the technology into products and bring them to market first. From the 1950's through the 1970's, Japanese companies successfully commercialized technologies invented in the United States.
The next barrier will be reducing the cost of producing the lasers and devising technical standards that will provide compatibility with existing applications.
Mr. Nakamura first burst onto the scientific stage in November 1993 when Nichia announced that he had succeeded in fabricating a bright blue light-emitting diode, another kind of widely used light source.
His advance came just two years after the International Business Machines Corporation had decided to scale back its effort in laser research, partly in the belief that the market would not be large enough in the near future. Yesterday, I.B.M. researchers said they were impressed by the Nichia achievement.
"I'd call it a piece of technical work that is absolutely remarkable, and it stands on its own," said Bill Lenth, manager of science and technology at the I.B.M. Almaden research laboratory in San Jose, Calif.
But other American competitors refused to concede the international race to commercialize the technology. And further breakthroughs in short-wavelength lasers -- like blue lasers, which could lead to higher-resolution computer displays -- have yet to be achieved.
"He's really a leader in this field," said Waguih Ishak, director of Hewlett-Packard's Communications and Optics Research Laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif. "He's ahead, but it's a marathon and we've just started."
Hewlett-Packard ramped up its multimillion-dollar research program in lasers and light-emitting diodes (L.E.D.'s) shortly after Mr. Nakamura's breakthrough in 1993. Mr. Ishak said the company had now caught up in the L.E.D. market, and he said he was pushing hard to catch Nichia in the laser race.
"This is something I can't fail in," he said.
The commercial application of the new lasers is expected to have substantial impact. For example, they will make possible high-definition digital video disks, or HD DVD's, a step beyond the current digital video disks. The new disks will deliver HDTV-quality movies, concerts and stage presentations. In addition, music publishers could publish entire anthologies on a single HD DVD, carrying more than a dozen hours of music on each side.
Besides DVD applications, Mr. Nakamura said by E-mail that the violet semiconductor lasers would enable a new generation of digital tape recorders that will be similar to today's VCR machines but able to store high-definition video images.
While the most sought-after commercial applications for short-wavelength lasers are in the area of digital storage, there are many other practical uses, ranging from laser printers with twice the resolution of today's best-quality products to a new class of household lighting that could be 2 to 10 times as energy-efficient as today's fluorescent and incandescent light bulbs.
The Nichia researcher's breakthrough came from exploring an unusual class of materials known as gallium nitrides. Other companies had previously tried to use other materials to construct blue semiconductor lasers.
"He took an unorthodox, high-risk route, and he won," said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a computer and consumer electronics consulting concern based in Seaford, N.Y.
In addition to near-term digital storage applications, Mr. Doherty and other researchers said that inexpensive short-length lasers might make possible such futuristic technologies as optical computers, laser-based computer or television displays and perhaps a new generation of optical fiber communications systems or even ultra-high-speed laser optical communications sent directly through the air rather than by fiber optic wires.
In "The Blue Laser Diode," a book about his technology published in 1997, Mr. Nakamura wrote that the chairman of Nichia, Nobuo Ogawa, had originally invested $3.3 million in the laser diode project, or about 1.5 percent of the company's annual sales at that time. The amount is much higher than what companies usually invest in the work of one researcher.
Despite the acclaim for Mr. Nakamura's achievement, executives of one small United States company that is a close competitor of Nichia predicted that they would win the race to commercialization.
"I think there are still huge questions to be answered about pricing and volume production," said Neal Hunter, chief executive of the company, Cree Research Inc. of Durham, N.C.
In the race to build inexpensive L.E.D.'s, Nichia was first to market, but others ultimately managed to produce them more cheaply, he argued, saying that the same economics might hold true in the semiconductor laser race.
Cree is gambling on a technology using silicon carbide, rather than gallium nitride, and Mr. Hunter said the company believed that it would make products easier to manufacture and with better heat dissipation -- properties that will be crucial in low-cost applications.

HEADLINE: Environmentalists Battle Growth of Ski Resorts

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Colo., Jan. 18

 BODY:
Next weekend, skiers here are to inaugurate the world's highest chair lift. Whisking 1,200 skiers an hour to a 12,700-foot ridge, the lift will offer sweeping views of the Rockies and challenging runs down the Continental Divide.
But in a sign of changing times in the nation's most popular skiing state, a Colorado environmentalist is suing, asserting that Loveland Ski Area, owners of the lift, violated its Federal permit for building on national forest land. 
 After fighting logging, mining and cattle grazing on national forest lands, environmentalists declared open season this winter on ski areas, once a seemingly wholesome presence in the landscape. The expansion of ski areas, mostly on public land, that once aroused little opposition is now being fought by groups who are angry over growing real estate development on adjacent private land.
Increasingly run by publicly traded corporations, ski areas are turning to mountain real estate as a source for big profits in the future. In contrast, the number of lift tickets sold nationwide each winter has been stagnant for a decade, at around 53 million. In that period, ticket sales in Colorado increased by about 20 percent, but the state has seen its ski ticket sales drop 11 percent this season as some resorts endured their scantiest Christmas season snow in 40 years.
"It is not about skiing, it is about real estate development," said Jonathan J. Staufer, a shop owner in Vail who is chairman of the Ski Area Citizens Coalition, a new environmental group. "Industrial tourism is posing the next major threat to wild places in Colorado and America."
Here in the High Rockies, signs of growth abound.
Directly below Loveland's new Continental Divide chair lift, but muffled by a quarter mile of granite, traffic on Interstate 70 regularly slows to a crawl in the Eisenhower Tunnel, a major link between Colorado's busiest ski areas and the two million people in greater Denver. In 25 years, traffic has quadrupled in the tunnel, 60 miles west of Denver.
In the 75 miles between here and Eagle-Vail Airport, enough home construction is planned to double the populations of several towns in five years. A rural airstrip in 1990, the airport is Colorado's second busiest this winter, offering direct jet service to 13 cities, including New York and San Francisco.
On public lands, recreation is shaping up as the new battleground. In the last decade, while the volume of timber cut in national forests fell by two-thirds, the number of recreational visitors jumped by 40 percent With hikers, hunters, bikers, campers and skiers increasingly dominating forest policy, the United States Forest Service predicts it will record one billion recreational visits a year by 2010.
"Now we see lawsuits, not only against oil, gas and mining, but also to stop recreational use," the chief of the Forest Service, Mike Dombeck, said in Denver recently, after encountering protesters objecting to a 2,000-acre expansion of Vail into National Forest land.
In Colorado, where most skiing is done on national forest land, the conflict flared into the public eye in October when an amorphous group, the Environmental Liberation Front, protested the expansion of Vail's ski slopes by burning three buildings and damaging four lifts.
But in less dramatic fights, Colorado environmentalists are lobbying Federal agencies to block new ski trails at Keystone Resort and Breckenridge Ski Resort. Nearby, at Arapahoe Basin, they are trying to block the installation of a snow-making system that would fulfill that area's dream of becoming the nation's first to offer skiing year round.
Two weeks ago in Colorado, in the face of strong local opposition, a consortium of Vermont and Colorado developers abandoned plans to build a ski area 10 miles south of Steamboat Springs, which would have been called Catamount. In addition, the developers planned 3,700 new homes and 1,000 hotel rooms.
"They had the resources and they had the permits," said Susan Otis, executive director of the Yampa Valley Land Trust. "But they knew that in the community there no longer was a desire to have a new ski area."
Census figures show that Colorado has the third-fastest-growing population in the nation, after Nevada and Arizona. Now, defenders of the fragile lands in the Rockies are also worried that out-of-state demographic pressures will result in a proliferation of second-home developments and swelling crowds at ski areas.
On one end, the average age of a second-home buyer in the United States is 51. Over the next 18 years, 78 million Americans are to turn 51. Their children number 72 million and are expected to pack ski areas again. The intermediate group now in their 20's and 30's numbered only 44 million.
At public hearings in Vail last spring, one resident drew applause when he said, "We want to look at trophy elk, not trophy homes." At the hearings, most speakers spoke against the expansion plans of Vail, the nation's largest ski area.
Critics noted that within 40 miles of Vail, eight ski areas are already operating, with 126 lifts and 850 trails covering almost 15,000 acres. Vail Resorts is expanding its ski terrain by 19 percent, even though lift ticket sales dropped 5 percent last winter, to 1.6 million.
Two weeks ago, a company close to Vail Resorts, Turkey Creek LLC, successfully bid $42 million for a 2,900-acre parcel of private land that is a mile from the resort's new expanded area. The ski company has an option to buy half of Turkey Creek.
And Vail Resorts and the Intrawest Corporation, a Canadian company, are partners in the construction of 4,600 housing units at the Keystone ski area. Intrawest has a total $1 billion in construction planned at the nine ski areas it owns in the United States and Canada.
"The trend is to focus on real estate, while quietly selling some ski tickets on the side," said Sandy Shea, a director of High Country Citizens' Alliance, a group that opposes a 300-home development planned for private land next to Crested Butte Mountain Resort.
Noting that Crested Butte offers free skiing early in the season to fill company-owned hotel rooms, Mr. Shea added: "I don't think any ski area is making money off tickets. Most of the money is made from real estate."
When the Forest Service approves ski slopes near private land, the value of the private land jumps. Looking at ski lifts that serve mediocre slopes near vacation homes, some Colorado environmentalists derisively call them "real estate lifts."
"Ski-in, ski-out real estate commands a 25 percent premium," said Neil Adams, a real estate broker in Crested Butte. "When you, your wife and your five kids decide to go skiing, do you want to play taxi driver? Your kids can come home for lunch, no problem. Just ski right up to the door."
The ski industry describes as minuscule the 20,000 acres of ski area expansions planned on national forest lands around the nation. About one-quarter of the nation's 525 ski areas operate on Forest Service land, leasing about 190,000 acres out of total national forest holdings of 190 million acres.
"That means that on one-tenth of 1 percent of Forest Service land, 30 million people enjoy a winter recreation experience," said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association, an industry group based near Denver.
While ski areas are magnets for growth, not all of the growth in second homes in the Colorado high country is tied to skiing.
"You can go to other areas of Colorado, where there are no ski areas, and trophy homes are being built," said Lyle Laverty, the Forest Service's top official for Colorado.
In the lawsuit against Loveland, the environmentalist, Steven Hannon, asserts that the Forest Service awarded permit for a 1,700-foot surface lift, then allowed the ski area to nearly triple the length of the lift and to change it to a chair lift.
Ken Abrahamson, the general manager of the ski area, which is fighting the suit in Federal District Court in Denver, said: "The Forest Service approved putting skiers on top of the ridge. We followed the process from A to Z."
Greg Walcher, Colorado's newly appointed director of the State Department of Natural Resources, has watched the Rocky Mountain economy shift dramatically to tourism from mining, grazing and logging, partly because of environmental opposition to extractive industries on public lands. Now he worries, Mr. Walcher said, that "some people want to slow tourism down, then shut it down."
"It would be a horrible mistake not to take them seriously," he said.

HEADLINE: Requests Are to Include More Aid for Russia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
In his State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, President Clinton will insist that the United States substantially increase its financial assistance to Russia to minimize the threat posed by the Russian nuclear arsenal, Administration officials say.
"The President believes it's in the national security interest of the American people that we work with Russia and other former Soviet countries to reduce the risk that materials, technology and expertise for weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of rogue nations or terrorists," David Leavy, a National Security Council spokesman, said today. 
 Another senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Clinton was concerned about "people trying to sell what has value."
"As Russia is in a period of greater economic distress, it is even more in our interest to accelerate these programs," the official said.
The Administration officials said the President would propose spending $4.2 billion over the next five years, a 68 percent increase over the $2.5 billion already budgeted.
The new money would be used in these areas:
*To dismantle warheads and other weapons.
*To redirect Russian scientists and scientific institutes into civilian pursuits.
*To tighten controls over non-nuclear weapons and materials like chemical and biological weapons and missile parts and help the Russians beef up their export controls.
*To assist in the relocation of Russian troops now stationed outside the country.
The President will emphasize that the money will not be available to institutions that offer nuclear assistance to Iran. Last week, the White House announced economic sanctions against three Russian institutions that the Administration said were helping Iran and possibly other nations develop nuclear weapons and missiles.
In an interview, Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a military research organization here, and an expert on Russian nuclear weapons, said the increased spending to be proposed would be "a good down payment to solve an important problem."
Asked how much it would cost to solve the problem once and for all, Mr. Krepon replied, "There isn't a soul who knows the answer."
The request for additional financial assistance to Russia will be the centerpiece of the quarter of the speech devoted to foreign and military policy, the officials said. They said the President would also talk about efforts to contain the threat from Iraq and to achieve peace in the Middle East, Northern Ireland and the Balkans.
Mr. Clinton will also press for a five-year increase in the Defense Department budget, with an emphasis on improving the ability of troops to respond quickly to emergencies, and will call on the Senate to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. As long as the United States does not join the 151 other nations who have signed the treaty, the President plans to say, this country will lack the moral authority to persuade India and Pakistan to stop testing nuclear weapons.
Other passages will involve United States policy in Asia and Africa, and there will be a sizable section on trade and international economics. The President will urge Congress to reinstate his authority to negotiate trade agreements under a process that would allow Congress to approve or reject the pacts but not amend them.
In 1991, in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, Congress approved legislation that provided money to Russia and other former Soviet states to help them dismantle their nuclear arsenals and create safe storage for weapons-grade nuclear material.
This is called the Nunn-Lugar program after its chief sponsors, former Senator Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who headed the Armed Services Committee, and Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, a former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
An Administration official said that somewhat more than $1 billion had been spent since the program's inception.
A spokesman for Mr. Lugar, now the second-ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the Senator had been briefed on President Clinton's proposed expansion of the program and supported the initiative.
But the President's plan could still run into difficulty in Congress, because many Republicans do not trust the Russians and are wary about giving them assistance.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Propose Tax Break For Parents Who Stay at Home

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
President Clinton will embrace an idea long favored by conservatives and propose a tax break for parents who stay home to care for their children, White House officials said today.
The proposed tax credit, up to $250 a year for each child under age 1, is smaller than the tax breaks proposed by Republicans for the same purpose. But the Administration now accepts the Republican argument that the Government should recognize the value of services provided by a parent, generally the mother, who forgoes paid employment to stay home and care for the children. 
 "The President believes we should respect and support parents in whatever choices they make, whether to work or to stay at home," said Bruce N. Reed, Mr. Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser. "Mothers or fathers who stay home to raise a child need help too."
In the past, Mr. Clinton has offered several proposals to make child care more affordable to working parents.
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton would probably highlight his child care proposals, including the tax credit, in his State of the Union Message to Congress on Tuesday. Republicans led by Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island proposed a similar tax credit last year, and they intend to try again this year.
In addition, White House officials said, Mr. Clinton will propose a tax credit to encourage small businesses to provide health insurance to employees. Under the proposal, employers with fewer than 50 workers could get the tax credits for two years if they established or joined a purchasing coalition to obtain health insurance.
Employers would receive a tax credit of $500 a year for each family insured through a coalition, and $200 for each person covered as an individual.
Small businesses are much less likely than big companies to provide health insurance to their employees, in part because the premiums are higher and the costs less predictable. Small businesses have generated most of the nation's new jobs, and this helps explain why the ranks of the uninsured are growing even as the nation's economy expands and employment rises to record levels.
About 11 million people are uninsured and work for companies with fewer than 25 employees. They account for nearly half of all uninsured workers and nearly one-fourth of people without insurance.
Administration officials said tonight that Mr. Clinton would also ask Congress for $1 billion to help poor people move from welfare to work next year. Labor Department officials said the money could help 200,000 people, by subsidizing jobs for school dropouts, long-term welfare recipients and other people with few skills. The plan was reported tonight by The Washington Post.
In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress provided $1.5 billion a year in "welfare-to-work grants" for 1998 and 1999. The President wants to extend the program for one more year, on the assumption that people who remain on welfare need extra help getting jobs.
White House officials said the tax break for small businesses would cost $44 million over five years. It would be available only to companies that did not provide health benefits to employees in 1997 or 1998.
The proposed tax credit for stay-at-home parents is part of a package of measures to subsidize child care that would cost more than $18 billion over five years. The tax credit would cost $1.3 billion over five years and would benefit 1.7 million families, the White House said.
Other items in the package would give additional tax relief based on income and child care expenses to working parents, to help offset child care costs, and would expand the main Federal program that subsidizes child care for families so poor that they pay no taxes.
Most of the child care proposals, aside from the assistance for parents who stay home, were included in Mr. Clinton's budget last year. He announced the proposals with fanfare at the White House in January 1998, but he did not fight hard for them on Capitol Hill. The proposals died in Congress, in part because their financing was linked directly to a big tobacco bill, strenuously opposed by the tobacco industry. There will be no such link this year.
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, said the President's proposals on child care and health insurance were intriguing.
But he said: "We have two questions. Is the White House inviting the Internal Revenue Service deeper into people's lives by complicating the tax code? Is the Clinton Administration paying for its initiatives by raising taxes on the American people?"
Republicans last year faulted Mr. Clinton for not proposing assistance to parents who stay home to care for children. The criticism came from moderates like Senator Chafee and conservatives like Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho. "The Government should not discriminate against parents who decide to stay home and take care of their kids," Mr. Craig said.
On another issue, the Administration has decided to seek a substantial increase in Federal grants to the states for services to people with severe mental illnesses. The grants would total $358 million, an increase of $70 million, or 24 percent, over this year's level.

HEADLINE: TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE OVERVIEW;
BRAZILIANS PLEDGE MARKET CURRENCY

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Brazil said today that it would continue to allow market forces to set the value of its currency, the real, all but abandoning a policy to support the currency that was draining billions from its reserves of dollars.
With the Government still seeking some control over the currency, the nation's central bank raised interest rates on overnight loans today to keep the real from weakening further. Finance Minister Pedro Malan traveled to Washington and told American officials that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration was determined to take whatever steps necessary to avert crippling new inflation. Page C8. 
 The Government's move on Friday to allow the real to trade freely against the dollar had lifted the benchmark stock market index here by 33.4 percent, and its announcement today kindled a further upswing, with the index rising 5.4 percent. Though New York exchanges were closed for a holiday, European markets rose. The real, however, fell an additional 10 percent, to a rate of 1.58 to the dollar. It has plunged 24 percent since the Government first moved to devalue the currency.
The decision by Brazil ends a policy that had been geared toward suppressing once-crippling inflation by pegging the currency to the dollar, which helps keep a tight rein on the money supply. That was a key feature of the so-called Real Plan, which was introduced in 1994. But the country could no longer afford to prop up the value of the currency by buying reais with its diminishing reserves, which must also be used to pay foreign debt. Brazil's economy has been stagnating; unemployment is at near-record levels; exports are falling and the trade deficit is way up, and the the nation's troubles have aroused fears of an Asian-style collapse that could weaken economies throughout the region, including in the United States.
The central bank said that "as of today," it would let market forces "define the exchange rate." It added that it might intervene in currency trading in the future, "occasionally and in a limited way, with the goal of countering disordered movement in exchange rates."
With the currency disconnected from the dollar, editorial cartoons in one newspaper pictured Mr. Malan and the new central bank president, Francisco Lopes, flying in a red purse in search of solutions to Brazil's difficulties. On Saturday, the handbag was shown taking them to Washington for talks with the International Monetary Fund, which has promised to lend $41.5 billion to help Brazil weather its crisis. Brazil has already received $9 billion from the package, and another $9 billion is to be released at the end of February. Brazilian and American officials said today that there were no discussions about granting the loans ahead of schedule.
Communications Minister Pimenta da Veiga said the President was "extremely impressed with the reaction of the markets" to Friday's devaluation, during which the real did not lose the 30 percent in value that economists had predicted. He said there would be "a period with moments of tension, certainly" but added, "The floating of the currency has had a very positive result."
A weak currency can help stimulate exports by making them cheaper abroad. But it also reduces the purchasing power of consumers, particularly when buying imports, and puts downward pressure on the currencies of neighboring nations.
President Cardoso told reporters in Brasilia today that devaluation would not make the real more vulnerable and that the currency could grow stronger. Now, he said, "we are more dependent on ourselves."
The attention of investors is turning to Brasilia, where Congress is expected to take the second of a series of votes needed to extend and increase a tax on financial transactions. The tax is part of an austerity plan, estimated at $23.5 billion in tax increases and spending cuts before the devaluation, that was a condition for Brazil to win I.M.F. backing for a standby loan last fall. The austerity plan is intended to reduce a huge budget deficit and restore confidence in the economy.
The Government is also sending a bill to Congress this week that would make civil servants contribute to the public pension system, which Congress has already rejected four times. Public workers enjoy generous lifetime pensions equal to, or higher than their salaries when working, and benefits for an estimated 1.8 million of them are expected to produce a $30 billion deficit this year.
If Congress acts decisively, said William Cline, chief economist at the Institute for International Finance in Washington, "chances are relatively good that confidence will rebuild, and that will allow the central bank to reduce interest rates and take a lot of the severe recessionary pressure off the economy."
After talks with officials at the fund this weekend, Mr. Malan said Brazil did not ask the I.M.F. to speed up the second installment of its loan. Mr. Malan said that "additional measures will be adopted, as appropriate, to deal with the fiscal impact of the exchange rate devaluation."
As investment specialists here braced for a possible new round of austerity moves from the Government, short-term interest rates rose. Martin Arranz, who tracks international markets at Banco Patente here, said he expected the Government to announce another series of measures in the next few weeks to help it pay debts due in 1999 that must be paid in dollars. He estimated such debt rose $13 billion with last week's devaluation.
"The worst has not happened yet," Mr. Arranz said. "With the money devalued, economic activity will shrink even more. Companies that began to invest are going to put on the brakes."
The President is insisting that Brazil has not abandoned the control of inflation, which sank below 1 percent last year and ran in three digits only a few years ago. Today, he called on businesses not to ignite instant inflation, which Mr. Malan estimated would reach 8 percent this year by raising prices in response to the devaluation.
Banking experts say that despite the devaluation, Brazil is in stronger condition to meet its foreign obligations than was Mexico in 1994-95 or South Korea in 1997, both of which devalued their currencies in response to financial crisis.
Across Latin America, major markets rose modestly on word that Brazil had abandoned its policy of spending dollar reserves to defend its currency. Only Argentina's benchmark index closed down, at 2.4 percent, with business leaders there calling for trade barriers to keep out a flood of suddenly cheaper Brazilian imports. The two countries are among the partners in Mercosur, a regional customs union and have extensive trade relations.

Graphs: "Turbulent Ride for Brazil"
A strong reaction to last Wednesday's loosening of central bank intervention in the Brazilian currency market led to a swift decision to let the real trade freely, which investors immediately rewarded. The news that Brazil would not defend the value of the real brought interest rates down from their peak, lessened the loss of U.S. dollars, and the stock market enjoyed robust gains.

HEADLINE: Rikers Island Learns to Recycle;
Behind Razor Wire, Gardens and a Composting Plant

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
As weekly pickups of recyclable trash spread to all the neighborhoods of New York City, there is one eco-friendly urban corner that is way ahead of them, already providing pickups twice a week.
In the rest of the city, composting is confined to the odd backyard, but gardeners in this place compost six tons of food scraps and packaging a day. The $5 million plant where they do it, said to be the world's largest devoted to composting only food, has a roof made of photovoltaic cells, making it one of the city's most ambitious efforts to turn sunlight into electricity. 
 Last year, 30,000 pounds of vegetables were harvested here in the city's largest community garden. There are daily classes on garden design, plant care and other horticultural topics. There is a Zen meditation pond, an ornamental grass garden and a native woodlands area. Birds peck at suet in feeders as observers keep lists of species.
Environmentalists visiting this spot might think they had died and gone to eco-heaven, but this New York City address is nobody's idea of paradise. It is Rikers Island, home to 10 jails and 16,000 inmates, to tall fences, miles of menacing razor ribbon and ominous guard towers.
But the experimental jail farm is also a strikingly unexpected laboratory for solving one of the city's most intractable problems: getting rid of garbage. As Staten Island's Fresh Kills landfill prepares to close in 2001 and the city scrambles against mounting opposition to sending its trash out of state, environmentalists say the jail complex is demonstrating how to deal with more waste at home.
The Rikers experiment is explicitly part of a waste-management plan the city drafted in 1992 and updated last year. Ultimately, experts say, if the city meets its recycling goals, all of its food waste -- which at that point would be one-fourth of the city's total garbage -- could be composted within the five boroughs.
"The whole purpose here is to remove the word waste from the dictionary," said Thomas C. McCarthy, a spokesman with the City Department of Correction. "To take what used to be called waste and find a use for it."
Greater self-sufficiency is also the main benefit of the other environmental programs at Rikers. The farm last year raised 30,000 pounds of fresh vegetables for use in prison meals, an amount that would have cost $8,111 to buy.
Even more important, officials here say, are the practical and psychological benefits inmates gain from learning new, possibly money-making skills as well as from the simple pleasures of gardening.
"It's like serenity," said Frederick Lewis, 45, an inmate who finds that the rewards in his job in the landscaping program go far beyond the 15 cents an hour he is paid. "There's a sense of freedom."
From the prison authorities' perspective, the benefit is greater control of potentially unruly inmates. "You hardly have any violence at all," said Gary Pereira, a correction officer for 12 years.
Only inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses are allowed to participate in the program at Rikers, a maximum-security prison complex. But given that inmates work with pitchforks, shovels and shears, security concerns are paramount and gardeners are pat-searched coming and going. "No one's going nowhere until all the tools are counted," said Manuel Monserrat, a correction officer.
Terrariums are made with unbreakable plastic rather than with glass, and garbage compactors must be searched to make sure inmates are not trying to escape by hiding among recyclable material.
Besides the hands-on work, the program involves daily classroom instruction: a blackboard has two dozen words, like "chloroplast," "anther" and "mulch." Inmates learn how to cultivate house plants and design outdoor gardens. In the native plants area, they have planted dogwood, juniper and plum trees. They make their own decisions on garden design. Women in prison made the biological symbol for female the centerpiece of one garden.
Last summer, inmates collected worms for a nestful of baby mockingbirds. They scattered ladybugs about as a weapon against aphids that were attacking the plants. They were amazed to learn that tulips grow from bulbs, not seeds. In the farm program, which runs from April through September, they grew zucchini, tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables.
"It's nurturing," said Mr. Lewis, a former construction worker from East Harlem who would not specify his offense. "Planting a seed and seeing it grow is more satisfying than just eating the stuff."
David Brown, 41, of the Bronx, who was convicted of stripping automobiles, said: "I knew my cars. Now I know my plants."
On a day-to-day basis, the Rikers program, operated by the Horticulture Society of New York, is run by James Jiler, 39, who quit his job as a Wall Street commodities analyst and joined the Peace Corps. He advised the Government of Nepal on organic farming. He picked up a master's in urban forestry from Yale University. He works with prisoners five days a week.
More than 200 inmates have participated. For the women, Mr. Jiler teaches a course on house plant care, encouraging them to think of themselves as doctors nurturing patients. For the men, he is beginning a program to raise plants for use in landscaping grounds next to city bus garages. Other plants have gone to the median islands on upper Broadway.
"We want to encourage a sense of creativity," Mr. Jiler said.
In helping to make things grow, Rikers Island is returning to its roots. It began as a 90-acre farm owned by the Riker family, and through the dumping of waste was expanded to 450 acres. It became a prison in the 1930's.
In 1986, the Horticulture Society started a greenhouse and landscaping program, but the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ended it for budgetary reasons in 1994.
The society returned in September 1997 partly because the gardening program fit into other programs. For instance, the society uses plants from Rikers Island to beautify the lawns of landmark Carnegie libraries. And the new society president, Anthony Smith, is also a director of South 40 Corporation, which helps former inmates find jobs. The society has promised to pay all of the program's bills.
Mr. Smith contends that the program is more than worth the cost. "Inmates may be seeing something for the first time that is going to live or die based on what they do or don't do," he said. He added that in the program's first incarnation, 25 percent of participants returned to prison after they were released, compared with more than 60 percent of the general inmate population.
The recycling and composting operations would seem to involve inmates the least, but their participation is actually crucial. It is the job of one correction officer, Sandra Simmons, to get the prisoners' attention; they must sort food waste into the right bins for the program to have any chance of working.
"You have to be very demanding to be taken seriously," said Ms. Simmons, whom inmates have dubbed the Garbage Queen. "If you ask for 100 percent, you get 50 percent. It works."
Ms. Simmons got her appreciation for recycling from her mother, who took her to a recycling and redemption center near their Queens home when she was a little girl. She found that few inmates had the same background. Most thought the waste was being taken to hog farms to be used as swill. "Some couldn't care less and some were confused," she said. "But for some, it was like the circle of life."
The goal of the composting operation is to take the process from backyards to a much larger part of the population. If composting can be shown to be economical in the large Rikers Island project, other composting centers might be constructed around the city. The compost could be used in parks, golf courses and botanical gardens and for other uses, both within and outside the city.
"How to do anything beyond backyard composting in New York City becomes very, very complex," said Thomas Outerbridge, who originally planned the project as a Sanitation Department official and now works as an environmental consultant.
"Our first idea was that the project must be big enough to catch the attention of the people at sanitation," he said.
The composting center cost $5 million, mostly in state money, and is on an isolated corner of the island unlikely to be used for a new jail. It enables the Correction Department to avoid using hundreds of garbage trucks that otherwise might pose a security risk, and the department pays nothing to the Sanitation Department for running the program.
Each day, the residue of 60,000 meals is mixed with recycled cardboard into a yeasty substance that smells like manure. The final result is high-grade fertilizer for use in the gardening and farm programs.
"It's the largest composting facility in America used strictly for food waste," said Robert LaValva, the Sanitation Department's chief of composting. "This is the point of reference for the rest of the city."
Well, maybe. Neighbors have been known to complain about the odor from composting. Nobody had to ask the inmates for their view.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Investors Sour on Belo as Ad Sales Fall at Flagship Paper

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON and FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
It's as if, as 1998 ended, some prankster turned the A. H. Belo Corporation's stock chart upside down. Falling from $28 and change to less than $20 last year, a stock that had long paced the newspaper industry fell far behind, with its worst performance since Belo went public in 1981.
The cause everyone points to is weak advertising at the company's flagship, The Dallas Morning News, which regularly prints more column inches of advertising than any other newspaper in the nation. But total advertising volume dropped by 2.3 percent in 1998, and classified advertising -- the most profitable advertising newspapers sell -- led the decline. Some company executives and analysts speculate that the drop was fueled by the migration of high-technology help-wanted advertising to the Internet. 
 A quarterly earnings report due on Thursday will show whether Belo's efforts to control expenses in the last six months have had results. Analysts, absorbing the company's cautions, have trimmed their outlook to 20 cents a share, from 28 cents three months ago.
Publishing represents about 45 percent of Belo's profits, and The Morning News perhaps three-quarters of that. But those numbers alone cannot convey the true heft of the newspaper as the symbol of the financial and journalistic success of a media company that with $1.2 billion in 1997 revenue is one of the nation's largest. When The Morning News does well, Belo smiles and Wall Street smiles with it. And when The Morning News suffers, Wall Street feels Belo's pain.
Elsewhere, Belo's situation is stable, or even promising. At its 17 television stations, which now reach one of seven households around the nation, advertising gains remain healthy. Its other newspapers, including The Providence Journal-Bulletin and The Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif., had good results in 1998.
But the company and its many acquisitions have been built on the growth and profitability of The Morning News. Given the strength of the Dallas economy, investors want to know what's wrong.
Robert W. Decherd, Belo's chairman, president and chief executive, has confronted the reversals with the same bravado that has helped him turn a business run by his family for more than seven decades into a media giant. He contends that the current doldrums are simply part of the normal cycle that every business goes through, especially when digesting major acquisitions.
In fact, the company's stock, which had outperformed the newspaper industry for two years, beginning in the fall of 1994, had already begun to slip behind the group just before Belo's $1.7 billion acquisition of the Journal-Bulletin Company in 1997. And the gap between Belo and the industry increased, so that by the end of 1998, its stock was the worst performer in the group.
But Mr. Decherd argues that the stock's downturn should not detract from the underlying strength that he sees resulting from Belo's heavy investments in its newspapers and broadcast stations.
"It's clearly a patient-money strategy," he said in an interview. "Crepe-hanging over the performance of The Dallas Morning News in 1998 is the most ridiculous idea I can imagine."
Yet underlying the advantages are some of the broadest uncertainties Belo and Mr. Decherd have faced since they won a fight to the death with The Dallas Times Herald, which Belo bought and closed in 1991. Mr. Decherd, who became the company's president six years before that, at age 33, must now find among his contemporaries successors for the two top executives who -- besides him -- are most responsible for Belo's growth and success: Ward L. Huey Jr., the vice chairman and broadcast division chairman, who is 60, and Burl Osborne, the publisher of The Dallas Morning News and president of the newspaper division, who is 61. Two other top executives quit the company last year.
Although Mr. Huey and Mr. Osborne do not plan to leave before reaching the usual retirement age of 65, preparing for their departures is already a Decherd priority. "The question you pose is one I take very seriously and about which I have a lot of personal angst," he said, finishing with a word that repeatedly creeps into his speech these days.
The naming of Robert W. Mong Jr., 49, who had come up through the Dallas newsroom, as the newspaper's president last September appears to put him in a position to eventually become its publisher and the chief of the entire newspaper division. Mr. Mong is striving to establish his cost-cutting credentials. His first memo in his new job began, "I want to let you know that we will not be having a company picnic this fall," and went on to cite the newspaper's lagging performance.
Reporter's travel has been curtailed, and new parking decks, for the newspaper and an adjacent television station, have been delayed. So has construction of a new building for the Riverside newspaper. And the planned pace for adding high-definition capability to the television stations has been slowed. All told, Belo intends to cut capital spending this year from a planned $125 million to $98 million.
Early retirement incentives offered to 300 employees of The Morning News and the Dallas television station were accepted by about 180, averting the need to begin the year with layoffs.
Mr. Mong succeeded Jeremy L. Halbreich, who had been president since 1991. Mr. Halbreich had worked for Mr. Decherd since graduating from Harvard, which Mr. Decherd attended at the same time, in 1974. Although Mr. Halbreich's associates say he was offered other positions with Belo, he decided to leave.
In June, Belo also lost Michael D. Perry, its chief financial officer. Mr. Decherd described the resignation as voluntary. But two people who know both men well said that their relationship had grown rancorous. The separation agreement, which included job-hunting services for Mr. Perry, reads almost like the terms of a cease-fire in an armed conflict. One provision, for example, commits Mr. Perry and the company to saying nothing negative about the other.
Many of Mr. Perry's duties went to James M. Moroney, a 42-year-old, Stanford-educated cousin of Mr. Decherd's and the son of a former Belo chairman. Mr. Moroney had risen to second-in-command at the broadcast division. As executive vice president for finance, with the new chief financial officer reporting to him, he gave the company's presentation last week at a Salomon Smith Barney investment conference.
Despite the turnover and pending retirements, Mr. Decherd says that investors should draw assurance from his own continuing tenure and his status as Belo's largest shareholder. "I'll be 48 in April and have no plans to go anywhere," he said. Lest anyone doubt his robust good health, he suggested with a laugh that an interviewer meet him at the pool where his coach, a champion swimmer himself, pushes him through hourlong workouts.
At a newspaper generally considered one of the nation's best regional dailies, Mr. Mong and Mr. Decherd pledge to continue the necessary spending and investments. They cite the addition of another weekly zoned section for the fringe suburbs and a personal-technology section, as well as the purchase of new $36 million presses scheduled for installation in 2000. The newspaper's reporters are also appearing on the Texas Cable Channel, which Belo introduced on Jan. 4 -- itself a $15 million investment in plant and equipment.
Even the newspaper's critics have noticed improvements in The Morning News, which has won six Pulitzer Prizes since 1986. "The News is getting better, though we hate to admit it" said Molly Ivins, the popular columnist for the rival Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
The cash-flow margins for the newspaper -- perhaps the best measure of profitability -- peaked at 34 percent in 1997 before dropping to 32.6 percent in 1998. Newspaper margins in the 20's are more common.
Although Morning News circulation, like that of other major newspapers, has been sliding, it was the loss of advertising that prompted analysts to turn negative. Double-digit growth in advertising revenue in 1995 and 1996 had tailed off to 7.2 percent in 1997. And beginning last August, these sales went into a steep decline. The greatest losses came in what had been the newspaper's most profitable category, help-wanted, which was off by 6 percent in September and 3 percent in October, the company told analysts.
Some analysts blame rate increases of 32 percent from 1995 to 1998 for retail advertising, 47 percent for general advertising and 75 percent for classified employment ads. But Belo executives say that advertisers' cost per thousand readers remains below the average for the largest newspapers. They say that high-technology employment advertisements may have migrated to the Internet, or may have dried up with the loss of Asian demand for high-technology products. Similar weakness in classified advertising dented profits for newspapers in San Jose, Calif., Los Angeles and Boston.
Mr. Decherd sees no broader Internet invasion. "These are computer-facile people," he said, working his fingers as if his conference table were a keyboard. "I don't think it means there is some sort of broader secular change in terms of newspaper advertising generally."
But Mr. Decherd sees an even broader challenge -- demonstrating that in journalism, high quality can still bring high and growing profits. "If it doesn't work for Belo, my opinion is it won't work for anybody," he said, his voice falling to a distant murmur.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK;
A Sure Cure for Bordeaux Sticker Shock

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
THE best 1996 Bordeaux wines are being bottled right now, the 1997's are still maturing in barrels and the 1998's are almost ready for blending. In a few months, the most famous first-growth chateaus will announce their prices for the 1998 vintage, to be delivered in 2001.
No one is expecting any surprises: even if prices stay at current levels, they will be exceptionally high. And annual price increases have become the norm in Bordeaux in recent years, regardless of the quality of the vintage. 
 For investors and collectors, these increases are no more than a minor annoyance, since their wines will probably be worth even more 10 years from now. But for the average wine drinker, it would seem that these high prices would put good Bordeaux totally out of reach. Actually, they merely pose a challenge -- to find good Bordeaux for a reasonable cost. Happily, that is not so difficult to do.
To some extent, the staggering prices of the most famous Bordeaux do reflect production costs and the intrinsic quality of the wines. But mostly they reflect the laws of supply and demand. Most of the top-name chateaus make fewer than 30,000 cases a year -- a huge amount compared with production at Burgundy estates and the cult California wineries, but still hardly enough to meet demand.
Yet, there are hundreds of chateaus in Bordeaux not part of this special market. Their prices are far more reasonable and more closely reflect their costs. What is more, many of these non-first-growth wines are from the fine 1995 vintage -- the one that Chateau Margaux sells for more than $300 a bottle and that Latour, Lafite-Rothschild, Mouton-Rothschild and Haut-Brion sell for $200 to $300.
I WOULD be much more tempted by the exceptional 1995 Lynch-Bages for about $55. Jean-Michel Cazes, the owner, regularly produces wines of first-growth quality at prices that people who actually drink wine can afford; a 1995 bottle of Haut-Bages-Averous, his second label at Lynch-Bages, can be found for less than $25. Lynch-Bages is in prestigious Pauillac. The Cazes family also owns Les Ormes de Pez, in St.-Estephe, and its 1995 is also under $25.
There have always been so-called second wines from the top Bordeaux chateaus, usually from younger vines or from lots that just don't qualify for the principal wine. And a few of these second wines are considered about on par with the principal wines from lesser properties. Among these second labels are Les Forts de Latour and Les Fiefs de Lagrange.
Les Forts de Latour is the second wine of Chateau Latour. Tradition has it that in less memorable vintages Les Forts can be more appealing than Latour itself. That has not been my experience, although I remember when a bottle of the 1973 was opened for lunch at the chateau in the early 1980's and the magnificent bouquet filled the house. The 1995 Forts de Latour is going to set you back $50, but if you happened to have an urge to spend $50 on a bottle of Bordeaux, you needn't look any further.
Almost in the same class and much less expensive, at about $20, is Les Fiefs de Lagrange, the second wine of Chateau Lagrange, in St.-Julien. This is an underrated chateau that has been making superb wines since it was purchased by Suntory, the Japanese wine and spirits conglomerate, in 1983. St.-Julien wines are usually softer and more approachable than those of adjoining Pauillac, and that is true of the 1995 vintage. The first wine probably needs several more years to reach maturity, but Les Fiefs is ready now.
ONE of St.-Julien's best-known properties, at least in this country, is Chateau Gloria, which was made famous by its owner, the late Henri Martin, a legendary figure in the Bordeaux wine trade. Gloria was not included in the 1855 classification, so it cannot command the prices of the chateaus around it. But most of its vineyards were bought by Mr. Martin from those classified properties. Over the years, Gloria's wines have matched or bettered those of many of its neighbors in quality and beaten them in price. The 1995 is about $30.
I have always wondered why, even with the unconscionable inflation of Bordeaux prices in recent years, some chateaus that could have raised prices did not. One of them is Chateau Meyney, another property in St.-Estephe, in the northern Medoc. The wines are big and rich and, like most St.-Estephes, a bit hard when they are young. In the 1995 Meyney, that hardness has dissipated, leaving a full, rounded wine, ready to drink now, for about $22 a bottle.
I've concentrated on the Medoc here, but there are well-priced 1995's to be found all over the Bordeaux region. In St.-Emilion, there is Clos des Jacobins at about $27, and La Commanderie, a light, easy-drinking wine at about $15. In adjoining Pomerol, there is an elegant Clos l'Eglise at about $30.
Clos de Jacobins is owned by Domaines Cordier, a well-known Bordeaux negociant that also owns Meyney. Offering good chateau-bottled wine at reasonable prices would seem to be a Cordier principle. Clos l'Eglise is an austere wine for a Pomerol, whose wines are often compared to Burgundies. This 1995 has a beautiful bouquet, plenty of ripe fruit in the taste and a most appealing silky finish.
Anyone can buy superexpensive Bordeaux wines and show that they have lots of money. A shrewd few can buy Bordeaux like these and show that they have lots of smarts.
 
Tastings
Pure Pleasure In Pinot Noir
 
Buena Vista Pinot Noir 1996, Carneros, Calif. About $16.
SOME California pinot noirs are selling for $60 and more; a few are worth it. For the rest, it would be tough to defend their costs on the basis of quality when compared with this modestly priced offering from Buena Vista.
The Carneros region, which stretches across the south end of both Napa and Sonoma, is incontestably one of the best places in California to grow pinot noir. Buena Vista, with more than 900 acres, is the largest estate winery there, and has more than 160 acres planted in pinot noir.
Spring rains reduced the size of the 1996 crop, but what survived was mostly high-quality fruit. Two weeks of lower-than-normal temperatures in August made it possible to keep the grapes on the vines longer than usual, adding to both flavor and color.
The wine has good color and a delectable bouquet, although I didn't get the touch of menthol found by Judy Matulich-Weitz, the wine maker.
With or without menthol, it is a most attractive pinot noir, ready to drink now.

Jamaica prepares to put troops on patrol at resorts to help ease tourists' fears of crime.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell

 BODY:
WITH its tourist industry battered by fear of crime and by visitor complaints of harassment, Jamaica is trying to decide when to deploy troops to its tourist resorts and whether they will be in uniform or plainclothes. The move is backed by the Jamaica Hotel and Motel Association, which was previously lukewarm toward the idea. The change comes as occupancy rates have fallen after several well-publicized crimes against tourists.
While Jamaican officials say that crime against visitors has fallen in the last couple of years, harassment is so widespread, especially in cruise ports, that Prime Minister Percival J. Patterson described the situation last year as the single biggest problem facing the tourist industry. 
 Four cruise lines threatened to pull out of Montego Bay two years ago, and one line, Celebrity, did pull out its Mercury ship. Still, merchants say that this year fewer than half the passengers on cruise ships in Ocho Rios are staying aboard rather than coming ashore.
At stake is an industry that is Jamaica's biggest money maker by far. In 1997, the island drew 1.9 million visitors, whose spending accounted for 45 percent of Jamaica's foreign exchange, almost 14 percent of its gross domestic product and one in every four jobs.
To protect the industry, Jamaica raised fines last year for harassing tourists: the penalty for a first-time offense is about $2,700, up from $27, and repeat offenses draw fines of about $4,100, also up from $27. But, judging from last week's decision to deploy troops, the harsher penalties have apparently had little effect.
The date of the deployment has not been determined, a spokeswoman for the Jamaica Tourist Board said yesterday, largely because the tourism and security ministries have not yet resolved whether the soldiers will patrol in uniform or plainclothes, or whether they will patrol at all resorts simultaneously. The United States State Department, meantime, recently updated a year-old advisory warning visitors to Jamaica to exercise caution.
 
1998: A So-So Year
Final statistics for 1998 travel and tourism will not be compiled for months, but the numbers are expected to surpass those for 1997, if just barely. While the number of cruise passengers is likely to top the 5.05 million who sailed in 1997, several other major tourist industries slumped last year.
Attendance at theme parks, for example, fell almost two million in 1998 principally because of bad weather, while visits to such popular national parks as Grand Canyon in Arizona and Yosemite in California were also down significantly. Unusually warm weather toward the end of the year ruined the plans of tens of thousands of skiers, and lowered hotel occupancy rates in Orlando and elsewhere in central Florida.
The bad economic news from Asia, especially Japan, also hurt attendance at theme parks in California and Florida, while dealing a hammer blow to Hawaiian tourism.
The number of Japanese visitors to Las Vegas probably reached a record in 1998, but would perhaps have been even higher if the yen had remained strong.
 
A Few Worries in Utah
The scandal over reports of bribery involving the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City is creating concern that the expected 50,000 additional visitors a day might not show up, either out of disgust with the process used to land the Olympics or because diminished sponsorship might result in fewer events surrounding the Games.
Any significant drop in visitors would affect hotels, restaurants and much else, including the State of Utah, which had projected an extra $19 million in tax revenues. And a decline in foreign visitors would be especially painful, since Utah has been expecting them to spend generously as well as spread the word back home about the state's many scenic charms.
For now, though, the Utah Travel Council has said that calls to its information line have more than doubled since the scandal emerged. More worrisome, for the time being at least, is the below-average snowfall over much of the state, which has led to a disappointing ski season so far.

Archive Tells How Church And City Grew

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
THE moving van has yet to roll up to John Cardinal O'Connor's residence on Madison Avenue. Although at 79 he has passed the church's mandatory retirement age of 75, he continues to serve at the discretion of his friend and superior, Pope John Paul II. So, what gives with all the boxes he has been sending to the archdiocese's seminary in Yonkers?
The Cardinal is not cleaning house; he has history on his mind. The boxes, several dozen so far, contain speeches, letters and assorted awards from his tenure as Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York. They have joined hundreds of other boxes, albums and books from his predecessors that now spill out of three rooms at the seminary's library. Come September, the documents will have a new home at the seminary's Archbishop John Hughes Heritage Center, a climate-controlled archive and exhibition space for scholarly research on the church in New York. 
 But the archive's value, Cardinal O'Connor said, goes beyond church matters. He said it offered an often-overlooked perspective on the city's growth, as seen through the church's network of schools, charities and societies that turned immigrants into Americans. While some social critics have recently embraced the notion that churches can save the inner city, the archives show that such work was being done since the diocese's founding in 1808.
"The history of the church here parallels the history of New York and in many ways is one with it," the Cardinal said. "We are an immigrant church today. We were an immigrant church 200 years ago. Right now, I'm meeting with a group of concerned individuals about how do we support the Mexican community. In trying to come to grips with this, I have been going back and seeing what was recorded in how we dealt with immigrant populations through the past 200 years."
A striking example is found in the legacy of the center's namesake, Archbishop Hughes of the mid-1800's. Dagger John, as he was known, defended the Irish immigrants, who were scorned as criminals and louts. His battles with Protestants whom he accused of anti-Catholic bias in the education of poor children led him to start a system of parochial schools. When nativist riots were threatened, he rounded up 1,000 militiamen to protect the cathedral.
"He had an enormous impact on the city," the Cardinal said. "He was almost alone in recognizing the needs of the immigrants and the contemptuous treatment of them. He helped them integrate into society."
Sister Marguerita Smith, the seminary's archivist, said such efforts eased the way for other immigrants who arrived facing even more hurdles than the Irish. The Italians who settled in New York in the late 1800's, she said, did not speak English and were often beholden to padrones who treated them like indentured servants. Archbishop Michael Corrigan established the St. Raphael Society to break those ties and encourage assimilation.
"The priests would try to meet them at Ellis Island so they wouldn't fall into the hands of the padrones," she said. "The priests would find them jobs, tide them over with money or help them if somebody died in the family."
OTHER groups followed a similar path and the church responded in kind. When paperboys and ragamuffins slept in hallways, Father John Christopher Drumgoole started an orphanage on Staten Island. The archives hold copies of a newsletter he published about the hard-knock lives of homeless waifs.
There are volumes about the hospitals founded by nuns to treat the poor, demands for economic and racial equality in Harlem and calls for increased attention to the social ills that plagued the newcomers in old neighborhoods. You could tell the newest arrivals easily enough: they were the ones who held services in church basements.
To bring the archives up to date, 100 priests, nuns and lay people are being interviewed for oral histories that will reflect the moods of various neighborhoods in this century. A photographer has been visiting several landmark churches, documenting the handiwork of generations of artisans.
Msgr. Jeremiah Monahan, the chancellor of the archdiocese, said the archives would ultimately affirm the heritage and contributions of the city's people and parishes. After nearly 200 years, they've finally arrived. "We always thought the archives would be a grand place to match the grandeur of New York," Monsignor Monahan said. "It's not just a place where we put our things."

HEADLINE: King Hussein Back Home; Despite Joy, Jordan Frets

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Piloting his own plane, King Hussein of Jordan returned to his kingdom today after six months of cancer treatment. His arrival prompted scenes of widespread jubilation, but also speculation about who might next take the reins of the country he has governed for nearly half a century.
The 63-year-old King has promised only "a comprehensive review" of Jordan's course. But senior officials said today that he was contemplating succession by one of his five sons rather than by his long-designated successor, his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, who has ruled the country during his long absence. 
 Never before during his reign has King Hussein been away from Jordan for so long. He was welcomed home by hundreds of thousands of Jordanians, who braved unseasonably chilly and rainy weather to pay tribute to a King who has been the only leader a vast majority of them have ever known.
After landing his jet at a military airport today, during the Id al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the King, gaunt and hairless from his cancer therapy, knelt on a prayer rug to give thanks.
Before his return, the King had fueled much talk here that he might be reconsidering a succession plan that for more than 30 years had put his brother next in line for the throne. He has kept people guessing with comments like, "No one knows what is in the mind of al-Hussein until it crystallizes into a reality."
Today the King praised Prince Hassan for serving as his "deputy," but gave no clue about his intentions. A senior palace official said, though, that the King's "difficult days of life and death" during his treatment had "naturally rekindled a wish to seek posterity through passing the succession to one of his sons."
Only once before, in 1992, after treatment for an earlier bout with cancer, had the King's return from abroad prompted the kind of rejoicing that burst forth today.
Fireworks exploded over Amman, and streets were decorated with pennants and banners and crowded with hundreds of thousands of people. Dancers from around the kingdom joined in what by any measure was a most extraordinary pageant.
King Hussein has ruled Jordan since 1952 -- when Harry S. Truman was President -- and there is no doubt that he has been sorely missed.
"Thank God he has returned," Amira al-Awahdi, a 42-year-old homemaker, said this afternoon as she took part in the celebration. "I can't imagine what we will ever do without him."
Jordan, with its 4 million people, has a strategic location, sandwiched between Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
In the last five years Jordan has reached out to Israel, joining Egypt as the only two Arab countries to make peace with Israel. But it has never fully forsworn its ties with Iraq -- on which it still depends for oil -- and that prompts distrust in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries that joined the United States in waging war against Iraq in 1991 after it invaded Kuwait.
This has left Jordan a bit lonely, despite King Hussein's efforts to bridge gaps through his charm and diplomacy. The King took time out from his treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., to join President Clinton last October for Middle East peace talks at the Wye Plantation in Maryland. Then, as happened several times in the past, he was credited with helping to bridge the gap between Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
In his absence the country was led by Crown Prince Hassan, the King's understudy for more than 33 years, who is seen both at home and abroad as a competent and effective leader.
But still, at 52, Hassan seems to lack the common touch that might be necessary to guide Jordan though what many expect will be tumultuous years ahead.
For years Jordan had depended for much of its revenue on trade with Iraq, most of which was halted under the United Nations sanctions that stemmed from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
More than half of Jordan's people are Palestinians whose homeland is the West Bank, but for whom returning there has become an increasingly distant prospect.
Jordan has yet to reap clear dividends from its accord with Israel in 1994, which remains deeply unpopular among many Jordanians. In the years since, the economy has suffered and unemployment has soared.
In the days preceding his return, King Hussein had seemed intent on pre-empting his critics. In a televised address from London over the weekend, he declared that there was "no choice but to engage soon in a comprehensive review of our national course and dealing with all the issues and challenges that occupy our minds or obstruct our blessed path."
Jordanian officials have interpreted that statement as a signal that the King may be reconsidering the succession. For many Jordanians, that kind of speculation was fueled again today when the King, in a statement on his arrival, made no more than passing reference to his brother.
Many people in Jordan believe that he would prefer to be succeeded by one of his five sons from his four marriages. The one most often mentioned is Prince Hamzeh, 18, the King's eldest son by his current wife, the American-born Queen Noor.
As his father was, Prince Hamzeh is being educated at the British military academy at Sandhurst. His eloquence in Arabic and English has been widely admired in Jordan, and he has been at the King's side through most of his illness.
The speculation was fed today by the very public presence of Queen Noor at the King's side as the royal party rolled through the streets of Amman in a 1960's Mercedes-Benz limousine.
Even in Jordan, which has a more relaxed attitude toward public roles for women than most Arab countries, it is unusual that the wife of a leader would be presented so prominently.
The King has pronounced himself "fully recovered" from his lymphoma. Since July he has undergone six courses of chemotherapy, which he has acknowledged left him physically and emotionally weakened, and today he appeared a bit frail.
But throughout his illness, the King has appeared determined to display his physical vigor, most often by taking control of his aircraft, as he did today by flying his Gulfstream jet here from London, where he had been recovering in a holiday home.

HEADLINE: Browsers and Borders Are Argued at the Microsoft Trial

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
In the Microsoft antitrust trial, the Government spent most of today attacking the company's central defense -- that its Internet browsing software is a seamless feature of its Windows operating system and not a stand-alone product. The Government is trying to prove that the browser and operating system are two products, illegally bundled together mainly to stifle competition.
But the Justice Department and 19 states suing the Microsoft Corporation face an uphill struggle to confirm that allegation. In a related case, a Federal appeals court ruled last June that Microsoft had virtually unlimited freedom to include anything it wanted in its products. The decision pointedly noted the "undesirability of having courts oversee product design." 
 In the current trial, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court is not necessarily bound by the appeals court ruling. But it does suggest that the Government must make some very convincing arguments to prevail.
David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, spent hours today trying to show that Microsoft's position on the issue was contradicted by the company's own internal documents and by common sense. Using other products as examples to illustrate his point, Mr. Boies insisted that it was possible to do what Microsoft says is nearly impossible -- draw a boundary line in software code, separating one product from another.
Microsoft, Mr. Boies said, could do the same thing with its popular word-processing program, Word, as it did with its Internet Explorer browser. "But the mere fact that two programs share some software code -- and a company can make it difficult to disentangle that code" -- by no means proved that they were a single product, Mr. Boies said.
Mr. Boies directed question after question at Microsoft's first witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist who is the dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The Justice Department lawyer noted that even Michael Dertouzos, the director of M.I.T.'s Computer Science Laboratory -- who was initially on Microsoft's witness list but was later dropped -- had testified in a deposition that he considered the browser an application program, separate from the operating system.
Mr. Schmalensee held his ground, however, cautioning the court against immersing itself too deeply in software code. "One thing this industry teaches is that the borders between products vary over time as technology advances," he said.
At another point, he explained that he did not give "any particular weight" to the testimony from expert witnesses that the browser and operating system were separate products. "Testimony as to the way things are," Mr. Schmalensee said, should not be binding in determining "guidelines that are going to affect the evolution of this industry" -- a nod to the expectation that whatever the verdict for Microsoft, the case will have a far-reaching effect on the nation's high-technology economy.
The Government argues that Microsoft's decisions to bundle its browser with Windows and to place contract restrictions on personal computer makers add up to anticompetitive behavior.
Pursuing that line, Mr. Boies asked Mr. Schmalensee if Microsoft had bundled its browser with Windows in part to increase the distribution of its browser. "It certainly had that effect," the witness replied.
Next, Mr. Boies asked if one purpose for the bundling was to make it more difficult for a Microsoft rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation, to distribute its browser.
"Yes," Mr. Schmalensee replied, "but that would have happened anyway. Competition would have plausibly raised Netscape's distribution costs."
"Competition on the merits can raise rivals' costs," he added, "but that says nothing about anticompetitive effects."
The M.I.T. business school dean insisted that the Government had not shown any current harm to consumers from Microsoft's decision to fold browsing software into its operating system and to give the browser away. And in determining whether business practices are legitimate competition or anticompetitive predation, Mr. Schmalensee emphasized that "the touchstone has to be ultimate impact on consumers."
The Government contends that Microsoft's practices effectively limited Netscape's access to mainstream channels of distribution where most people obtain their browsing software -- from computer makers who load it onto new PC's and from Internet service providers.
"And that harms consumers because it deprives them of choice," Mr. Boies said today on the courthouse steps.

EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: THE CASE AGAINST PINOCHET -- The Law Lords rehearing Gen. Augusto Pinochet's claim to immunity from arrest were told that the acts leading to charges of crimes against humanity should not be thought of as functions of a head of state. "It must be that no matter who you are, whether you are a head of state, a government official, a public official, you have individual, personal responsibility in respect of a category of crimes recognized internationally as particularly odious, such as genocide, torture and taking hostages," said Alun Jones, the lawyer arguing the case against the former Chilean dictator. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: YELTSIN DELAYS TRIP TO FRANCE -- President Boris N. Yeltsin's state visit to France, initially planned for next week, has been postponed until mid-March. The 67-year-old Mr. Yeltsin was hospitalized on Sunday with a stomach ulcer and is expected to stay at least two weeks. (Reuters) 

RUSSIA: NEW ENVOY TO U.S. TAKES OVER -- Russia's new Ambassador to the United States, Yuri Ushakov, formally took up his post and will present his credentials to President Clinton on Friday. Mr. Ushakov, 51, who is a career diplomat, replaces Yuli Vorontsov, who is retiring at 69. (Reuters)
 
FRANCE: WARNING ON WEB PORNOGRAPHY -- Police and other experts discussed how to stop the spread of child pornography on the Internet in a conference at the Paris headquarters of the United Nations Economic, Social and Cultural Organization. Unesco warned that children are falling victim to the boom in information technology, with hundreds of Web sites used to promote sex tourism and to exploit children. (Agence France-Presse)
 
VATICAN: POPE'S PLEA FOR THE POOR -- Pope John Paul II urged the world to open its arms to the poor, the lonely and "those excluded from the banquet of everyday consumerism." In his traditional message for the Christian season of Lent, which begins on Feb. 17, the Pope returned to a theme that has often troubled him in the past year: the marginalization of the world's poor in the face of free marketeering and economic globalization. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
JAPAN: A PLEDGE TO RECOVERY -- Opening this year's session of Parliament, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi promised to put his recession-plagued country on the path to recovery and told lawmakers to make decisions quickly to combat Japan's problems. But he apologized for not being able to mention concrete measures. Less than a week ago Mr. Obuchi shuffled his Cabinet to form a conservative coalition. (AP)
 
CHINA: AN ECONOMIC WARNING -- China's financial system has weathered the Asian financial crisis but is threatened by a combination of internal and external factors, including bad debts and poor management, the official China Daily newspaper said. It said some Chinese financial institutions had skirted regulations and taken on too much risk in their investments. (Agence France-Presse)
 
KASHMIR: INDIA AND PAKISTAN CLASH -- Indian troops fought with Pakistani soldiers who tried to seize a military post high on a glacier in disputed Kashmir, killing four Pakistani soldiers, the Press Trust of India reported. The clash took place after nearly 20 Pakistani soldiers advanced toward Indian-held territory on the Siachen glacier, the news agency said, quoting an Indian military statement. (AP)
 
NORTH KOREA: ENVOY SAID TO SEEK ASYLUM -- A North Korean diplomat and his wife who disappeared in Berlin are seeking political asylum in the United States, The Korea Herald in South Korea reported. The envoy, Kim Kyong Pil, 54, was the second secretary in North Korea's representative office in Berlin. (Reuters)
 
PHILIPPINES: DEATH SENTENCE STANDS -- The Supreme Court ruled that the death sentence for a house painter convicted of raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter should be carried out in what will be the country's first execution since 1976. The ruling followed an overwhelming vote in the lower house of Parliament to retain capital punishment, which was abolished in 1987 but reinstated in 1994. (Reuters)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
YEMEN: KIDNAPPERS' DEMANDS -- Tribesmen in Yemen who have kidnapped two Britons and four Dutch nationals are demanding the release of a detained clansman, security officials said. They said the kidnappers are members of the Bakeel tribe and not Islamic militants, whose abduction last month of 16 Westerners ended in a shootout with soldiers that killed four hostages. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
SIERRA LEONE: FAMINE WARNING BY U.N. -- West African troops fighting rebels in Sierra Leone said they now controlled the port area of Freetown, which could make it easier for ships to deliver desperately needed food. Dozens of bodies, mostly of rebels, have been found in the capital. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warned that the depletion of food stocks could lead to famine in the devastated capital, where refugees have swollen the population to an estimated one million people. (Reuters)
 
CONGO: REBELS IGNORE WORD OF TRUCE -- Congolese rebels trying to topple President Laurent Kabila said they would not lay down their arms until Mr. Kabila meets them at the negotiating table. The rebels said they would pay little heed to a cease-fire commitment reached by five African nations that have sent troops into Congo to fight for either side. (AP)
 
LESOTHO: POLITICAL PACT BROKEN -- The fragile truce between Lesotho's Government and the opposition fractured when seven political parties walked out of a meeting of the interim political authority to protest worsening security in the kingdom. The walkout, by 14 members of the 24-member body set up to guide the volatile kingdom to elections, came after 50 soldiers facing charges of mutiny took control of the Maseru prison for several hours late Monday. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ZIMBABWE: REPORTER ARRESTED -- The police arrested a journalist who wrote about an alleged coup plot, a week after the army detained his editor over the report, a colleague at their weekly newspaper said. The colleague said Ray Choto, a reporter for the independent Standard, was taken to the central police station in Harare, the capital. (Reuters)
 
RWANDA: GENOCIDE PROSECUTIONS -- Rwandan courts last year tried 864 people accused of taking part in genocide in the central African country in 1994, said the supreme court's public prosecutor, Simeon Rwagasore. He gave no details of convictions or sentences handed down in the trials. (Agence France-Presse)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CUBA: RUSSIA SEEKS CLOSER TIES -- Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia told the visiting Cuban Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina, that Moscow wanted to increase ties with Havana, its cold-war ally. The Interfax news agency quoted Mr. Primakov as saying during the talks, "We have to draw closer." Cuba's special relationship, including a steady flow of financial aid from the Kremlin, ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but Russia remains a major trading partner. (Reuters)
 
GRENADA: GOVERNING PARTY WINS VOTE -- Supporters of the governing New National Party staged street parties to celebrate a clean sweep of Grenada's 15 parliamentary seats in general elections on Monday.

HEADLINE: Chief Regulator Of Futures To Step Down

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
Brooksley E. Born, the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said yesterday that she would step down from that post, ending a year of sharp public disagreements with other regulators and Clinton Administration officials over regulation of the financial derivatives markets.
The announcement came just a few months before President Clinton would have decided on whether to reappoint Ms. Born to a second five-year term. Administration officials say there was little expectation that she would have been reappointed because Ms. Born openly broke ranks with some of the Administration's top economic advisers -- including Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. The issue was her edging toward tighter regulation of the market in over-the-counter derivatives. 
 But Ms. Born, who was appointed by President Clinton in 1996 to oversee the commodity futures and options market, said yesterday that the debate over regulating the derivatives market did not play a role in her decision against seeking a second term. After careful consideration over the holidays, Ms. Born said, she had decided to return to her "true calling," the private practice of law.
"I don't think the controversy played any role," she said in a telephone interview. "The fact that Congress and the other financial regulators and a number of international organizations are now addressing the major issues posed by the over-the-counter derivatives market is very gratifying to me. It makes me feel as though these issues are being left in good hands."
The debate over whether the complex financial instruments known as derivatives ought to be more heavily regulated, though, clearly contributed to the criticism of Ms. Born. The global marketplace seems increasingly bent on deregulation, despite several high-profile disasters in the derivatives market, most recently the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund rescued in a federally orchestrated bailout by a consortium of Wall Street firms.
Last May, when Ms. Born issued a "concept release" seeking comment on the regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, the commission came under a barrage of criticism, from Wall Street officials who saw the attempt at tighter regulation as costly and cumbersome and from Washington officials who believed that the commission was overstepping its jurisdiction and creating legal uncertainties that could drive business offshore.
On the day the "concept release" was issued in May, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan; Treasury Secretary Rubin and Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, issued a joint statement saying that they had grave concerns about the commission's action.
Mark C. Brickell, a board member of the International Swaps and Derivatives Assocation, said that even though the commission action had educated Congress about the importance of derivatives activity, Wall Street officials were troubled by the move. "Regulations that make it harder to manage risk raise widespread concern," he said.
Ms. Born later said that she was not intent on creating regulatory burdens, but had simply been raising important questions, particularly about the need for more information for hedge funds and others that trade in the derivatives. Still, Congress and Treasury officials evidently thought otherwise.
Treasury officials lobbied Congress to pass legislation that would prevent the commission from regulating the over-the-counter derivatives market, which is now only loosely regulated through banks and brokerage firms. It is a huge multitrillion-dollar market that allows investors to manage a great deal of risk, and Administration officials said any move to increase regulation would weaken the market.
After public hearings, Congress blocked for six months any move by the commission to enact regulation of the over-the-counter market, where financial instruments like interest rate swaps are traded.
The last 12 months have been a volatile time for Ms. Born, 58, who was on the short list of those under consideration for Attorney General in late 1992, shortly after Bill Clinton was elected President.
But Ms. Born -- who sent a letter to the President yesterday stating that she would not seek a second term -- said that she did not feel any bitterness over the derivatives debate and that she had confidence the regulators would improve the market and protect the public interest.
Indeed, she said the "concept release" issued last May made more sense in light of Long-Term Capital's near-demise, which unnerved markets around the world.
"I think that Long-Term Capital Management vividly demonstrated to many people that the issues that had been raised in the concept release were important," she said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Index Hits a High, Eclipsing the Other Indicators

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A further advance in Internet and telecommunications shares helped push stock markets higher yesterday, even as analysts expressed fear about hefty valuations.
The rally in Internet and telecommunications stocks, fueled by the At Home Corporation's agreement to buy Excite Inc. in a deal valued at $6.7 billion and Vodafone Group P.L.C.'s $59.7 billion planned acquisition of Airtouch Communications Inc., helped to push the Nasdaq composite index to a new high. It closed above 2,400 for the first time. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderate, at 787 million shares. But 1.1 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq.
Other market averages, which bobbed for much of the session, rallied late and closed higher.
Helped by big gains in AT&T and I.B.M., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.67, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,355.22. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 8.74, or seven-tenths of a percent, to 1,252. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization companies did even better, rising 3.84, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 430.89.
But those gains were eclipsed by the Nasdaq composite, which jumped 59.97, or 2.5 percent, to 2,408.17. And Thestreet.com's index of 20 Internet companies rose 43.92, or 8.7 percent, to 548.29.
"The merger and acquisition news in the technology sector led the day," said Michael Clark, head of United States stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. "And the news provided a tremendous amount of support for the market."
Still, many analysts and traders said stocks were very richly priced, and due for a correction. Bad news from important foreign markets like Brazil or China could pound stocks, they said. And they said they are wary about what the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, may say about the stock market when he testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee today.
"The market has become such an economic driver that he has to say something," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore.
Worries about Brazil eased a bit yesterday, as the Brazilian Senate approved an important part of the Government's austerity package. For the day, Brazil's Bovespa stock index gained 3.8 percent.
Besides the merger announcements, expectations that Microsoft's profits for the quarter ended Dec. 31 would meet or exceed expectations were also an important part of yesterday's overall advance.
Microsoft rose 5 7/8, to 155 5/8. After the close of trading, the world's leading software company reported that it earned 73 cents a share during the period, 20 percent more than the highest estimate.
Three of the most venerable names in American capitalism -- AT&T, I.B.M. and General Motors -- were the Dow's biggest gainers. Gains in those stocks offset weakness among bank shares.
AT&T jumped 7 1/8, to 91 3/8. It will take control of At Home when its acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. is completed. TCI is At Home's largest shareholder.
I.B.M. gained 7 5/16, to 192 1/4, a record. General Motors rose 4 11/6, to 88.
Dow losers included American Express, which dropped 3 7/8, to 100 1/2, J. P. Morgan, which shed 2 13/16, to 105 15/16, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which lost 1 13/16, to 72 3/4.
At Home's announcement that it would pay 1.04 shares for each share of Excite, the second-biggest Internet directory company, caused a surge in the price of Excite and other Internet stocks. Excite leaped 42 1/2, to 110, a 57 percent increase.
Lycos Inc., the third-biggest directory, gained 25 1/16, to 112 15/16.

Bond Prices End Lower
By Bloomberg News
Bonds fell yesterday, reflecting expectations among investors that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, will quash hopes for an interest rate cut when he testifies before Congress today. Lower rates tend to improve bond prices.
The 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32, to a price of 101 19/32. Its yield, which rises when the price falls, advanced to 5.14 percent from 5.12.
Results of the Treasury's weekly auction of 3-month and 6-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.918	97.821	High Rate	4.28%	4.31%	Coupon Yield	4.39%	4.47%	Low Rate	4.20%	4.28%	Median Rate	4.25%	4.30%	Total applied for	$27,266,448	$29,383,316	Accepted	$11,256,075	$10,813,516	Noncompetitive	$1,186,614	$1,134,863

HEADLINE: Excite and At Home Confirm $6.7 Billion Merger

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
One company was started in the proverbial Silicon Valley garage. The other began as a play by some of the nation's biggest cable television interests. Yesterday, they joined forces in the race to capture Internet users and the dollars they are increasingly spending on line, and investors appeared to endorse the strategy.
The deal brought together Excite Inc., which has evolved from a simple search engine into the Internet's sixth most heavily trafficked site, and the At Home Corporation, a high-speed Internet service aimed at cable television subscribers, in what the two companies described as a merger. 
 The transaction, which involved issuing 1.04 shares in At Home for each share of Excite, was valued at $6.7 billion, making it the largest in the recent spate of consolidations among Internet companies.
The deal valued Excite at $106.27 a share, or a 57 percent premium over its closing price on Friday. In raising the stakes that high, At Home is hoping that it will be able to exploit Excite's position as one of the leading Internet destinations to attract subscribers to its own service.
And yesterday Wall Street seemed to share that vision. At Home ended trading at $115.375, up $13.375, while Excite closed at $110, up $42.50.
Analysts said the deal heralded another round of consolidation that would leave just a few major companies controlling both access to the Internet and the most heavily used content.
"At the end of the day we're going to have an oligopoly structure in terms of Internet media and access," said Alan Braverman, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. "In my mind one of the survivors will be the At Home camp, and this makes it all the more likely."
At Home's major shareholder, the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., is being acquired by the AT&T Corporation, which also markets Internet access through AT&T Worldnet. If the Excite deal goes through, the combined company's main competitor on the Internet front will be America Online, which in turn has announced plans to acquire the Netscape Communications Corporation.
The At Home-Excite deal also sets the stage for the battle shaping up around high-speed Internet access. About two million households will have high-speed connections by 2000, through either telephone lines or television cables, according to Forrester Research Inc.
America Online, the largest Internet service provider, with 15 million subscribers, last week announced a deal with the Bell Atlantic Corporation to provide high-speed access to some of its subscribers starting this summer. And this week, Snap, an Internet company part-owned by NBC, said it would offer a new service that takes advantage of the ability to provide higher-quality video and audio programming over high-speed connections to the Internet.
At Home has forged partnerships with cable providers that it says will eventually enable it to provide high-speed Internet access to 60 million homes. But largely because cable providers have been slow to make necessary upgrades to their systems, the At Home service is available to only 10 million homes, and only 330,000 have signed up for it. Cable modems attached to home computers operate at speeds 10 to 30 times faster than the telephone modems that most of the nation's 28 million Internet households rely on.
A key piece of the merger plan is to use Excite's current Internet presence to promote At Home's service. In November, according to the Internet measuring service Media Metrix, Excite had 14.2 million visitors to its site. About 20 million people have used Excite's My Excite feature to create a service that provides them with individualized information on favorite sports teams, stocks and news. Many of them have given the company permission to E-mail them material that might be of interest.
"We can take what we know about these people and intuit their income levels and imputed demographic profile and whether they are likely to want to sign up for broadband," George Bell, the chief executive of Excite, said. "That's a powerful method of cross-promotion."
At Home plans to use Excite's customer data base to recruit advertisers as well. Last year, Excite acquired Matchlogic, an advertising tracking firm, and it has been developing a plan to adapt its services to cable television, where a service provider like At Home knows far more about its customers -- including their addresses -- than most Web sites do.
"Probably the hidden gem of the whole deal is how we'll be able to implement their targeting and database technology to deliver advertising to the individual user," said At Home's chief executive, Tom Jermoluk.
In many ways the story of the deal reflects the struggle for control over the Internet by unknown start-ups and established media companies and the dizzying pace of the industry's evolution.
Excite, started in 1994 by a group of Stanford graduates in a garage and originally called Architext, was financed by the high-profile venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. In April 1996, the company went public, marketing itself as a search engine. Mutating with the market, it then turned itself into a so-called portal site, offering not only search capabilities but news, weather, stock quotes, free E-mail accounts and, of course, advertising. Although Excite's stock price has appreciated by almost 600 percent since its initial public offering, the company lost $39.6 million on income of $100 million in the September 1998 quarter.
At Home, though also backed by Kleiner Perkins, has very different origins. It was an effort by major cable companies -- Tele-Communications, Cox and Comcast -- to devise a high-bandwidth Web service and programming intended to be a selling point for cable modems.
Now they are next door to each other in Redwood City, Calif., with roughly the same number of employees and the same interior designer. Each company has a curvy red slide that employees may use to go from the third to the second floor.
"The only thing that separates us is a fountain," Mr. Jermoluk said. "And we're having a party there today."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Microsoft's Profit Up 75% In Quarter

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
Strong shipments of personal computers strengthened the second-quarter financial results of the Microsoft Corporation, which reported a 75 percent gain in earnings yesterday, far exceeding the most optimistic projections of Wall Street analysts.
But officials at Microsoft, the world's leading maker of personal computer software, remained cautious in their outlook, citing concerns about the uncertainty of corporate spending on solutions to the Year 2000 computer clock problem as well as continued financial crises in many foreign markets. 
 Microsoft reported its results after the stock market closed. In anticipation of a strong quarter, its shares rose $5.875, to close at $155.625, in Nasdaq trading. The good news sent Microsoft shares up further in after-hours trading, where they sold as high as $163.25.
Once again, Microsoft's financial performance eclipsed worries about the effects of the Justice Department's antitrust suit.
"It was classic Microsoft: Blow the numbers out and then tell everybody why you won't do it again this quarter," said Rick Sherlund of Goldman, Sachs. "The second half of calendar 1999 they didn't say anything about because they really don't know. That's the tougher call."
Analysts have grown accustomed to Microsoft's pattern of greatly exceeding its quarterly estimates, only to have the company's executives offer a sobering outlook based on perceived threats to its continued prosperity. Those executives attributed the second quarter's strong performance to what was for some people an unexpected surge in personal computer sales, which in turn drove sales of the Windows 98 and Windows NT operating systems.
"Reports of the death of the PC turned out to be greatly exaggerated," Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with securities analysts from headquarters in Redmond, Wash. He noted that in October, when many predicted a slowdown, Microsoft, rather than offering its usual gloom, forecast strong growth. "However, results also spiked due in part to demand caused by Year 2000 concerns," he said.
"We remain guarded about growth in 1999," Mr. Maffei said. In the current quarter, he said, it seems likely that revenue will decline by at least $300 million from the one being reported yesterday. Although Microsoft's operating earnings will be up 25 percent year over year, and analysts' current estimates are 2 or 3 cents short, Mr. Maffei said earnings will be down compared with the second quarter.
"That's his guidance," Mr. Sherlund remarked. "Whether we want to follow it is another question. They certainly are steering the Street toward slower growth."
For the quarter ending on Dec. 31, Microsoft reported earnings of $1.98 billion, or 73 cents a diluted share, up 75 percent from $1.13 billion, or 42 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenue rose nearly 38 percent, to $4.94 billion, over the $3.585 billion reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 1998.
Analysts had expected Microsoft to earn 59 cents a share, according to First Call.
Unearned revenue, the portion of sales Microsoft sets aside to reflect the long-term use of many of its products, grew to $3.37 billion, from $3.13 billion in the first fiscal quarter.
On a cautionary note, Mr. Maffei said that conditions in Asia, Latin America and Russia remained tough, and that the company did not see a timely end to the difficulty in those markets. "We're talking about a whole segment of the globe," he said. "It's a strange situation. The developing countries are growing slowest while the mature markets, like the U.S., are growing fastest," he said. "Obviously it can't continue, but we don't see how it will end."

The year-earlier share earnings are restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split in February 1998.
The company attributed the latest second-quarter earnings to strong growth in personal computer shipments, demand for products such as the Windows NT server and the Windows NT work station, server applications and Office 97, and demand caused by Year 2000 concerns.
Microsoft's results are for the second fiscal quarter.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION;
Clinton Outlines His Vision for Nation's Transition to the 21st Century

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The following is the prepared text of President Clinton's State of the Union address to Congress tonight, as provided by the White House:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans: 
 Tonight, I have the honor of reporting on the State of the Union.
Let me begin by saluting the new Speaker of the House, and thanking him for extending invitations to two special guests who are sitting in the gallery with Mrs. Hastert. Lyn Gibson and Wenling Chestnut are the widows of the two brave Capitol police officers who gave their lives to defend freedom's house.
I stand before you to report that America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history -- with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest homeownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years -- and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957.
For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 billion last year. We are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years.
Violent crime is the lowest in a quarter century. Our environment is the cleanest in a quarter century.
America is a strong force for peace from Northern Ireland, to Bosnia, to the Middle East.
Thanks to the pioneering leadership of Vice President Gore, we have a government for the Information Age. Once again, our Government is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our oldest values: opportunity, responsibility, community. A modern government, devoted to fiscal responsibility and determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives. A 21st Century government for 21st Century America.
My fellow Americans, I stand before you to report that the state of our union is strong.
America is working again. The promise of our future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a nation far into the 21st Century depends upon what we do as a nation today.
So with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st Century. Let's get to work.
 
Aging of 21st-Century America
Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge: the aging of America.
With the number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030, the Baby Boom will become a Senior Boom.
So first and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st Century.
Early in this century, being old meant being poor. When President Roosevelt created Social Security, thousands wrote to thank him for eliminating what one woman called the "stark terror of penniless, helpless old age." Even today, without Social Security, half our nation's elderly would be forced into poverty.
Today, Social Security is strong. But by 2013, payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments. And by 2032, the Trust Fund will be exhausted, and Social Security will be unable to pay out the full benefits older Americans have been promised.
The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is not to make drastic cuts in benefits; not to raise payroll tax rates; and not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of saving it.
Instead, I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save Social Security.
Specifically, I propose that we commit sixty percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in the private sector just as any private or state government pension would do. This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55 years.
But we must aim higher. We should put Social Security on a sound footing for the next 75 years. And we should reduce poverty among elderly women, who are nearly twice as likely to be poor as other seniors -- and we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn.
These changes will require difficult but fully achievable choices. They must be made on a bipartisan basis. They should be made this year. I reach out my hand to those of you of both parties in both houses and ask you to join me in saying: We will Save Social Security now.
Last year, we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we should not spend any of it until after Social Security is truly saved. First things first.
Second, once we have saved Social Security, we must fulfill our obligation to save and improve Medicare. Already, we have extended the life of Medicare by 10 years -- but we should extend it for at least another decade. Tonight I propose that we use one out of every six dollars in the surplus over the next 15 years to guarantee the soundness of Medicare until the year 2020.
But again, we should aim higher. We must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report of the bipartisan Medicare commission. If we work together, we can secure Medicare for the next two decades and cover seniors' greatest need -- affordable prescription drugs.
Third, we must help all Americans, from their first day on the job, to save, to invest, to create wealth. From its beginning, Americans have supplemented Social Security with private pensions and savings. Yet today, millions of people retire with little to live on other than Social Security. Americans living longer than ever must save more than ever.
Therefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st Century. I propose that we use 11% of the surplus to establish Universal Savings Accounts -- U.S.A. Accounts -- to give all Americans the means to save. With these new accounts, Americans can invest as they choose, and receive funds to match a portion of their savings, with extra help for those least able to save.
U.S.A. Accounts will help all Americans to share in our nation's wealth, and to enjoy a more secure retirement.
Fourth, we must invest in long-term care. I propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled and the families who care for them. Long term care will become a bigger and bigger challenge with the aging of America -- and we must help our families deal with it.
I was born in 1946, the first year of the Baby Boom. I can tell you: Our generation is determined not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren. Our economic success and fiscal discipline now give us the opportunity to lift that burden.
Saving Social Security and Medicare is the right way to use the surplus. If we do so, we will still have the resources to meet urgent national needs in education and defense. And this plan is fiscally sound. And listen to this: By saving the money we need to save Social Security and Medicare, then within fifteen years we will achieve the lowest level of publicly held debt since 1917.
With these four measures -- saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, establishing U.S.A. Accounts, and supporting long-term care -- we can begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st Century seniors.
 
21st-Century Schools
There are more children, from more diverse backgrounds, in our public schools than at any time in our history. Their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our nation to thrive in the new economy.
Today we can say something we could not say six years ago: with more affordable student loans, more Pell grants and work-study jobs, education I.R.A.'s, a lifetime learning tax credit for junior and senior year of college, and the new HOPE Scholarship tax cut that more than 5 million Americans will receive this year, we have opened the doors of college to all.
With our help, nearly every state has set higher academic standards for public schools, and a voluntary national test is being developed to measure the progress of our students. With over $1 billion in discounts available this year, we are on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom and library to the Internet.
Last fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. Now I ask you to finish the job.
Our children are doing better. S.A.T. scores are up. Math scores have risen in nearly all grades. But there is a problem: While our fourth graders outperform their peers in other countries in math and science, our eighth graders are around average, and our twelfth graders rank near the bottom.
We must do better. Each year the national Government invests more than $15 billion in our public schools. I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting what doesn't.
Later this year, I will send Congress a plan that for the first time holds states and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results. My Education Accountability Act will require every school district receiving Federal help to take the following five steps:
*First, all schools must end social promotion.
No child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she can't read. We do our children no favors when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without mastering the material.
But we can't just hold students back when the system fails them. So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and after-school programs. We can keep 1 million students learning beyond regular school hours, when parents work and juvenile crime soars.
If you doubt this will work, look at Chicago, which ended social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who don't master the basics. Math and reading scores are up three years running, with some of the biggest gains in some of the poorest neighborhoods.
*Second, all states and school districts must turn around their worst performing schools or shut them down. That is the policy established by Gov. Jim Hunt in North Carolina, where test scores made the biggest gains in the nation last year. My budget includes $200 million to help states turn around their failing schools.
*Third, all states and school districts must be held responsible for the quality of their teachers. The great majority of teachers do a fine job. But in too many schools, teachers don't have college majors, or even minors, in the subjects they teach.
New teachers should be required to pass performance exams. All teachers should know the subjects they are teaching. My balanced budget contains new resources to help them reach higher standards.
To attract talented young teachers to the toughest assignments, I recommend a sixfold increase in scholarships for college students who commit to teach in the inner cities, isolated rural areas and Indian communities.
*Fourth, we must empower parents with more information and more choices. In too many communities, it is easier to get information on the quality of the local restaurants than on the quality of the local schools. Every school district should issue report cards on every school.
And parents should have more choice in selecting their public schools. When I became President, there was one independent, public charter school in all of America. With our support, there are 1,100 today. My budget assures that early in the next century, there will be 3,000.
*Fifth, to insure that our classrooms are truly places of learning, all states and school districts must adopt and implement discipline policies.
Now, let's do one more thing for our children. Today, too many of our schools are so old they're falling apart, or so overcrowded students must learn in trailers.
Last fall, Congress missed the opportunity to change that. This year, with 53 million children in our schools, Congress must not miss that opportunity again. I ask you to help our communities build or modernize 5,000 schools.
If we do these things -- end social promotion, turn around failing schools, build modern ones, support qualified teachers, promote innovation, competition and discipline -- we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to create 21st century schools.
 
Support for American Families
We must do more to help the millions of parents who give their all every day at home and at work.
The most basic tool of all is a decent income. Let's raise the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years.
And let's make sure women and men get equal pay for equal work by strengthening enforcement of equal pay laws.
Working parents also need quality child care. Again, I ask Congress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working families, improved safety and quality, and expanded after-school programs. Our plan also includes a new tax credit for stay-at-home parents. They need support, too.
The Family Medical Leave Act, the first bill I signed into law, has helped millions of Americans care for a new baby or an ailing relative without risking their jobs. We should extend family leave to 10 million more Americans working in smaller companies.
Parents should never face discrimination in the workplace. I will ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have children.
America's families deserve the world's best medical care.
Thanks to bipartisan Federal support for medical research, we are on the verge of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's, from arthritis to cancer.
As we continue our advances in medical science, we cannot let our health care system lag behind.
Managed care has transformed medicine in America, driving down costs but threatening to drive down quality as well. I say to every American: You should have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. You should have the right to see a specialist. You should have the right to emergency care. You should have the right to continuity of care, to keep your doctor during a pregnancy or chemotherapy or some other treatment.
I have ordered that these rights be extended to the 85 million Americans served by Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health plans. But only Congress can enact the Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans in all health plans. Last year Congress missed that opportunity. This year for the sake of our families Congress must not miss that opportunity again. Pass the Patients' Bill of Rights.
There's one more right you should have. As more of our medical records are stored electronically, the threats to our privacy increase. Because Congress has given me the authority to act if it does not do so by August, one way or another, we will protect the privacy of medical records this year.
Two years ago, we acted to extend health coverage to up to 5 million children. Now, we should make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance, and to give people between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into Medicare.
No one should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job. We should pass the landmark bipartisan legislation, proposed by Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Roth and Moynihan, to allow people with disabilities to keep health insurance when they go to work.
We need to enable public hospitals, and community and university health centers, to provide basic, affordable care for working families without insurance. My balanced budget makes a down payment toward that goal.
We must continue to ensure access to family planning.
And we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental illness. No American should ever be afraid to address this disease. This year, we will host a White House Conference on Mental Health. With sensitivity and commitment, Tipper Gore is leading our efforts here, and I thank her.
As everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes. I ask this Congress to resist the tobacco lobby. Together, let's reaffirm the F.D.A.'s authority to protect children from tobacco, hold the tobacco companies accountable, and protect tobacco farmers.
If we act in these areas -- minimum wage, family leave, child care, health care and the safety of our children -- we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to strengthen our families for the 21st century.
 
A 21st-Century Economy
Today, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job creating economy in history.
But we can do even better -- in building a 21st century economy for all Americans.
Today's income gap is largely a skills gap. Last year, Congress passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the training they need. This year, I recommend a five-year commitment in this new system so that we can provide that training for all Americans who lose their jobs, and rapid response teams to help towns where factories have closed. And I ask for a dramatic increase in Federal support for adult literacy so we can mount a national campaign aimed at millions of working people who read at less than a fifth-grade level.
In the past six years, we have cut the welfare rolls nearly in half. Two years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight, our Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people. Our balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the dignity and pride of work.
We must bring the spark of private enterprise to every community in America -- to inner cities and remote rural areas -- with more support for community development banks, empowerment zones and 100,000 vouchers for affordable housing. And I ask Congress to support our bold plan to help businesses raise up to $15 billion of private sector capital to bring jobs and opportunity to our inner cities and rural areas, with tax credits and loan guarantees, including new American Private Investment Companies modeled on our Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Our greatest untapped markets are not overseas, they are right here at home.
We must bring prosperity back to the family farm. Dropping prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many family farmers. I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to create a farm safety net including crop insurance reform and farm income assistance.
We must strengthen our lead in technology.
Government investment led to the creation of the Internet. I propose a nearly 30 percent increase in long-term computing research.
We must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment, by solving the "Y2K" computer problem. If we work hard with state and local governments and businesses large and small, the "Y2K problem" can be remembered as the last headache of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st.
For our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad.
Until recently, one third of our economic growth came from exports. But over the past year and a half, financial turmoil overseas has put that growth at risk. Today, much of the world is in recession, with Asia hit especially hard.
This is the most serious financial crisis in a half-century. To meet it, the U.S. and other nations have reduced interest rates and strengthened the International Monetary Fund. While the turmoil is not over, we are working with other industrial nations to contain it.
At the same time, we will continue to work on a global basis to build a financial system for the 21st Century that promotes prosperity and tames the cycles of boom and bust. This June, I will meet with other world leaders to advance this historic purpose.
We must also create a freer and fairer trading system for the 21st Century. Trade has divided Americans for too long. We must find the common ground on which business, workers, environmentalists, farmers and government can stand together.
We must tear down barriers, open markets, and expand trade. At the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all countries benefit from trade -- trade that promotes the dignity of work, the rights of workers, the protection of the environment. And we must insist that international trade organizations be open to public scrutiny.
We must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our nation. I have already informed the Government of Japan that if that nation's sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed, America will respond.
And we must act to help all American manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis -- with loan guarantees and other incentives to increase U.S. exports by nearly $2 billion.
We can achieve a new consensus on trade, based on these principles. I ask Congress to join me in this common approach and give the President the trade authority long used to advance our prosperity.
This year, we should expand trade with our neighbors in Central America and the Caribbean. And because trade and investment are the keys to African development -- we must finally pass the African Growth and Opportunity Act.
And tonight, I also issue a call to the nations of the world to join the United States in a new round of global negotiations to expand exports of services, of manufactures, and most of all, farm products.
We will work with the International Labor Organization on a new initiative to lift up labor standards around the world. And this year, we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world.
If we do these things -- invest in our people, our communities, and our technology, and lead in the global economy -- then we will begin to meet the historic responsibility of our generation to build a 21st Century prosperity for America.
 
A Strong America in a New World
No nation in history has had the opportunity and the responsibility we now have to shape a world more peaceful, secure and free.
All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in Northern Ireland.
All Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on the path to peace. And with our NATO allies, we are pressing the Serbian Government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice, and give the people of Kosovo the self-government they deserve.
All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting peace in the Middle East. Some of you were with me in December as we watched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for the destruction of Israel. I ask Congress to provide resources to implement the Wye Agreement ---- to protect Israel's security, stimulate the Palestinian economy, and support our friends in Jordan. We must not, we dare not, let them down.
As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our nation's security -- including increased dangers from outlaw nations and terrorism. We will defend our security wherever we are threatened -- as we did this summer when we struck at Osama bin Laden's network of terror. The bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us of the risks faced every day by those who represent America to the world. Let's give them our support, the safest possible workplaces, and the resources they need so America can continue to lead.
We will work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks, to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergencies, and to support research into vaccines and treatments.
We must increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles, from North Korea to India and Pakistan.
We must expand our work with Russia, Ukraine, and the other former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology so they never fall into the wrong hands. My balanced budget will increase funding for these critical efforts by almost two-thirds over the next 5 years.
With Russia, we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals. The START II treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for START III could cut them by 80 percent from their Cold War height.
It has been two years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If we don't do the right thing, other nations won't either. I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the Treaty now, so we can make it harder for other nations to develop nuclear arms -- and we can end nuclear testing forever.
For nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligation to destroy its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them. America will continue to contain Saddam -- and we will work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people.
Last month, in our action over Iraq, our troops were superb. Their mission was so flawlessly executed, we risk taking for granted the bravery and skill it required. Capt. Jeff Taliaferro, a 10-year Air Force veteran, flew a B-1B bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war machine. He is here with us tonight. Let us honor him and all the 33,000 men and women of Desert Fox.
It is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in 1985. Since April, together we have added nearly $6 billion to maintain our readiness. My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over the next six years for readiness and modernization, and pay and benefits for our troops.
We are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented by millions of veterans. America's defenders today stand ready at a moment's notice to go where comforts are few and dangers are many, doing what needs to be done as no one else can. They always come through for America. We must come through for them.
The new century demands new partnerships for peace and security.
The United Nations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing burdens America might otherwise bear alone. America needs a strong and effective U.N. I want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our debts.
We must support security in Europe and Asia -- expanding NATO and defining its new missions at its 50th Anniversary summit this year in Washington, maintaining our alliance with Japan and Korea, and our other Asian allies, and engaging China.
In China, I said to the leaders and people what I say again tonight: Stability can no longer be bought at the expense of liberty.
And I say again the American people: It is important not to isolate China. The more we bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change and freedom to China.
Last spring, with some of you, I traveled to Africa, where I saw democracy and reform rising, but still held back by violence and disease. We must fortify African democracy and peace -- and support the transition to democracy now beginning to take hold in Nigeria.
We are strengthening our ties to the Americas -- to educate children, fight drugs, deepen democracy. And to increase shared prosperity, we will work to launch a Free Trade Area of the Americas.
In this hemisphere, every government but one is freely chosen by its people. We are determined that Cuba, too, will know the blessings of liberty.
The American people have opened their arms and their hearts to our Central American and Caribbean neighbors devastated by recent hurricanes. Working with Congress, we will help them rebuild. When the First Lady and Tipper Gore visited the region, they saw thousands of American troops and volunteers. In the Dominican Republic, Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by Dominicans and Americans, working side by side.
With her was someone who has been very important to the relief efforts.
Sports records are made, and sooner or later, they are broken. But making other people's lives better -- and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood -- that's something that lasts forever. So for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you are a hero of two countries.
If we do all these things -- pursue peace, fight terrorism, increase our strength, and renew our alliances -- then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st Century America in a freer, more peaceful world.
 
21st-Century Communities
As the world has changed, so have our own communities. We must make them safer, more livable, more united.
This year, we will reach our goal of 100,000 community police officers, ahead of schedule and under budget. The Brady Bill has stopped a quarter million felons, fugitives and stalkers from buying handguns. Now, the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years, and the crime rate has dropped for six straight years.
Tonight, I propose a 21st-century crime bill to deploy the latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer.
My balanced budget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the beat in the areas hardest hit by crime, and to equip them with new tools, from crime-mapping computers to digital mug shots.
We must break the deadly cycle of drugs and crime. My budget expands support for drug testing and treatment. It says to prisoners: if you stay on drugs, you stay behind bars. And it says to those on parole: to keep your freedom, keep free of drugs.
Congress should restore the five-day waiting period for buying a handgun. And you should extend the Brady Bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes from buying a gun.
We must keep our schools the safest places in our communities.
Last year, we were horrified and heartbroken by the tragic killings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield. We are deeply moved by the courageous parents who are working to keep guns out of the hands of children, so that other parents don't have to live through their loss.
One of them is Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Ark. After she lost her daughter, she came to the White House with a powerful plea: "Please, please, for the sake of your children, lock up your guns. Don't let what happened in Jonesboro happen in your town."
She is here tonight with the First Lady, and we thank her for her courage and commitment. In memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence, let's strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free School Act. Let's pass legislation to require child trigger locks. Let's keep our children safe.
A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt defined our "great, central task" as "leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us."
Today, we are restoring the Florida Everglades, saving Yellowstone, preserving the red-rock canyons of Utah, protecting California's redwoods and our precious coasts.
But our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming; 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded. Last year's heat waves, ice storms and floods are but a hint of what future generations may endure if we don't act now.
So tonight, I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce pollution, and tax incentives and investments to spur clean energy technologies. And I will work with Congress to reward companies that take early, voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gases.
All communities face a preservation challenge, as they grow and green space shrinks. Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are lost every day.
In response, I propose two major initiatives: first, a $1 billion "Livability Agenda" to help communities save open space, ease traffic congestion and grow in ways that enhance every citizen's quality of life; second, a $1 billion "Lands Legacy Initiative" to preserve places of natural beauty all across America, from the most remote wilderness to the nearest city park. I thank Vice President Gore for his visionary leadership in helping to develop these historic proposals.
To get the most out of your community, you have to give something back. That's why we created Americorps, our national service program that gives today's generation a chance to serve their communities and earn money for college.
So far, in just four years, 100,000 young people have built low-income homes with Habitat for Humanity, helped tutor children, worked with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters and performed countless other acts of service that have made America better.
Some of them are here with us tonight. I thank them for their service, and I ask Congress to give more young Americans the chance to follow their lead.
We must work to renew our national community for the 21st century.
Last year, the House passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation sponsored by Representatives Shays and Meehan and Senators McCain and Feingold. But a partisan minority in the Senate blocked reform. To the House I say: pass it again, quickly. And to the Senate: say yes to a strong democracy in the year 2000.
Since 1997, our initiative on race has sought to bridge the divides between our people. In its report last fall, the initiative's advisory board found that Americans want to bring our people together across racial lines, but that we must do more to close the opportunity gaps that remain. The economic, health care and education initiatives in my balanced budget will do a lot to close those gaps.
But we have more to do.
Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or gender, disability or sexual orientation, is wrong. It should be illegal. Therefore I call upon Congress to make the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and the Hate Crimes Prevention Act the law of the land.
And since every person must count in America, our census must count every American. Let's have a census that uses the most modern scientific methods.
Our newest immigrants must be part of one America. They are revitalizing our cities, energizing our culture, building our new economy. We have a responsibility to make immigrants welcome here, and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life.
That means learning English, and learning about our democratic system of government. There are now long waiting lines of immigrants seeking to do just that. Therefore, my budget expands significantly our efforts to help them meet their responsibility.
Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower or on slave ships, whether they landed on Ellis Island or at Los Angeles Airport, whether they arrived yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago, we can be, and we must be, one America. We can only meet our generation's historic responsibility to go forward into the 21st century if we go forward as that one America.
 
The Millennium
You Know, Barely more than 300 days from now, we will cross that bridge into the new millennium. This is a moment, as the First Lady has said, to honor the past and imagine the future.
I honor her, for leading our millennium project, for all she has done for our children and for her historic role in serving our nation and advancing our ideals at home and abroad.
Last year, I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the millennium by saving America's treasures. Hillary has traveled across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like Thomas Edison's invention factory and Harriet Tubman's home.
We must preserve our treasures in every community. I invite every American town, city and county to become nationally recognized "millennium communities" by launching projects that save our history, promote the arts and humanities, and prepare our children for the 21st century.
Already, the response has been remarkable, and I thank Congress and our private sector partners for their support. Because of you, "The Star-Spangled Banner" will be preserved for the ages.
In ways large and small, we are keeping alive what George Washington called "the sacred fire of liberty."
Six years ago tomorrow, I came to office in a time of doubt for America, with our economy troubled, our deficit high, our people divided. Some even wondered whether our best days were behind us. But across this nation, in a thousand neighborhoods, I had seen, even amid the pain and uncertainty of recession, the heart and character of America.
I knew then we Americans could renew our country.
Tonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union Message of the 20th century, no one can doubt the enduring resolve and boundless capacity of Americans to work toward that "more perfect union" of our founders' dreams.
We near the end of a century when generation after generation of Americans answered the call to greatness, overcoming Depression, lifting up the dispossessed, bringing down barriers of racial prejudice, building the largest middle class in history, winning two World Wars and the "long twilight struggle" of the Cold War.
We are profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievement of our forebears.
Perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of controversy, we do not see our own time for what it truly is -- a new dawn for America.
A hundred years from tonight, an American President will stand in this place to report on the state of the union. He, or she, will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now.
Let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time, but of their time; that we reached as high as our ideals; that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness; that we joined together to serve and strengthen the country we love.
My fellow Americans, this is our moment. Let us lift our eyes as one nation, and from the mountaintop of this American century, look ahead to the next one, asking God's blessing on our endeavors and our beloved country.
 Thank You and Good Evening.

Angolans Fear Forced Service
Now that the war in Angola has again grown so fierce that the United Nations is on the verge of abandoning its peace observer mission and the warring armies remain short of personnel, the fear of being kidnapped to serve in the army is once more very real.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Historic Tower Near Wall Street Spruces Up for Its New Tenant

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
When a new owner took over the landmarked building at 20 Exchange Place in the heart of the financial district in late 1997, it faced an immediate decision: Convert the building to residential use? Or find a hotel operator for the vacant lower floors and keep the mostly occupied tower section as an office building?
It is a sign of the improved leasing picture downtown that the 54-story building has found a major office tenant for 5 of the vacant floors in the 18-story base. Accordingly, the building has embarked on a $25 million improvement program to restore it to a status in keeping with its history. 
 The tenant is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, taking 130,000 square feet on the fourth through the eighth floors, with Mark A. Jaccom of Julien J. Studley as its broker. The space accounts for about a third of the 400,000 square feet that Cushman & Wakefield is leasing out on the base floors for the building's new owner, a partnership of the Witkoff Group and Kamran Hakim, a Manhattan-based owner of residential and commercial properties.
With the reconstruction just getting under way, the F.D.I.C.'s regional office is to arrive in August with its staff of 245 from the Republic National Bank building, 452 Fifth Avenue at 39th Street. "We'll be getting a Class A building," said Michael L. Rubin, the F.D.I.C.'s associate director for administration.
The lease is indicative of the type that several downtown buildings are now seeking in order to continue filling vacant office space. Colliers ABR, the real estate firm, calculates that 8.5 million square feet of space in blocks of 100,000 square feet or more is on the market downtown, contributing significantly to the overall vacancy rate of 9 percent.
That vacancy rate, covering buildings designated Class A and Class B, is the lowest since the middle 1980's, largely the result of a pack of big leases last year. Among these were leases to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Guardian Insurance, Goldman Sachs, J & H Marsh & McLennan and the New York City Housing Authority. The downtown vacancy rate was 13 percent at this time a year ago, Colliers ABR said.
Relative to midtown, however, there is still enough available space to offer large tenants a rent differential of $10 a square feet a year or more over similar midtown space, brokers report. The incentive tempts midtown tenants like the F.D.I.C., as long as the downtown location is also suitable for other reasons. If a tenant is leasing, say, four 25,000-square-foot floors, a $10-a-square-foot differential saves $1 million a year in rent.
The rental picture in the 27-story tower part of 20 Exchange Place, with floors of about 5,000 square feet, is entirely different. There the occupancy is 94 percent, the management says, but many tenants face much higher rents as leases come due over the next five years. In a building that has seen little new investment for many years, most tower tenants now pay about $22 to $25 a square foot per year, said Adam I. Popper, a Witkoff Group managing director.
Small new arrivals like Otus Ltd., a softwear developer that took half the 41st floor, and Worldwide Weather Trading Company, on the entire 33d floor, are already paying about $35 a square foot, Mr. Popper said.
The building sits on the triangularly shaped block bounded by Exchange Place, William Street, Beaver Street and Hanover Street. The site for a proposed new New York Stock Exchange lies diagonally across Exchange Place to the northwest. Frank A. Cento, the leasing director for Cushman & Wakefield, noted that 20 Exchange Place was built with four street entrances facing different directions, enabling major users to have their own private entrance if they chose.
The granite and limestone building was designed by the firm of Cross & Cross as the City Bank-Farmers Trust Company building, after the merger of National City Bank, forerunner of today's Citibank, and Farmers Loan & Trust Company in 1929. At the time, National City Bank's headquarters were across the street at 55 Wall, and Farmers Loan owned property on the Exchange Place block.
Instead of demolishing 55 Wall and building a new tower, National City acquired the full Exchange Place block for a new building, and connected it to 55 Wall with a pedestrian bridge, no longer in existence.
At one time Citibank occupied about 75 percent of the space in 20 Exchange Place, said Robert Cicciari, who started working in the building in 1968 and became its manager in 1979. It was sold that year to a Dutch pension fund, and was the home of tenants like Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Lehman Brothers, Kidder Peabody and First Boston, before the institutional consolidations and downtown departures of the late 80's and early 90's.
Now, 20 Exchange Place is a prime example of the type of property that the Witkoff Group has specialized in buying and revitalizing over the last few years. Witkoff has assumed owner-management of 14 Manhattan office properties with 6.5 million square feet office space since 1995, including the former Daily News building, at 220 East 42d Street, and the Woolworth Building, at 233 Broadway. Nearly all these properties had substantial vacancies or major leases coming due shortly after the acquisitions.
Successfully leasing out the space depends on buying it at a price low enough to enable the owner to provide good improvements at a rent acceptable to a major tenant. At the Daily News building, Witkoff found the Omnicom Group to take 300,000 square feet; at 33 Maiden Lane it found the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also for 300,000 square feet.
"At the prices I was paying at the time," said Steven C. Witkoff, president of the Witkoff Group, "I wish I could have bought more."

HEADLINE: New York Life Insurance Won't Go Public, for Now

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
The New York Life Insurance Company will announce today that unlike several other industry leaders it has decided not to change its corporate structure to enable it to issue publicly traded shares.
Executives of the company, a mutual insurance concern formally owned by its policyholders, had been debating the structure of the company since this summer, when the New York Legislature rejected a hybrid corporate form. New York Life had advocated the hybrid, which would have allowed the sale of stock while the company remained under the technical control of policyholders. 
 The other leading advocate of the hybrid structure, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, announced in November that it was converting to public ownership, so Bill Werfelman, a New York Life spokesman, said the company "felt it was important to let people know what we were going to do."
Several analysts said they believed one reason for the decision not to go public was that New York Life -- which, by some calculations, has been reporting below industry returns on capital -- was concerned it might be taken over or be forced by investors to reorganize. Under the hybrid structure, a takeover would have been impossible.
"There's no question that a powerful, strong company like New York Life with the cash flow it has, its market position and distribution system would be a very interesting candidate for a company that might want to have a strong position in the life industry," said Sy Sternberg, New York Life's chief executive, in an interview yesterday from San Francisco where his board was meeting.
But he said the main reasons he recommended to the board that the company's structure remain unchanged, and won its unanimous endorsement in a vote Monday morning, was that he believes in the mutual concept. That allows policyholders to receive dividends that reduce the cost of their coverage and have a stake in the company. He also believes that New York Life has enough cash -- at least $3 billion -- to carry out its acquisition plans.
Other big mutual insurers that are shifting to public ownership besides Metropolitan -- the Prudential Insurance Company of America and the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, for example -- have said they are doing so to have shares that they can use to buy other companies, thus gaining market share and economies of scale.
Though Mr. Sternberg spoke of "an intangible value" in mutual ownership, many in the insurance business say there seems to be little practical distinction these days for policyholders between mutual and shareholder companies. Because of competitive pressures, they say, prices for coverage are very similar.
Many in the industry consider it inevitable that mutual companies shift to public ownership. And some analysts said they believed Mr. Sternberg might simply be postponing such a change to give himself breathing room to increase New York Life's returns, which would lead to a higher stock price should it go public, and provide protection against unwanted changes.
Mr. Sternberg said the company would periodically reconsider going public, but said he had "not concluded that eventually" it must do so.
Duff & Phelps in Chicago said that New York Life had been reporting returns below the 5.9 percent average of all mutual life insurers. Mr. Sternberg said his company's returns had been slightly above average. But they were still well below Duff & Phelps's calculated average return of 12.5 percent for publicly held life insurance companies.
"If your return on capital is mediocre, it makes no sense to convert to a shareholder-based ownership because it opens you up to the possibility that someone will come in and buy up your stock at a depressed price and force management changes," said Cathy Seifert, an analyst for the equity research group at Standard & Poor's.
Another prospect, she said, is that an efficient competitor would buy the company outright, sensing a bargain in the low stock price and expecting to transfer the efficiency of his company to the one being acquired.
None of the recently converted mutual companies have been taken over. But the field of potential buyers may increase sharply. Mr. Sternberg noted that Congress was once again considering the elimination of Depression-era restrictions that would permit "a bank, a securities firm or one of the larger global companies" to buy an insurance company.

HEADLINE: Bush Blends Optimism and Challenge in Texas Inaugural

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 19

 BODY:
Replaying the themes of unity, optimism and social responsibility that fueled his landslide re-election victory two months ago, George W. Bush was inaugurated as Governor of the nation's second-largest state today in a sun-warmed ceremony on the south promenade of Texas's red granite Capitol.
"The 21st century will be one of great opportunity," he told the crowd. "Our economy will be strong, so long as we pursue free markets, free trade, low taxes and limited government." 
 Governor's Bush's position as the presumptive front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2000 -- a race he has not yet entered -- was never mentioned during the daylong ceremonies. But there were moments -- when he spoke of how the lessons learned in Texas might apply to the entire country -- in which he seemed to be reaching for this larger audience.
"Texans can show America how to unite around issues that are larger than race or party," Mr. Bush said in his brief address.
The day began foggy and chill, and the dew still coated the Capitol's south lawn as the noon ceremony approached and the expectant crowd pushed against the white picket barricade around the base of the inaugural stage. As the Texas A&M band struck up "The Star Spangled Banner" and four F-16's roared overhead, the wind lost its chill and a bright sun began to push through the fracturing clouds.
Entering the platform beneath a canopy of raised swords, Governor Bush was joined by his wife, Laura, their twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna, and most of the rest of his family, including his parents, the former President and First Lady, and all of his four siblings save for Jeb, the new Governor of Florida, who was represented by his wife.
A private morning church service began the day's ceremonies. After the inaugural, a barbecue on the Capitol grounds perfumed the air with the mesquite smoke of 850 pieces of brisket and 5,000 pounds of sausage, turkey and ham. Midafternoon brought the traditional parade up Congress Avenue, and four inaugural balls ushered in the evening.
The Governor had that his inaugural speech would be short on legislative specifics and dwell, instead, on his vision for the state. The spine of his message was that the economy was doing very well, and was likely to continue to do so, but that this was not enough.
"I am optimistic our children's lives will continue to improve in material terms," he said. "The risk is that their moral and spiritual lives will not improve."
Mr. Bush urged families, communities and religious leaders to draw "a clear line between right and wrong," and said it was the responsibility of political leaders, public schools and public institutions to support this effort.
"Government can't solve all our problems," he said. "Economic growth can't solve all our problems. In fact, we're now putting too much hope in economics, just as we once put too much hope in government."
It was a difficult day for Democrats in Austin. For the first time since the Civil War, the party did not have a single statewide official to celebrate. Governor Bush's coattails led to a Republican sweep of the state offices in November.
Inaugurated as Lieutenant Governor today was Rick Perry, a social conservative and former agriculture commissioner.
Neither the impeachment proceedings in Washington nor the impending State of the Union speech by President Clinton were referred to during the inaugural ceremony, but there were plenty of references to the overriding importance of character and moral values.
"A healthy democracy depends upon the character of its citizens," Mr. Bush declared.
It was left to the Lieutenant Governor to underline the message. "George W. Bush is a man of character," Mr. Perry said. "The type of person we can point out to our children and say, We want you to grow up to be like him."
The Governor outlined three challenges that face Texas and said that each offered lessons for the rest of the country.
First, he said, Texas must assure equal opportunity.
"Texas must be an open society," Mr. Bush said. "We must not become two societies, one that believes in the American dream and one without such hope."
He recalled a visit last year with a group of "young tough criminals," one of whom asked him whether he saw any hope for them.
"His question reveals something crucial to the future of Texas, as well as this country," Mr. Bush said. The answer, he said, is to "rally the armies of compassion that are in every community of this great state."
Second, the Governor said, Texas must "become an educated society" that is "literate in the language of the 21st century" and ready to compete. This means not only ending social promotions and making sure all students learn to read, he said, but educating public school students in "the values of a civil society."
Finally, Mr. Bush said, Texas must embrace its ethnic and racial diversity.
"We should be proud of our various heritages," he said. "We should celebrate them in festivals, we should enjoy their traditions in our homes, we should share them with friends. This genuine appreciation of heritage stands in stark contrast to those who would divide people into groups for political purposes."
Essentially, the Governor said, he is optimistic about the new century. He recalled a favorite quotation by an El Paso writer who described himself as living on "the sunrise side" of the mountain.
"As we head into a new century, Texas lives on the sunrise side of the mountain," Governor Bush said. "And I see a very good day coming."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: DOMESTIC ISSUES;
Clinton Social Security Plan Runs Into Opposition

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
After a year of trying to reduce the political voltage running through Social Security and months of maneuvering over who would put a proposal on the table first, President Clinton stepped up today with the outlines of a plan to strengthen the system and promptly got clobbered.
Republicans attacked the plan over its reliance on Government investment in the stock market and for its message that growing Federal budget surpluses should be allocated to pressing needs other than tax cuts. 
 Mr. Clinton's plan, which would keep intact Social Security's basic structure and its guaranteed benefit payment, is clearly an opening bid in what could still be a serious bipartisan effort to insure the retirement system's long-term financial health.
The plan has elements likely to have substantial appeal, including a proposal for new savings accounts under which the Government would match a portion of the money that low- and middle-income workers put aside for retirement.
Still, the President's plan left many questions unanswered. It would extend the solvency of Social Security from 2032 only to 2055, rather than to 2075, as the retirement system's accounting rules require. Mr. Clinton did not address whether he would support tax increases or benefit cuts to close the remaining gap, or how he would pay for other proposals he made today to help elderly women on Social Security and to remove the earnings restrictions that discourage many retirees from working. And he did not say what would happen if the projected surpluses never materialized.
But it was clearly an opening move not from the center, as many Republicans had hoped, but from the left. The plan Mr. Clinton set out -- dedicating the bulk of the surplus to Social Security, seeking higher returns for the system through Government investment, rejecting mandatory individual investment accounts -- was precisely what liberal Democrats have been advocating.
Republicans, said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, have "been asking the President to come forward with a framework, and this is a very balanced effort."
Mr. Clinton specifically ruled out the kinds of mandatory individual investment accounts, financed out of payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers, that nearly all Republicans and a few Democrats have been pushing as the basis for a more market-oriented Social Security system.
And the President's proposal that the Government invest $700 billion in the market over the next decade and a half was immediately deemed unacceptable by Republicans and by big corporations uncomfortable with the notion of having the Government as a shareholder.
They said the Government should under no circumstances own a stake, even indirectly, in any company. As a shareholder, they said, the Government would be unable to resist using its influence for partisan or political ends in the private sector, especially in industries like tobacco.
"Government-controlled investment in markets is contrary to free enterprise and it will open the doors to all kinds of mischief involving government dictates, favoritism and cronyism," said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
White House officials said the investment by the Government would be modest relative to the total size of the stock market -- about 4 percent of the market's total value, less than half of what state and local governments invest through their pension plans.
Moreover, they said, the Government could invest in index funds that track overall market performance, rather than buy and sell individual stocks. And the investing could be done through an independent agency that would hire fund managers through competitive bidding, and would be insulated from political pressure.
White House officials said stocks would never exceed 15 percent of Social Security's reserves, leaving the system far less exposed to the risk of market downturns than pension funds.
The plan assumes that the stock market investments would yield an annual return of 6.75 percent, equivalent to the historical average from 1959 to 1996 (the White House did not include the last two years because of the market's extraordinary rise). That return would be 3.8 percentage points higher than the average for Treasury bonds, which is where Social Security's reserves are invested now.
Mr. Clinton's proposal for voluntary retirement savings accounts, which would be financed by $500 billion of the surplus over 15 years, was not technically part of his Social Security package. But it signaled to Republicans that the White House is aware of their desire, reiterated today, to make certain that individual investment accounts are a part of any deal.
The idea behind the accounts is to give incentives to low- and middle-income workers to save and invest more. The Government would match deposits by each individual based on income.
Although they said they had not worked out the details, Administration officials said they envisioned a plan under which a worker earning $40,000 a year would get a $100 grant to start an account, and then could deposit up to $600 a year. At that income level, they said, the Government might match 50 cents on every dollar deposited, or up to $300 in a year. At the end of the year, the worker would have $1,000 in the account, $400 of it from the Government.
The biggest and most complex aspect of the White House plan is its proposal to use $2 trillion of the surplus over the next decade and a half to bolster Social Security by reducing the national debt.
Economists have long argued that reducing the debt, now about $5.5 trillion, would reduce interest rates, stimulate investment and spur faster economic growth.

The Government estimates that there will be a $4.4 trillion Federal budget surplus over the next 15 years. The Clinton Administration wants to set aside 62 percent to shore up Social Security, by paying down the national debt and investing some money in financial markets. Graph plots Social Security trust fund assets, from 1998 through 2031.

HEADLINE: San Francisco Pie-Throwers Are Guilty Of Battery

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The pie-throwers were on a roll. Within a few months, they had whammed their liberal objections into a gallery of unwitting political foes. They "pied" more than a half-dozen bigwig corporate executives and politicians in the face, and they got away with it.
Then, three members of the local pie-throwing movement, known as the Biotic Baking Brigade, took aim at the city's big cheese: Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. 
 The three Biotic Baking Brigade members, who said they were protesting the Mayor's lack of solutions to San Francisco's homeless population, nailed their target. But this time, the target struck back. Not only did Mr. Brown wrestle one of the pie-throwers to the ground, but in a move that has inspired debate throughout San Francisco over whether the pie-throwing was political theater, a silly prank or assault and battery, he pressed charges. Last week, the pie-throwers, or so-called Cherry Pie Three, went on trial.
The star witness: Mayor Brown.
The verdict, announced this afternoon after the jury of six men and six women deliberated for nine hours: Not guilty of assault on a public official, guilty of battery.
It was a decision that left both sides slightly deflated and failed to definitively answer the question of just what a pie in the face constitutes, at least in San Francisco. Still, both the prosecution and the defense claimed victory.
"The verdict shows there's a thin line between free speech and battery," said Maria Bee, the assistant district attorney who tried the case.
But Mark Vermeulen, one of the defense lawyers, countered that the acquittal on the assault charge, which charged that the pie-throwing was an act of retaliation and an effort to impede a public official from doing his job, was more important than the guilty verdict in the battery charge.
"That acquittal was a pie in the face to Mayor Brown," Mr. Vermeulen said.
The defendants, Justin Gross, 27, of Berkeley and Rahula Janowsky, 27, and Gerard Livernois, 34, of San Francisco, could have faced up to a year in county jail if convicted on the first count. They face up to six months in jail when sentenced later this month for the second.
Still, in a liberal city where the Mayor has been faring badly in the polls partly because of the problem of homelessness, many courtroom observers -- friends and members, mostly, of the Biotic Baking Brigade -- expected a full acquittal. Even the one juror who agreed to talk to reporters said the panel had been taken aback to find that the pie-throwing fit the legal definition of battery.
"We were all surprised," said Susan Cassidy, a public school teacher.
"In terms of the pie-throwing," she added, "I think it's really important that people choose how to express their activism." She said she empathized with their cause but was emotionally affronted by seeing a video of the Mayor being hit with the three pies.
The incident, which happened on Nov. 7, was widely publicized, since the Mayor was on a public podium, about to kick off a city-wide street cleaning campaign and announce a new stadium deal for the San Francisco 49ers.
All along, the defense lawyers had argued that the whole trial was orchestrated by the Mayor to avenge a public embarrassment that he had shrugged off at the time as "a momentary inconvenience." District Attorney Terence Hallinan, who refused to consider plea bargains that did not involve an admission of assault, was a good friend of the Mayor's, they said. No pie-throwing case had gone to trial in this country in about 20 years, and that first trial had ended in acquittal. Not to mention no pie in the history of pie-throwing, from the days of the Keystone Kops, had ever hurt anybody.
"A pie," said Kim Melcheski, another of the defense lawyers, "is not a gun; a pie is not a knife; a pie is not a rock. A pie, is not under any circumstances, a deadly weapon."
The Mayor made a forceful witness, telling the jury that the first "object" that hit his face had blurred his vision, had frightened him. He sprained his right ankle moments later in the scuffle between the pie-throwers and the police and said it still hurts a little.
Besides the Mayor, the Biotic Baking Brigade has "pied" the economist Milton Friedman, for being what it calls "the world's foremost neo-liberalist economist," Charles Hurwitz, the chief executive officer of the Pacific Lumber Company, which logs old-growth redwoods, and a San Francisco Supervisor, Gavin Newsom, for "becoming pro-development," among others.
Today, members of the Biotic Baking Brigade weren't sure what the conviction would mean for future pieings. "I know there's a pastry revolution going on all over the world," Ms. Janowsky said. "Public officials are getting pied every day."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: FOREIGN POLICY;
Farm Exports are Cited In a Call for Trade Talks

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
President Clinton called tonight for a new round of global trade negotiations beginning at the end of the year that would, above all, aides said, help promote the export of American agricultural products.
In his State of the Union Message, Mr. Clinton called for broader trade ties with Central America and Africa, and said that trade talks should seek to "expand export of services, of manufactured goods and, most of all, farm products." 
 Aides to the President said that the Administration hoped to begin the new round of global trade talks in November, when trade ministers gather in Washington for a meeting of the World Trade Organization.
The new talks would come 13 years after the start of the last major round of global free-trade negotiations, the so-called Uruguay Round, which resulted in overall tariff cuts around the world of more than a third and the creation of the World Trade Organization.
In a statement offering details on the President's proposals, the White House said that the new trade negotiations could "create important new opportunities for America's world-class farmers and ranchers, manufacturers and service providers to increase sales in foreign markets."
The President also hoped to use the negotiations to promote "a more open and accountable W.T.O. system," the White House statement said. The Geneva-based organization is often criticized by American lawmakers and economists who say it has infringed on American sovereignty and failed to treat the United States fairly in trade disputes.
The President suggested that a new trade fight was brewing over the sharp growth in Japanese steel exports to the United States, a result of the collapse of the market for steel in much of the rest of Asia over the last two years.
"We must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our nation," Mr. Clinton said. "I have already informed the Government of Japan that if that nation's sudden surge of steel imports is not reversed, America will respond."
While the President's speech dealt primarily with domestic policy, it also called for new American initiatives to end labor abuses overseas, especially those involving children.
"We will work with the International Labor Organization on a new initiative to lift up labor standards around the world and we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world," Mr. Clinton said.
Aides said the White House planned to seek an additional $40 million in the next budget for programs to help developing nations establish a code of labor rights and programs for unemployment insurance and pensions. They said the President would seek $10 million for a separate program to improve access to education for children now employed in dangerous work places.
Mr. Clinton also sought to step up programs intended to help Russia, Ukraine and other nations of the former Soviet Union safeguard nuclear materials to keep them out of the hands of terrorists and rogue nations.
Despite a recent brutal crackdown on democracy advocates in China, the President called for continued close dialogue between Washington and Beijing. "I say again to the American people: It is important not to isolate China," he said. "The more we bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change and freedom to China."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE MARKETS;
Wall Street Not Exactly Bullish On Plan to Aid Social Security

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
The bull market in stocks, running hard for more than eight years now, has already lived longer than any other in history. And if President Clinton gets his way, the gallop will continue.
The President's plan to shore up Social Security calls for putting $700 billion into the stock market. His idea is to transfer almost two-thirds of the projected Federal budget surplus, roughly $2.7 trillion, to the Social Security trust fund over the next 15 years and funnel $700 billion of that into stocks. 
 Investors reacted tepidly to the proposal yesterday. But make no mistake, the prospect of such a shift into stocks would be a powerful, positive force on a bull market, which investors fret is long in the tooth.
The $700 billion earmarked for stocks is equal to roughly 5 percent of the value of the entire United States stock market now. If this money went into mutual funds whose holdings reflected well-known market averages, like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, those shares might become stock rockets. They are already valued exceedingly high by historical standards.
Most Americans need not be sold on the merits of stock investing. According to the Federal Reserve Board's most recent data, American households own $5.3 trillion in corporate equities directly. This dwarfs the holdings of mutual funds ($2 trillion) and that of state and local government retirement funds ($1.3 trillion). Five consecutive years of at least 20 percent returns in S.& P. 500 stocks have made even the most cautious investor a believer.
Meanwhile, Social Security's returns have been woeful. On average, the fund's investments have yielded 2 percent to 2.5 percent annually since 1937, a rate based on a composite of short-term and long-term interest rates paid on a special, nonmarketed type of United States Treasury security that matures in four years or more.
Still, investors were blase following news of the President's plan yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average bounced back from a decline of about 130 points earlier in the day to end 14.67 points higher.
Mr. Clinton's plan is likely to meet stiff opposition. Such issues as how the Government would manage its investments in private businesses loom large. What a spectacle it would be if the Social Security fund had a large position in the Microsoft Corporation as the Justice Department was pursuing a vigorous antitrust case against it.
And how would the Government vote its beneficiaries' views on proxy issues like mergers and acquisitions and chief executive compensation?
If the Government were to control a large portion of a company's shares, what would happen when it came time to sell? It would surely disrupt the market in that company's shares. If the market fell, how would the throngs of investors exit? Who would get to leave the party first?
"The market is correct in realizing how difficult the endgame is going to be," said Charles Gabriel, a senior Washington analyst at Prudential Securities. "I don't think it is inevitable at all."
Oddly, the idea of putting Social Security funds into equities has not been the subject of furious lobbying in recent years. Merrill Lynch and State Street Bank, two administrators of retirement accounts that stand to benefit from a switch to equities, have pushed the idea somewhat.
But the Investment Company Institute, which represents the mutual fund industry in Washington, has not favored putting Social Security assets in stocks. "We will look closely at what the President is proposing," said John Collins, the institute's spokesman. "We will withhold our enthusiasm until we see the details."
Even though Wall Street firms would love to get their hands on $700 billion in Social Security funds, American corporations may not be so sure of the idea. "This would be a significant transfer of ownership from the private sector to the Government," said Michael Tanner, director of Health and Welfare Studies at the Cato Institute, a research organization influential with conservatives.
Lawrence J. White, professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University, thinks funneling Social Security assets into the stock market is a bad idea because the money will probably wind up at the nation's largest public companies and therefore reduce funds available for small businesses. As recently as the early 1990's, he said, a third of Keogh retirement plans and individual retirement accounts were invested in bank accounts or an equivalent account at an insurance company. Much of this money was then lent to small businesses, the engine of job growth.
"Where the money ultimately ends up is what concerns me," Mr. White said. "I don't like it only ending up at the disposal of the 10,000 public companies."

HEADLINE: U.S. Audit Is Said to Criticize Giuliani's Strict Welfare Plan

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

 BODY:
A two-month Federal inquiry into New York City's welfare program has found that city officials routinely violate the law by denying poor people the right to apply promptly for food stamps, according to two officials who have read a draft report prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture.
The officials said Federal auditors, who reviewed 600 cases at two welfare offices in Queens, had found that city workers failed to make applications immediately available as required by law. The workers also failed to screen families for emergency food needs, required the poor to search for jobs before receiving help and cut off food stamps to needy families who were still eligible for those benefits, the officials said, speaking on the condition that neither they nor their agencies be identified. 
 The Federal investigators, the officials said, also sharply criticized the state for failing to properly monitor the city's welfare program, which the Giuliani administration has said was intended to discourage people from applying for public benefits, including food stamps. Advocates for the poor -- not state officials -- alerted the Federal Government to the problems at city welfare offices.
"Substantial noncompliance with the food stamp act and regulations has gone undetected and unaddressed at the local level," the report said, according to the two officials who described its findings to The New York Times.
The Federal report offered the sharpest criticism yet of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's tough welfare policies, which Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly described as one of his biggest accomplishments. Federal officials are also reviewing the city's Medicaid policies to determine whether the city is improperly preventing the poor from applying for medical assistance.
Officials from the Department of Agriculture, who presented the draft report to the city and state last week, told the local officials that they must act immediately to correct the deficiencies and gave them until yesterday evening to respond.
City officials declined to discuss the report or to describe the changes they were making in response to it. Instead, they accused the investigators of trying to sabotage their efforts to push people to rely more on themselves and less on government.
"The review being conducted by U.S.D.A. is a misguided effort intended to derail the state and city's progress in transforming welfare, which includes food stamps, into one where work and self-sufficiency are the foremost objectives of the program," said Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources Administration, which runs the city's welfare programs.
State officials said they had responded in writing, telling the Federal auditors that the city had agreed to develop a new application form, to improve the screening process for emergency food needs and to allow food stamp applicants with children under 6 to forgo the work requirement. But the state officials vigorously defended their oversight of the city, saying the problems were minor and already being addressed.
"We have spent unprecedented amounts of time working on various food stamp issues," said Daniel D. Hogan, a Deputy Commissioner of the state's Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, which oversees welfare programs in New York City.
"We have asked the Federal Government to withdraw this review," Mr. Hogan said. "There's no basis for it. A conference call could have taken care of these issues. The city's only intention here is to run a fair, efficient operation that works."
Federal officials, who have the power to withhold financing from states that fail to address legal violations, plan to issue a final report in several weeks once they review New York's comments on their findings. But the inquiry has already spawned a Federal class-action lawsuit, filed by lawyers for the poor last month, as well as some soul searching in welfare offices and state capitals across the country.
The situation in New York highlights the conundrum confronted by welfare officials across the country, who find themselves struggling to juggle two very different Federal mandates. On one hand, the Federal welfare law allows states and municipalities to discourage people from applying for cash benefits, and offers financial incentives for those with declines in their caseloads.
On the other, the law requires states to encourage the needy to apply for food stamps and Medicaid, two benefits described as critical by Federal officials hoping to keep the working poor off welfare and the newly employed from returning.
While the law allows food stamp applicants who are denied benefits to appeal those decisions, it was unclear last night whether people who have been improperly discouraged from applying for food stamps have any recourse, beyond reapplying. An official familiar with the Federal report said it did not address that issue.
New York City began its new application process in April when it started converting welfare offices into "job centers," where caseworkers encourage people to seek child support payments, unemployment benefits or help from food pantries instead of cash benefits. The workers offer applications only if a person returns for a second appointment.
About a third of the city's welfare offices currently operate under those rules. When the Federal investigators examined the two Queens offices, they were among only 9 of the roughly 30 offices citywide that had been converted.
The welfare issue is important to Mayor Giuliani, who may be contemplating national office and often mentions his tougher approach to welfare when he travels across the country testing the political waters. And when the Federal inquiry became public in November, Mr. Giuliani began a vigorous attack on the Federal investigators and advocates for the poor.
At first, Jason Turner, the city's welfare Commissioner, told The Times that he would speed up the distribution of applications to the poor as a precaution while the Government conducted its inquiry.
But the next day, city officials said they would not speed up the distribution. They said agriculture officials had determined that their policies complied with Federal law, an assertion the officials promptly denied.
Later that week, Mr. Giuliani said that The Times had not reported Mr. Turner's remarks accurately, adding, "Sometimes, things aren't reported exactly the way somebody says something because there is an emotional or ideological bias." Mr. Turner did not complain of being misquoted, but he was no longer available to comment.

 BODY:
The DaimlerChrysler Corporation produced a record number of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars in 1998, the company reported yesterday. Mercedes made 926,400 vehicles, up some 200,000 units, or 27 percent, for the year. The biggest increases were in the new A-class, M-class, CLK coupe and CLK convertible models, all introduced in 1997. 
 Mercedes-Benz benefited from robust economies in the United States and Europe, its two largest markets, and strong response to the new models. The A-Class, the first Mercedes entry in the small-car category, was especially popular in Europe.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION;
Clinton Outlines His Vision for Nation's Transition to the 21st Century

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the presentations yesterday by Representatives Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, and Steve Largent, Republican of Oklahoma, in response to President Clinton's State of the Union Message, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
MS. DUNN
As you might imagine, if you'd been sitting with us in the House chamber tonight as the President was giving his speech, you could have felt the swirl of history. These are disturbing and controversial times in our nation's capital. 
 A couple of weeks ago, I even heard a network anchor say, "The capital is in chaos." Another proclaimed we were in the midst of a constitutional crisis.
Ladies and gentlemen, our country is not in crisis. There are no tanks in the streets. Our system of government is as solid as the Capitol dome you see behind me.
Our democracy is sound. Our economy is prosperous. The state of our union is strong. And no matter what the outcome of the President's situation, life in America will go on. Our lives will continue to be filled with practical matters, not constitutional ones.
I've been a single mother since my boys were little, 6 and 8. My life in those days was taken up with meeting -- trying to make -- make ends meet, trying to get to two soccer games at the same time on two different fields, worrying about dropping the boys off early at school in order for me to get to work on time. I know how that knot in the pit of your stomach feels. I've been there.
I'm still a practical person. You heard the President make a lot of promises to a lot of people tonight. But I'd like to talk to you about two very practical Republican priorities, tax relief and Social Security reform.
Our current tax system is a burden on the economy and on the American people. Let me tell you a story about a fellow I represent from North Bend, Wash. His name is Robert Allan.
A few years ago, the I.R.S. denied his right to file a joint return with his wife because they said his wife, Shirley, was deceased. Well, I've seen Shirley -- she looks pretty good for a dead person.
Robert took Shirley to the I.R.S. office in Seattle. The I.R.S. was not convinced. So the Allans brought in their family doctor, and in his medical opinion he pronounced Shirley alive. The I.R.S. was still not convinced.
It took intervention by a member of Congress, me, to resolve this comedy, which in truth is a tragedy because it's symbolic of how removed our entire tax system has become from reality and from common sense.
Last year, we passed legislation reining in the I.R.S., so that taxpayers are now considered innocent until proven guilty. But so much more needs to be done.
Next year there will be a $63 billion budget surplus. Mr. President, give it back. Last year, a typical mother and father who both work paid nearly 40 percent of their income in taxes. That means 40 cents out of every dollar they earned went to the government in Federal, state or local taxes.
That's the highest percentage of income ever paid in taxes by American families.
I don't know about you but that really bothers me; no wonder so many American families are struggling:
Get married, and your taxes go up.
Save for your children's education, and your taxes go up.
And when you die -- that's right, your taxes go up. The Government gets a bigger piece of your life's work than all your children put together. So what can you expect from Republicans? Expect action.
First, tonight we're proposing a 10 percent, across-the-board cut in tax rates for every working American. That's the down payment on a simpler, fairer, flatter tax system.
Second, we must end the marriage penalty. We should honor commitment, not tax it.
And third, we must cut death taxes so that families don't have to sell their businesses and farms when mom and dad die.
In all of our tax policies, we start from this premise: the people's money belongs to the people, not to the Government.
The second thing I want to talk about is Social Security. A year ago in his State of the Union speech, the President said he was committed to saving Social Security. I'm glad to hear him discuss it again this evening. Unfortunately, spending the surplus, as he proposes, will not save Social Security. It just temporarily props it up with some extra cash.
Mr. President, we're still waiting for real legislation.
We've reserved H.R.1, the very first bill of this Congress, for the President's Social Security plan.
There's one thing we can all agree on, one nonnegotiable principle: we must keep our contract with our senior citizens who depend on Social Security for part or all of their retirement income. This nation made that promise long ago and we will keep that promise.
But Social Security needs not just to be patched up; it needs to be updated for the 21st century. People today want and expect to have more control over their lives and over their money. But President Clinton's approach, as you've just heard, gives the Government more control of your retirement income.
The Social Security dollars deducted from your paycheck currently earn less than 3 percent a year. That's not enough of a return; that's not going to keep Social Security solvent, and it's especially not fair to young people and to women.
For example, the current system works against mothers who choose to step out of their job for a while, away from their career, to raise children or to care for parents.
It works against wives, who more often than not, survive their husbands and they end up living for more years on fewer dollars. And it works against young people who believe they'll never see a Social Security check.
Here's a better way: give working Americans the choice to invest some of their Social Security dollars in personal retirement accounts. We can do this without touching a dime in Social Security funds, without raising one nickel in taxes and without touching one penny of current benefits.
A new century requires a new beginning, in approaches, in ideas, and, yes, in civility and cooperation between political parties.
I'd like to close on a personal note. I'm a mother, a gardener, a Republican and a member of Congress. Believe me, all four take patience. My boys, thankfully, turned out to be wonderful young men. My plants at home, unfortunately, need a lot of work. And as for my efforts in the Congress, I am constantly planting and watering.
As one citizen to another, in spite of all the troubling things you hear about our nation's capital, I believe that good ideas can take root here, good things can grow here and good things can blossom here.
 
MR. LARGENT
Tonight, I want to share some brief but important thoughts with you.
First, let me say what a special privilege it is to speak to you and give my response and the Republicans' response to the President's remarks.
Let me tell you a bit about myself. I grew up in Oklahoma and was born in the very district I'm now proud to represent.
I was raised in a broken home and thanks to my mom, I stayed in school, stayed out of most trouble, and went to college. I married my high school sweetheart, Terry, a cheerleader. And, for the next 14 years, I got to live every boy's dream -- playing in the National Football League for the Seattle Seahawks.
After I concluded my career in the N.F.L., I started my own marketing and advertising business back in Tulsa. But in 1994 I campaigned for the first elective office in my life and won. I came to Washington with a group of Republicans committed to balancing the budget, slowing the growth of government, cutting taxes, reforming welfare and saving Medicare. And that's exactly what we did. . . .
Prior to 1994, my wife and I, we weren't political. We were like most families --raising four kids, hustling from one school or sports event to another, our car littered by fast-food wrappers and french fries. In fact, it wasn't until after I was elected that I attended a Republican function where a banner hung that read "G.O.P." I had to ask someone what those letters stood for. They said, "Grand Old Party, of course."
I believe tonight is an appropriate time to ask once again, what does the G.O.P. stand for? What does the party of Lincoln and Reagan stand for today? What are the lasting bedrock principles that personify and distinguish the Republican Party? It's these questions I want to answer tonight because the answer is why I ran for office in the first place.
Here's the 15-second sound bite answer: the Republican Party's mission is to promote, preserve, and protect individual liberty, free enterprise and limited government. But what does that mean to my family and your family?
First, we must preserve the notion that true liberty and freedom come from God and are His blessing on this land and that freedom reigns only as we act responsibly toward God, each other, and His creation.
Our freedom was bought at a great price, and our most important responsibility is to defend this sacred gift and keep our country secure. Tonight we support our troops that are stationed in Bosnia, the Middle East and around the world. And the good news is that after six years of cutting spending for our armed forces, the President has signaled that he is ready to join us in strengthening our national defense.
We must never be complacent in what is still a dangerous world. Terrorists and rogue nations are rapidly acquiring technology to deliver weapons of mass destruction to our very doorstep.
Most Americans are shocked to discover that our country is unshielded from the accidental or ruthless launch of even a single missile over our skies. Mr. President, we urge you to join Congress in establishing a viable missile defense system to protect the United States.
Protecting individual liberty also means protecting the unborn. Again this year, overwhelming majorities in both Houses will urge the President to end the dreadful and unwarranted practice of partial-birth abortion. We must uphold the sanctity of life amidst the tragedies of abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide.
Republicans also promote free enterprise. We believe market principles like competition really work. At the heart of free enterprise is good education. For far too long we've allowed Washington to dictate how our children are taught. One of our priorities is to give control of our schools to local communities.
We want the most important election affecting your children's education to be the one that decides who sits on the school board, not who you send to Washington. Parents deserve the opportunity to choose the best school, with the best curriculum, the best teachers and the safest environment for their children.
I recently met with a room full of teachers in Jenks, Okla. I came out of that meeting convinced more than ever that teachers like these know best how Federal education dollars should be spent.
That's why Republicans are leading the effort that will insure 90 cents of every Federal education dollar goes directly to the classroom, empowering parents and teachers, not bureaucrats.
And if we really want to "free" enterprise and the economy, lets scrap the Internal Revenue tax code. The 8,000 plus pages of confusion, contradiction and confiscation are choking small business and driving the average taxpayer mad.
Republicans want to establish a date by which the tax code will be abolished and replaced by something that's simple, fair and takes a smaller bite from the family's pocket book.
 Finally, Republicans stand for limited government. Ronald Reagan reminded us that "a government that is big enough to give you everything you want is also big enough to take everything you have." And tonight the Federal Government is still too big and taking more than it should. We will continue our efforts to control Washington's wasteful spending and its insatiable appetite for your money.
Well, this is what the Grand Old Party stands for and if this represents your hopes and dreams, we ask not that you pull for us, but that you push with us. . . .
Yesterday marked the 70th year since the birth of a great American leader and hero, Dr. Martin Luther King. In one of his last sermons in 1968, Dr. King warned that, while the world is a closer neighborhood, we are experiencing less brotherhood. That's equally true today.
It is no longer the aggression from without that is America's greatest threat, but alienation from within; alienation at every level -- husband from wife, mother from father, parent from child, black from white, Republican from Democrat, liberal from conservative.
And there's only one solution -- reconciliation. Ironically, the word Congress itself is made of two Latin words that mean "to walk together."
Reconciliation requires the humility and courage to say, "I'm sorry, I was wrong, will you forgive me." Therein lies the healing salve for the wounded soul of our nation. You see, the body of our country is strong. It's the heart that needs attention.
On Christmas Eve my family and I packed up our kids and gifts and headed to grandma's house. In the car, we sang along with Vince Gill's Christmas tape. As we sang one particular song, I was struck by the words and by their poignancy for our country tonight. The chorus went, "Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me."
So, let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me. And let it begin with Republicans and Democrats and blacks and whites, and moms and, yes, especially dads. Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with all of us who comprise one nation, under God, indivisible.
And if we work together and walk together, and if we have a Congress motivated not by the maintenance of power, but by principle, then I believe historians will tell our children's children: There walked a great people, a nation that preserved the wonderful promise that we call America.
May God bless you and your family, and may God continue to bless this great nation.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE RESPONSE;
In New Unity, G.O.P. Seeks 10% U.S. Tax Cut

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Republicans sought today to dispel the image of a Congress consumed by impeachment, putting forward an agenda that calls for a 10 percent across-the-board cut in income tax rates and pledging to engage President Clinton on assuring the long-term solvency of Social Security.
The proposal for a sweeping income tax reduction was made by Senate Republicans in a morning news conference, and then highlighted tonight by Representative Jennifer Dunn of Washington, who shared with Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma the televised Republican response to the State of the Union Message. 
 The House and Senate coordination on tax cuts showed a new unity on the part of Republicans in the two chambers who fought bitterly over tax reduction last year. The proposal sets up a sharp ideological collision between the Republicans' tax-cutting ambitions and Mr. Clinton's call to allocate budget surpluses over the next 15 years to Social Security, Medicare and increased domestic and military spending.
"Americans should not have to wait 15 years for a tax cut," said Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, after Senate Republicans introduced the tax cut plan as one of the first five bills of the year.
Leading Republicans in the House and Senate today also immediately criticized Mr. Clinton's call for the Federal Government to invest some of the retirement benefits in the stock market. They prefer giving Americans private investment accounts to manage themselves.
"If you thought a Government takeover of health care was bad," said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, "just wait until the Government becomes an owner of America's private sector companies."
And Representative Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the new Speaker, said, "Having the Government invest in the stock market for the American people will not strengthen our economic security. The President's suggestion that Social Security reform starts with Government intervention in the stock market is plain wrong."
On a day that saw lawmakers ricochet from the impeachment trial in the Senate to the President's State of the Union Message before a joint session of Congress in the House chamber, most Republicans were studiously polite, although two House leaders, Dick Armey of Texas and Tom DeLay of Texas, noticeably did not applaud.
Mr. DeLay said of the President's speech, "It was a political speech. He used all of his weapons of mass distraction."
Mostly, Republicans as much as Mr. Clinton sought to play down the impeachment struggle. And by putting forward Ms. Dunn and Mr. Largent for the party's response, the Republicans tried to give a fresh and more diverse look to the Congressional majority that for four years had seemed to be defined by just one person, Newt Gingrich. The two -- both told a bit of their personal story tonight -- had emphasized their newer faces as selling points in House leadership races last year that they both lost.
Standing with the Capitol dome as a backdrop, neither House member outright mentioned impeachment, but Ms. Dunn tried to defuse the issue immediately and remove it from center stage.
"A couple of weeks ago, I heard a network anchor say, 'The capital is in chaos,' " she said. "Another proclaimed we were in the midst of a constitutional crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, our country is not in crisis."
Ms. Dunn noted, "There are no tanks in the streets."
Then picking her words carefully, she said, "No matter what the outcome of the President's situation, life in America will go on. Our lives will continue to be filled with practical matters, not constitutional ones."
She called for an array of tax cuts to satisfy every Republican constituency, beginning with the 10 percent reduction in income tax rates, saying "That is the down payment on a simpler, fairer, flatter tax system." Ms. Dunn also advocated an end to the so-called marriage penalty, which charges some couples more in taxes than they would pay if they were single, and a reduction in the inheritance tax.
The Republicans did not spell out how much revenue the Government would lose under their plan. By some estimates, the cut in the income tax rates alone would amount to $700 billion over a decade. Under their plan, each marginal income tax rate would fall. The 15 percent rate would drop to 13.5 percent, for example, while the highest rate of 39.6 percent would fall to 35.64 percent.
The proposal means that a married couple with two children earning $75,000 a year, for example, would see its tax payment fall to $9,277 from $10,308, for a net tax savings of $1,031, according to the Senate Finance Committee. Those savings assume the couple does not itemize its taxes.
Republican leaders sought to counterpose such a sweeping tax rate reduction against Mr. Clinton's own call for specific tax credits for needs like child care and displaced workers. Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, called such selective tax relief "the old Washington solution:Take it from the worker, bring it to Washington, Washington takes the parts it wants. And then return it back to the people in a way that we tell them that they can have a tax credit."
On Social Security, Ms. Dunn challenged Mr. Clinton to send forward legislation immediately. But she also criticized his proposal as "giving Government more control of your retirement income." She promoted instead a Republican proposal for Americans to have individual accounts that they choose how to invest.
Mr. Largent's response emphasized issues of concern to the Republicans' conservative base, while at the same time trying to strike a theme of reconciliation for the Congress left so divided by impeachment.
"First, we must preserve the notion that true liberty and freedom come from God and are His blessing on this land," Mr. Largent said, "and that freedom reigns only as we act responsibly toward God, each other and His creation."
Mr. Largent praised Mr. Clinton for proposing an increase in military spending and asked him to embrace a Republican proposal for a national missile defense system.
Mr. Largent also turned to an issue paramount for social conservatives, saying "protecting individual liberty also means protecting the unborn." He called for an end to a form of abortion that opponents call partial-birth abortion. Mr. Clinton has vetoed legislation that would ban the practice, in which a fetus is partially extracted and its skull collapsed in the birth canal. The House overrode his veto but the Senate failed to do so by three votes last year.
Another major policy battle was shaping up on education, an issue both parties said would be a priority in this session. Republicans criticized Mr. Clinton's newest proposals, which would hold states and schools accountable for their progress and use Federal aid as a lever to improve performance, as an encroachment on local control of schools.
"We will focus on local school districts," said Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee.
Some Republicans were also dubious of Mr. Clinton's announcement that the Justice Department will sue the tobacco companies. "Some may view it as relieving the Congress of having to move on any legislation," said Senator John McCain of Arizona, who tried and failed to push through the Senate anti-tobacco legislation last year.
By night's end some members of Congress were left reeling by the convergence of impeachment and the State of the Union address. "This is schizophrenia at its highest," Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said. "The President excels at appearing oblivious."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE OVERVIEW;
Unbowed, Clinton Presses Social Security Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
President Clinton proposed tonight that the Federal Government invest for the first time in the stock market to strengthen Social Security, as he delivered a confident report on the State of the Union to a divided Congress considering cutting short his Presidency.
Appearing in the grand House chamber a month to the day after he was impeached there, Mr. Clinton also urged Congress to begin contributing $33 billion a year to a new system of retirement accounts for American workers. 
 The President smiled and even joked with his audience of antagonists and allies as he ignored the trial steps away in the Senate -- where lawyers began defending him just a few hours earlier -- and envisioned using the rest of his term to strengthen the nation's schools, military forces and programs for the elderly.
In a sure-footed, 77-minute address, Mr. Clinton coupled a rosy appraisal of the nation's state with an urgent appeal for action, flaunting his laurels but insisting he would not rest on them.
"America is working again," the President said. "The promise of our future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency." Transcript, pages A22-23.
Mr. Clinton announced tonight that the Justice Department was preparing to sue tobacco companies, opening a new front in a war that has repeatedly gained him political ground. He argued that Federal programs like Medicare were due hundreds of billions of dollars for the costs of treating lung cancer and other diseases.
Mr. Clinton left it to his lawyers to attack the charges that he broke the law to cover up his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, the former intern.
But he seized on his State of the Union Message as his most potent defense, just as for the last turbulent year he has counted on his dogged advocacy of popular programs to sustain him.
Mr. Clinton exuded ease and a sense of political control, reacting with unmistakable delight when both sides of the chamber erupted in applause for his call for equal pay for equal work by women or men.
"That was more encouraging, you know," he said, grinning and spreading his arms wide as he bent slightly from side to side. "There was more balance on the seesaw. I like that!"
After the traditional, bipartisan ovation welcoming the President, Democrats applauded far longer and louder, and some of Mr. Clinton's accusers sat with lips compressed and hands folded.
But Mr. Clinton tried to draw his opponents in. Early on, he recalled the acceptance speech of the new Speaker, Dennis Hastert, who urged members to work together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship.
"Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that," the President said, turning and extending his hand to the Republican. A surprised Mr. Hastert stood and accepted the handshake.
The President presented his legislative shopping list -- from an initiative to ease traffic congestion to a $1 billion program to help people switch from welfare to work -- to a Republican Congress with far different plans for spending the surpluses accumulating after decades of deficits. He did not explain how he would pay for most of his programs.
Yet even if some of his plans stand little chance of passage, Mr. Clinton was able to command a television audience for a recitation of the economic benefits of his leadership -- and an implicit argument that the trial is an unwarranted distraction from important business.
"With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st Century," Mr. Clinton said. Calling this time "a new dawn for America," he urged his listeners to "put aside our divisions" and find "a new hour of healing and hopefulness."
Mr. Clinton recognized several people in the galleries to underscore his points. Among them, Sammy Sosa, the home run hitter, and Rosa Parks, the civil rights demonstrator, brought thunderous applause that created an image of bipartisan bonhomie, at least on television.
The President also singled out his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose loyalty and advice have been important to his political stamina. "I'd like to take just a minute to honor her," he said. Mrs. Clinton beamed as the President gazed up at her through squinting eyes. She rose, sat, then rose again to wave and acknowledge applause.
In all, Mr. Clinton was interrupted about 98 times by the usually partisan applause.
Illustrating the peculiar political dynamic unfolding here, Republican leaders also seemed eager today to play down the trial. They laid out their own legislative agenda this morning, insisting that mulling the first removal of a sitting President would not divert them from what Trent Lott, the majority leader, called "the people's business."
In giving the Republican response tonight, Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington assured her viewers that "our country is not in crisis," and that "no matter what the outcome of the President's situation, life in America will go on."
Mr. Clinton devoted only a fraction of his speech to foreign policy, joining in one paragraph a statement of pride in Northern Ireland's peace with a condemnation of the violence in Kosovo.
Though the President called for sure-fire political initiatives like putting 50,000 more police officers on the street, he also used his speech to push beyond his short-term predicament. He urged a long-term fix to the Social Security system his associates said he hopes will shine through the historic blot of impeachment.
Anticipating a political free fall over the coming budget, Mr. Clinton urged Congress in his State of the Union Message last year to "Save Social Security first." That proved a deft political move, stifling Republican appeals for tax cuts.
But with the surpluses growing and a new politics of prosperity firing legislators' imaginations, Senate Republicans declared this morning that they would seek a 10 percent cut in personal income tax rates.
Tonight, Mr. Clinton again moved to box them in.
"I reach out my hand to all of you in both houses and both parties and ask that we join together in saying to the American people: We will save Social Security now," he said. "Now, last year we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say we shouldn't spend any of it, not any of it, until after Social Security is truly saved. First things first."
For a month, the White House has deliberately leaked proposals from Mr. Clinton's State of the Union speech to capture headlines showing the President at work. But it held back its plans for Social Security as well as for tobacco, to try to insure that Mr. Clinton's substantive proposals, rather than the spectacle of his appearance before Congress, would drive tonight's news coverage.
Mr. Clinton argued that the greater share -- 62 percent -- of forthcoming Federal surpluses should be earmarked to preserve Social Security, a program that was at the heart of the Democratic New Deal but that has since developed overwhelming popular support.
Another 15 percent of the surpluses, Mr. Clinton said, should go to protect the Medicare program, which assists the elderly with health care. The President would spend about 11 percent of the surpluses to create retirement savings accounts, called Universal Savings Accounts.
The remainder of the surpluses -- roughly another 11 percent, according to the Administration -- would go to defense and domestic initiatives.
In all, Mr. Clinton proposed that $2.7 trillion of a projected $4.4 trillion in surpluses over the next 15 years be directed to help preserve Social Security. The changes Mr. Clinton seeks in the system, the Administration contends, will keep it solvent until 2055. It is now projected to run out of money to pay the claims of retirees -- who are expected not only to grow in number but also to live longer -- by 2032.
But the Administration's goal is to secure Social Security until 2075, which means today's plan even by Mr. Clinton's standards is only a partial solution. Mr. Clinton made clear tonight that he had no interest in pursuing politically unattractive options, like tax increases or what he called "drastic cuts in benefits."
Mr. Clinton argued that Social Security would be stronger if it could invest some of its trust fund in the stock market, where it could earn higher returns than from the Treasury bonds it invests in now. Although state governments invest their pension plans in stocks, this would be the first venture by the Federal Government into the market.
In all, the Administration proposed investing up to 25 percent of the new money for Social Security, or $700 billion, in stocks over the next 15 years. Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council, said that under this plan, Social Security would never have more than 15 percent of its assets in the market, a level he called "far, far more conservative than any pension plan in the country does."
The Administration proposes to work with Congress to create a privately managed system to invest the money without political interference.
But Republicans signaled they had no interest in the President's suggestion. "Government-controlled investment in markets is contrary to free enterprise," said Bill Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Archer said that such investment "will open the doors to all kinds of mischief involving Government dictates, favoritism, and cronyism."
The remainder of the surplus money Mr. Clinton hopes to reserve for Social Security -- about $2 trillion -- would, like the money he would set aside for Medicare, go to pay off the Federal debt. They propose using the money to shore up the Social Security system by reducing the national debt.
That would simultaneously reduce the amount of Government debt and increase Social Security's financial reserves. The Administration says it would help bring down interest rates, stimulate new investment and create conditions for faster economic growth to guard against the strains caused by the retirement of the baby boom generation.
Mr. Sperling said that under this plan, the Federal debt would fall as a percentage of the domestic product from 44 percent today to less than 10 percent by 2014. When Mr. Clinton took office, he said, that number was 50.1 percent.
In proposing his fix for Social Security, Mr. Clinton heeded the demands of his core Democratic constituencies, rejecting a Republican call that individuals be permitted make some of their investment decisions about the money the Government deducts from their pay.
Instead, he called for maintaining Social Security as a "defined benefit" plan, that is, one with a guaranteed payout. But tonight he also proposed the system of personal savings accounts, which are similar to what Republicans are seeking as at least a partial replacement for Social Security. For the President, the new accounts would supplement Social Security, not replace it.
Each worker would receive some flat payment, say $100, to open an account. If a worker then chose to deposit more money, Administration officials said, the Government would match part of it, perhaps in the form of a tax credit. Mr. Sperling said that the Administration favored weighting the matching system so that it provided a greater benefit to lower-income workers.
Mr. Clinton's aides repeatedly referred to the agenda he presented tonight as the most aggressive he has offered since 1993, and far different than the kind of agenda one might expect from a President contemplating his seventh year.
They were emphasizing that Mr. Clinton intended to stick around, and they were trying to draw a sharp contrast with the Republicans.
Mr. Clinton proposed a raft of domestic initiatives tonight, including several to bolster education. This year, Congress must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as it does every five years.
The Administration hopes to amend the law, which governs aid to public schools, to demand that states and school systems begin testing new teachers for competence, identify failing schools and shut them if necessary, and end practices like social promotion, or moving children into the next grade even if they have not gained the necessary skills.
"Each year the national Government invests more than $15 billion in our public schools," Mr. Clinton said. "I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting what does not work."

HEADLINE: Chase, Among Other Banks, Posts Gains for 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Some of the biggest United States banks reported gains in fourth-quarter earnings yesterday as a strong economy lifted income from loans and fees.
The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the nation's third-largest bank, and the Bank One Corporation, the fifth largest, both benefited from growth in credit card fees. 
 "Strong fee growth and fairly strong mortgage and loan origination are functions of a strong economy," said Scott Edgar, director of research at Sife Trust Fund in Walnut Creek, Calif., which owns $1.1 billion in financial stocks.
Concern among investors about whether that growth can be sustained should the economy slow led some bank stocks to fall yesterday, Mr. Edgar said.
BankAmerica, the nation's second-largest bank after Citigroup Inc., also benefited from growth in credit card loans. One-time merger charges, losses from a loan to D. E. Shaw & Company, a hedge fund and securities firm, and lower income from capital markets offset those gains.
J. P. Morgan & Company, the financial services giant, said that its earnings fell because of weak results from equity investments.
Shares of Chase rose $3.50, to $74.375; those of BankAmerica declined 56.25 cents, to $64, and those of J. P. Morgan fell $2.8125, to $105.9375.
Bank One slipped $1 a share, to $54.125; PNC dropped 81.25 cents, to $49.125; Bank of New York fell $1.9375, to $35.125, and Wells Fargo & Company fell 68.75 cents, to $36.8125.
Chase's fourth-quarter earnings rose 31 percent, to a record $1.15 billion, or $1.31 a diluted share, compared with $850 million, or 94 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. That surpassed analyst expectations of $1.19 a share.
For the full year, earnings for the bank, which is based in New York, were $4.02 billion, or $4.51 a share, compared with $3.85 billion, or $4.17 a share, in 1997.
BankAmerica reported a quarterly profit of $1.60 billion, or 91 cents a diluted share, excluding the cost of the company's merger with Nationsbank last fall, a performance in line with Wall Street's expectations.
After $441 million in merger-related charges, net income was $1.16 billion, or 66 cents a diluted share. For the period a year earlier, net income was $1.46 billion, or 81 cents a share, including a $220 million charge related to Nationsbank's earlier merger with Barnett Banks.
BankAmerica lost $201 million, or 7 cents a diluted share, before taxes on its business with Shaw, the securities firm and hedge fund. BankAmerica took over a $20 billion bond portfolio from Shaw. The bank sold more than $13 billion of that portfolio, incurring trading losses of $43 million. BankAmerica wrote down the value of a loan to Shaw by $158 million.
For all of 1998, BankAmerica, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., posted net earnings of $5.17 billion, or $2.90 a diluted share, compared with $6.54 billion, or $3.61 a share, in 1997.
Morgan's earnings fell 35 percent, to $175 million, or 86 cents a diluted share, compared with $271 million, or $1.33 a share, in the quarter a year earlier -- more than double analyst expectations of 38 cents a share.
Including an after-tax charge of $86 million for severance pay and consolidating the bank's real estate in Europe, profit fell 67 percent, to $89 million, or 42 cents a share.
For all of 1998, Morgan, which is based in New York, had net earnings of $963 million, or $4.71 a share, compared with $1.47 billion, or $7.17 a share, in 1997.
Fourth-quarter earnings for Bank One, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, rose 17 percent as profit from operations rose to $1.04 billion, or 88 cents a share, from $890 million, or 75 cents in the period a year ago, matching analyst estimates.
Net income fell 75 percent, to $226 million, or 19 cents a share, including one-time charges for the merger in October with the First Chicago NBD Corporation, a write-down of the value of its auto-leasing portfolio and the closing of some automated-teller machines.
Net earnings for all of 1998 were $3.12 billion, or $2.61 a share, compared with $2.96 billion, or $2.43 a share, in 1997.
Wells Fargo's profit from operations rose 18 percent, to $768 million, or 46 cents a diluted share, compared with $650 million, or 39 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier, in line with analyst estimates.
The bank, based in San Francisco, reported a net loss of $194 million, or 12 cents a share, for the fourth quarter because of charges from its merger with the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis in November.
Including unusual charges, Wells Fargo earned $1.95 billion, or $1.17 a share, in 1998, down from $2.50 billion, or $1.48 a share, in 1997.
Bank of New York said fourth-quarter earnings rose 5 percent, to $313 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with $298 million, or 37 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier, led by growth in its securities-processing businesses. The results met analyst forecasts.
For the year, Bank of New York's profit grew 8 percent, to $1.19 billion, or $1.53 a share, compared with $1.10 billion, or $1.36 a share, for 1997.

HEADLINE: Fleet Says Profit Rose in Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The Fleet Financial Corporation said today that its fourth-quarter profits rose 25 percent, to $416 million, assisted by growth in fee income and solid credit quality.
The Boston-based bank earned 69 cents a diluted share in the quarter, a penny better than forecast by analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation and higher than the 57 cents a share Fleet earned in the corresponding quarter a year earlier, after merger-related charges, it said. 
 "Fleet continues to benefit from strong asset generation, particularly in commercial banking, where loans were up 15 percent for the year," said Fleet's president, Robert Higgins. "Fleet's national businesses, including credit card and asset management, contributed to significant growth in fee income."
Fleet, which has about $104.4 billion in total assets, said noninterest income jumped 43 percent in the fourth quarter, to $890 million, with particularly robust growth in credit cards and capital markets revenues.
Strength in corporate finance fees, venture capital revenue, market-making activities at its Quick & Reilly unit and foreign exchange and interest rate products trading revenue drove capital markets revenue up to $161 million from $88 million, Fleet said.
Its net interest income rose to $1 billion in the fourth quarter from $944 million amid commercial loan growth.

HEADLINE: G.E. Reports 14% Profit Gain As It Does More Service Work

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn., Jan. 20

 BODY:
The General Electric Company, which makes everything from light bulbs to locomotives, said today that its fourth-quarter profit rose 14 percent as the company sold more industrial service contracts.
Net income climbed to $2.67 billion, or 80 cents a diluted share, compared with $2.35 billion, or 70 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The results matched analysts' expectations. Revenue rose 7 percent, to $28.6 billion from $26.7 billion. 
 For the year, G.E. said its profit climbed 13 percent, to $9.3 billion, or $2.80 a share, compared with $8.2 billion, or $2.46 a share. Revenue rose 11 percent, to a record $100.5 billion from $90.8 billion.
G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., increasingly generates profit and revenue by selling long-term service contracts with its industrial products, a strategy that insures steady revenue. Profit from service contracts tends to be more reliable than that from product sales, which can rise or fall with the economy. The contracts let G.E. lock in revenue over time. G.E. has a large base of installed equipment to service and provides service for other manufacturers' products.
About 70 percent of G.E.'s revenue comes from services, including those provided by its GE Capital finance unit, according to estimates by some analysts.
G.E. said services in 1998 at its industrial units rose more than 20 percent, though it did not break out a percentage of revenue that services now make up. Some analysts estimated it to be as much as one-third of sales.
Results were led in part by G.E.'s aircraft engine unit, the No. 1 maker of jet engines; its power systems unit, the No. 1 provider of power generation equipment and services; its medical systems unit, the No. 1 maker of MRI and CAT scan machines, and GE Capital.
That offset slower profit gains at the company's lighting, appliances, plastics and broadcasting units, including the NBC television network.
G.E. has also taken advantage of recessions in Asia, particularly at GE Capital, by snapping up companies at reduced prices or creating joint ventures, such as one it entered in February with Toho Mutual Life.
Last year, G.E. made 108 acquisitions -- including more than 70 outside the United States -- totaling more than $18 billion.
Shares of G.E., whose $328 billion market value is exceeded only by that of Microsoft, fell $1.0625, to $100.375. G.E.'s stock has climbed more than 33 percent in the last 12 months and has almost quadrupled in the five years ended Dec. 31.

Output Is Off at Car Makers in Japan

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Domestic production at the major Japanese auto makers fell in 1998 because of a prolonged domestic recession and economic turmoil in the rest of Asia, the manufacturers said today.
Toyota Motor, the nation's largest car maker, said its domestic production fell 9.6 percent, to 3.17 million vehicles last year. Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest, reported a 10.1 percent decline, to 1.55 million, while Mitsubishi Motors recorded a 12.8 percent drop, to 1.08 million. 
 Honda Motor and Mazda Motor, which is controlled by Ford Motor of the United States, recorded their first declines in three years. Honda's domestic production fell 4.8 percent, to 1.24 million vehicles, while Mazda's declined 3.5 percent, to 838,179.
Toyota's exports in 1998 declined 2.1 percent, to 1.46 million vehicles; Mitsubishi's dropped 5.2 percent, to 522,988, and those at Honda slipped 2.5 percent, to 530,717 vehicles.
Bucking the trend was Nissan, whose exports rose 2 percent, to 705,730, and Mazda, which exported 555,717 vehicles, 2.7 percent more than in 1997.

HEADLINE: Unprecedented Good Times

 BODY:
The current economic expansion will soon enter its ninth year, making it the longest peacetime expansion in American history. But it is unusual in more ways than length, as Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, emphasized in Congressional testimony yesterday.
Mr. Greenspan pointed to the unprecedented rise in stock prices. That has made it far cheaper and easier for American industry to raise capital, and it has contributed to a sense of well-being in this country. It also has led to President Clinton's proposal to have some Social Security money go into stocks, an idea Mr. Greenspan opposed out of fear of political influence in investment decisions. 
 As Mr. Greenspan pointed out, Government statistics show that Americans are saving far less than they were in 1992, when Mr. Clinton was running for President and complaining about poor economic performance, but are much richer as household net worth has risen about 50 percent. That has stimulated consumption, which remained strong even when economists were most alarmed about the threats from Asia's recession.
Mr. Greenspan insisted that, when the Fed cut interest rates last fall, "we were not attempting to prop up equity prices," but he knows that was one result, and he appears to be bothered by it. He warned that prices had risen further than profit growth would seem to justify. He voiced concern about the impact a falling stock market could have on consumer behavior and on the economy, and warned that protectionist trade measures could severely damage investor confidence.
Mr. Greenspan, along with most economists, expects the American economy to slow this year, but he conceded that there is as yet little evidence that is happening. Indeed, most sectors are booming. The country's huge trade deficit has so far had little impact because foreigners have been willing to finance it. In a time of international financial turmoil, American investments have seemed attractive to many, even with interest rates low.
There are sectors of the economy that are suffering -- largely the parts most sensitive to international weakness. Food prices are down substantially, hurting farmers. Producers of industrial materials such as steel are suffering from the reduced demand abroad, and many other manufacturers have seen orders and profits decline. But together, notes Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, those sectors employ about 20 percent of the work force. The rest are doing well.
This economic recovery began slowly in 1991, and now is going very strongly. That is the reverse of the normal process, and has surprised economists. But that very lack of predictability should make politicians hesitate as they decide what to do with the budget surpluses that have resulted. Assuming that the good times will continue indefinitely may be tempting, but it would also be foolish.

HEADLINE: Reducing Russian Dangers

 BODY:
No investment in American national security has paid higher dividends than the $2 billion Washington has spent over the last eight years to help Russia and other former Soviet republics dismantle nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. President Clinton was right, in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, to call for significantly increased spending on such programs. Congress, including members who oppose other foreign aid to Russia, should approve this White House request in full.
There is no longer any threat of Russia's deliberately attacking the United States. But Moscow's still-formidable stocks of nuclear bombs, nuclear ingredients and biological and chemical warfare agents pose a different kind of danger. Much of this material is inadequately secured, and the workers guarding it are paid poorly or not at all. That creates an unacceptably high risk that some material could be sold to potential aggressors like Iraq, Libya, North Korea or Serbia. Many Russian weapons scientists are also unemployed or unpaid and vulnerable to foreign recruitment. 
 Some of the $4.5 billion the Administration is requesting for the next five years would be used to speed the safe disposal of bomb plutonium and chemical and biological weapons stocks, and further improve security at storage sites. Washington would add new defenses against smuggling by helping Russia to establish better border controls and export monitoring. There would also be an expansion of efforts to re-employ scientists in civilian work.
During the cold war, the United States spent trillions of dollars to deter Russia from using its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. It would not take much more than $10 billion to eliminate most of the risks from those weapons today.

HEADLINE: U.N. Frees $81 Million for Iraq to Increase Its Electricity Supply

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The United Nations is releasing more than $81 million to Iraq to buy equipment to increase its supply of electricity, the director of the Iraqi relief program said today.
Iraq, which suffers frequent power shortages as power plants fail and electrical demand rises, applied to buy the necessary generating equipment last year, when the "oil for food" program was expanded to allow Iraq to begin rebuilding its crumbling public services. Sanctions and a more limited oil sales program had earlier prevented the Iraqis from replacing old equipment. 
 The bulk of the purchases, $74.9 million in gas turbines, will come from China, said Benon V. Sevan, director of all nonweapons projects for Iraq. Last year Iraq bought $70 million in power-generating equipment from a Russian company.
Under a separate program, the Security Council sanctions committee approved $6.5 million worth of contracts for oil industry spare parts to upgrade pumping equipment, officials said.
Washington opposes calls for a lifting of the embargo on Iraqi oil sales so that Baghdad can buy what it needs, although with international supervision.
Iraq has had difficulties in recent months raising enough money through permitted oil sales, since the international price of oil has plummeted. Money earned on oil sales goes into a United Nations-supervised escrow account.
Under the expanded oil sales program, even with prices low, Iraq has been able to buy equipment to repair its telephone system and place computers in schools.
But Iraq has not used $17 million set aside last year for fortified biscuits and milk for malnourished children and mothers, Mr. Sevan said today. And millions of dollars worth of medicine remains in warehouses.
In Washington today, the Clinton Administration took another step toward giving more support to Iraqi opposition groups. In a report to Congress, the White House designated seven organizations as permitted recipients of American financial support.
Among the groups is the Iranian-based Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution, led by Mohammed Bakr al-Hakim, a Shiite Muslim clergyman. The organization is considered most influential in the largely Shiite Iraqi south, where opposition to President Saddam Hussein is widespread.
In the past, United States administrations have been wary of backing Shiite groups because of their links to Iran. But relations with Iran are beginning to thaw slightly, making a gamble possible. Shiite Muslims account for about two-thirds of the Iraqi population, although Mr. Hussein's Government is dominated by Sunni Muslims.
Other groups eligible for American aid under a $97 million program created last year by Congress are the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition of opposition organizations; the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Popular Union of Kurdistan, both based in the autonomous Kurdish north of Iraq; the Movement for Constitutional Monarchy, led by the pretender to the Iraqi throne; the Iraqi National Accord, and the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan.
The Iraqi Communist Party, long a foe of Mr. Hussein, was not on the list.
Today 47 exiled Iraqi opposition leaders -- but not the major Kurdish parties in northern Iraq -- asked Arab foreign ministers who are planning to meet on Sunday in Cairo to lend their support to a campaign to overthrow the Hussein Government.

HEADLINE: Chancellor May Sell or Spin Off Some Units to Raise Share Value

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The Chancellor Media Corporation, soon to be the No. 1 owner of radio stations in the United States, said today that it might sell or spin off all or part of its businesses to raise its share value to that of its biggest rivals.
Company officials say they are frustrated by Chancellor's stock price, now about 16.7 times 1998 broadcast cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and corporate overhead. That compares with 24.9 for the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation and 27.2 for Clear Channel Communications Inc. 
 Chancellor was formed by the Dallas buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., which will own a 25 percent stake after planned purchases are completed. Chancellor stock traded as high as $57.375 last July and as low as $18.625 in October as investors worried that a slowing economy might hurt revenue. The stock has rebounded recently, though it still does not carry the same valuation as its competitors. Shares of Chancellor soared $9.1875, to $54.75.
"We can't help but compare ourselves to Infinity and Clear Channel," said Jeffrey Marcus, the company's president and chief executive. "We sell at multiples consistently less than they do. These are great companies, but so is ours."
Mr. Marcus said Chancellor might "end up selling a division or merging the entire company or selling the entire company." The company intends to proceed with all pending acquisitions, including the Capstar Broadcasting Corporation and the LIN Television Corporation, he said.
Chancellor said that it had asked the investment bank BT Alex. Brown Inc. to help it consider strategic options, including a possible sale.
Potential buyers might include Clear Channel, the Walt Disney Company or the General Electric Company, analysts said. Chancellor also might spin off one or more of its media businesses, similar to the CBS Corporation's public stock sale of Infinity for $2.87 billion.
Hicks, Muse formed Chancellor last year by combining the Evergreen Media Company and the Chancellor Broadcasting Company, both owned by Hicks, Muse. Thomas Hicks, the chief executive of Hicks, Muse, is also the chairman of Chancellor.
A sale of all of Chancellor could bring $65 to $70 a share, or $23 billion, based on analyst estimates, said Frank Bodenchak, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company.

HEADLINE: E-Mail to U.S. Lands Chinese Internet Entrepreneur in Jail

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 20

 BODY:
A court here sentenced a computer engineer to two years in jail today in a case watched closely by people monitoring official efforts to control China's growing use of the Internet.
The Shanghai No. 1 Intermediate Court ruled that Lin Hai, 30, committed a subversive act last year when he sent 30,000 Chinese E-mail addresses to VIP Reference, an electronic publication based in the United States that the Chinese authorities consider hostile to Beijing. 
 Mr. Lin, who was arrested last March, ran a software company that set up Web sites and offered other Internet-related services. Mr. Lin's wife, Xu Hong, said her husband was not interested in politics and had simply been exchanging E-mail addresses to build a database for his on-line business.
But prosecutors argued that the names provided by Mr. Lin had been used to distribute "large numbers of articles aimed at inciting subversion of state power and the socialist system."
VIP Reference, one of many electronic publications that distribute news about China, is compiled by Chinese democracy advocates in Washington. Editors of the newsletter say they send information to 250,000 E-mail accounts in China.
Efforts to restrict the exchange of political information on the Internet, these editors contend, are fruitless because of the volume and variety of electronic commerce.
Chinese officials formally embrace use of the Internet as a necessary part of efforts to modernize their economy and society. At the same time, special task forces monitor political content on the Internet and block some Web sites carrying information that Beijing deems unfriendly.
Although no one knows the true size of Internet use in China because many users share accounts, one recent official estimate said 2.1 million people in China were on the Internet by the end of 1998, up from 670,000 a year earlier.
In such a fast-growing environment, the case against Mr. Lin looks like a throwback to an earlier era, when Beijing had tighter control of the spread of information. It may also reflect a decision by the authorities to make an example of someone seen to be helping a publication like VIP Reference, if only indirectly.
Mr. Lin's two-year sentence, harsh by any international standard, is relatively light for a charge of political subversion in China. In a recent crackdown on efforts to set up a democratic political party, three leading dissidents were given sentences ranging from 11 to 13 years in prison.
In a country where the official media offer dull versions of the news, some Chinese on-line services feel freer to provide flashy news accounts that do not go through the same official censors as newspapers, television and radio.
Although the Communist authorities would clearly like to maintain their once-firm control over access to information, they are steadily becoming overwhelmed by the growth in more open communication -- by telephone, fax and now by Internet -- that has come with efforts to modernize China's economy.
The official New China News Agency reported today that a recent survey of young people, ages 14 to 28, found an overwhelming hunger for access to the Intenet. But 69 percent of those surveyed said they had no way to get on line.
Only 3.4 percent of the young people said they surfed the Internet regularly. At the same time, only 7 percent said they had no interest in the Internet, and 6 percent said they had not heard of it.
"There is still a long way to go before the Internet becomes truly popular among Chinese youth," the news agency concluded.

HEADLINE: The Name Behind Those Ping-Pong Balls

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
FIRST, to answer the most obvious question: Yolanda Vega does always say her name that way. "Hi," she said yesterday, and then without a trace of show biz: "I'm Yo-LAHNNN-da Vega!"
The woman who has become the smiling personification of fate for any New Yorker with a lottery ticket shook a reporter's hand in both of hers at the lottery's offices on Beaver Street in lower Manhattan, in the small room where the big cardboard checks are handed out. 
 She beamed exactly the way she does on television when she reveals the numbers on the airblown Ping-Pong balls. Then she sat down to explain, as she has in countless interviews since she began announcing the lottery results nine years ago, that she has absolutely no idea why she has become famous for the way she says her name.
"Many women have told me that the first word their little girls say is "LAAAHNNDAVEGA," she said. "It's melodic, I guess. It's got a rhythm. And I guess grown people like it because, by the way I say my name, I show I'm proud of who I am and happy doing what I do. But who knows? It's a crazy thing."
She is only one of five regular lottery number announcers, sharing air time at the lottery's Schenectady studios most nights of the week with Annette Collins, Judith Ortiz, Stephanie Moore and Kimberly Chapman. In New York City, they are watched by millions of viewers around 7:40 P.M. and around 11 P.M. on WABC, Channel 7.
But it is Ms. Vega, 43, who has become the Vanna White of the lottery drawings, invited to more charity events and panel discussions and onto the Oprah Winfrey show for a makeover. To capitalize on her following, lottery officials have even begun a contest -- the "I Want to Be Yolanda Vega" Sweepstakes -- in which applicants are invited to send, before Feb. 4, a videotape of themselves announcing lottery numbers.
The winner will get to announce winning numbers alongside Ms. Vega later this year.
"In the beginning it was a little weird with the other girls," she said yesterday. "I felt like: 'Oh, they should be here getting interviewed with me. They should be here on Oprah with me.' But they weren't and I was. And if it had been them, I would have been happy for them."
Now, she says, she feels a little like "Diana Ross leading the Supremes," and she has decided to be comfortable with it.
"I've been told -- and this is just what I've been told -- that out of all the drawing assistants, when I get out there, my eyes really shine. And the other girls, 'We don't see that shine in their eyes.' "
Ms. Vega, who grew up very poor in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the third of six daughters of Cruz and Marta I. Antequera, said her success has been all the more bewildering because she never had any desire to be on television. When she auditioned in 1990, she trembled as she read the numbers. ("I didn't even know how to put on makeup nine years ago -- I think I had blue eyeliner on.")
In fact, her only preparation for the lottery was that she was always great with numbers. She excelled in math at John Jay High School in Park Slope and earned a bachelor's degree in economics at Hunter College in 1977, becoming the first member of her family to graduate from college.
AFTER school, she took a series of bookkeeping jobs, and then met Miguel A. Vega, a security guard in Albany, while she was on a trip upstate to see her best friend.
Four years later, Mr. Vega had become a state trooper and they were married. She was working full time doing accounting jobs for a bagel maker in Albany, and she auditioned to become a lottery announcer simply to make some extra money for herself at a night job.
But when she became pregnant with her first child -- she now has two daughters, Gabriella Frances, 7, and Rebecca Isabel, 6 -- she quit her day job and, basically, became a full-time television announcer so she could spend more time with her children.
She is quick to point out that she is not paid what most people think of as television wages. As a state employee, she started out making $15 an hour and working 20 hours a week. She added, smiling at a lottery spokesman who sat across from her, "I don't make a whole lot more now."
"Everybody tells me, 'Wow, I'd like your job: what do you work, maybe two, three minutes a day?' " she said, rolling her eyes. "Let me tell you: first we have to set up the equipment and test it. There are lots of procedures to make sure it's working right. There's an auditor there every night. We do test runs to make sure it works. Then we do the drawing. Then we break the whole set down, go put it all away in the safe, and get out the next game. It's more involved than people care to believe."
But the job has unexpected perks. Her father-in-law, who lives in southern Puerto Rico, gets to see her several nights a week when he tunes in. "He watched me carry both of his granddaughters almost to full term -- on television," she said.
Her husband is sometimes not crazy about all the attention. "At work, they say: 'Trooper Vega? No, it's Mr. Yo-LAHNNN-da Vega.' " But she admits she kind of likes it.
"We were coming up the steps just now at Penn Station," she said, beaming, "and this little old Italian man sees me and goes, 'Yo-LAHNNN-da Vega! You gonna make me rich?"

HEADLINE: THE TRIAL OF THE PRESIDENT: THE SURPLUS;
$4.4 Trillion Windfall And Parties Square Off

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
After a yearlong transition in which both parties struggled to shift from an era of crippling Federal budget deficits to an anticipated age of fiscal plenty, the battle has at last been joined over how the country should allocate the flood of excess money streaming into Washington.
In an immediate sense, the debate is whether nearly all the surplus will be needed for the twin pillars of the social welfare system, Social Security and Medicare, as Democrats assert, or whether there is enough to take care of those looming problems and still return much of the surplus to the people in the form of tax cuts, as Republicans say. 
 In a broader sense, though, it is about the size and role of the Federal Government, a familiar ideological issue but one that has been seen for most of the last two decades through the prism of deficit reduction.
President Clinton changed that on Tuesday night in his State of the Union address. The headlines were about his proposal for shoring up Social Security, but Mr. Clinton was setting out to do something more than deal with the retirement system's future.
Mr. Clinton said the Government was going to take in $4.4 trillion more than needed to pay for current programs over the next 15 years, a previously undisclosed and staggeringly big windfall that, if it materializes, would be unlike anything the country has ever experienced. Roughly 60 percent of the money would come from excess payroll tax revenues that are earmarked for Social Security. The rest would be a true surplus, the difference between general tax revenues and what the Government would spend to maintain current programs at their existing levels.
Rather than just repeating his demand from a year ago that the projected surpluses be left untouched until Social Security's future is assured, Mr. Clinton laid out exactly how he would spend the money. Social Security was at the top of the list. But he also proposed using hundreds of billions of dollars for Medicare, unveiled a plan under which the Government would subsidize retirement savings accounts for low- and middle-income workers, and said he would set aside big sums for the Pentagon, education and other domestic programs.
In setting out his priorities, Mr. Clinton was moving into a policy vacuum that he had created last year with his "save Social Security first" strategy. But Republicans, who last year had been shy about advancing any big ideas because of their well-founded fears that they would be accused by Democrats of endangering Social Security, immediately made clear that they would be far less inhibited this year.
Seeking an issue as potent as Social Security to claim as their own, Republicans turned to the one idea that unites their fractious party, tax cuts, and proposed a plan that they say combines good economic policy with strong political appeal: reducing income tax rates by 10 percent across the board.
The result is that -- to the degree it is not consumed with Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial -- Washington will see a wide-ranging ideological debate this year over fundamentally different views of how the country should capitalize on its good fortune.
"The President essentially made the case that we should use this period of extra resources and prosperity to invest in the future and save to solve future retirement challenges," said Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy director. "The Republicans seemed to respond by suggesting we should go to across-the-board consumption. That's a good solid policy debate for the nation to have."
Mr. Clinton's view of an activist Government shoring up the social safety net programs played to the liberal wing of his party, but with a twist: He portrayed himself as the champion of austerity, dedicated to paying down the national debt to levels not seen since World War I.
Republicans said they were energized to make the case for a smaller Federal Government once again, a task that they admitted would be more difficult now that the discipline of reducing the deficit can no longer be the backbone of their argument. They said tax cuts would not only put more money back in the hands of the people out of whose paychecks it is coming but would help strangle the Federal bureaucracy and push power back closer to the people.
"After Ronald Reagan extended spending and borrowing a great deal in the 1980's, the deficit was a forced limit on the growth of Government," said Representative Nick Smith, Republican of Michigan. "Now that damper is sort of off, and we're going to have to make an upfront philosophical decision whether we want to reduce taxes and slow the growth of the Federal Government."
"We're faced with a situation where there's still a political advantage to coming up with programs that do new things for more people and spend more money," Mr. Smith said. "It's going to be a huge challenge even in the Republican ranks not to take advantage of spending some of that money on programs they think are important."
What remains unclear is whether the debate will lead to bipartisan deals on issues like Social Security, or simply allow the two parties to define what they stand for heading into the 2000 elections.
Having the debate serve as an electoral platform "is the more probable outcome, but that's not inconsequential by itself," said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, adding, "To frame the issue for debate and consideration in the election is worthwhile, and maybe some progress can be made toward resolving the issue in some way this year."
The optimistic scenario is that the surplus is so big, and the options for dealing with issues like Social Security so fluid, that there is plenty of room for a legacy-minded President and a Republican leadership eager to prove it can pass legislation to come to some accommodation this year.
The pessimistic scenario is that the battle over Mr. Clinton's removal from office has so poisoned the atmosphere in Washington that the two parties will never trust each other enough to join together in addressing politically sensitive issues. And without any consensus on how to use the surplus, it could gradually be eaten away by politically popular tax-and-spending programs from both sides.
"We have paid the price for running up huge deficits, and we have finally, with the help of good economic times as well as hard work by politicians, gotten past that," said Martha Phillips, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group. "Now we have to find a way for politicians to do their thing without going too far."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Falls 19.31 as Earnings News Prompts Profit Taking

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Shrugging off the latest caution by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, stock prices marched higher during the morning yesterday but then faded in the final hour or so and ended mixed.
Once again, technology stocks supplied much of the lift, spurred by the surprisingly strong profits reported by Microsoft after the markets closed on Tuesday. 
 But with the quarterly earnings season in full stride, investors seemed inclined to take profits on upbeat reports, with General Motors a prominent example. The auto giant's shares jumped as much as 4 points, to 92 -- practically double their low on Oct. 8 -- after announcing a big jump in earnings, only to slip back to 88 15/16.
And several Internet stocks, which have dazzled for so long, fell sharply.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.31 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,335.91, after rising nearly 125 points during the day. Nineteen of its 30 blue-chip components posted losses. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index followed a similar pattern but hung on to small gains. Nasdaq edged up 7.32 points, to 2,415.49, its second straight record, and the S.& P. 500 rose 4.62 points, to 1,256.62.
"The market valuation level scares a lot of people," said James W. Paulsen, chief strategist at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis. Nonetheless, he added, the economy is strong and stock prices relative to bond prices are still lower than they were last summer.
Mr. Greenspan was less blunt in his appraisal of the stock market, the subject of close scrutiny by policy makers these days. He told the House Ways and Means Committee yesterday that current valuation levels "would appear to envision substantially greater growth of profits than has been experienced of late."
But Mr. Greenspan, confirming widespread belief, also seemed to rule out raising interest rates despite an economy still growing rapidly.
"If you didn't have a global crisis, you'd be worried that the guy is setting himself for a tightening stance," said Mark C. Lapman, executive vice president of Independence Investment Associates in Boston. "But he can't do that at this point."
Analysts said that President Clinton's State of the Union Message, which included a proposal to invest Social Security money in stocks, was a modest plus yesterday. Tobacco stocks, however, tumbled because of the President's surprise announcement of a Federal lawsuit. Philip Morris fell 2 3/8, to 48 7/16.
Microsoft surged 7, to 162 5/8, while Dell Computer rose 3 3/16, to 85 5/16. Texas Instruments rose 6 5/8, to 99 5/8, after reporting improved profits.
"Strong earnings seem to be carrying the market," Michael Pendergast, managing director of HGK Asset Management in Jersey City, said before the late swoon.
But Internet stocks were weak throughout. Amazon.com skidded 26 13/16, to 113, its biggest decline since Aug. 31. Ebay fell 16 1/8, to 213 3/4; Yahoo was down 35 13/16, to 287 3/16; Broadcast.com dropped 17 3/8, to 120, and Excite slid 13 3/8, to 96 5/8.
Airline stocks were also pounded, with U S Airways falling 6 5/16, to 51 1/8, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, down 4 7/16, to 59 13/16, after both companies reported disappointing profits.
"You've got a bit of profit taking coming in here," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief strategist at Gruntal.
As these groups faltered, some stocks that had been under pressure of late rebounded. Among them were shares of drug companies, with Pfizer up 31 3/16, to 119 11/16, Lilly and Schering-Plough up more than 2 each and Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck each up more than a point.
New York Stock Exchange volume picked up to 906 million from 787 million Tuesday.
Stocks ending lower yesterday held a slim margin over those advancing, 1,587 to 1,478.
Overseas, stocks gained in nearly every major foreign market. Brazil's Bovespa surged 3.98 percent; Mexico's Bolsa was up 4.77 percent, and Germany's DAX index rose 3.15 percent. Lesser gains were 1.87 percent in Japan, 1.8 percent in France, 1.29 percent in Britain and two-tenths of a percent in Hong Kong.

Treasury Prices Fall
 By Bloomberg News
 Bond prices fell for a third session as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said there was little evidence the economy was losing steam, snuffing expectations for another interest rate reduction.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 12/32, to 101 7/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.17 percent, from 5.14 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Finance Commissioner to Head Grand Central Business Group

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
The Grand Central Partnership is expected to name Alfred C. Cerullo 3d, the city's Finance Commissioner, as its president today, further consolidating Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's influence over the business group, which oversees sanitation, security and other services in the area around Grand Central Terminal.
Mr. Cerullo, 37, will replace Daniel A. Biederman, who resigned in September as president of the group, under pressure from the Mayor. Mr. Giuliani had complained that Mr. Biederman amassed an unhealthy degree of power by managing two of the city's other private-public partnerships, which are known as business improvement districts or BID's, while heading the Grand Central group. 
 Last July, the city refused to renew its contract with the Grand Central Partnership, blocking the group's access to about $6 million collected from businesses within its boundaries. One month ago, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said that the city was within days of signing a new contract with the business group, but the organization continues to operate without one.
Last month, Bernard H. Mendik, who had been chosen by the Mayor as the interim chairman of the group, announced plans to reorganize it under a new name in order to purge it of board members loyal to Mr. Biederman. But those plans were rescinded after three board members resigned.
Mr. Cerullo, a former Republican leader of the City Council and a close ally of Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, was appointed Finance Commissioner in 1995 after serving as Commissioner of Consumer Affairs from 1994 to 1995.
Last year, the Mayor tried to put Mr. Cerullo in charge of the Times Square Business Improvement District, but ran into opposition. Brendan J. Sexton, the group's new president, praises his former rival as highly qualified. "He's friendly, funny and easy to deal with," Mr. Sexton said. "He's a BID type of guy, by virtue of his personality."
Mr. Cerullo, one of several candidates interviewed for the Grand Central job, was selected by the group's seven-member executive committee, which includes Mr. Mendik. Mr. Cerullo did not respond yesterday to a request for an interview. He is expected to assume his new post next month.
Victor A. Kovner, a former counsel to the Grand Central Partnership who subsequently represented several of the Biederman loyalists, said the appointment of Mr. Cerullo had ominous implications.
"I have nothing negative to say about Mr. Cerullo," Mr. Kovner said. "I gather that he's done a credible job. But for a BID to turn over to the Mayor's office in effect the picking of the president, the picking of the interim chair and the cleansing of certain disfavored directors, threatens BID's everywhere."
William G. Cohen, the executive vice president of Newmark & Company Real Estate, and a board member, said he was glad that the partnership was no longer a "headless horseman." But he said he hoped that Mr. Cerullo's government background would not make him ill-suited for a group that prides itself on efficiency.
"One of the reasons we've been able to make a difference," Mr. Cohen said, "is that we've operated from the mentality and mind-set of a private company. It's important to maintain that mind-set."

HEADLINE: U.S. Presents Documents in Case Against Microsoft

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The Government presented documents and E-mail in the Microsoft trial today as evidence for its allegation that the big software maker had imposed contract restrictions on personal computer makers to thwart competition.
The contracts imposed strict limits on Windows' opening "desktop," the screen that computer users see when they turn on their computers. These limits clearly upset some manufacturers who wanted to use the desktop to display their own brands or to feature factory-installed software -- often made by Microsoft's competitors. 
 In a memo to the Microsoft Corporation, an executive at the Hewlett-Packard Company complained about the restraints and concluded that if his company had any alternative to loading Microsoft's Windows operating system, "you would not be our supplier of choice."
Microsoft began imposing the restrictions in 1996, saying it had the legal right to do so and adding that the curbs helped consumers by insuring a "uniform Windows experience." But 1996 was also when Microsoft was struggling to catch up to the early leader in the Internet software market, the Netscape Communications Corporation, which pioneered the browser software used to navigate the World Wide Web.
At one point in court today, the Government also addressed the fact that on Tuesday, Microsoft reported a 75 percent jump in quarterly earnings, well ahead of expectations on Wall Street. David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, mentioned the earnings report in his cross-examination of the company's leadoff witness and asked if consistently high profits were an indicator of monopoly power.
The witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist and dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, conceded that persistently high profits suggest "some impediment to competitive alternatives." But such a barrier, he added quickly, could well be a very valuable asset, protected by intellectual property rights, like Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system.
"You simply cannot infer monopoly power from profits," Mr. Schmalensee said.
The Government contends that Microsoft's contracts were mainly intended to unfairly damage Netscape, not to benefit consumers. Microsoft used its monopoly power in the operating system market, the Government charges, to force computer makers to restrict how they could promote Netscape's browser.
To make that point, the Government cited a number of documents, including a Jan. 5, 1996, E-mail memo in which William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, stressed that increasing the company's browser share was a "very, very important goal." He also complained that some PC makers were displaying competing browsers on their machines "in a FAR more prominent way" than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
Later that month, an executive review of Microsoft's sales to PC makers during the previous six months noted that one of its missed opportunities was failing to impose "control over start-up screens."
Yet by May 1998, Microsoft was weighing dropping the contract curbs on some major PC makers in response to their complaints, and it later did. An internal E-mail written by Brad Chase, a Microsoft executive, however, noted that the reaction from the company's "antitrust team was negative." He continued, "Changes like this undermine our whole defense of Windows Experience."
Microsoft says that the Justice Department is selectively plucking comments from the more than three million pages of E-mail and documents the company has produced during the Government's investigation. The documents, taken out of context, may seem damaging but are not, according to Microsoft.
Throughout his cross-examination, which began last week, Mr. Schmalensee has held to his main themes -- that Microsoft's contracts are mostly garden-variety business deals, that friction and fights among business partners are to be expected, that Netscape has been able to distribute many millions of copies of its browser, and that consumers have benefited from Microsoft's practices.
Late this afternoon, Mr. Boies concluded his cross-examination with the kind of diverting exchange that occasionally brings some levity to the trial. Asked about Microsoft's profit margins on its operating system sales, Mr. Schmalensee replied that was difficult to determine precisely and that the company's internal accounting systems were not all that sophisticated.
Microsoft, he said, records "operating system sales by hand on sheets of paper." Since that struck many in the courtroom as odd for a leading producer of data-base and financial-spreadsheet software, people laughed aloud in the courtroom. Later, Microsoft executives said Mr. Schmalensee probably misspoke.
"What you saw in there," said William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, "was a trial lawyer looking for an exit line."

HEADLINE: THE TRIAL OF THE PRESIDENT;
The Rule of Law Protects the President, Too, a Counsel Tells the Senate

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the presentation today by Cheryl D. Mills, White House deputy counsel, on accusations of obstruction of justice in Article II in the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton:
 Over the course of the House managers' presentation last week, I confess I was struck by how often they referred the significance of the "rule of law." House Manager Sensenbrenner, for example, quoted President Theodore Roosevelt stating, "No man is above the law, and no man is below it." 
 As a lawyer, as an American and as an African-American, it is a principle in which I believe to the very core of my being. It is what many have struggled and died for, the right to be equal before the law, without regard to race or gender or ethnicity, disability, privilege or station in life. The rule of law applies to the weak and the strong, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the powerless.
If you love the rule of law, you must love it in all of its applications. You cannot only love it when it provides the verdict you seek; you must love it when the verdict goes against you, as well. We cannot uphold the rule of law only when it is consistent with our beliefs; we must uphold it even when it protects behavior that we don't like or is unattractive, or is not admirable, or that might even be hurtful. And we cannot say we love the rule of law but dismiss arguments that appeal to the rule of law, as "legalisms" or "legal hair-splitting."
I say all this because, not only the facts, but the law of obstruction of justice protects the President. It does not condemn him. And the managers cannot deny the President the protection that is provided by the law, and still insist they are acting to uphold the law.
His conduct, while clearly not attractive or admirable, is not criminal.
That is the rule of law in this case. . . .
So let's talk about the allegation of obstruction of justice, about the box of gifts that Ms. Currie received from Ms. Lewinsky. I want to begin by telling you another true story, the real story of the now-famous gifts.
It takes place on Dec. 28, 1997. On that day the President gave Ms. Lewinsky holiday gifts. During her visit with the President, Ms. Lewinsky has said that she raised the subpoena that she had received from the Jones lawyers on the 19th and asked him what should she do about the gifts.
The President has said he told her, whenever it was that they discussed it, that she would have to give over whatever she had. He was not concerned about the gifts, because he gives so many gifts to so many people. Unbeknownst to the President, however, Ms. Lewinsky had been worrying about what to do with the gifts ever since she got the subpoena. She was concerned that the Jones lawyers might even search her apartment, so she wanted to get the gifts out of her home.
After Ms. Lewinsky's visit with the President, Ms. Currie walked her from the building. Then or later, either in person or on the phone, Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Currie that she had a box of gifts that the President had given her that she wanted Ms. Currie to hold because people were asking questions. In the course of that conversation, they discussed other things as well, and Ms. Currie agreed to hold the box of gifts. After their discussion, Ms. Lewinsky packed up some, but not all, of the gifts that the President had given her over time. She kept out presents of particular sentimental value, as well as virtually all of the gifts he had given her that very day, on the 28th.
Ms. Currie went by Ms. Lewinsky's home after leaving work, picked up the box, which had a note on it that said, "Do not throw away," and she took it home. Ms. Currie did not raise Ms. Lewinsky's request with the President because she saw herself as doing a favor for her friend. Ms. Currie had no idea the gifts were under subpoena. And so Mrs. Lewinsky's request hardly struck her as criminal.
 
'A Selective Reading'
This story that I just told you is obviously very different from the story presented by the House managers. How can I tell such a story that is so at odds with that which has been presented by the House managers? The answer lies in a selective reading of the record by the House managers. But theirs is not the only version of the facts that can be told. . . .
Now, let's go through their story piece by piece. On Dec. 19, Monica Lewinsky was served with a subpoena in the Jones case. The subpoena required her to testify at a deposition in January 1998, and also to produce each and every gift given to her by the President. This statement is factually accurate. It does not, however, convey the entire state of affairs.
Ms. Lewinsky told the F.B.I. that when she got the subpoena, she wanted the gifts out of her apartment. Why? Because she suspected that lawyers for Jones would break into her apartment looking for gifts. She was also concerned that the Jones people might tap her phone. Therefore, she wanted to put the gifts out of reach of the Jones lawyers, out of harm's way.
The managers entirely disregarded Ms. Lewinsky's own independent motivations for wanting to move the gifts.
Let's continue. On Dec. 28, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky and the President met in the Oval Office to exchange Christmas gifts, at which time they discussed the fact that the lawyers in the Jones case had subpoenaed all the gifts from the President to Ms. Lewinsky. During the conversation on Dec. 28, Ms. Lewinsky asked the President whether she should "put away the gifts outside her house some place or give them to someone, maybe Betty." At that time, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President said, "Let me think about it."
The House managers have consistently described the Dec. 28 meeting exactly this way, as did the majority counsel for the House Judiciary, as did the Office of Independent Counsel.
It's been said so often that it's become conventional wisdom, but it is not -- it is not the whole truth. It is not the full record. Ms. Lewinsky actually gave 10 renditions of her conversation with the President. All of them have been outlined in our trial brief. Invariably, the one most cited is the one least favorable to the President. But even in that version, the one that is least favorable to the President, no one claims he ordered, suggested, or even hinted that anyone obstruct justice. At most, the President says, "Let me think about it." That is not obstruction of justice. . . .
You also may not have heard this version, and this is a juror speaking -- a grand juror speaking to Ms. Lewinsky:
The juror: "Now did you bring up Betty's name, or did the President bring up Betty's name?" And this is at their meeting on the 28th.
Ms. Lewinsky: "I think I brought it up. The President wouldn't have brought up Betty's name, because he didn't -- he really didn't discuss it." . . .
Why haven't we heard these versions? Because they weaken an already fragile circumstantial case. If Ms. Lewinsky says that the President didn't respond at all, then there's absolutely no evidence for the House managers' obstruction of justice theory, even under their version of events.
So these versions get discarded to insure that the House managers' big picture doesn't get cluttered by all those details. It's those facts, those stubborn facts that just don't fit.
But the most significant detail the managers discard because it doesn't fit is the President's testimony. The President testified that he told Ms. Lewinsky that she had to give the Jones lawyers whatever gifts she had. Why -- as the House managers predicted we would ask, because it is a question that begs to be asked -- why would the President give Ms. Lewinsky gifts if he wanted her to give them right back? The only real explanation is he truly was, as he testified, unconcerned about the gifts.
The House managers want you to believe that this gift-giving was a show of confidence, that he knew Ms. Lewinsky would conceal them. But then why, under their theory, ask Ms. Currie to go pick them up? Why not know that Ms. Lewinsky is just going to conceal them? Better still, why not just show her the gifts and tell her to come by after the subpoena date has passed? It simply doesn't make sense. The President's actions entirely undermine the House managers' theory of obstruction of justice.
But let's continue with their version of events: "That answer, the let-me-think-about-it answer, that answer led to action. Later that day, Ms. Lewinsky got a call at 3:32 P.M. from Ms. Currie who said, 'I understand you have something to give me' or 'The President said you have something to give me.' It was the President who initiated the retrieval of the gifts and the concealment of the evidence."
Here is where the House managers have dramatically shortchanged the truth, because the whole truth demands that Ms. Currie's testimony be presented fairly. In telling their story, the House managers do concede that there is a conflict in the testimony between Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie.
But they strive mightily -- they strive mightily -- to get you to disregard Ms. Currie's testimony by telling you that her memory on the issue of how she came to pick up the gifts was fuzzy. Fuzzy. In particular, Manager Hutchinson told you:
"I will concede there is a conflict in the testimony on this point with Ms. Currie. Ms. Currie in her grand jury testimony had a fuzzy memory, a little different recollection. She testified that the best she could remember, Ms. Lewinsky called her, but when she was asked further, she said that maybe Ms. Lewinsky's memory is better than hers on that issue." That's what the House managers want you to believe about Ms. Currie.
That's not playing fair by Ms. Currie. It's not playing fair by the facts. Why? Because Ms. Currie was asked about who initiated the gift pick-up five times. Her answer each time was unequivocal -- five times. From the first F.B.I. interview just days after the story broke in the media to her last grand jury appearance, Ms. Currie repeatedly and unwaveringly testified that it was Ms. Lewinsky who contacted her about the gifts. Her memory on this issue is clear. . . .
But what about that supposedly corroborating cell-phone call from Betty Currie to Monica Lewinsky on Dec. 28? The managers highlighted this call, which they claim is the call in which Ms. Currie told Ms. Lewinsky that she understood she had something for her, the gifts.
This, they say, is the linchpin that closes the deal on their version of the facts.
What the managers downplay, as Mr. Ruff discussed yesterday, is the fact that this call to arrange the pickup of the gifts, comes after the time Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly testified that the gifts were picked up by Ms. Currie.
In citing the cell-phone record as corroboration, they also disregard Ms. Currie's testimony that she picked up the gifts, leaving from work, on her way home. That would have been from Washington to Arlington. That is inconsistent with a call from Arlington.
Most significantly, the managers purposely avoided telling you about the length of the call. As Mr. Ruff pointed out yesterday, the call is for one minute or less.
According to Ms. Lewinsky's own testimony, when she spoke to Ms. Currie to arrange the gift pickup, they talked about other matters, as well as the box. They had a conversation. That's a lot of talk: "I have a box. When can you come pick it up? Where do you want me to meet you?" -- other chitchat. That's a lot of talk for a call that lasts one minute or less. . . .
 
No Evidence of a Threat
On Jan. 17, 1998, the President called Ms. Currie after his deposition and asked her to meet with him the following day. On Jan. 18, the President and Ms. Currie met, and the President told her about some of those surprising questions he had been asked in his deposition about Ms. Lewinsky. In the course of their conversation, according to Ms. Currie, the President posed a series of questions and made statements, including, "You were always there when she was there, right?""We were never really alone." "You could see and hear everything." "Monica came on to me, and I never touched her -- right?" And "She wanted to have sex with me, and I can't do that."
Our analysis of this issue could stop here. There is no case for obstruction of justice. Why? There is no evidence whatsoever of any kind of threat or intimidation. And, as we discussed, the U.S. Attorney's manual indicates that without a threat or intimidation there is no corrupt influence. Without corrupt influence there is no obstruction of justice.
But the evidence reveals much more. Not only does the record lack any evidence of threat or intimidation, the record specifically contains Ms. Currie's undisputed testimony, which exonerates the President of this charge. This is Ms. Currie's testimony, and is the fourth exhibit in your materials:
Q. Now, back again to the four statements that you testified the President made to you that were presented as statements, did you feel you were pressured when he told you those statements?
A. None whatsoever.
Q. Well, what did you think, or what was going through your mind about what he was doing?
A. At the time, I felt he was -- I want to use the word 'shocked' or surprised that this was an issue and he was just talking.
Q. That was your impression, that he wanted you to say, because he would end each of the statements with 'right,' with a question?
A. I do not remember that he wanted me to say, 'right.' He would say 'right?' and I would have said 'wrong.'
Q. But he would put each of these questions to you with a 'right,' and you could either say it was true or not true?
A. Correct.
Q. Did you feel any pressure to agree with your boss?
A. None.
The evidence on this issue is clear. There was no effort to intimidate or pressure Ms. Currie, and she testified that she did not feel pressured. Betty Currie's testimony unequivocally establishes that the managers' case lacks any element of threat or intimidation. There is no evidence, direct or circumstantial, that refutes this testimony. This is not obstruction of justice.
But let's not stop there. Let's look at the intent element of the obstruction of justice laws; in other words, whether the President had the intent to influence Ms. Currie's supposed testimony or potential testimony. In an attempt to satisfy this element of the law the managers overreached in their presentation to create the appearance that the President has the necessary specific intent. They argue that based upon the way he answered the questions in the Jones deposition he purposely referred to Ms. Currie in the hopes that the Jones lawyers would call her as a corroborating witness. Therefore, according to their theory he had the specific intent. The facts belie they are overreaching.
The House managers suggested to you that the President increased the likelihood that Ms. Currie would be called as a witness by challenging the plaintiff's attorney to question Ms. Currie. Her review of the transcript, however, shows that the President's few references to Ms. Currie were neither forced nor needlessly interposed. They were natural, appropriate. They were responsive.
Indeed the only occasion where he suggested that the Jones lawyers speak to Ms. Currie is when they asked him if it was typical for Ms. Currie to be in the White House after midnight. He understandably said, "You have to ask her" -- hardly a challenge. It's a reasonable response to an inquiry about someone else's activities.
The managers' conjecture about the President's state of mind, however, fails on an even more basic level. If you believe the managers' theory, if you believe that the President went to great lengths to hide his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, then why on earth would he want Ms. Currie to be a witness in the Jones case? If there was one person who knew the extent of his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky it was Ms. Currie. . . .
And even if the Jones lawyers had wanted to question Ms. Currie, it's highly unlikely they would have been allowed to do so given the posture of the case at that time.
Judge Wright ordered the parties in August of 1997 to exchange names and addresses of all witnesses no later than Dec. 5, 1997. Ms. Currie was not on their final witness list. Moreover, the cut-off date for all discovery was Jan. 30. By the time the President's deposition was over it was really too late to call Ms. Currie as a witness. . . .
The President was understandably concerned about media inquiries, a concern everyone who lives and serves in public eye likely can understand. In trying to prepare for what he saw as the inevitable media attention, he talked to Ms. Currie to see what her perceptions were and what she recalled. He talked to her to see what she knew.
Remember some of the questions that the Jones lawyers asked the President were so off-base -- for example, they asked him about visits from Ms. Lewinsky between midnight and 6 A.M., when Ms. Currie supposedly cleared her in. The President wanted to know whether or not Ms. Currie agreed with this perception or whether she had a different one; whether she agreed that Ms. Lewinsky was cleared in when he was present, or whether there may have been other occasions that he didn't know about.
He also wanted to assess Ms. Currie's perception of the relationship. She knew the first person who would be questioned about media accounts, particularly given that she was in the Internet report, was going to be Ms. Currie.
The House managers did the President a disservice in suggesting in the end that his five pages of testimony about why he spoke to Ms. Currie ultimately amounts to a forward sound bite of "to refresh his recollection." He obviously said a lot more. Why did they say that? Because they needed to establish intent. And the testimony and the facts do not show intent. That is the truth. That is all of the facts.
The President's intent was never to obstruct justice in the Jones case. It was to manage a looming media firestorm, which he correctly foresaw. As the President told the grand jury, "I was trying to get the facts and trying to think of the best defense we could construct in the face of what I thought was going to be a media onslaught." He was thinking about the media. That is the big picture. That is not obstruction of justice. . . .
Before I close, I do want to take a moment to address a theme that the House managers sounded throughout their presentation last week: civil rights. They suggested that by not removing the President from office, the entire house of civil rights might well fall. While acknowledging that the President is a good advocate for civil rights, they suggested that they had grave concerns because of the President's conduct in the Paula Jones case. And some managers suggested that we all should be concerned should the Senate fail to convict the President, because it will send a message that our civil rights laws and our sexual harassment laws are unimportant.
 
A Record of Civil Rights
I can't let their comments go unchallenged. I speak as but one woman, but I know I speak for others as well. I know I speak for the President. Bill Clinton's grandfather owned a store. His store catered primarily to African-Americans. Apparently his grandfather was one of only four white people in town who would do business with African-Americans, and he taught his grandson that the African Americans who came into his store were good people, and they worked hard, and they deserved a better deal in life.
The President has taken his grandfather's teachings to heart and he has worked every day to give all of us a better deal, an equal deal.
I'm not worried about the future of civil rights. I'm not worried because Ms. Jones had her day in court, and Judge Wright determined that all of the matters we are discussing here today were not material to her case and ultimately decided that Ms. Jones, based on the facts and the law in that case, did not have a case against the President.
I'm not worried because we've had imperfect leaders in the past and we'll have imperfect leaders in the future. But their imperfections did not roll back nor did they stop the march for civil rights and equal opportunity for all of our citizens. Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. -- we revere these men. We should. But they were not perfect men; they made human errors. But they struggled to do humanity good.
I'm not worried about civil rights, because this President's record on civil rights, on women's rights, on all of our rights is unimpeachable.
Ladies and gentleman of the Senate, you have an enormous decision to make, and in truth, there is little more I can do to lighten that burden. But I can do this, I can assure you that your decision to follow the facts and the law and the Constitution, and acquit this President will not shake the foundation of the house of civil rights. The house of civil rights is strong because its foundation is strong. And with all due respect, the foundation of the house of civil rights was never at the core of the Jones case, it was never at the heart of the Jones case.
The foundation of the house of civil rights is in the voices of all the great civil rights leaders and the soul of every person who heard them. It's in the hands of every person who folded a leaflet for change, and it's in the courage of every person who changed. It's here in the Senate, where men and women of courage and conviction stood for progress; where senators, some of them still in this chamber, some of them who lost their careers, looked to the Constitution, listened to their conscience, and then did the right thing. The foundation of the house of civil rights is in all of us who gathered up our will to raise it up and keep on building.
I stand here before you today because others before me decided to take a stand or, as one of my law professors so eloquently says, "because someone claimed my opportunities for me" by fighting for my right to have the education I have, by fighting for my right to seek the employment I choose, by fighting for my right to be a lawyer, by sitting-in and carrying signs, and walking long marches, riding freedom rides and putting their bodies on the line for civil rights. I stand here before you today because America decided that the way things were was not how they were going to be. We the people decided that we all deserved a better deal.
I stand here before you today because President Bill Clinton believed I could stand here for him.
Your decision whether to remove President Clinton from office, based on the Articles of Impeachment, I know will be based on the law and the facts and the Constitution. It would be wrong to convict him on this record. You should acquit him on this record. And you must not let imagined harms to the house of civil rights persuade you otherwise.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
A Japanese Giant's Not-So-Subtle Courtship

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 20

 BODY:
FOR SALE: A piece of the world's sixth-largest car company. Excellent engineering and technical capabilities. Some $20 billion in debt, but a fixer-upper with promise. Interested parties may apply to Yoshikazu Hanawa, president of the Nissan Motor Company.
Mr. Hanawa has embarked on a sales campaign never before seen in Japan and perhaps in the world. Nearly every day for more than a week, Nissan's leonine president has been hawking his company, welcoming one and all to make a bid. 
 It's not exactly the subtle tap on the shoulder one would expect from a Japanese executive, but then, these are not subtle times for Nissan. The company's predicament -- carrying a staggering amount of debt at a time when it has lost ground in its two major markets, Japan and the United States -- is glaringly obvious, and the stronger yen and rising Japanese interest rates have only increased pressure on the company to act.
So far, Renault S.A., the rejuvenated French car company that is reaping the fruits of a corporate overhaul, is the only potential partner that has publicly acknowledged an interest in the company. After Nissan's operation in Britain leaked news of the overtures, Renault confirmed that it was indeed talking to Nissan -- and other car makers.
Last year, Renault embarked on an extended fact-finding mission on several Japanese vehicle manufacturers, according to bankers, including the Suzuki Motor Corporation and Fuji Heavy Industries, a Nissan affiliate. "Clearly, they're interested in Japan, but what in Japan, no one knows for sure," one banker said.
After subtracting debt, Renault has cash of about $1 billion, according to analysts, which would buy it a little more than 10 percent of Nissan at current market prices.
Shares of Nissan here have edged up 3.5 percent this week. In New York, its American depository receipts -- each representing two shares of the company -- closed today at $7.25, down 25 cents.
Under Japanese law, a shareholder must own at least 33.4 percent of a company to win board representation and veto power, and given Nissan's well-documented history of foot-dragging, a potential buyer would presumably want that kind of control at the minimum.
That does not mean a purchase is out of the question. Renault could, of course, use new shares as currency, but that would not help Nissan pay down debt and would dilute the holdings of Renault's shareholders.
DaimlerChrysler A.G. and the Ford Motor Company have also been rumored to have an interest in Nissan. Speculation that Jurgen E. Schrempp, a chairman of DaimlerChrysler, is taking an offer with him to Tokyo, where he is attending an exhibition of Daimler technology at the end of this week, is rampant.
Neither DaimlerChrysler nor Ford has sought to dispel such speculation, but Nissan has said it has yet to receive any offer. Indeed, the company has quite directly said it has as yet had no concrete discussions about any kind of equity purchase with anyone.
DaimlerChrysler clearly has designs on the global market, and Asia remains a huge gap in its plans. Mercedes-Benz cars continue to sell well in Japan despite the recession, and Chrysler has built test models of slimmed-down minivans that would be perfect for the Japanese market. Conceivably, some of Nissan's excess capacity, currently at about 35 percent, could be switched to production of Mercedes and Chrysler vehicles.
DaimlerChrysler has been negotiating with Nissan since May over the disposition of the Nissan Diesel Motor Company, a troubled truck maker in which Nissan owns a 39.8 percent stake. The negotiations have dragged on and on -- first, because DaimlerChrysler wanted more detailed financial information and, second, because the information it obtained made it wary.
DaimlerChrysler is now more comfortable with the numbers, but it has asked Nissan Diesel's bankers, led by the Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank, to forgive some of the truck maker's debt. Debt forgiveness is not unheard of in Japan, but it is unusual.
Nissan is expected to hold a news conference on Friday, but it has no plans at this point to announce a sale of Nissan Diesel to DaimlerChrysler.
Ford already has a relationship with Nissan. It produces some Nissan vehicles in the United States in an alliance that has been so-so for both partners, and it rents Nissan's shuttered Zama production plant southwest of here and uses it as an inspection site for its cars.
But it also owns 33.4 percent of the Mazda Motor Corporation, a company once caught in the same bind that now grips Nissan, but on a much smaller scale. Ford won the right to install its own executives and has managed to cut costs without layoffs, which are anathema in Japan. Mazda has cut procurement costs, frozen wages and paid down debt, making more gross profits a car now than it did a few years ago.
Having gone through such an exercise, does Ford now want to do it again on a much grander scale? Does it need to?
Mr. Hanawa has some goodies to sell that would be attractive to any buyer. For starters, Nissan presents a golden opportunity to establish a rather large beachhead in Asia.
And despite its problems, Nissan is still respected for its engineering prowess and technological skills. Nissan boasts some 150 alliances with car makers around the world that have sought its engineering expertise. Its strained budget has been most apparent in the design of its cars, which has been, in a word, boring, but their quality and performance is still among the best in the world.
What is more, the company owns big chunks of real estate that were acquired decades ago and are still carried on the books at more or less their original prices. It also has a hefty stock portfolio.
Jay N. Woodworth, an independent auto analyst, has scoured the company's Japanese financial statements. He believes the company values its total fixed assets and real estate at about $7.5 billion, which he regards as being well under their present value.
But it will take a lot of sales to put a dent in Nissan's debt, which ranges between $24 billion -- excluding potential leasing liabilities -- and $39 billion if those liabilities are included.
Christopher Redl, an analyst who follows auto parts makers at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo, has a novel suggestion for potential buyers. "If people are interested in Nissan's technology, they should consider buying one of its parts makers," he said. "That's where the technology resides anyway."

Not so long ago, Chicago's public schools were considered the worst in the nation. But in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday, President Clinton held them up as a model.
Specifically, Mr. Clinton singled out the Chicago system's eliminating the practice of promoting students even if they did not meet their grade's academic standards, just so they could stay with their age, or social, group. He praised Chicago's decision three years ago to force students who do not have basic math and English skills to attend summer school, and to make them repeat a grade if they do no better by the end of the summer. 
 Mr. Clinton seemed to suggest that these policies accounted for the fact that student test scores in the Chicago school system have been rising for the last three years. But, as with most issues in education, the reality is more complex.
Chicago's ending of the schools' so-called social promotion is only one part of a major overhaul of the country's third-largest school system, something the city has been able to accomplish largely because the Illinois Legislature in 1995 gave Mayor Richard M. Daley extensive control over the schools. He appointed his budget director, Paul Vallas, as the school system's new chief executive officer, and Mr. Vallas has set about trying to make the public schools work with the efficacy of a business.
Among other things, Mr. Vallas and a school board, also appointed by the Mayor, have revamped the school system's budget, removed principals from some failing schools and put more resources into programs like early childhood education. More than 100 schools were put on academic probation and told to improve; now only 58 remain on the list.
Mr. Vallas, a former teacher, believes that the elimination of social promotion is another important part of the package.
"Social promotion kills an educational system," he said. "When we came in, 9,700 of the previous year's 27,000 graduates were reading at sixth-grade level or below. If you're a teacher, what are you to do? You have to lower your standards. You have to dummy down the curriculum. The children who are behind never get caught up. The children at grade level get taught to inferior standards."
Yet, as other cities follow Chicago's example, experts say it is still too early to rate the effectiveness of the policy against social promotion.
Begun with just eighth graders in 1996, it now applies to third, sixth and ninth graders as well. If students do not score above a cutoff on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills or, in ninth grade, if they fail subjects like math and reading, they are required to go to summer school. If they still do not pass, they must repeat the grade and receive at least an hour of extra instruction each day.
About a quarter of the students in these grades were required to attend summer school last year -- about the same percentage as in previous years. The results were not universally encouraging.
Of the 10,000 third graders who attended mandatory summer school, 5,500 are now repeating third grade, said Blondean Davis, the school system's Chief of Operations. Of those, 964 are repeating third grade for a second time.
In the sixth and eighth grades, the results were a little better, with just under 40 percent of the mandatory summer-school students held back a grade. Dr. Davis said the eighth-grade results were not quite as disappointing, however, because eighth-graders had a higher minimum test score this year.
Still, "the hopes have been that far larger numbers of kids going through the summer school would move from scores that weren't adequate up to the promotion level," said G. Alfred Hess, the director of Center for Urban School Policy at Northwestern University.
Professor Hess said that while the program seemed to have helped many students, "larger proportions than any of us had hoped have not made it to that level."
He said it was not yet clear whether the policy had yielded another hoped-for benefit: that the threat of going to summer classes and being held back would force students to take school more seriously.
The Chicago policy has its critics.
"It's a grossly unsuccessful policy," said Suzanne Davenport, the acting executive director of Designs for Change, a school reform, research and advocacy organization in Chicago. "Of all the things to quote about improvements in the Chicago school system, this is not what we would pick out."
Ms. Davenport said her organization did not advocate social promotion. But she said some studies showed that holding students back a grade did not help.
"Even if kids show any short-term gains, they don't last very long," she said. "And secondly, students are much more likely to drop out if they are held back."
The solution, she said, was significantly improving other aspects of the schools, like curriculum, teaching, class size. Struggling students should be promoted, she said, but given extra help in their new grade.
At one Chicago school today, teachers said they supported mandatory summer school and the end of social promotion.
"A lot of older kids see retention as a reality, all of a sudden, and it has lit a fire under a lot of them," said Julie Hines, a computer teacher at Louis J. Agassiz Elementary School on the North Side.
James Starzynski, a reading specialist and curriculum coordinator at the school, said: "I think it took a lot of courage to do such a thing, but the alternative is awful. You can't have 16-, 17-, 18-year-old social and economic liabilities walking around the streets of Chicago."

HEADLINE: Envoys Flock to Milosevic To Tackle Crisis He Created

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Jan. 20

 BODY:
While NATO tried to convince the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, that the alliance is serious about using force against him, Western diplomats continued to flock here today to urge him to defuse a crisis he himself created.
Mr. Milosevic is back in the headlines after what the Clinton Administration is calling a mass killing of ethnic Albanian civilians on Friday in the Serbian province of Kosovo. 
 In some ways, it is a delicious moment for the Yugoslav leader, some senior Western diplomats here concede. He has thrown down the gauntlet to the West and is orchestrating anti-Western diatribes in the Serbian press, accusing Western officials of being unfair and too quick to believe propaganda from Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
At the same time, the United States and its allies are sending him envoys, pressing him to make relatively easy concessions that will allow them to avoid using force, which Mr. Milosevic doubts they are willing to do in any event. Even American officials say they have real doubts, as was the case with Iraq, of what policy would follow any air strikes.
Mr. Milosevic sent away NATO's top military commanders with very little after a seven-hour meeting on Tuesday. After the generals, Wesley K. Clark, the NATO commander, and Klaus Naumann of Germany, left on Tuesday, more envoys followed.
Aleksandr Avdeyev, Russia's First Deputy Foreign Minister, has been here, as has a senior State Department official, James Pardew. The American negotiator, Christopher Hill, who is also the Ambassador to Macedonia, is about to arrive, and he will be followed by Knut Vollebaek, the Norwegian Foreign Minister who is the current chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, known as the O.S.C.E.
Mr. Milosevic is also leaving himself room to maneuver and back down, the diplomats noted. The case of William Walker, the American head of the O.S.C.E. monitoring mission in Kosovo, is one example.
He accused Serbian forces of the killing of at least 45 ethnic Albanians in the village of Racak, and in turn was accused by the Serbian propaganda machine of partiality. On Tuesday he was ordered to leave within 48 hours. That order was extended by another 24 hours after the organization, whose members include Russia, demanded that Mr. Milosevic allow Mr. Walker to remain.
It appeared tonight that Mr. Milosevic would let Mr. Walker stay, a senior Western diplomat said, at least as long as negotiations with the West continued. "As usual, if Milosevic concedes, it will be on an issue that he created," the diplomat said.
Mr. Vollebaek today ordered Mr. Walker, to keep working despite the deportation order, and Mr. Walker returned to Kosovo.
But Serbian officials here echoed accusations made in the Government-controlled press that the West had rushed to judgment on the killings in Racak, arguing that the 45 victims had been killed in fighting, not in cold blood, and that ethnic Albanians of the Kosovo Liberation Army later mutilated the bodies, changed their clothing and dumped them in one spot to be discovered.
While such charges have been dismissed out of hand by American officials, French officials say they are taking them more seriously, while urging the kind of international forensic investigation Washington also wants. The Serbs have agreed to allow some Finnish forensic scientists to see at least some of the bodies found in the village last week.
Washington and the West are also insisting that Mr. Milosevic resume full cooperation with international agencies in Kosovo, by living up to the cease-fire agreement he signed with the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, last October and by allowing the tribunal investigating war crimes in the former Yugoslavia access to Kosovo.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
G.M.'s Profit Rose 7.7% in Fourth Quarter

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation today announced an unexpectedly large increase in profits during the fourth quarter of last year, as the very strong American auto market and the company's continued recovery from last summer's strike more than offset losses in Latin America and East Asia.
G.M.'s profits rose 7.7 percent, to $1.77 billion, during the fourth quarter, but fell 53.2 percent, to $2.96 billion, for all of last year because of a 54-day strike in June and July at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich. The strike forced the auto maker to close almost all of its assembly plants in North America. 
 The company's fully diluted earnings per share reached $2.61 in the fourth quarter, up 12 percent. Excluding a long list of one-time losses, G.M.'s earnings were $3.25 a share, easily beating the Wall Street analysts' average estimate of $2.65 a share, according to First Call.
Shares of G.M. rose to an all-time high after the earnings were announced. They closed at $88.9375, up 93.75 cents.
G.M.'s robust fourth-quarter results reflected exuberant sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the United States and continued profits in Europe. Because the Ford Motor Company also depends heavily on the American and European markets, G.M.'s results make it likely that Ford will also report healthy profits when it releases its earnings on Thursday.
"The regions of the world that are strongest happen to be where we are strongest," J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said in an interview today.
The North American auto market produced $1.58 billion in profits for G.M. in the fourth quarter, while European car operations generated another $146 million in profit, allowing the company to prosper despite economic troubles in emerging markets. By contrast, G.M.'s East Asian automotive division lost $213 million in the fourth quarter while operations in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, previously very profitable, lost another $212 million.
Last summer's strike reduced G.M.'s full-year, after-tax profits by "at least $2 billion," Mr. Losh said. While G.M. had declared strike-related losses totaling $2.5 billion during the second and third quarters of last year, John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, had predicted in August that the company would be able to reduce that to $2 billion by the end of the year by building extra cars and trucks in the fourth quarter.
But Mr. Losh said that G.M. had not been able to catch up as much as expected during the fourth quarter because Americans bought cars and light trucks at a torrid pace. Indeed, last month had the highest seasonally adjusted annual rate of new auto sales in the United States since December 1986.
As a result, G.M. factories in North America will continue to produce cars and trucks at a brisk tempo in the first quarter, usually a slow season, Mr. Losh said. Whether the strike cost G.M. $2 billion or even more, it still remains easily the most expensive strike in American history, before adjusting for inflation.
Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at ING Baring in the New York, said that G.M.'s strong fourth-quarter profits were likely to spill over into the first quarter because G.M. will be catching up on full-size pickup truck production, which is very profitable. Unlike past periods of prosperity, G.M. is also continuing to cut costs aggressively, Ms. Keller said, adding that she had raised her estimate of G.M.'s 1999 profits to $8.75 a share from $8.25 a share.
G.M. earned $4.18 a share in 1998 and $8.62 a share in 1997. G.M.'s sales also fell last year, to $161.32 billion from $171.18 billion.
G.M., which had cash reserves of $14.1 billion on Dec. 31, announced today that it would resume a $4 billion share buyback program soon and finish it this year. G.M. had suspended the program last summer because of the strike, after spending only a third of the $4 billion.
G.M.'s fourth-quarter earnings included $420 million in one-time, after-tax charges. These mostly reflected early retirement programs, but included a $97 million charge in G.M.'s East Asian automotive division that was caused partly by the need to replace equipment at a factory in Thailand.
Delphi Automotive Systems, G.M.'s wholly owned auto parts subsidiary, earned $88 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a $508 million loss in the period a year earlier, as smaller one-time charges more than offset a deterioration in operating results. Delphi plans an initial public offering of a 17.7 percent stake in itself this spring, and to become completely separate from G.M. by the end of this year through a distribution or exchange of shares.

HEADLINE: Limousine Company Signs Union Contract

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In a breakthrough in one of New York City's largest unionization drives in decades, the machinists' union has signed a contract on behalf of nearly 700 drivers at one of the city's largest black-car companies, Elite Limousine Plus.
With the union seeking to organize the city's more than 12,000 black-car drivers, labor experts said the agreement with Elite could pave the way for most of the city's 41 other black-car companies to sign union contracts. 
 Elite had long led the battle against unionization attempts, taking the fight to the courts and the National Labor Relations Board, but now it has become the first large limousine company to sign a labor contract.
The International Association of Machinists reached the contract with Elite last weekend after a two-year battle in which most drivers voted to unionize. The company had refused to accept the union, asserting that the drivers were not employees, but independent contractors.
"It's a very important agreement in this industry, and it will get this whole industry off on the right track and help get other companies organized," said James Conigliaro, assistant director of the machinists' union for metropolitan New York.
Under the contract, the drivers will gain two coveted benefits: health insurance and free legal services, providing legal consultation and representation in their many disputes with the Taxi and Limousine Commission. In addition, Elite agreed to set up a grievance and arbitration system and to stop imposing fines on drivers -- they sometimes faced $100 fines for failing to wear a tie or a white shirt.
The contract covers a group of drivers, most of them immigrants, who say that they, notwithstanding their shiny limousines and suits, barely make enough to support their families. Even though many drivers work 70-hour weeks, they often net just $20,000 a year, after subtracting the cost of the car, insurance, gasoline, repairs and parking tickets. The drivers own their cars and set their own hours, while the companies provide a dispatching service and issue many rules on how they are to do business.
Shafquat Chaudhary, Elite's president, said in an interview that one of the main factors pressuring him to sign the contract was his desire to reduce turnover among the drivers working for him.
"We have been looking at ways to create some kind of benefits for the drivers," Mr. Chaudhary said. "It's a tough job, long hours. We would like to create an atmosphere where the drivers would like to stay."
Kevin Lynch, the machinists' organizing director in New York, said, "In the industry today, the most difficult thing is holding onto drivers. Doing a contract with the union will make it easier for Elite to hold onto its drivers."
Mr. Chaudhary acknowledged that he hoped the contract would help Elite grow faster by persuading drivers at other companies to move to Elite because they want health-care coverage.
Union officials predicted that other limousine companies would seek to avoid such an exodus of drivers to Elite by agreeing to sign similar labor contracts.
The contract also provides the drivers with $5,000 in life insurance and places a cap on the fees Elite receives from drivers. Elite now takes slightly more than one-fifth of each driver's daily gross.
Shaikh Nadeem, a Pakistani immigrant who drives for Elite, said: "I think it's a very good contract. It's very good benefits on some of the things drivers have been looking for for so long."
In 1997, Elite's drivers voted 218 to 117 to join the machinists, but the company refused to negotiate, asserting that the drivers were contractors, not employees. In November 1997, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against the company, saying that the drivers were employees.
But until recently, the company continued to refuse to bargain.
The new agreement skirts the issue of whether the drivers are employees or contractors, enabling the company to continue to insist they are independent contractors. If the workers are contractors, the company does not have to pay taxes for Social Security, unemployment insurance or workers' compensation.
A. Michael Weber, Elite's lawyer, said: "They're not employees. That's always been Elite's position. We believe then and now they're independent contractors."
Drivers at two other large limousine companies -- Prime Time and Telecar -- have voted on whether to unionize, but the votes have been impounded pending a labor board determination on whether the drivers are employees or contractors.
At another black-car company, Last Radio Group, the drivers voted decisively in favor of unionizing, but the company has resisted the effort, insisting that the workers are contractors.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Clinton's plan for Social Security has its backers. But does America want the Government to be a big shareholder?

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
President Clinton's proposal to shore up the financially shaky Social Security system leans heavily on a leading Republican plan. He would grab trillions of dollars of general tax revenue and invest some of it in the stock market. The plan is attractive, since neither Mr. Clinton nor the Republicans would need to propose higher payroll taxes or reductions in retirement benefits. On this feature, Democrats and Republicans easily agree.
But under Mr. Clinton's plan, the Government would own stocks. The leading Republican plan, proposed by Prof. Martin Feldstein of Harvard and backed by Senator Phil Gramm and others on Capitol Hill, would turn the general revenue over to individuals for deposit into their own investment accounts. Therein lie profound political and financial differences. 
 The retirement of the baby boomers early next century combined with their increased longevity will throw Social Security into deficit. The Administration proposes to balance the books by tapping Federal surpluses that it expects will total about $4.4 trillion over the next 15 years. Mr. Clinton aims to pump about $2.7 trillion of that amount into the trust fund. About $700 billion of the $2.7 trillion would be invested in stocks. Under current law, the entire trust fund is invested in low-yielding Government bonds.
The combination of new revenue and return on stock investments would be expected to generate enough money to eliminate deficits in the program for the next 50 years or so.
The proposal has the political virtue of closing the deficit in Social Security without cutting retirement benefits. And by preserving the central feature of the current system -- paying benefits entirely out of public funds -- it avoids certain pitfalls of private accounts. The plan would pay retirees a benefit based on their lifelong earnings, not on the vagaries of stock and bond market returns. It would preserve the ability to transfer money from high- to low-paid workers. And the costs of administering a single public fund are very low compared with those of setting up 150 million individual accounts.
But the plan solves those financial problems by creating a severe political problem. The Administration estimates that the Government would come to own 4 to 5 percent of the value of shares on Wall Street. The danger is that Congress will meddle, for example steering Federal dollars into environmentally friendly companies rather than, say, tobacco companies, which were a target of Mr. Clinton's speech on Tuesday night.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, added his weight to the critics yesterday.
"I do not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from Government direction," Mr. Greenspan said in Congressional testimony. "I am fearful that we would use those assets in a way that would create a lower rate of return for Social Security recipients."
Michael J. Boskin, chief economist to President George Bush, rejects the Clinton plan as "politically naive."
"Congress," Mr. Boskin said, "will simply not stand by and let huge surpluses accumulate without spending them. Congress is much less likely to tamper with private accounts."
Economists point out that investing Social Security revenue in stocks would not in and of itself affect the nation's savings rate or raise future living standards. It would merely shuffle stock out of accounts of private investors and into a public account. But, as a recent report from a panel of the National Academy of Social Insurance pointed out, the shuffle would have an important impact nonetheless.
Wealthy families, the report observes, need not care if the public trust fund invests their payroll contributions in stocks, because they can invest their private savings in stocks, reaping the high rate of return that stocks have historically provided. But most families save and invest very little. The only way their retirement income can reflect the value of investing in stocks is if the Government does the investing for them. Mr. Clinton's proposal to invest some of the trust fund in stocks brings the benefit of stock investing to a larger swath of American families.
Whatever the financial merits, though, the Administration is left with Chairman Greenspan's political demerit. Here the Administration has a plausible response provided by two economists at the Brookings Institution. Those economists, Henry Aaron and Robert Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, outline safeguards that they say would insulate stock purchases from political interference.
The basic idea is to create a board that would turn the Social Security money over to private managers of widely diversified mutual funds. No Government official would have any say over actual purchase decisions. Mr. Boskin remains unconvinced. Congress can build whatever fire walls Mr. Aaron and Mr. Reischauer want, he says, "but in the end Congress can tear them down."
Mr. Clinton's Social Security plan was proposed in the context of a larger budget plan that places other claims on future surpluses. About $500 billion of the $4.4 trillion would be used to help create individual retirement accounts that would be separate from Social Security. The White House envisions contributing, say, $100 into accounts for low- and middle-income families. Families that add more would have their contributions partly matched by the Government.
The obvious purpose behind the idea is to encourage families to save more for retirement, the best way to raise future living standards. But the Administration also wants to use these individual accounts to blunt the Republicans' fervor for setting up private accounts as part of Social Security. The virtue of keeping the accounts separate from Social Security, the Administration hopes, is that they will not provide a ready excuse for cutting benefits under the Social Security program, or lead to a cascading momentum that drives Social Security increasingly away from a public plan to a private plan.

HEADLINE: Study Urged On Cancer And Races

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The National Institutes of Health needs to develop a broader strategy for finding out why poor people and some ethnic minorities are more prone to certain cancers and less likely to survive them than is the rest of the population, an expert panel said today.
The institutes, the Federal agency that sponsors most of the nation's medical research, needs to expand the study of why ethnic and racial groups are disproportionately affected by cancer and make certain that minority groups are adequately represented in research trials, the panel said in a report. 
 The 15-member committee of medical, health and research experts, convened by the Institute of Medicine, said the effort to understand the impact of cancer on subgroups in the population would be helped by discarding traditional racial categories and studying people on the basis of their ethnic and economic backgrounds.
Use of the term "race" is scientifically inaccurate because it implies fundamental biological differences among groups that do not exist and masks the influence of ethnic background and life style differences that could be big factors in cancer, panel members said at a news briefing.
Dr. M. Alfred Haynes, former president of the Drew Postgraduate Medical School in Los Angeles and chairman of the committee, said studies within and between ethnic groups could not only help in determining what affected their cancer risks, but also provide insights for the general population. Finding out why some ethnic minorities are less affected by certain cancers could lead to ways to reduce risks for the majority, Dr. Haynes said.
"This information will benefit all Americans and help the medical community craft prevention strategies that work," he said.
The panel said African-American men, for example, had unusually high rates of prostate cancer, while people of Asian descent were more likely to develop stomach and liver cancer than whites. Cervical cancer is higher among Hispanic and Vietnamese-American women, while African-American women are less likely than others to develop breast cancer but also less likely to survive it. And while Alaska natives have high rates of colon and rectal cancer, low-income whites in rural areas like Appalachia have some of the highest rates of lung and other cancers in the nation.
Having people in cancer studies in traditional racial categories -- white, black, Asian or Pacific Islander, or Native American -- makes it hard to pinpoint factors affecting incidence of the disease and its treatment within subgroups, the panel said. Asians, the report noted, include Vietnamese and other Southeast Asians, Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, Indians and others who are ethnically and culturally very different.
Congress asked the independent Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, to examine the Government's efforts to understand and deal with cancer as it affects poor Americans, with little insurance and limited access to care, and ethnic minorities. The committee said the health institutes, and its National Cancer Institute, were trying to address these issues, but needed to devote more money and develop a Government-wide plan to deal with them.
The panel said the cancer institute spent about $24 million a year, or about 1 percent of its budget, on programs specifically addressing cancer among ethnic minorities and the poor. These groups also are included in more general research studies, it said, but more resources need to be devoted to programs targeted to minorities and the medically underserved.

HEADLINE: Fed Report and Housing Data Are Strong

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's latest reading on the nation's economy suggests the current expansion, already at a peacetime record, will persevere in 1999 while inflation remains at bay.
"Most regions are showing solid economic growth over all," the Fed said. "Most districts report generally stable or declining prices." 
 The Fed's regional outlook, known as the beige book, is based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks. It is published eight times each year. The latest edition was compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Information for the report was collected before Jan. 11.
The report will help form the basis for discussion on interest rate targets at the Feb. 2-3 meeting of the Fed's policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.
In today's report, the Fed also said many retailers resorted to more drastic discounting than usual during the holidays and that labor shortages persisted in most parts of the country, with some regions reporting heightened wage pressures.
"Looking forward, business contacts in most districts remain optimistic about 1999, especially the first half," the Fed said. "However, respondents in most districts expect somewhat slower growth in 1999 than in 1998."
The job of collating and writing the Fed's report is randomly rotated among the 12 regional banks. The identity of that bank is kept confidential until the report's release. The research director of the district bank in charge of compiling the latest edition writes a summary based on the other banks' data.
In another report today, the Commerce Department said housing starts rose in December as builders enjoyed the busiest year for new- home construction in more than a decade.
Starts rose 3.5 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.720 million houses, led by a rebound in multifamily construction. For all of 1998, 1.616 million homes were started, the most since 1.121 million in 1987.
By region in December, housing starts rose 24.7 percent in the Midwest, to an annual rate of 414,000 units in December; rose 3.9 percent in the Northeast, to 158,000 units; increased 3.1 percent in the West, to 428,000, and fell 5.6 percent in the South, to 720,000.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE PUBLIC;
Plan for Social Security Wins Support in Buffalo

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Jan. 20

 BODY:
When President Clinton gave his folksy version of his State of the Union Message today to the blue-collar and middle-class residents of Buffalo and its environs, he got an ardent response from people like Beverly Brigantia, for whom Social Security, the centerpiece of the President's message, is no academic matter.
"I'm going to be one of those women on Social Security that he's talking about," Ms. Brigantia said, listening to Mr. Clinton's speech on a small television propped up on a satellite truck outside the Marine Midland Arena here. "I'm single and currently unemployed and, there's $6,000 in my pension in the teachers retirement system. I'm probably going to have to work until I drop." 
 Ms. Brigantia, a 55-year-old former community college writing instructor, said Mr. Clinton's plan to reserve 62 percent of the budget surpluses over the next 15 years -- an estimated $2.7 trillion -- for Social Security "sounded reasonable to me," and at least put the issue squarely on the national agenda.
Of course, to generate excitement after his State of the Union address, the President could scarcely have picked a more receptive audience than the one in this heavily Democratic city of about 300,000 people. Buffalo's mood today was as bright as the sunshine that ended a week and a half of snow, with a total accumulation of about 60 inches.
This Lake Erie city, where Grover Cleveland was Mayor in 1881 and President William McKinley was assassinated in 1901, has made a slow and somewhat mixed economic recovery since the 1970's, when Bethlehem Steel closed its plant in neighboring Lackawanna and chemical and automobile companies downsized. Unemployment is at 7 percent or 8 percent, said Vincent J. Lovallo, chief of staff to Mayor Anthony M. Masiello. That is almost twice the national average, but far less than the double-digit rates that Mr. Lovallo said prevailed before Mr. Clinton's election in 1992.
The President was delighted with the long ovation he received after a fiery introduction by Vice President Al Gore. "You got so excited you melted the snow for miles outside the arena," Mr. Clinton told the crowd of about 15,000 people.
The warmth was by no means unanimous. Fifty demonstrators stood across from the domed arena, the home of the Buffalo Sabres hockey team, with signs saying "Jail to the Chief!" and "Can You Trust a Liar?"
One protester, Andrea Tice, a 30-year-old mother of two from the suburb of Marilla, said she had not watched Mr. Clinton's speech on Tuesday night -- "I prefer to go to sleep at night without rage in my heart," she said -- but she disliked his Social Security plan anyway.
"Social Security is fine, but he should give the hard-working people a tax cut," Ms. Tice said, echoing a proposal made by Republicans in Congress on Tuesday that called for a 10 percent across-the-board cut in income tax rates.
But mostly the crowds outside and inside the arena seemed impressed with a President spunkily going on with his job despite a Senate impeachment trial that could remove him from office. Even the baby boomers who doubt that the Government will have surpluses for the next 15 years were glad Mr. Clinton enunciated something to shoot for that may protect them when they retire. And many were simply tickled at glimpsing the President and his wife, Hillary, and by his colloquial delivery today, with lines about Social Security like this one: "Seniors today have no sweat unless they live to be 120 years old."
Nellie B. King, who had trouble getting into the arena even though she is superintendent of the Lackawanna City School District, described the Social Security plan as "excellent." Ms. King said she did not want to end up in the kind of poverty she was born into as a sharecropper's daughter in Mississippi.
"I am 56 and I hope to retire in the 21st century, and I hope the Social Security system will be there for me," she said. "It was through education that I was able to rise above the poverty level, and when I retire I don't want to go back into poverty."

Fed Chief Supports Aid for Social Security
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the House Ways and Means Committee he supports the President's notion of putting almost two-thirds of the Federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years into Social Security reserves.
But Mr. Greenspan and some Republicans in Congress disagreed with the President's idea of having the Government invest part of the money in the stock market. Political pressures, Mr. Greenspan said, could lead to inefficient investments that would result in a lower rate of return for retirees and a lower standard of living for Americans. Page A1. 

President Clinton's proposal to shore up the Social Security system by investing some money in the stock market disagrees with a Republican plan to turn revenue over to individuals for their own investment accounts. Michael Weinstein: Economic Scene. A21.
 
United Interested in America West
United Airlines, the nation's largest airline, said that it was interested in buying America West Airlines, a move that would escalate its battle with American Airlines on the West Coast. America West said several airlines had approached it about a range of deals. C8.
 
Profit Up at Texas Instruments
A slimmed-down Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts said the company's moves out of memory chips, computers and defense combined with its concentration on more specialized products like digital signal processors and analog chips had begun to pay off with higher profit margins and more consistent earnings growth. Shares of Texas Instruments rose $6.625, to $99.625. C2.
 
American Airlines and U S Airways posted disappointing quarterly earnings on weaker-than-expected revenues, while America West Airlines exceeded Wall Street estimates. C8.
 
General Electric said its fourth-quarter profit rose 14 percent as the company sold more industrial service contracts. C16.
 
Bristol-Myers Squibb said its fourth-quarter profit rose 13 percent. C4.
 
G.M.'s Profits Increase 7.7%
General Motors announced an unexpectedly large increase in profits during the fourth quarter as the very strong American auto market and the company's continued recovery from a strike last summer more than offset losses in Latin America and East Asia. G.M.'s profits rose 7.7 percent, to $1.77 billion, but fell 53.2 percent, to $2.96 billion, for the year. C2.
 
Stocks Start Out Strong but Fade
Stock prices marched higher during the morning but then faded in the final hour or so and ended mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.31 points, to 9,335.91. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.62 points, to 1,256.62. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 7.32 points, to 2,415.49, its second consecutive record. In the bond market, Treasury prices fell as the yield of the 30-year issue rose to 5.17 percent from 5.14 percent. C14.
 
E-Mail Presented at Microsoft Trial
The Government presented documents and E-mail in Microsoft's antitrust trial as evidence for its contention that the software giant had imposed contract restrictions on computer makers to thwart competition. C16.
 
A Record Sum for Super Bowl Ads
Anheuser-Busch is spending a record sum for 9 spots during 5 minutes and 15 seconds of commercial time during the Super Bowl on Jan. 31, the most by far for any advertiser.

HEADLINE: New York Moves on Plan To Ship Trash Out of City

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
New York City took the first steps yesterday toward its goal of shipping up to 2,000 tons of garbage a day from Manhattan and Queens to transfer stations, landfills and incinerators outside the city, with industry officials saying sites in New Jersey, Long Island and Westchester County were all likely candidates.
"This is the first time we're asking transfer stations outside the city to take our waste," said Peter Montalbano, director of the Sanitation Department's Bureau of Waste Disposal. 
 Officials began taking bids yesterday from private companies to transport and dispose of the two boroughs' trash as part of an interim solution to the long and increasingly complicated process of closing the giant Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island by the end of 2001.
Ultimately, the city plans to build a new infrastructure to ship its garbage beyond its borders at an estimated cost of $6 billion over 30 years. Last month, as part of that effort, the city announced that it was asking private companies to build huge transfer stations in New Jersey and Brooklyn to export waste by rail and barge to other states. A barrage of protest followed, with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman lambasting the plan for its potential impact on New Jersey's environment.
More recently, the possibility that New York might ship more of its garbage to landfills in Virginia started a protracted war of words between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. James S. Gilmore 3d of Virginia.
The interim effort, intended to provide new places for the garbage while the long-term plan is being created and put into place, has been criticized by environmentalists.
Both the permanent and short-term initiatives depend on transfer stations, where garbage is relayed from one mode of transport -- usually trucks or barges -- to another before being shipped to incinerators or landfills. The stations are also typically where the trash is compressed and sealed in larger containers. Environmental concerns are often raised about these transfer points because of the increased truck traffic they generate and the possibility that mishandling or a barge accident could pollute the water.
In the short term, a likely destination for the garbage from Queens and Manhattan is a large transfer station run by the Bergen County Municipal Utilities Authority. The station has the capacity to handle 5,000 tons of garbage a day, but currently processes only 1,400 to 1,500 tons a day, said Jerome Sheehan, acting executive director of the authority.
Mr. Sheehan explained that waste companies that use the county's transfer station would be responsible for entering into contracts with New York. "No one's approached us," he said.
Other possibilities mentioned by industry executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, include incinerators in Essex and Union Counties, N.J., and another in Hempstead, N.Y. An incinerator in Peekskill, N.Y., was also mentioned.
Wendy Patella, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Whitman, said New Jersey counties were responsible for making decisions about their own transfer stations and incinerators. "That's the first line of defense, so to speak," she said.
Susan Tolchin, communications director for the Westchester County Executive, Andrew J. Spano, said that Waste Management Inc., a large waste company, operates an incinerator in Peekskill. She said that its capacity is 657,000 tons a year, and that it processes about 550,000 tons annually. She noted that that did not leave much room for the city's garbage.
"The reality is very, very negligible," she said. "You're talking about a couple of trucks."
Marlene Kastleman, a spokeswoman for the Town of Hempstead, said a company there called American Ref Fuel was running its incinerator at capacity. "Were a deal to be struck, it would replace existing waste," she said. "We would not agree to expand the capacity."
Each site must be able to accept a minimum of 10 garbage trucks an hour and at least 150 tons of waste a day, about the amount generated by each of the city's 59 community board districts. The companies winning contracts are responsible for securing all local permits and approvals.
The companies must also submit to regular city inspections of the stations. The city contracts will run for three years with the possibility of two one-year renewals. Bids will be opened in March, and environmental reviews may take as long as six months.
Since 1997, all Bronx garbage has been exported as part of this interim effort. Late last year, the city began shipping 2,400 tons a day of Brooklyn's garbage to out-of-state landfills from transfer stations in the borough. But the Brooklyn plan is being challenged in court on environmental grounds.
According to city policy, garbage from one borough cannot be processed in another borough. There are no transfer stations in Manhattan and very few in Queens.
James Tripp, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, who also served as a member of the task force that planned the closing of Fresh Kills, said that an original draft of the planning document specified that each borough would handle only its own garbage. The policy was not included in the final document because of fears it would act as a straitjacket on policy makers, but it has nonetheless been repeatedly stated as city policy by Mr. Giuliani and other city officials.
"The policy made no sense from any point of view," Mr. Tripp said. "I mean, after all, we live in one city."
In particular, Mr. Tripp said he was concerned that the policy would cause a great increase in truck traffic through the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels as garbage from Manhattan and Queens headed to transfer stations or incinerators in New Jersey.
"In order for the city and state to prove their commitment to closing Fresh Kills by 2001, do we have to do something that makes little environmental and economic sense?" he asked.
Thomas Outerbridge, an environmental consultant who serves as co-chairman of the Citywide Recycling Advisory Group, an unpaid consulting panel, agreed with Mr. Tripp's assessment. "For the discussion to start intelligently, somebody is going to have to stand up and say that borough self-sufficiency doesn't make sense," he said.

Republicans in Congress and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that President Clinton's proposal to have the Government invest a portion of Social Security reserves in the stock market would endanger the economy.
But while some influential Republicans said the plan proposed by Mr. Clinton in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday night was so off base that it left no room for compromise, many others saw the proposal as an opening bid that could lead to fruitful negotiations. 
 In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee today, Mr. Greenspan, whose views on economic matters carry considerable weight in Congress and on Wall Street, said he supported the President's notion of putting almost two-thirds of the Federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years into Social Security reserves.
But Mr. Greenspan added that the idea of having the Government invest part of the money in the stock market could threaten the economy.
The most pessimistic of the top lawmakers interviewed today was Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a Republican who is one of the foremost authorities in Congress on Social Security. "I was profoundly disappointed in what the President proposed," Mr. Gramm said.
He said he feared that "the whole thing is dead for this Congress" and that "we may have to wait for a new President to take office" before the long-term financial problems with Social Security could be resolved.
Asked about that view, Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, replied, "I'm not that pessimistic."
"I think the President's opening shot ducks out on facing up to the real issues," said Mr. Archer, whose committee will have first crack in Congress at writing a new law, "but I'm not sure this is his final shot."
 Under Mr. Clinton's plan to address the potential insolvency of the retirement system when the baby boom generation begins to retire, 62 percent of the projected surpluses in the Federal budget over the next 15 years -- about $2.7 trillion out of total surpluses of about $4.4 trillion -- would be allocated to the Social Security trust fund. Since the fund is expected to be solvent for decades, it would lend most of the money back to the Treasury, in a bookkeeping measure, to pay off the national debt.
Economists believe that lowering the debt, now about $5.5 trillion, would reduce interest rates, generate private investment and stimulate economic growth. The stronger the economy, the more income there would be to pay Social Security taxes. The Treasury would also have to eventually pay back the money the Social Security fund lent it.
The Clinton Administration calculates that all this would help extend solvency to 2055 from 2032, protecting almost everyone who is now working.
But the President would invest $700 billion of the $2.7 trillion in the stock market, which over the long term has historically produced substantially higher returns than Government bonds, where the Social Security reserves are now placed.
The White House says these higher returns would extend Social Security solvency for an extra five years, to 2055 instead of 2050.
Administration officials insist that care would taken to make sure the investments were insulated from politics.
But Mr. Greenspan and Republicans in Congress are skeptical of Government participation in the private financial markets, and this is where they take strongest issue with Mr. Clinton's proposal.
Mr. Greenspan, for example, said he supported the idea of using most of the surplus to shore up Social Security reserves. But as for the Federal Government's investment in the stock market, he said, "I do not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from government direction."
Political pressures, Mr. Greenspan said, could lead to inefficient investments that, in turn, would result in a lower rate of return for retired people and a lower standard of living for all Americans.
Many Republicans took a similar stand. "It amounts to nationalization of American industry," said Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona. "It's scary. They haven't thought it through."
Republicans, almost without exception, favor investing retirement money in financial markets, but they would have workers invest the money themselves in their own private accounts rather than having the investments placed by the Government.
The President, with the support of most Democrats in Congress, believes that such individual investments could result in unsophisticated workers' risking their retirement savings.
Outside of Social Security, Mr. Clinton proposed spending about $500 billion over the next 15 years to subsidize workers who established investment accounts that would work like the 401(k) plans that many workers have. Republicans objected to this on the ground that it would create a new government entitlement program.
Republicans are not united behind any particular plan. Some, like Mr. Kolbe, would allow workers voluntarily to invest part of their payroll taxes. Their guaranteed Social Security benefits would be reduced accordingly.
Other Republicans would maintain the current Social Security tax and benefit structure but would give workers an income tax cut if they invested the money for their retirement.
This would ultimately cause the Federal deficit to rise again if taxes were not raised or the Government's spending reduced.
Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr. of Florida, the new chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee in the Ways and Means Committee, said he was optimistic that a compromise could be reached.
"The President has opened the door toward investing in the private sector," Mr. Shaw said. "Republicans don't support the idea of the Government doing the investing, but it's a good thing the President has opened the dialogue."
Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, calculated the odds of finding a consensus at 20 to 1. But before Mr. Clinton's speech, the Senator said, he would have set the odds at 200 to 1.
Mr. Archer, the Ways and Means Committee chairman, is retiring at the end of this Congress, and he said that like the President, he would like to leave a solvent Social Security system as a legacy of his years in politics.
"I really do want to work something out and get this solved during the last two years for Clinton and me," Mr. Archer said. Then, referring to the impeachment trial, he added, "Assuming he goes on for another two years."

Chart: "AT A GLANCE: The President's Social Security Plan"
Key points of President Clinton's proposal to revamp Social Security:
 
-- Out of projected Federal budget surpluses of $4.4 trillion over the next 15 years, 62 percent, or $2.7 trillion, would be used to bolster Social Security's cash reserves. This would keep the Social Security system solvent until 2055. Mr. Clinton would like to see additional unspecified steps to keep it solvent until 2075.
 
-- The Government would invest $700 billion of transferred money in the stock market. Steps would be taken to make sure that the investments were made independently and without political interference.
 
-- Additional money from the surplus would be used to help workers establish private retirement savings accounts, much like 401(k) programs. The Government would provide seed money to get the accounts started and match a portion of workers' contributions.
 
-- Workers would be allowed to earn full Social Security benefits at retirement age even if they did not retire. Under current law, workers 65 to 69 lose $1 in benefits for each $3 of earnings over $15,500 a year. The President did not specify where the money to pay for this would come from.
 
-- About $700 billion from the surplus would also be used to help shore up Medicare, the Government's health insurance program for retirees and disabled people.

HEADLINE: Scaffold in Times Square Collapse Was Built Improperly, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A 700-foot construction scaffold that buckled and broke in Times Square last summer, killing a woman in a nearby hotel and disrupting traffic for several days, was built improperly and was missing critical support braces on 10 floors, according to citations issued yesterday by Federal safety officials.
The citations issued by the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration against the builder of the scaffold, Universal Builders Supply, do not state that the defects were the cause of the collapse, the city's most serious construction accident in a decade. But investigators involved in a city inquiry say that the violations are among the problems that contributed to the accident on July 21 at the construction site of the Conde Nast building, on Broadway between 42d and 43d Streets. 
 In issuing the citations accusing the company of four safety violations, the Federal agency recommended fines totaling $26,000. Universal Builders, which is based in Mount Vernon, N.Y., has until Feb. 10 to contest the citations.
"After the accident," said Robert Kulick, the director of the Federal safety agency in New York, "we found that the scaffold had not been built in accordance with an engineer's plans, that support braces were missing and that the company had failed to insure that the mast bolts were maintained for tightness. We consider these serious safety violations."
The city's official investigation into the causes of the accident is still months away from completion. One person involved in that investigation said that early on, "it was clear that there was some crossbracing that was missing." The braces were designed to insure that the scaffold remained straight, level and square against the building.
"My suspicion is that we'll undoubtedly agree with OSHA," said the investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
City investigators and engineers said that they were unsure whether they could identify a single reason for the accident, but that they could probably identify a series of problems that built on one another, creating a "cascade effect," until the scaffold collapsed.
Kevin O'Callaghan, president of Universal Builders, declined to comment on the accusations of violations because the city was still investigating the collapse. He did issue a statement saying that "the actual cause of the collapse has not yet been determined."
Universal Builders, which erected scaffolding for the renovation of the Statue of Liberty, Grand Central Terminal and the Washington Monument, is already contesting citations for other safety violations in the death of a carpenter, Charles Robbins, in an earlier accident at the Conde Nast site, which is known as 4 Times Square.
The city's report may not be completed until May 1, said Gaston Silva, the city's Buildings Commissioner.
"We have not completed our investigation," Mr. Silva said yesterday. "But we will look at OSHA's findings and incorporate them into our findings."
The collapse of the scaffolding last summer cast a pall over what was supposed to have been a triumph for the developer, Douglas Durst, and a symbol of the rebirth of Times Square. Mr. Durst was building the first new office tower in Manhattan since the recession in the early 1990's.
But on the morning of July 21, the scaffold and an elevator tower that had been erected next to the 48-story tower buckled at the 21st floor as the sound of tearing metal echoed across midtown. The scaffolding above the 20th floor dropped about eight feet, wrenching the elevator tower, which snapped off and fell. A 50-foot section of that tower pierced the roof of the Woodstock Hotel across 43d Street, knocking a concrete slab onto Thereza Feliconio, 85, and killing her as she sat in her top-floor apartment.
Traffic in midtown was disrupted for the better part of a week as city officials, fearful that the scaffold would plummet to the street, blocked off large portions of the Times Square area to traffic.
Workers spent the next two months dismantling the twisted aluminum beams piece by piece and transporting the pieces to a pier in Brooklyn, where the scaffold was reassembled for examination by forensic engineers looking into the causes of the accident.
Yesterday, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration contended that the scaffold, one of the tallest used for skyscraper construction, had not been built in accordance with the plans of a professional engineer and that the structure was not capable of bearing the maximum weight required by safety regulations.
There were also support braces missing from floors 15 through 24, as well as disconnected braces on the 25th floor and a cut brace on the 26th floor, according to the citations.
"Everyone in the industry is keenly awaiting the reports by top technical professionals in the business to determine if any design, installation or inspection procedures should be modified or added to hoist and scaffolding construction," said Richard M. Kielar, senior vice president of Tishman Realty and Construction Company. A unit of the company, Tishman Construction Corporation, is the construction manager at 4 Times Square.

BRITAIN: PEERS' VOTING RIGHTS -- Prime Minister Tony Blair's Government submitted to Parliament legislation aimed at fulfilling his promise to eliminate the voting rights of 750 hereditary peers, members of the House of Lords who gained their seats by the circumstances of birth. Some 500 life peers would remain in a transitional assembly while a proposed Royal Commission produced recommendations due Dec. 31 for longer-term reform of the chamber. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

BRITAIN: PARTY CHIEF TO STEP DOWN -- Paddy Ashdown, left, said he would step down in June as leader of the Liberal Democrats, Britain's third-largest political party, and would not run for re-election to Parliament in 2002. Mr. Ashdown took over leadership of the party in 1988 and in the last national election in May 1997 saw it capture 45 seats in Parliament, the best showing by a third party in Britain in 60 years. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
GERMANY: JOBLESS RATE STEADY -- Germany's high unemployment rate will not be reduced this year, with 10.9 percent of the working population continuing to be jobless, Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine said. The average number of Germans out of work this year should be about 4.1 million, he said, almost no change from the 4.197 million unemployed recorded last month. (Agence France-Presse)
 
RUSSIA: DOUBTS OVER NEW MIG -- A new MIG fighter jet made public last week as a response to the latest American combat aircraft might never be deployed because of Russia's cash shortage, officials said. The plane's designer, Gen. Mikhail Korzhuyev, said the new fighter would have stealth abilities and other features allowing it to outperform the most advanced American fighter, the F-22 Raptor. But he and other designers acknowledged that the prototype lacks stealth features, such as an anti-radar coating and combat equipment. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
VENEZUELA: RULING BACKS REFERENDUM -- Venezuela's Supreme Court ruled in favor of President-elect Hugo Chavez's plan to call a referendum on constitutional reform, a move that could lead to Congress being disbanded. Mr. Chavez, who takes office on Feb. 2, wants to order a referendum by presidential decree on Feb. 15 to create a popular assembly charged with rewriting the existing 1961 Constitution. (Reuters)
 
ARGENTINA: OIL SPILL'S AFTERMATH -- An oil spill last Friday in the Rio de la Plata will have a serious effect on plant and animal life in the estuary, said Flavio Maschione, an environmental official with the province of Buenos Aires. About 65,000 gallons of crude oil leaked from a Liberian oil tanker when it collided with a German container ship 50 miles down river from Buenos Aires. The spill, covering a million square feet, is about 12.4 miles off the nearest coastline, where remains of oil-soaked birds have already washed up. Mr. Maschione said it could take between 5 and 16 months for the area to recover. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ASIA
 
CHINA: NEW DRIVE IN TIBET -- China's Communist Party has begun a fresh "atheist propaganda" drive in Tibet to stamp out separatism and combat the Buddhist region's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, the Tibet Daily newspaper said. Earlier this month the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy, a group based in India, reported that China had stepped up repression of religion in Tibet. (Reuters)
 
TAIWAN: AGREEMENT ON HIJACKERS -- Taiwan agreed to hand over nine Chinese hijackers, China announced, but while it welcomed the move it urged Taipei to release all those being held. A total of 16 Chinese hijacked 13 commercial planes to Taiwan between 1993 and 1998. (Reuters)
 
NORTH KOREA: DEFECTION'S EFFECTS -- The reported defection of a North Korean diplomat could affect four-party talks aimed at bringing a permanent peace to the divided Korean Peninsula, a North Korean official said. North Korea has accused the South of kidnapping one of its diplomats based in Berlin and handing him over to the United States. South Korean officials said the diplomat, Kim Pyong Pil, and his wife, Kim Kum Sun, defected on a trip last week to Frankfurt. (AP)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: NEW CABINET MINISTER -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed another right-wing Likud lawmaker, Shaul Amor, to his Cabinet, four months ahead of elections. Mr. Amor, who had been promised, and then denied, posts in Mr. Netanyahu's Government, was sworn in as a Minister Without Portfolio to deal with social issues. (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
SOUTH AFRICA: FUGITIVE CAUGHT -- After a 13-month manhunt, South Africa announced that it finally captured its most wanted man, Colin Chauke. The former anti-apartheid guerrilla fighter was facing murder and robbery charges when he escaped from prison late in 1997. Mr. Chauke is accused of masterminding a series of attacks on armored cars. Suzanne Daley (NYT)
 
ANGOLA: U.N. ROLE SOUGHT -- Key Security Council members called for a limited United Nations political presence in Angola's capital, Luanda, despite Secretary General Kofi Annan's recommendation that the operation there be ended. The draft was drawn up by the United States, Russia and Portugal. (Reuters)
 
ZIMBABWE: DETAINED JOURNALISTS MOVED -- An editor and a reporter for The Standard newspaper who were arrested after writing about an alleged army coup plot have been removed from Harare's central police station, their lawyers said. The police refused to say where the two suspects, Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto, were taken, raising fears that they were being interrogated by the army. The two journalists are being charged with "causing alarm and despondency." Suzanne Daley (NYT)

HEADLINE: Greenspan Hints Rate Cut Is Unlikely

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today there is little evidence that the economy is slowing. But he warned for the first time since the stock market's most recent run-up that equity prices might be getting excessive.
His comments, analysts said, suggested that the central bank would leave interest rates unchanged for some time to come. 
 "While there are risks going forward," Mr. Greenspan told the House Ways and Means Committee, "to date domestic demand and hence employment and output in the United States certainly has remained vigorous. Though the pace of economic expansion is widely expected to moderate as 1999 unfolds, signs of an appreciable slowdown as yet remain scant."
Among the risks, he suggested, is that stock prices may again have become unrealistically high. One of the reasons that Wall Street has rebounded so smartly from its brief but sharp dip last summer is Mr. Greenspan himself, who engineered a series of three interest-rate cuts in the fall.
"The level of equity prices would appear to envision substantially greater growth of profits than has been experienced of late," he said, restating a theme he has sounded on and off for more than two years.
The markets, which have come to expect some low-key jawboning from Mr. Greenspan, largely shrugged off his comments. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had advanced well over 100 points during the day, retreated to end with a 19.31-point loss, at 9,335.91. Broader market indicators closed modestly higher, including the Nasdaq composite index, which set another record. Bond prices fell. Page C14.
Mr. Greenspan has not directly addressed stock market valuations in public since the market tumbled and then recovered. But he has warned in general terms about what happens when investors fail to make appropriate judgments about risk, whether on Wall Street or in emerging markets. And the minutes of the Fed's policy-making meeting on Nov. 17, when Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point, show that some members of the committee were worried that pushing rates down would send the stock market to unjustifiably high levels.
Economists have assumed for several months that the Fed is likely to hold rates steady at least the next few months unless the global financial turmoil that has unsettled markets and economies flares anew.
Mr. Greenspan reinforced that view today, though he acknowledged that Brazil's recent problems create uncertainty. He suggested that the Fed was again concerned that stronger-than-expected growth could rekindle inflation if the economy did not slow on its own. Growth in the fourth quarter of 1998 may have been as high as 5 percent, according to some estimates, ending a year in which the economy expanded by nearly 4 percent.
Fed officials and many economists expect growth to slow to a range of 2 to 3 percent this year.
Mr. Greenspan also discussed subjects including Social Security, tax cuts and trade policy, saying that "some moderation" in growth might be required to sustain the nation's long expansion.
"Through the end of 1998, the economy continued to grow more rapidly than can be currently accommodated on an ongoing basis, even with higher, technology-driven productivity growth," he said.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony marked something of a return to his customary views after the tumult of last fall, when the Fed cut interest rates by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point to calm anxious investors and insure that the financial upheaval that began in Asia did not spread to the American economy.
As it has for most of the last three years, the economy is cruising along, defying predictions of a slowdown. The stock market is regularly setting new highs. But even though unemployment is low and demand is strong, there are almost no signs of inflation, leaving policy makers, including Mr. Greenspan, pleased but wary.
A survey released today by the Federal Reserve System provided much the same view of the economy's performance as Mr. Greenspan's testimony. The survey found that "most regions are showing solid economic growth over all," with "generally stable or declining prices."
No element of the economy's performance draws more attention these days than the boom in the financial markets, and Mr. Greenspan used much of his prepared testimony today to explore the link between Wall Street and the buoyancy of consumer demand.
He said there have been valid reasons for the jump in stock prices over the last few years.
"Lower inflation, greater competitiveness and the flexibility and adaptability of our businesses have enabled them to take advantage of a rapid pace of technological change to make our capital stock more productive and profitable," Mr. Greenspan said.
He declared that the Fed had not sought to use monetary policy to move stock prices up and down to reflect its view of appropriate market valuations, adding, "We need to react to changes in financial markets, as we did this fall, but our objective is the maximum sustainable growth of the U.S. economy, not particular levels of asset prices."
At another point, referring to last fall's rate cuts, he said, "We were not attempting to prop up equity prices, nor did we plan to continue to ease rates until equity prices recovered, as some have erroneously inferred."
But the markets have a direct if complex effect on the economy that must be factored into monetary policy, Mr. Greenspan said. The rise in stock prices, he said, had clearly affected the personal savings rate, which declined from almost 6 percent in 1992 to zero last year. Instead of saving through traditional channels, individuals are accumulating wealth through the stock market. There is evidence, he said, that all or most of the decline in personal savings is concentrated among the wealthy, who benefit the most from capital gains.
The wealth effect -- the theory that consumer spending rises along with increases in the value of investment portfolios -- "has been real and significant," Mr. Greenspan said. But the wealth effect could also work in reverse, he said, since "a decline in equity values, especially a severe one, could lead to a considerable weakening of consumer demand."
The markets have stabilized substantially since the fall, Mr. Greenspan said, but the forced devaluation last week of Brazil's currency illustrates the tenuous nature of that calm. And he noted that global economic crises continue to have an effect in the United States, not least in leading to a growing trade deficit as foreign markets for agricultural and industrial products dry up and other nations look to this country to import their goods.
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan said, central banks had to be careful that interest-rate changes did not unduly unsettle the financial markets, given their fragility. Policy makers, he said, "are going to have to be particularly wary of actions that unnecessarily sow uncertainties, undermine confidence and interfere with the efficient allocation of capital."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Federal Reserve Chairman's Testimony

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony by Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, before the House Ways and Means Committee today as recorded by the Federal News Service: 
 The American economy through year-end continued to perform in an outstanding manner. Economic growth remained solid, and financial markets, after freezing up temporarily following the Russian default, are again channeling an ample flow of capital to businesses and households. Labor markets have remained quite tight, but, to date, this has failed to ignite the inflationary pressures that many had feared.
To be sure, there is decided softness in a number of manufacturing industries as weakness in many foreign economies has reduced demand for U.S. exports and intensified competition from imports. Moreover, the underutilized production capacity and pressure on the domestic profit margins, especially among manufacturers, are likely to rein in the rapid growth of new capital investment. With corporations already relying increasingly on borrowing to finance capital investment, any evidence of a marked slowing in corporate cash flow is likely to induce a relatively prompt review of capital budgets.
The situation in Brazil and its potential for spilling over to reduce demand in other emerging market economies also constitute a possible source of downside risk for demand in the United States. So far, markets seem to have reacted reasonably well to the decisions by the Brazilian authorities to float their currency and redouble efforts at fiscal discipline. But follow through in reducing budget imbalances and in containing the effects on inflation of the drop in value of the currency will be needed to bolster confidence and to limit the potential for contagion to the financial markets and economies of Brazil's important trading partners, including the United States.
While there are risks going forward, to date, domestic demand and hence employment and output in the United States certainly has remained vigorous. Though the pace of economic expansion is widely expected to moderate as 1999 unfolds, signs of an appreciable slowdown as yet remain scant.
But to assess the economic outlook properly, we need to reach beyond the mere description of America's sparkling economic performance of eight years of record peacetime expansion to seek a deeper understanding of the forces that have produced it. I want to take a few moments this morning to discuss one key element behind our current prosperity -- the rise in the value markets place on the capital assets of U.S. businesses. Lower inflation, greater competitiveness, and the flexibility and adaptability of our businesses have enabled them to take advantage of a rapid pace of technological change to make our capital stock more productive and profitable. I will argue that the process of recognizing this greater value has produced capital gains in equity markets that have lowered the cost of investment in new plant and equipment and spurred consumption. But, while asset values are very important to the economy and so must be carefully monitored and assessed by the Federal Reserve, they are not themselves a target of monetary policy. We need to react to changes in financial markets, as we did this fall, but our objective is the maximum sustainable growth of the U.S. economy, not particular levels of asset prices.
. . .At root, the remarkable generation of capital gains of recent years has resulted from the dramatic fall in inflation expectations and associated risk premiums, and broad advances in a wide variety of technologies that produced critical synergies in the 1990's.
Capital investment, especially in high-tech equipment, has accelerated dramatically since 1993, presumably reflecting a perception on the part of businesses that the application of these emerging technological synergies would engender a significant increase in rates of return on new investment. . . .
While discussions of consumer spending often continue to emphasize current income from labor and capital as the prime source of funds, during the 1990's, capital gains, which reflect the valuation of expected future incomes, have taken on a more prominent role in driving our economy.
The steep uptrend in asset values of recent years has had important effects on virtually all areas of our economy, but perhaps most significantly on household behavior. It can be seen most clearly in the measured personal saving rate, which has declined from almost 6 percent in 1992 to effectively zero today. . . .
We have some evidence from recent years that all or most of the decline in the saving rate is accounted for by the upper income quintile where the capital gains have disproportionately accrued, which suggests that the wealth effect has been real and significant. Thus, all else equal, a flattening of stock prices would likely slow the growth of spending, and a decline in equity values, especially a severe one, could lead to a considerable weakening of consumer demand. . . .
Despite brisk demand and improved productivity growth, corporate profits have sagged over recent quarters. This is attributable in part to some acceleration in labor compensation, but other factors have been pressing, especially intensified competition and lower prices facing our exporters and those industries competing with imports. In these circumstances, businesses will feel under considerable pressure to preserve profit margins should labor costs accelerate further, or should the falling prices of commodity inputs, like oil, turn around. But, to date, businesses' evident pricing power has been scant. Either that would change and inflation could begin to mount or, if costs could not be recouped, capital outlays might well be cut back.
The recent behavior of profits also underlines the unusual nature of the rebound in equity prices and the possibility that the recent performance of the equity markets will have difficulty in being sustained. The level of equity prices would appear to envision substantially greater growth of profits than has been experienced of late. . . .
Our task going forward -- at the Federal Reserve as well as in the Congress and Administration -- is to sustain and strengthen these policies, which in turn have sustained and strengthened our now record peacetime economic expansion.

HEADLINE: American and US Airways Report Weak Fourth Quarters

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
American Airlines and U S Airways posted disappointing quarterly earnings yesterday on weaker-than-expected revenues, while America West Airlines exceeded Wall Street estimates by a wide margin.
Analysts said that American and U S Airways, like other major domestic airlines, were hurt during the final months of 1998 as revenue declined from the premium fares most often paid by business travelers flying at the last minute. 
 "Airlines make most of their money off business travelers and you saw business travel stall in the fourth quarter," said Glenn Engel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York.
Inexpensive fuel prices helped ease the carriers' pain by lowering expenses. But the savings were not enough to offset the slide in revenues.
The AMR Corporation, the holding company for American, the country's second-largest airline, said earnings declined 13 percent, to $182 million, or $1.09 a diluted share, compared with $208 million, or $1.16 a share, during the corresponding period a year earlier.
Adjusting for a stock split and one-time gains, AMR earned $1 a share, compared with $1.09 in 1997. The consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation was $1.16 a share.
While total revenue at AMR rose 1.3 percent, to $4.6 billion in the quarter, passenger revenue at American Airlines fell 3 percent, to $3.5 billion, compared with the period last year. The company attributed the decline primarily to softening demand on its international routes.
"What we are seeing are weaker economies in Europe and Latin America and Asia at a time of capacity increases by the industry," Gerard J. Arpey, AMR's chief financial officer, said.
U S Airways, the sixth-largest domestic airline, earned $104 million, or $1.18 a share, in the quarter, compared with $479 million, or $4.66 a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding a one-time $125 million charge and a $467 million tax credit, earnings declined 25 percent. The consensus earnings estimate by First Call had been $1.20 a share.
The airline's costs, not including fuel, fell 1 percent compared with a year earlier, largely because of the introduction of Metrojet, the low-cost airline it started last year to combat growing competition by Southwest Airlines. But Metrojet also charges lower fares, which along with the softening of business travel pushed U S Airways' total per-passenger revenues down nearly 5 percent.
The company was also hurt during the quarter by the transition to a new computer reservations system that confused many reservation agents.
Mr. Engel said that Rakesh Gangwal, U S Airways' chief executive, told analysts yesterday that downward pressures on revenues would continue this year as the airline expands Metrojet and faces more competition. Mr. Gangwal warned that the consensus 1999 earnings estimate of $6.40 a share might be too high.
America West, which struggled to improve its operations last year, bucked the industry trend by attracting more business travelers on long-haul flights to cities like New York and Boston from its hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas, Nev.
Net income for America West, based in Phoenix and the ninth-largest airline in the country, remained flat at about $20 million in the quarter, but soared 11 percent, to $22.4 million, after excluding a one-time charge. Stock purchases helped per-share earnings soar to 56 cents, from 43 cents in 1997, easily surpassing the First Call consensus estimate of 39 cents a share.
W. Douglas Parker, America West's chief financial officer, said America West plans to continue to woo business travelers this year and will expand capacity by 10 percent.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, America West shares rose $1.375 to $19.50; U S Airways fell $6.3125 a share, to $51.125, and AMR fell $4.4375, to $59.8125.

Stocks Are Too Risky

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Unbowed, Clinton Presses Social Security Plan" (front page, Jan. 20): The new approach presented by President Clinton has serious dangers. There is the possibility that Wall Street will not enjoy continuing good times, nor is any explanation given for the economics of replacing assets of the Social Security trust fund, which have yielded a small but dependable return, with stocks, which are much riskier investments. Support for his line of thinking comes from financial institutions that will benefit because of the influx of new money. 
 A sounder proposal would be to raise the income cap for the FICA tax, making the program more finacially stable. Or we could drastically raise the corporate part of the FICA tax and remove the income cap.

Elderly Have Paid

 BODY:

To the Editor:
For years the Treasury has benefited from the fact that the Social Security trust fund was required to buy United States bonds with its surpluses, thus lowering the Treasury's interest burden. The general taxpayer benefited at the expense of the elderly, whose retirement funds could have been more fruitfully invested. Therefore it is only fitting that the Treasury help solve the Social Security shortfall by transferring part of its surplus to the trust fund, as proposed by the President in his State of the Union Message (front page, Jan. 20).

Jobless Rate Shows Drop in New Jersey

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
New Jersey's economy, like the nation's, seems to keep humming along.
The state's unemployment rate for December was 4.4 percent, down from the November rate of 4.5 percent. If the December rate holds up after officials adjust the numbers next month, it would be the lowest since February 1990. 
 The unemployment rate for all of 1998 would then be the lowest in nearly a decade. The State Labor Department says the preliminary rate for 1998 was 4.8 percent, the lowest since 1989, when the annual rate was 4.1 percent.
"New Jersey is enjoying a vibrant and growing economy which continues to reach new employment records," said State Labor Commissioner Mel Gelade, who noted that every new job created in New Jersey adds to a record number of jobs provided by state employers.
Even so, New Jersey's unemployment picture still does not outshine the nation's. The December unemployment rate was still slightly higher than the national average of 4.3 percent posted for December.
And the national rate for 1998 was 4.5 percent, lower than New Jersey's expected rate of 4.8 percent.
New Jersey employers added 65,900 jobs in 1998, a healthy increase but not up to the best-of-the-decade growth of 87,000 jobs in 1997. Following an established pattern, the year saw New Jersey add jobs in the service sector and lose jobs in manufacturing. More than 60 percent of the new jobs -- 41,200 -- were service sector jobs. The state lost 9,600 manufacturing jobs in 1998.

HEADLINE: Planet Africa: Black History on Disk;
Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Microsoft Produce A Long-Awaited, Much-Debated Encyclopedia

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
IN 1995, Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard professor and perhaps the most widely recognized African-American scholar today, cast himself in the role of fast-talking encyclopedia salesman. Dr. Gates, who had begun dreaming of creating a comprehensive encyclopedia of the black world two decades earlier, found himself in New York presenting his proposal to executives from the giant publishing company Random House. But before he could finish his pitch, the company's chief executive, Alberto Vitale, asked him if the encyclopedia could be done as a multimedia CD-ROM, rather than in the conventional print-only manner.
"Of course," was Dr. Gates's response. The only hitch: he had no idea what a CD-ROM was. 
 But Dr. Gates is a famously quick study. And the result is the Encarta Africana, a new electronic encyclopedia that attempts to distill the black experience into two honey-hued CD-ROM disks.
The disks -- crammed with 2.5 million words and more than 2,500 pictures, maps, graphs, sounds and video clips on practically all things of African descent -- reverberate with their subject. A mouse click can send users, even those with modestly powered personal computers, on a cinematic voyage along the Swahili coast, or permit them to retrace centuries of slave routes between the "dark continent" and the New World, or simply watch, in stunningly stark video clips, haunting scenes of civil rights marchers being attacked with fire hoses and police dogs. A keystroke can call up a 1929 performance of "Saint Louis Blues" belted out by Bessie Smith, or samples of Duke Ellington's elegant redesign of jazz, or the Temptations crooning in their Motown glory years in the 1960's or sounds from hip-hop's humble birth in the Bronx.
"We have finally a technology that can explore and explain the expressive features -- music and dance, art and cinema, literature and story-telling -- that are the heart of cultural achievements of people of African descent," Dr. Gates says in a three-minute video clip in the encyclopedia.
There are other CD-ROM collections of some of the sounds, words and deeds of blacks, like last year's Encyclopedia Britannica Profiles Black History. But most of them have been very limited in scope and imagination. By contrast, Encarta Africana, officially released Monday by Microsoft to mark the celebration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth, had from its inception the audacious task of chronicling black history and culture stretching back to the first Africans and, for that matter, the first humans, some four million years ago.
Almost for its ambition alone, the project has attracted an enormous amount of attention and some controversy. For Dr. Gates and his co-editor, Kwame Anthony Appiah, a Harvard colleague, the struggle to create the encyclopedia had taken many paths. Some led to dead ends and crushing disappointments. Others met with debate over whether the project was taking an Afrocentric or Eurocentric perspective, and over who actually had the rights to the idea of a black encyclopedia, long a recurring dream among some African-American intellectuals.
In the process of creating the Encarta Africana, Dr. Gates and Dr. Appiah called on more than 400 scholars to research and write more than 3,000 articles that could appeal to everyone from grade-school students to graduate-school students. Dr. Gates also persuaded noted figures like Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian-born recipient of the Nobel Prize in literature, and Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations, to participate in the project. Dr. Gates even called upon his friend Michael Jordon, recently of the N.B.A., to preview the encyclopedia. Mr. Jordan's endorsement -- "a reference work which every family should own" -- appears on the encyclopedia's packaging.
Borrowing some of the most popular features from Microsoft's Encarta series, Africana was designed, its makers say, to show as much as tell. Some officials at Microsoft have been describing the encyclopedia, which costs $49.95 after a $20 mail-in rebate that expires at the end of this year, as a groundbreaking marriage of content and technology. One feature, for example, offers users six virtual tours that include the slave castles of Goree, off the coast of Senegal, West Africa, and the Egyptian ruins at Medinet Habu, using 360-degree photographs that rotate with the nudge of a computer mouse.
"The majority of people in the United States are not going to have a chance to make it over to Africa, so we really try to bring you the sights and sounds in a stimulating format," said Evette Gee, a Microsoft project manager for Encarta Africana.
The earliest dream of a comprehensive black encyclopedia belonged neither to Professor Gates nor to Bill Gates, but to a man whose life ended long before the advent of personal computers, the Internet and CD-ROM's. In 1909, W.E.B. Du Bois, who was the first black person to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University and who went on to become an influential American intellectual, writer, social scientist and Pan-Africanist, called for the creation of a black encyclopedia. He said he wanted this work, which he called the Encyclopedia Africana, to tell the complete saga of Africa and its diaspora in Europe, Asia, the Caribbean and the Americas.
"Du Bois thought in 1909 that the principle cause of racism was ignorance," said Dr. Gates, who is director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard, in an interview. "And if he could marshal scientific evidence -- that was his phrase -- that we could defeat racism. And the best way to marshal scientific evidence was through an encyclopedia."
While his belief would change over the years, as he came to the conclusion that racism was rooted in economics, Du Bois nonetheless pursued his dream of producing an encyclopedia of the black world until his death in 1963 in Ghana, at age 94. For the last two years of his life, Du Bois lived in Ghana at the invitation of its president, Kwame Nkrumah, and was at work leading the creation of the Encyclopedia Africana. Since then, his work has slowly continued in Ghana, with three volumes published so far.
While a student at Cambridge University in 1973, Dr. Gates said, he dreamed of completing the vision of Du Bois, whose brilliance and self-confidence, he acknowledged, still stagger him. At Cambridge, he met a young philosophy major, Kwame Anthony Appiah, whose uncle is an Asante chief in Ghana. They became friends and collaborators in trying to make real what Dr. Appiah calls Du Bois's "noble idea."
In 1979, Dr. Gates, then an assistant professor at Yale University, approached Encyclopedia Britannica with the idea. But the company was not convinced that the project would be make money. If Dr. Gates could raise the millions required to create the encyclopedia, the company told him, Britannica would produce it
It wasn't until 1995, after having taught at Harvard for four years, Dr. Gates said, that he felt secure enough there to try once again to resurrect the idea. He had received pledges of development money from Quincy Jones, the composer and media entrepreneur, and Martin Payson, a high-ranking executive at Time Warner, for the project. It was then that he met with Random House officials and was asked to consider making a CD-ROM.
Six months later, after working with Dynamic Diagrams, a Rhode Island-based design group, Dr. Gates had a CD-ROM prototype of his encyclopedia. But when he returned to Random House with it, he was told that the bottom had fallen out of the CD-ROM market. The company was no longer interested.
"They said that they were only doing games," Dr. Gates recalled recently. "I could have cried. I was devastated."
Even today, the "edutainment" CD-ROM market is rapidly shrinking as more users turn to the vast, ever-changing resources of the Internet, rather than the static data on disks, said L. Butt Jr., director of entertainment and technology strategy at Forrester Research. There are some exceptions, however, for CD-ROM encyclopedias like Encarta, Mr. Butt said.
After his rejection by Random House, Dr. Gates shopped the project around New York, making presentations to numerous companies, including the Voyager Company and Simon & Schuster. Still no deal.
But in the spring of 1997, while approaching Prodigy, the Internet service provider, to set up an on-line version of the encyclopedia, Dr. Gates was also talking separately with Perseus Books and Microsoft. The day after Dr. Gates finalized a deal with Perseus to produce a single-volume text version of the encyclopedia -- scheduled for publication in November -- Microsoft agreed to produce the CD-ROM encyclopedia. Microsoft and Perseus quickly reached an agreeement to split the costs. No one will say how much the compendium cost, but a source close to the project said the research budget was about $2 million.
Although Dr. Gates had finally found publishers for the encyclopedia, he learned that the original name he had in mind, Encyclopedia Africana, would have to be dropped. The group still working in Ghana to complete Du Bois's project, it turned out, owned the rights to that name.
Some say the scholars involved in the project, who have so far produced three volumes of an anticipated 20-volume Encyclopedia Africana: Dictionary of African Biography are the inheritors not only of the project's name but also of its true spirit.
"What we have here is a commercial product for the white buyers," said Molefi Kete Asante, a widely published author and former chairman of the African studies department at Temple University in Philadelphia. "It is a project that is flawed, because the people who created it, even though they have strong credentials in the white academies, do not understand the African world."
Dr. Asante, a founding father of Afrocentricity, which holds that black history must be seen from what he calls an "African center." Encarta Africana, he said, takes a more Eurocentric approach to examining the black world.
Specifically, Dr. Asante points to the encyclopedia's passages on Egypt, passages that he said work to confirm some historians' views that despite its place on the African continent, Egypt's civilization is somehow more akin to that of the Middle East, rather than having evolved from core African cultural and historical roots.
Dr. Asante and Raymond A. Winbush, a professor and director of the Race Relations Institute at Fisk University in Nashville, also say that Dr. Gates and Dr. Appiah asked few, if any, Afrocentric scholars to join the more than 400 scholars who contributed articles to Encarta Encyclopedia.
"I'm just disappointed that some of our great scholars, like on slavery in America, were not invited," said Dr. Winbush, who is an advisor to the Ghana-based project. He said the electronic encyclopedia was not the "definitive view of Africa." He acknowledged, however, that it was "a good first step, a baby step."
The encyclopedia has drawn strong praise from Robert. L. Douglas, a noted African studies scholar. "The sheer magnitude of its size, scope and chronology -- from four million B.C. to the present -- is magnificent in itself," said Dr. Douglas, professor of art history and Pan-African studies at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. "Only with the coming years of its use in the multitude of educational forums and the research potential that it promises for teachers and scholars will its successes and failures be realized."
Dr. Gates concedes that Encarta Africana is "mainstream, very mainstream." But that does not devalue its scholarship, others agree. Any potentially controversial passage in the encyclopedia is, he said, clearly identified so. And often, he says, his group of scholars, which he described as "ideologically diverse," tried hard to include opposing arguments on interpretations of black history and culture.
"We don't have a God complex," Dr. Gates said. "We are not saying that this is the Bible." He noted that this week he started an Internet site (www.africana .com) inviting anyone to send in "ideas and opinions" regarding the encyclopedia's content. "The more the merrier," Dr. Gates said, suggesting that the encyclopedia may be revised over time. Still, the CD-ROM is not yet for everyone. It does not come in a Macintosh version (or a single-disk DVD version). And there are no immediate plans for a Mac Encarta, said Evette Gee at Microsoft. That could present a problem, some educators say, for poor, urban school districts that may be more likely to have older, Macintosh computers.
Microsoft announced that it plans to donate 2,000 copies of Encarta Africana to urban schools, part of an overall donation of 8,000 copies of the encyclopedia to schools, including historically black colleges and universities and selected public libraries in the South.
Dr. Gates said he is immensely proud of the encyclopedia and is pleased with the thought that Du Bois might be pleased as well. Last month, when Encarta Encyclopedia was being shipped, he received a letter from David G. Du Bois, the 71-year-old son of W.E.B. Du Bois.
In part, it read, "Anthony Appiah and Henry Louis Gates Jr., inspired by Father's original idea, have made a magnificent, state-of-the-art contribution to African and African American studies and humanities with Encarta Africana. Dr. Du Bois would have been proud."

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 12.
 
Now Playing
 
 * "AFFLICTION," starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Mr. Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Mr. Schrader, this pure, unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks's novel starts on a deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin). 

 "AT FIRST SIGHT," starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. Directed by Irwin Winkler (PG-13, 128 minutes). In this overlong and often desperately banal version of a case study reported by Dr. Oliver Sacks, Mr. Kilmer plays a man whose nearly lifelong blindness was suddenly alleviated by surgery. Ms. Sorvino plays the bright-eyed New York career woman who falls in love with him, then urges him to change his once-peaceful life. But the film brings little more than case-study data to communicating how this man's restored sight affected him, or what made it a mixed blessing. Sample dialogue: "Have you ever listened to the rain? I mean, really listened?" (Maslin).
 
 * "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
 
 * "A CIVIL ACTION," starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall. Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes). This story of a David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters, with Mr. Travolta first-rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a conscience, could have been business as usual in the legal thriller genre. But Mr. Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film, based on Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn, Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and white, and is all the better for its shades of gray. Mr. Duvall is outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
 
 "DR. AKAGI," starring Akira Emoto. Directed by Shohei Imamura (not rated, 128 minutes). This bawdy gallows comedy centering on the treatment of hepatitis is an eclectic footnote to the career of a Japanese filmmaker known for quirky daring (as in, most recently, "The Eel"). Based on a novel called "Dr. Liver" and set near the end of World War II, it unfolds with comic sprightliness in a seaside village near Hiroshima, where the health of the doctor's friends and neighbors is generally no laughing matter. The film's blend of frank earthiness, harsh flippancy, bizarre kinks and flashes of unlikely formal beauty may not do much to make liver disease riveting. But they do make the septuagenarian Mr. Imamura arguably the youngest-hearted filmmaker in Japan (Maslin).
 
 * "THE GENERAL," starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight. Directed by John Boorman (not rated, 125 minutes). Mr. Boorman's best and most stylish film in years is the deftly told story of Martin Cahill. Nicknamed "the General" for his crime-plotting strategies, this Irish gang leader and master thief is played with splendid brio by Mr. Gleeson. Photographed gorgeously in black and white, the film tells of his elaborate art and jewel heists, his unusual domestic arrangement with his wife's sister and his singular difficulties with the I.R.A. and the law. Mr. Voight is outstandingly good as the police detective who knows all of Cahill's tricks (Maslin).
 
 "IN DREAMS," starring Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn and Robert Downey Jr. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 112 minutes). At heart this is just a campfire story, and a pretty loony one at that. But Mr. Jordan directs it furiously a la "Interview With the Vampire" with a lush, insinuating visual style that gets right under the skin. Working with the inventive cinematographer Darius Khondji, he stirs up a nightmare brooding and intuitive enough to recall at times the richly textured mysteries of Nicolas Roeg's "Don't Look Now." Ms. Bening plays a psychic plagued by the thoughts of a serial killer, whom Mr. Downey makes as bizarre and disturbing as he can, in a performance that makes this story's craziest dreams come true (Maslin).
 
 * "MISSISSIPPI MERMAID," starring Catherine Deneuve and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Directed by Francois Truffaut (not rated, 123 minutes). The Film Forum (209 West Houston Street in the South Village) continues its two-week run of this bewitching, circuitous love story in the guise of a globe-trotting caper film, with Ms. Deneuve and Mr. Belmondo at their most dazzling. She plays a demure mail-order bride who swindles Mr. Belmondo's wealthy tobacco grower, and by the time she is revealed to be a con woman, the intrigue is over -- but that's where the romance really starts. Rarely shown theatrically, it now includes 13 especially tender, character-revealing moments that had been cut for the film's 1970 American release (Maslin).
 
 "PATCH ADAMS," starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter. Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor intent on making terminal patients laugh, Mr. Williams delivers a little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's "Ace Ventura" days. He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine excuse for Mr. Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist (Maslin).
 
 * "THE PRINCE OF EGYPT," starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came the great expectations for this animated magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film struggling mightily to balance animated whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must initially be seen as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles serve as special inspiration for the animators' reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).
 
 "PRIVATE CONFESSIONS," starring Pernilla August and Max Von Sydow. Written by Ingmar Bergman. Directed by Liv Ullmann (not rated, 127 minutes). The pedigree is irresistible, the screenplay often wrenchingly astute, as Mr. Bergman delves with wisdom into a spiritual and marital crisis experienced by his mother. In a film directed by Ms. Ullmann with Bergmanesque watchfulness, and with enough assurance to recall his devastating "Scenes From a Marriage," an adulterous liaison becomes a defining event in the life of a lonely, restless woman. Set mostly in 1925, the film also visits her past and her future, and features a formidable performance from Mr. Von Sydow and from Ms. August, passionately extending upon her "Best Intentions" role (Maslin).
 
 * "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE," starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
 * "A SIMPLE PLAN," starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This onetime cult horror director makes a flawless transition to mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path. The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the sky, and Scott Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance from Mr. Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin).
 
 "STEPMOM," starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female stars, both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest person ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama lion. Even when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages to maintain its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the circumstances) sense of fun. As in "Home Alone," Mr. Columbus directs with sunny indifference to reality, medical, economic or otherwise (Maslin).
 
 "THE THIN RED LINE," starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones's Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear that Mr. Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style that made "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven" the most beautiful films of the 1970's is instantly apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: no one who admired Mr. Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here (Maslin).
 
 * "YOU'VE GOT MAIL," starring Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Greg Kinnear and Parker Posey. Directed by Nora Ephron (PG, 110 minutes). This cozy, inviting comedy romanticizes the rivalry between two bookstore owners, while also finding time to fall in love with books themselves, the instant intimacy of E-mail and a picture-perfect rendering of Manhattan's Upper West Side. With a feel-good ambience much less forced than that of "Sleepless in Seattle," Ms. Ephron borrows adroitly from "The Shop Around the Corner" while making this knowing, urbanely funny film very much her own. Ms. Ryan is fresh and adorable without trying, while a ruefully lovelorn Mr. Hanks proves that he can do anything. Again (Maslin).
 
 Film Series
 
 "ANIME: THE HISTORY OF JAPANESE ANIMATED FILMS." A series at the Japan Society devoted to anime, the increasingly popular Japanese animated films that evolved from the comics, reaches a high point this weekend with a two-day symposium devoted to the genre. Tomorrow and Sunday, creators, critics, scholars and industry representatives will discuss anime and its influence on Japanese society and visual culture elsewhere in the world, and audiences will be shown a world premiere and other films. Directed by Hiroyuki Okiura, the world premiere film, "Jinroh," at 4:30 P.M. tomorrow, will be introduced by its writer, Mamoru Oshii. Based on "Little Red Riding Hood," the film portrays a cruel but sentimental relationship between a police officer and a 17-year-old girl who has lost her motivation for life. On Sunday, Mr. Oshii will discuss "Ghost in the Shell" a film about a cyborg pursuing a computer criminal that is to be shown at 8:30 tonight. The series continues through Feb. 26 at the Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan. Two-day symposium tickets, purchased in advance: $55; $25 for students. Symposium single tickets: $30; $15 for students. Screening tickets: $8; $5 for students. Information: (212) 752-3015 (Lawrence Van Gelder).Philip V. Caruso/MGM

HEADLINE: Microsoft and the Question of Monopoly

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The judge in the Microsoft antitrust trial asked the company's expert witness on economics a series of skeptical questions today, suggesting that the Microsoft Corporation may have a difficult time with one of its defenses -- that it does not have a monopoly in the market for personal computer operating systems.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson interrupted when a Microsoft lawyer was questioning Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist and dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, about the price Microsoft charges for its industry-standard Windows operating system. Mr. Schmalensee was explaining his view that the modest price Microsoft charges for Windows, typically less than 5 percent of the cost of a personal computer, indicated a company concerned about current and potential competition instead of the predatory monopolist the Government has tried to paint for the court. 
 But Judge Jackson cut in to ask if there could be sound business reasons that even a monopolist might charge less today "in search of larger glory at some later date."
To illustrate his point, the judge spoke of the hypothetical case of a cigarette company that might keep its prices low to hook generations of future smokers and customers.
"There isn't any indication," Mr. Schmalensee replied, "that Windows is that kind of addiction."
Judge Jackson seemed unconvinced. "Do you have kids?" he asked Mr. Schmalensee.
Yes, the M.I.T. dean replied, "but not all kids use Windows, Your Honor. Some use Macs," a reference to Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh machines, which run the Mac operating system.
The judge's occasional questions are scrutinized by both sides as a possible clue to his thinking. This is not a jury trial, so at least at the Federal district court level, Judge Jackson will determine the outcome of the case. Legal experts say that queries from the bench do not foreshadow a verdict but do suggest the issues a judge is focusing on when weighing testimony.
Whether Microsoft has a monopoly in the market for personal computer operating systems is not directly at issue in this case. The Justice Department and 19 states are not suing Microsoft for having a monopoly but for illegally using its market muscle to defend and extend the reach of its monopoly.
Still, if Microsoft can convince the court that it is not a monopoly, the Government's case collapses.
Under questioning from Richard Urowsky, a Microsoft lawyer, Mr. Schmalensee explained that his key assumption in explaining the company's business practices -- its pricing, investment spending and deals -- is that it lives in an industry characterized by "dynamic competition."
Unlike old smokestack industries, Mr. Schmalensee said, the software business requires even the incumbent leaders to move quickly, to keep prices low and to innovate continually. "Microsoft is constantly concerned with being displaced as a leader," he said.
The Government argues that Microsoft's behavior is that of a modern monopolist. It is in a fast-moving high-technology business, the Government concedes, but its monopoly position is nonetheless resilient partly because of the reluctance of consumers to switch operating systems once they have taken the time and trouble to figure out Windows, which runs on more than 90 percent of personal computers sold. This kind of self-reinforcing dependency -- "high switching costs," in economic terms -- was what Judge Jackson was alluding to with his cigarette-monopoly example.
The Government contends that Microsoft used exclusionary contracts with personal computer makers and others to unfairly shield its monopoly from the threat posed by the Internet generally, but especially by the Netscape Communications Corporation, the pioneer in software for browsing the World Wide Web, and Sun Microsystems Inc., the creator of Java, an Internet programming language.
But Mr. Schmalensee testified that even if one assumed that Microsoft was indeed a monopoly, there was no convincing evidence Microsoft did anything to restrict the distribution of Netscape's browsing software.
The Justice Department has introduced documents showing that some PC makers complained when Microsoft imposed new contract restrictions in 1996 that limited their freedom to do as they please with the first desktop screen that appears when users turn on their machines. The PC makers would prefer a free hand in selling that valuable commercial real estate to software makers, including Microsoft's rivals, to load their icons.
But Mr. Schmalensee testified that those restrictions were mostly modest, such as limiting the size of icons that can be displayed. Microsoft, he added, typically uses for its own software seven of the available 49 spaces for desktop icons.
"There is lots of room for PC makers to put on other icons, so Microsoft does not limit software distribution through the desktop," Mr. Schmalensee said.
The Government replies that by bundling its browser with Windows and giving it away free, Microsoft used its monopoly to give its browser an unfair edge and drive up the distribution costs of Netscape.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Rises, Setting Record Early

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
In a sign of how fast the American economy was growing at the end of the year and how quickly many other economies were slowing, the United States trade deficit widened sharply in November, setting a record for a year in just 11 months.
As consumers and businesses took advantage of import bargains and exporters struggled to sell in shrinking markets, the gap between American exports and imports jumped to $15.5 billion, from $13.5 billion in October, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. 
 With December remaining to be counted, the deficit for 1998 has already reached $153.9 billion, making it the worst year for trade since 1987, when the deficit was $153.4 billion, the previous record.
"This is a pretty lousy report," said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs.
To be sure, the deficit is not nearly as big relative to the size of the economy -- 2 percent of the gross domestic product in 1998 compared with 3.3 percent in 1987. And despite the surge in November, Mr. Dudley and other forecasters estimate that the economy grew at an annual rate of at least 4 percent in the fourth quarter.
Things are likely to get worse before they get better, and further deterioration in the trade deficit may well slow the pace of what has become the longest peacetime expansion in United States history.
Although the Asian economic crisis may be easing, growth in Europe is slowing and much of Latin America is stagnating or slipping into recession.
What is more, any lift that American exports get from the weaker dollar will most likely take months to materialize. Most forecasters think that the trade deficit will keep getting bigger, although not as rapidly as in parts of 1998.
Exports, which have been declining for most of the last year, fell by an additional 2 percent in November. The hardest-hit category was capital equipment -- aircraft, trucks and computers -- which accounts for nearly one-quarter of United States foreign sales.
At the same time, imports of construction gear, machine tools and other capital equipment soared -- suggesting that American businesses were not cutting back as much on new investment as some economists had feared.
The rise in the trade deficit is actually worse than the figures indicate because import prices have been falling in dollar terms as the currencies of Asian and Latin American countries have weakened and the world market for raw materials from copper to oil has plunged. On average, imported goods are 3.5 percent cheaper than a year earlier, while the cost of foreign petroleum products is down more than 34 percent. That means the volume of imports is even bigger than the statistics would indicate.
Because of seasonal quirks in the Commerce Department's trade statistics, the figures typically look deceptively good in the fourth quarter. The fact that the fourth-quarter numbers look as bad as they do at this point does not bode well for the current quarter.
Politically, the bulging trade deficit has become a serious concern for the Clinton Administration, underscored by the President's harsh words for Japanese steelmakers in his State of the Union address Tuesday night and his call for a new round of global trade talks. The Administration had already been urging the Europeans to import more, saying that the United States could not be the importer of only resort.
Although the deficits with Japan and China appeared to narrow, indicating that the recent weakening of the dollar against the yen was having some effect, the true picture is hard to measure because trade figures from those countries, which are not seasonally adjusted, among other things, are widely questioned.
Many American manufacturers have been hurt by intense price competition over the last year, and weak export markets have helped whittle away their profits, touching off a painful round of cutbacks and layoffs.
The growing trade imbalance also has some potentially negative implications for the dollar, as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned in his testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday. The United States' rapidly expanding current-account deficit -- a broad measure of the nation's international transactions that covers not only trade but also overseas transactions such as tourism, investments, services and brokerage fees -- is becoming sufficiently large to call into question foreign investors' willingness to keep putting money into United States assets at the current pace. If the appetite for United States assets no longer keeps pace with Americans' appetite for imports, the dollar comes under a lot of pressure.
That said, the trade deficit continues to be a boon to an economy that has been running flat out. Because American resources are stretched to the limit, with unemployment at its lowest level in a generation, the trade deficit is an important safety valve that helps keep inflation at bay.
"If we had not had all the imports, the economy would have had to expand far beyond its capacity to do so," said Pierre Ellis of Primark Decision Economics. "It's hard to believe that we wouldn't have had more inflation."
If, for example, the trade deficit had not worsened this year, the economy would have had to grow 5.5 percent, instead of the estimated 4 percent or so, to keep up with roaring domestic demand. It is also hard to see how real incomes could have risen as they did if imports and foreign competition had not held down the prices of a wide variety of goods from clothes and heating oil to electronic gadgets.
A separate report yesterday from the Department of Labor hinted at a possible softening in the tight labor market. First-time unemployment claims fell by 14,000, to 346,000 for the week ending on Jan. 16. But the four-week moving average, which economists prefer because it gives a truer reading of the underlying trend, rose to its highest level since early 1996 except for the period during a strike against General Motors last summer.

HEADLINE: Despite Vote on Austerity Measure, Brazil's Markets Take Dip

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 21

 BODY:
A day after Congress approved austerity measures perceived by investors as a crucial test of the country's commitment to reduce systematic overspending, its currency and stock market fell, and fears mounted that Brazil is running low on dollars to pay for debts, imports and other expenses.
Since Brazil devalued its currency on Friday, saying that it would no longer spend upward of $1 billion a day to protect the real, an average of $300 million a day has reportedly continued to leave for other countries. 
 As of 8:30 tonight $290 million had left today. Since September foreign reserves have fallen, from $75 billion to less than $30 billion.
The Bovespa share index fell 4.59 percent today, and the value of the real closed 1.70 to the dollar at the commercial rate, a drop of 7 percent under the Wednesday close of 1.59. Since Jan. 12 the real has fallen 40 percent from its initial level of 1.21 to the dollar.
"We're dealing with a very uncertain scenario now," the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro, Joel Korn, said. "We have too many questions and very few answers, really."
The falling currency and increasing interest rates have raised questions over whether Brazil might seek a moratorium or rescheduling its debt payments.
Many experts said they did not believe that a moratorium was inevitable, but nor could it be ruled out. The Group of Seven industrial nations, the United States and the International Monetary Fund are leading a $41.5 billion bailout to help Brazil weather its worst crisis since President Fernando Henrique Cardoso took office four years ago.
The Government, Paulo Rabello de Castro, chairman of SR Rating-Duss & Phelps, said, "has all the political incentives to not even consider the 'M word.' "
While nobody here is saying Mr. Cardoso's victory on Wednesday in Congress on revising the deficit-ridden social security system was too late, economists are contending that the Government's actions to cut costs will have be far more dramatic than anything rolled out so far.
The Government budget deficit, before devaluation, was a galloping 8 percent of the gross national product, or $65 billion, much of it aggravated by high interest rates.
Despite speculation that Brazil might lower interest rates because of the devaluation, it has raised them, with I.M.F. support.
The high interest rates are a counterweight to inflation, which has for most of the last 40 years moved at stratospheric levels. But high rates, while keeping money out of the private sector, are fueling higher debt costs for the Government.
Analysts said that could not last for long.
"The service of the debt is overwhelming now," Mr. Castro said. "So unless the Government does what it has to do quickly it could reach the point of no return. The fundamental that's missing is a real attack on the public sector debt."
Analysts here say they are convinced that Brazil faces a tougher task to rebuild the confidence of foreign investors, who are most unlikely to start putting money back into Brazil on the strength of signals like the Wednesday night vote alone.
"No one can say in good conscience what's going to happen in inflation or to the exchange or the level of economic activity in the country," Mr. Korn said. "All along investors have been motivated to invest in Brazil based on the monetary stability, low inflation, transparency and the way they could see a clear direction. And now everybody's kind of up in the air, because the exchange rate change changed the whole equation."
Martin Arranz of Banco Patente here said, "The important point for rebuilding the internal market will be to see dollars coming in."
Mentioning a series of Congressional votes on extending and increasing a tax on financial transactions, Mr. Arranz said: "Nobody wants to bet on whether it will pass. They'll wait until it does pass."
Mr. Arranz estimated that Brazil would need $50 billion to finance payments on Eurobonds, tourist spending and interest and service on Brady bonds. He said he expected $15 billion in direct investments to enter Brazil and $3 billion in import payments.
"So there will be $22 billion that Brazil will need to receive through other forms of investment," Mr. Arranz added.
Brazil had forecast losing $5 billion from its reserves in the first three months of the year. Instead, it has lost $6 billion in the first 14 business days.
Because the Central Bank is no longer intervening in currency trading to buy reals, it has not been clear how much of the money leaving Brazil since Friday is going out from the Central Bank coffers and how much might be dollars that banks here bought at cheaper levels and are now sending out of the country.

Train to Plane Is Seen Mainly As a Pain

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
IF for some reason you were hungry for outrage and skepticism, you could have done no better than to show up on Wednesday night at the Robert Ross Johnson Family Life Center, in St. Albans. The map said this was Queens. But those were unmistakably Bronx cheers coming from 400 people who packed a community board meeting to vent their anger at a planned rail link to Kennedy International Airport.
"I'd like to ask one question," a man said in a booming voice. "Who asked for this damn thing?" 
 In fact, quite a few New Yorkers have. Rail lines to both Kennedy and LaGuardia Airports have been deemed essential by transportation specialists for decades. The real question is not who asked for this thing, but rather if the city's needs will be met by this particular $1.5 billion project of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Slowly, New York is catching up to other major cities, which have long recognized that the way to beat the strangling effects of the automobile is with a downtown-to-airport rail connection. A spectacular example is a new express train that whisks travelers from Heathrow Airport to Paddington Station in central London in 15 minutes.
The Port Authority plan is not nearly as efficient. But its basic purpose is the same: to help keep the city hopping, not to make it cheaper for skiers to get to Gstaad. "The airport economy is critical to your interests and needs," Cruz Russell, the authority's director of policy and planning, told the audience in St. Albans.
But the crowd, mostly from nearby Jamaica, wasn't impressed. Anyone speaking up for the project found himself hooted down with shouts of "Here comes another liar" and "You don't live in our community."
There is no question that Jamaica residents, especially those by the Van Wyck Expressway, will feel pain from a project that largely benefits travelers to and from Manhattan.
In case you are unfamiliar with it, the plan has three components: a loop connecting Kennedy's terminals, a link from the airport to the Howard Beach stop on the A train, and a hookup from Kennedy to a station in Jamaica where travelers can switch to the Long Island Rail Road or to the E, J and Z subway trains. That last section is the one in dispute because it involves an elevated train slicing through Jamaica, above the median of the Van Wyck.
No way, local residents said.
They protested that they can expect years of air pollution and clogged streets once construction begins. They were unmoved when Mr. Russell promised that the authority would try "to disincent" trucks from using local roads. (Where does this bureaucratese come from?) They talked about the unsightliness of a 50-foot-high elevated line, and pointed out that few of them will ever use it because it will make no local stops.
It was, in short, Nimby-ism in high gear. How you build a corridor to a Queens airport without affecting one Queens neighborhood or another was left a mystery.
More impressive for other New Yorkers may be questions raised about whether the so-called Airtrain is worth the pain it will inflict, not to mention its high cost.
Unlike the Heathrow Express, it will not provide a seamless "one-seat" ride. Travelers willing to lug suitcases all the way from Manhattan on the E train must then switch at Jamaica. To critics, it sounds like a souped-up version of the "Train to the Plane," which died in 1990 because, as some noted on Wednesday, few tourists were prepared to "schlep their bags" across two trains.
THE Port Authority says there are ways around the problem, including a possible baggage check-in at Jamaica. Still, it expects only 7,000 people a day to use the Airtrain, possibly as many as half of them airport workers, not travelers. While this is being billed as but a first step toward an eventual one-seat ride, critics ask whether it's really what planners have dreamed of for so long, justifying the need to turn a neighborhood upside down.
For now, the project is lumbering through New York's complex land-use process. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has given his qualified approval, but the City Council must also climb aboard.
So there is still a way to go, with not much guaranteed except perhaps that most Jamaica residents will continue to agree with a woman who stood up in St. Albans and said, "I'm tired of all of you ignoring us when we say N-O."

StockPrices Fall As an Internet Selloff Continues

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Internet and other technology stocks helped lead equity markets lower yesterday as investors grappled with several uncertainties.
One was the question of how far Internet companies can go without bringing home some earnings, a worry that has pushed these stocks down sharply in the last week. Another was the outlook for corporate earnings over all, as the reporting season for the fourth quarter got into full swing. 
 Investors were also taking note of Brazil, where the currency dropped another 7 percent yesterday and the stock market fell 4.6 percent. Since Brazil devalued its currency, the real, on Jan. 13, it is down 29 percent. In the same period, the Bovespa stock index, even with yesterday's decline, is up 44.8 percent.
But the outlook remains uncertain because it is not clear yet how successful Brazil's economic stabilization program will be in the new environment of a floating currency.
On Wall Street yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 71.83 points, or nearly eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 9,264.08, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.46 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,235.16. The Nasdaq composite index finished down 70.77 points, or 2.9 percent, at 2,344.72.
Both the S.& P. and the Nasdaq are more heavily weighted with technology stocks than the Dow is. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks declined 6.57 points, or 1.5 percent, to 424.05.
The recent spectacular run-up in Internet stocks, which many analysts are now routinely referring to as a bubble, was bound to take some kind of pause. But for a lot of investors that "correction" may have been far more violent than they expected.
The Street.com Internet index, which includes the likes of Amazon.com, Excite, America Online and Yahoo, soared 308 percent from the bottom of last year's technology-stock selloff Oct. 8 through its high Jan. 11. Since then it has fallen 17.9 percent, including a 5.1 percent decline yesterday.
Even more unnerving has been the flight path of Amazon.com, the Internet bookseller. On Jan. 8 it hit an intraday high of 199 1/8 a share. Yesterday, at its intraday low, it was down more than 50 percent, at 92 9/16 , in just eight trading sessions. It rallied somewhat to finish yesterday at 106, down 7.
Also leading the Internet decline yesterday were Excite, down 10 3/4 a share, to 85 7/8; At Home, off 12 3/8, to 97 3/8, and Yahoo, down 22 3/16 , to 265.
Whether this Internet rally -- or frenzy -- is over or just taking a break is hard to tell.
In Tokyo yesterday, Barton Biggs, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, told Bloomberg News: "I promise you that, like all bubbles, this bubble will come to a very, very bad end. The only trouble is that none of us know when."
Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, suggests that the sector's retreat does not mean the Internet will not bear fruit for investors. But it may mean some investors are thinking the way he is, that the big Internet names of recent rallies may not be the big Internet winners in the future.
In Mr. McManus's opinion, the real future winners could be established companies, like Ethan Allen Interiors, that learn to use the Internet as a tool. It will be easier, he said, for such companies to develop their Internet skills than for some Internet companies to develop their performances as, for example, a furniture retailer.
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company in Rye Brook, N.Y., agrees.
When shares of Amazon.com traded at nearly $200, its investors' dream must have been that the company would expand well beyond books and kill Wal-Mart Stores, he said.
But, Mr. Barbera asked: "Do you think that Wal-Mart will roll over and die? Don't you think there will be a Wal-Mart.com?"
On corporate earnings, a third of the companies in the S.& P. 500 index have reported so far for the fourth quarter. Of these, 54.4 percent have had positive earnings surprises while 21.6 percent have had negative surprises, according to I.B.E.S. International, a research firm that tracks corporate earnings.
That performance is on par with recent quarters at the same point.
So far, earnings are up for the fourth quarter, but I.B.E.S. expects a decline when all the companies have reported.

Bond Market Rallies
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bonds rose for the first session in a week yesterday as stocks slumped, enhancing the appeal of the less-risky Treasury securities.
The slide in stocks is "creating a little bit of a flight into bonds," said Richard Schwartz, who manages $23 billion at New York Life Asset Management in Parsippany, N.J.
The 30-year bond rose 19/32 , to a price of 101 26/32 . Its yield, which falls when prices rise, declined to 5.13 percent, from 5.17 percent on Friday.
Yields on two-year notes, the most actively traded Treasuries, fell one- hundredth of a percentage point, to 4.61 percent.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Has Few Options on Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Republicans were quick to criticize President Clinton's proposal to invest a portion of Social Security's reserves in the stock market, but they have been slow to lay out any specific alternative for dealing with the retirement system's problems because other options have their own economic and political drawbacks.
Mr. Clinton's plan is built around earmarking $2.7 trillion in projected Federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years for Social Security, and investing around $700 billion of that in stocks in an effort to capture some of the hefty returns available on Wall Street. 
 Republicans do not object to using a big part of the surplus for Social Security, and party leaders like Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, endorsed the President's approach today on that score. They also support efforts to reap higher investment returns.
But Republicans are divided over whether the best way to use the surplus on behalf of Social Security is to pay down the national debt, as Mr. Clinton wants, and they have rejected the idea of the Government becoming a stock buyer, saying it would amount to meddling in the free enterprise system.
Instead, Republicans want Social Security to be remade to allow individuals to invest part of their payroll taxes in stocks and bonds.
There are two basic approaches to doing so, each with its own proponents and critics, and its own political risks.
Under one approach, two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that finances Social Security would be diverted into private investment accounts owned by each worker. But making such a plan work would require substantial cuts in Social Security's guaranteed benefit through mechanisms like increasing the retirement age and tweaking the formulas that determine average lifetime earnings.
Although its proponents say the return on investment from the private accounts would more than make up for cutbacks in the guaranteed benefit, the political cost of making the necessary cutbacks is sufficient that some Republicans are backing away.
The second approach, which is increasingly popular among Republicans, would provide offsetting tax breaks to workers who placed part of their payroll tax into private accounts. But it would pay for the change largely by using the surplus, and would reduce guaranteed benefits only to the degree that gains from the investment account still allowed each worker to come out ahead.
This approach, developed by Prof. Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, would be pain-free -- but only for a decade or two, when the Government would again face huge deficits after the baby boom generation begins to retire. In effect, critics say, it would just push down the road for a few years the hard decisions about how to insure Social Security's long-term solvency, and make it difficult if not impossible to reduce the national debt in the meantime.
The Republicans are not alone in their dilemma. Although he put forth a framework for dealing with Social Security, the President admitted that his ideas would not solve the entire problem, and that the Administration and Congress would still have to make some tough choices about tax increases and benefit cuts to get the job done.
"Clinton's speech only gave the easy solutions, and the Republicans only responded with their easy solutions," said Ron Gebhardtsbauer, senior pension fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, a nonpartisan research organization. "We're looking for the free lunch."
The President's effort to minimize the pain rests on his proposal to devote $2 trillion over the next 15 years to reducing the national debt. (The other $700 billion he would earmark for Social Security would be invested in the stock market.)
Under the Administration's plan, the $2 trillion would be used by the Social Security system to buy Government bonds held by the public.
Those bonds would then essentially become part of the Social Security trust fund, and the interest payments on them would bolster the retirement system's reserves, extending its solvency to about 2050 from 2032.
To some degree, the approach is an accounting gimmick. Because the debt would be transferred from the public onto the Government's own books, it would not reduce the total debt outstanding, currently about $5.5 trillion, which includes money the Government owes to itself under its complex accounting system.
But it would reduce the publicly held debt, now about $3.8 trillion. And it is that public debt portion of the nation's balance sheet that is more important economically, because its size determines how much competition there is between the Government and the private sector for capital.
The lower the publicly held debt, the less the Government's borrowing needs push up interest rates and crowd out investment by companies in new products, factories and jobs. In that sense, reducing the publicly held debt could boost the economy, which would in turn help Social Security by increasing the number of people working, the size of their paychecks and the taxes they pay to support the retirement system.
But Mr. Clinton's plan would not solve all of Social Security's problems, and White House officials acknowledge that the Administration and Congress still have to find a way to deal with the remaining shortfall over the next 75 years.
At a hearing before the Ways and Means Committee today, the Rev. Jesse Jackson argued for a traditional liberal Democratic approach, saying Social Security should remain an intergenerational commitment with a guaranteed benefit. Jack F. Kemp, the 1996 Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, called for "a shareholder democracy" built on wealth accumulation through individual accounts.
But Republicans remain reluctant to get any more specific about how they would proceed until the President provides more details of what steps he is willing to support.
Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, said on Tuesday that the retirement system could be shored up through private accounts "without touching a dime in Social Security funds, without raising one nickel in taxes, without touching one penny in current benefits."
But Ms. Dunn did not explain how, prompting Mr. Gebhardtsbauer of the American Academy of Actuaries to say that she "ignores the fact that if there is no pain anywhere, it ends up being our kids who pay."

Special Help for Elderly Extends to Less Affluent

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
The first rental building in Manhattan to be built mainly for low- and moderate-income elderly tenants that will provide professional assisted-living services is rising on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 108th Street in East Harlem. It will contain 127 apartments in a 14-story structure overlooking Central Park.
Monthly rents at the de Sales Residence, to be completed next January, will be $2,500 to $3,500 for the studio apartments, each with 400 to 532 square feet and full kitchens. Rents will include three meals a day, if desired, as well as all services, from recreational programs to personal care like assistance with bathing. The building is named after the Roman Catholic Church of St. Francis de Sales on East 96th Street. 
 Ninety percent of the units in the L-shaped structure, which will frame an interior courtyard, will be for Medicaid-eligible tenants earning less than $20,000 a year, including Social Security and pension. For those residents, the monthly rent will be covered entirely by Social Security and Medicaid payments. The other units will not have income restrictions.
Assisted living is a type of housing for people age 75 and older who need help with daily chores but not constant medical care. Many such projects being built in New York City cater to the affluent elderly. But the $23 million de Sales project is the first low- and moderate-income version to be built and privately financed in Manhattan.
The nonprofit developer -- the SFDS Development Corporation, which comprises nine Roman Catholic parishes in East Harlem, in partnership with St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center and Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center -- is able to do so for several reasons. For one, the project has been approved by the State Department of Health as an assisted living residence, enabling it to accept Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income reimbursements from tenants as rent payment.
It is one of eight such projects, totaling 820 units, approved in New York City in 1997 by the state agency, which supports the assisted living concept as an alternative to nursing homes. Such projects must be licensed by the state as adult homes or enriched housing and provide personal care through a licensed agency.
"We know there is a population interested in this type of housing," said Claire Pospisil, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health. She said it was compiling a report on assisted living that would define the future need for such housing in the state.
The de Sales project is licensed as an enriched housing residence, which provides meals and recreation. St. Vincent's Hospital will provide the health care.
As for the economics, the developer secured tax-exempt financing and a full property-tax exemption from the city as well as public loans and private grants, said Terrence Moan, a principal of DDM Development and Services of East Harlem, the project's consultant.
"There are many low- and moderate-income elderly in the city, yet there is little of this type of housing being built for them," said Mr. Moan, who was the city's Commissioner of Real Estate under Mayor Edward I. Koch. "It is a greatly under-served niche."
The cost of building the project is being primarily covered by $21 million in tax-exempt bonds from New York City's Housing Development Corporation. That first mortgage is being insured during construction by a letter of credit from the Dime Savings Bank of New York and, when completed, by the State of New York Mortgage Agency. The developer also obtained grants of $1.15 million, $400,000 and $25,000 respectively from the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Alexander Abraham Foundation and Dime, as well as a $960,000 low-interest second mortgage from the Housing Development Corporation.
The developer bought the site, formerly a parking lot and among the last available parcels facing the park on Fifth Avenue, in 1997 for $1.85 million. But Mr. Moan said the seller -- the Deacon Group. headed by Charles F. Feeney, a duty-free-shops entrepreneur turned philanthropist -- agreed to finance all but $450,000 of the price, which will be repaid over five years.
Russell A. Harding, the president of the Housing Development Corporation, described the de Sales project as "a tremendous innovation in senior living."
Mr. Harding said the $230 million approved last month for the second round of the corporation's New Housing Opportunities Program, begun late in 1997 to spur middle-income housing, would include financing for assisted-living quarters for the middle-income elderly. Under the program, the corporation issues taxable bonds and uses its own reserves to provide low-interest financing to builders.
The de Sales building, designed by the Manhattan architectural firm of Schuman, Lichtenstein, Claman & Efron, will rise to 14 stories on Fifth Avenue and to 9 stories on 108th Street. It will feature a two-story granite and limestone base, while the upper floors will be red brick with vertical bands of pink brick.
There will be 10,000 square feet of common space, including a library, lounge, and music and exercise rooms, some of which will open onto the interior courtyard. Also planned are a rooftop deck on the 9th floor and a dining room on the 14th floor, offering views of Central Park. Leasing is expected to begin next fall.

HEADLINE: Begrudging The Neighbors Their Good Luck;
Suit by Newly Rich Oneidas Stirs Up Other Resentments

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: VERONA, N.Y.

 BODY:
Five years ago, people in this quiet, rural community gazed with envy and amazement at the instant success of the Oneida Indian Nation's new Turning Stone Casino, an economic juggernaut that created thousands of jobs and lured millions of visitors to this desolate area halfway between Syracuse and Utica.
A few grumbled that it was unfair that the Oneidas did not have to pay taxes on their new wealth. A few others complained that the casino was crowding out small businesses. Yet on balance, most tolerated the incongruously mammoth Oz-like resort here, perhaps rationalizing that the Oneida Indians deserved a leg up after suffering years of poverty and discrimination. 
 But that was before it got personal.
Last month, the Oneidas and the Justice Department announced that they wanted to include 20,000 landowners as defendants in a long-stewing lawsuit to reclaim 270,000 acres from New York State. And almost immediately, the peaceful coexistence was shattered, as landowners flocked to meetings, hinted at violence and snubbed Oneida businesses.
"You'll never catch me buying their gas or going to their casino again," said Rosemary Canaguier, 60, who was combing the golden curls of a longtime customer, Bette V. Button, at the hair salon Ms. Canaguier runs in her house in Canastota. "There's a terrible, terrible dislike now. I don't think you'll ever see the people here ever trusting them again."
There is more, however, to this slide from empathy to enmity than just the fear of losing land that is roughly equivalent to the areas of New York City, Washington and Boston combined.
For many, the land-claim dispute has brought to the surface a latent sense of frustration and jealousy over the phenomenal success of the Oneida Indian Nation, which, like all federally recognized Indian tribes, does not pay taxes. Just like that, it seems, the Oneidas have rocketed from poverty to affluence, from being the have-nots to the haves, while everyone else in a working-class area stocked with grind-it-out dairy farmers has seen income stagnate.
So for many non-Oneidas, watching the Oneidas ask for the most prized of possessions around here -- one's land -- is tantamount to watching the rich squeeze the not-so-rich. And the Federal Government's decision to side with the Oneidas, many people say, only compounds their outrage.
"It smacks of nothing more than greed, and people feel betrayed because we've given them every advantage that every private businessman would die for," said David Wood, an Oneida County legislator. "For God's sake, how much is enough? Not only do we feel threatened, we're offended that our neighbors would do this."
That cocktail of anger and vulnerability figures to intensify in the coming months, residents say. On March 29, Judge Neal McCurn of Federal District Court in Syracuse is expected to hear arguments on whether to include the landowners in the Federal lawsuit. Judge McCurn is also expected to decide soon whether to appoint an arbitrator to do what the Oneidas and New York State officials have failed to do for more than 13 years: hammer out a compromise.
In 1970, the Oneidas filed a lawsuit in Federal court saying that New York State and local governments had illegally acquired Oneida lands in the late 1700's and early 1800's through illegal and coercive treaties. Fifteen years later, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Oneidas' argument.
At that point, the state began to negotiate with the Oneidas. But for years, nothing happened -- nothing, that is, until December, when the Oneidas and the Justice Department, seeking to pressure the state into a settlement, moved to name the 20,000 landowners as defendants.
"We have to use a tool of discomfort, and that we regret," said Ray Halbritter, nation representative and chief executive of the Oneida Indian Nation.
Mr. Halbritter said that the Oneidas did not want to evict anyone. Instead, he said that he would push for a creative solution that would benefit all parties.
The Justice Department has echoed that position. So, too, has the state. In a statement last month, Gov. George E. Pataki said, "We are going to make sure no one loses their homes, no one loses their property."
So far, though, such assurances have only bred more cynicism and mistrust in the land-claim area of northern Madison and western Oneida Counties.
At a forum in Verona, Michael Gaiser, owner of a bed-and-breakfast in Vernon who said his business has been severely clipped by the Oneidas' casino hotel, captured the bunkerlike mentality.
"The Justice Department is the one standing there telling us they're going to sue us, and you're telling us that we're not going to be giving up our land," said an exasperated Mr. Gaiser, his voice billowing with a timbre reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart. "Well, I don't know if I believe you!"
Mr. Gaiser was one of 350 people to attend the meeting, organized by Ralph J. Eannace Jr., the Oneida County Executive. Many belonged to a vocal landowners' group, Upstate Citizens for Equality, which was founded two years ago to challenge the Oneidas' tax-free status but has swelled in recent weeks to 1,000 members because of the land-claim dispute, said its president, Scott E. Peterman.
Mr. Eannace had invited the public to quiz a panel of state and county lawyers involved in the negotiations. But the mood was often testy, as speaker after speaker dismissed the relevance of something that happened 200 years ago, accused local politicians of being beholden to Oneida campaign contributions, and blamed the Oneidas -- now the area's largest employer, with 3,000 jobs -- for the souring fortunes of dozens of local businesses.
A few people even donned Colonial-era garb and displayed a sign that read, "What About Our Rights?"
Tim Thomas, 51, of Vernon, stoked the passions midway through the three-hour meeting when he told organizers that they had forgotten to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. So everyone stood up, pledged, then applauded vigorously.
"Our Constitution protects us from segregation and discrimination, so that no one person or group can hold sway over any other person in this nation," said Mr. Thomas. "And I say to you, that is exactly what is happening here with the issue of taxation with the Indians."
To the Oneidas, though, these complaints about unfair competition and basic rights betray a lack of perspective. For many years, the Oneidas were relegated to a 32-acre parcel dotted by abandoned trailers donated by the Federal Government. At one point, only a few Oneidas lived on the reservation; others had moved to Wisconsin and Canada.
But in recent years, the Oneida Indian Nation, flush with casino cash, has purchased 7,000 acres in the area, opened five gas stations and financed cultural and housing projects for a local Oneida population of 500 that continues to grow, Mr. Halbritter said. The Oneidas do not disclose how much Turning Stone earns, but industry analysts say that the casino, one of the country's most lucrative, generates annual revenues of hundreds of millions of dollars.
That money has helped the area economy as well as the Oneidas, Mr. Halbritter said. Since 1996, the Oneidas have contributed about $812,000 to school districts and municipalities. And Zogby International, a Utica-based research firm, recently concluded that the Oneidas' economic muscle had, among other benefits, helped convince Wall Street to upgrade Oneida County's municipal bond rating, saving taxpayers $3.2 million in borrowing costs.
But that has done little to assuage the populist anger, which Mr. Halbritter said emerged only after the Oneidas became wealthy.
"Should we take every ethnic group and allocate a certain amount of success so that the blacks don't get too rich, or the Italians, or the Irish, or the Asians?" said Mr. Halbritter, who grew up poor in central New York and worked his way through Harvard Law School. "It's the kind of racism that they don't even know is racism."
Inevitably, perhaps, the bad blood has begun to taint the smallest transactions in life.
Customers have abruptly left restaurants, their meals unfinished, when Oneida leaders have entered. Some people are boycotting Oneida businesses. Some are even averting eye contact with the Oneidas, Mr. Peterman said.
And Paula Eddy, a member of the Oneidas' Turtle clan, says she has overheard some people talk about violence against the Indians. So, fearful of identifying herself, she has shied away from using her tax-exempt card, which entitles her to tax-free purchases on Indian-owned lands. Her 12-year-old son, meanwhile, has stopped wearing his favorite T-shirt at school. It says "Oneida Indian Nation."
"He's afraid that someone will say something to him," said Mrs. Eddy, who works at the Turning Stone Casino as a games manager.
On Jan. 30, the Upstate Citizens for Equality plans to hold a motorcade that would roll past the Turning Stone Casino. So far, 2,000 residents have expressed an interest in participating, said Leon R. Koziol, a Utica-based lawyer who represents the group.
The landowners also plan to ask Judge McCurn for permission to join the lawsuit as a class and to challenge the Oneidas' gambling compact with New York State, Mr. Koziol said. And they say they plan to do whatever else is necessary to defend the landowners' rights. The land-claim dispute, Mr. Peterman said, is the last straw with the Oneidas.
"You have a lot of working stiffs that are subsidizing the rich, and the galling thing is that the Indians are rubbing it in our faces," said Mr. Peterman, a personable, earnest engineer who before the escalation of the lawsuit had never been active in civic affairs. "If they push this through, I think you're going to see people kill each other."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S TRIAL: WHITE HOUSE MEMO;
Armed With His New Initiatives, President Campaigns Yet Again

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Bill Clinton has now answered the question chewed over by his aides and friends after his last election: What would this born campaigner do without another campaign?
The answer is that he is running again for his second term, as hard as he can. 
 The President dispatched his lawyers and his old friend Dale Bumpers to the Senate this week to slug away at the charges against him, and sometimes at his own behavior. As they bemoaned his lapses, he was reintroducing -- or re-reintroducing -- a very different man: a bold, vigorous, optimistic leader with a mighty smart wife and solutions to problems most Americans may not even see coming. Sound familiar?
Adapted from Mr. Clinton's dog-eared political playbook, the combination of a free-swinging legal defense and daily policy announcements keyed to the State of the Union address has rocked Republicans back on their heels -- for the moment, anyway -- and emboldened Democratic senators to talk of seeking an up-or-down vote on the charges as early as next week.
But even if that move succeeded, it would not end this campaign, which unlike the one in 1996 has no Election Day to ring down the curtain.
"Now there are three hurdles, three endings: impeachment, his Presidency and the judgments people will make on it," said the former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos. "It's really three campaigns in one."
As Mr. Stephanopoulos noted, not one of those campaigns will be decided by the popular approval Mr. Clinton has so ably courted, although that can only help. "Even if the country supports the policies by 80 percent," Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "it doesn't mean they'll get through the Congress, it doesn't mean it'll stop impeachment, it doesn't mean the historians will say he was a successful President after all."
In summing up the President's case to the Senate today, former Senator Bumpers condemned his conduct and portrayed him as racked by his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and the agony it has caused his family.
"The relationship between husband and wife, father and child," Mr. Bumpers said, "has been incredibly strained, if not destroyed."
In an interview this evening, Mr. Clinton provided a milder appraisal. "I would say it has been a strain for my family," he said, "but we have worked very hard and I think we've come through the worst. We love each other very much, and we've worked on it very hard."
Indeed, what was said to the Senate is not what the Clintons show to the world. Today the President and the First Lady shared a podium at the Old Executive Office Building, where each nostalgically recalled their lengthy partnership in improving education.
Although Mr. Clinton may be campaigning harder because of the threat to his Presidency and the damage that his affair caused his reputation, his current and former aides insist that he is just doing what comes naturally in spinning off new initiatives and flogging them relentlessly. This is what he loves, and it is how he governs.
"This is a central part of his nature and his conception of the job," one senior aide said. He pointed with pride to a page-long list of Clinton proposals, marveling that "you've got to go to agate type and two columns to list all of your policy initiatives in the seventh year of your Presidency."
Republican Congressmen are scrambling to put forward their own agenda of tax cuts and other ideas, but they are unable to draw the kind of focused media attention that the President can take for granted.
Even if news reports are dominated by the Senate trial, Mr. Clinton's aides note, they inevitably refer to the President's public doings that day. Those doings, they say, will continue to be about matters like education, the economy and crime.
Assuming that Mr. Clinton will be able to complete his term, his aides are starting to look past the trial, in hopes of seizing the political initiative. They must decide questions like whether to push for education legislation right away or to join an immediate battle over Social Security.
Used to the rhythm of the Washington calendar by now, they are also looking ahead to annual events like the conferences of mayors and governors, to schedule attention-getting speeches.
Mr. Clinton's aides have repeatedly compared the scale of his agenda this year to the hefty one he presented at the beginning of his first term.
But in terms of execution, this campaign is shaping up more like the one in 1996. He appeared then in tightly choreographed events to promote his initiatives and argued that Republican tax-cutting would damage Social Security and Medicare,just as he is now insisting that most of the budget surplus be reserved for those two popular programs.
"He's forced them into a play where if they do their tax cut they have to cut both Social Security and Medicare," said Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton aide whom the President called back to Washington last weekend to help him prepare for his speech. "And I know how that movie ends. There's a shootout, and the good guys win."
Today the President began a day-by-day campaign to plug proposals individually, leading up to the presentation of his budget on Feb. 1.
Introduced by Arthur Moore, a soldier turned teacher from Baltimore, Mr. Clinton stood in the Old Executive Office Building before a navy blue sign emblazoned with flags, apples and A-pluses as he talked about the lessons in hard work and teamwork learned from his high school band leader.
"Research confirms what most of us know from our own experience," Mr. Clinton said. "What most determines whether students learn is not family background or even dollars spent per pupil, but the talent, the ability and the dedication of their teachers."
He spoke in a cramped amphitheater that until this week was known simply by its room number, 450-OEOB. It has been renamed Presidential Hall, lending a grander cast to the President's events there. Today, outside Presidential Hall, a sign noted that "the Intern Speaker Series" had been canceled for the day.

HEADLINE: Judge to Decide on an Affidavit in Gun Lawsuit

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
A Federal judge is expected to decide today whether criticism of the gun industry by a former gun company executive will be presented to a jury in a case that seeks to hold the industry liable for shootings with illegally obtained handguns.
The former executive, Robert I. Hass, who until 1989 was a senior vice president of marketing and sales for the Smith & Wesson Corporation, the nation's largest handgun manufacturer, has charged in an affidavit and a deposition that gun makers and wholesalers do not do all they can to keep their products from falling into the hands of criminals. 
 Mr. Hass charged that his former company, and the firearms industry as a whole, knew that the "black market in firearms is not simply the result of stolen guns but is due to the seepage of guns into the illicit market from multiple thousands of unsupervised" gun dealers.
The plaintiffs in the case -- a lawsuit in which relatives of six people killed by illegally possessed handguns and a seventh person wounded by one -- are seeking in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to hold more than 40 gun makers and wholesalers, including Smith & Wesson, liable for the shootings.
The plaintiffs contend that the companies have marketed and distributed handguns so negligently that dealers in states with weak gun control laws are oversupplied and that many of the excess guns end up with illicit traffickers who resell them to criminals in states with strong gun laws, like New York.
The companies deny that they oversupply the states with weak gun laws and say they cooperate in every way they reasonably can to curb illegal gun trafficking.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs had hoped to call Mr. Hass, who has been portrayed as a gun-industry whistle-blower, as a witness in the trial, but they say that a heart ailment prevents him from testifying and that they want his affidavit and deposition to be read to the jury. Lawyers for the company oppose this, saying any testimony by Mr. Hass should be in person to allow for cross-examination in front of the jury.
Anne G. Kimball, a lawyer for Smith & Wesson, also said yesterday that Mr. Hass's years at the company -- 1978 to 1989 -- were not "within the relevant time frame" of the case. She said in an interview that under earlier rulings in the suit, the activities by the companies to be considered are those from 1989 to 1994, the last year in which any of the shootings in the case occurred.
The plaintiffs' lawyers asserted that Mr. Hass's testimony remained relevant because the practices he described continued from 1989 to 1994. Judge Jack B. Weinstein is expected to decide today whether his affidavit and deposition may be presented to the jurors.
In his deposition, available since it was made last April, Mr. Hass said that one step gun manufacturers could take to keep their handguns from getting into the illicit underground trafficking market would be to use the information they got from law enforcement officials, regarding guns of theirs that might have been used in crime, to cut off retail dealers who have sold large numbers of such guns.

HEADLINE: Pope Is Returning to Mexico With New Target: Capitalism

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: ROME, Jan. 21

 BODY:
When Pope John Paul II held a working lunch recently to prepare for his visit to Mexico that begins on Friday, one Vatican official present said that the 78-year-old Pope spoke with deep nostalgia about his first papal trip there 20 years ago.
It is not surprising. This is John Paul's fourth visit to Mexico, but that first voyage in January 1979 was a rare moment in history: a youthful-looking, untested Pope was greeted by millions of Roman Catholics with an outpouring of hope and excitement that even the Vatican had not expected. 
 And that trip, where he spoke out sternly against the leftist liberation theology then polarizing the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America, unveiled the Polish-born Pope's unwavering stance against Communism of any kind.
As he returns to prepare the Americas for the third millennium, the Pope finds himself once again battling an ideology that he feels oppresses much of humanity, only this time it is capitalism.
"The human race is facing forms of slavery which are new and more subtle than those of the past," the Pope warned in an apostolic letter last month, while talking about an unbridled free-market system. "And for far too many people, freedom remains a word without meaning."
Much of the world has changed almost unrecognizably since that ground-breaking first trip. Communism has all but collapsed across the globe. Revolutionary liberation theology is almost, if not quite, extinct. The Mexican Constitution was then so fiercely anti-clerical that priests were banned from wearing collars in public. The Mexican Government changed its laws to allow religious freedom in 1991, and opened diplomatic relations with the Vatican the following year.
The Pope himself is also strikingly different: Then vigorous and bursting with health, John Paul II is now frail, stooped and shaky with the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
One thing has not changed: In what has proved the bane of the twilight years of his papacy, the problems of third world poverty that he so boldly emphasized in Mexico two decades ago, have not improved.
His trips to Mexico City and St. Louis have a dual purpose: He wants to re-energize Catholics and their bishops to pursue what he calls the new evangelization, his desire to deepen the church's relationship with its followers, and also broaden it by seeking new converts.
But he also wants to rattle the conscience of the free market.
"International institutions, national governments and the centers controlling the world economy must all undertake brave plans and projects to insure a more just sharing of the goods of the world," the Pope said in an address on Tuesday. It is a theme he is certain to repeat throughout his visit.
Having watched over the collapse of Communism, the Pope now wants a new political system for the 21st century, where the free market is reined in by humanitarian concerns. His frequent calls for third world debt relief and income redistribution are all part of his larger vision of a better world order.
The Pope has said the church cannot present a new economic model for the world, but offers the church's social teaching "as an indispensable and ideal orientation" for governments to follow. Some view his message as a kind of Christian liberation theology.
"After all the promises, suddenly nobody seems to care about the poor anymore," said Rev. Lorenzo Albacete, a theology professor St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers who accompanied the Pope to Cuba last year. "Neo-liberalism has made the poor invisible, and the church down there is the only one, badly or not, that is holding up their cause. In Latin America, it's not liberation theology, but it may be post-liberation theology."
Officially, the Pope is not visiting Mexico and the United States. He goes to Mexico to to deliver an "apostolic exhortation," a reply to the bishops of North and South America, who together held a synod in Rome in 1997, one of the largest meetings of bishops since the ecumenical council Vatican II. To address their concerns -- on matters including economic justice, third world debt, the shortage of priests and the growth of evangelical Protestant movements, as well as abortion and the death penalty -- the Pope plans to spend four days in Mexico City, then travel to St. Louis for a 36-hour visit.
The Vatican pointedly refers to the Pope's trip as a visit to America, lumping the two continents together. The wording is a reflection of the Vatican's long and Eurocentric view of history from the arrival of Christianity in the New World 500 years ago. Addressing the synod, the Pope asked the bishops to "consider the continent as a whole, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, without introducing a separation between the north, the center, or the south, so as not to risk a contrast between them."
It is also a sign that the Pope wants to ingrain in North American Catholics a stronger sense of solidarity with their brothers and sisters in the South. "He wants to get North American church out of its English-language bunker and start thinking of itself as one Catholic Church in the Western hemisphere," George Weigel, a Catholic theologian whose biography of John Paul II is due to be published in October. "And he wants Latin American Catholics to think of themselves not as victims but as agents of their own history."
And their future. The Pope has been planning how to usher in the third millennium ever since he was elected. Disappointed by what he sees as the secularism and alienation that runs through Europe, he looks to the more than 780 million Catholics of North and South America as the main source of expansion in the third millennium. The Pope's call for a new Catholic evangelization, however, has been muted by widespread indifference in rich countries and the spread of evangelical protestant churches in poor ones.
When the Pope addressed Mexican bishops during a 1990 visit, he told them that they were partly to blame that the church was losing ground to fundamentalist groups, saying they had left many Mexicans "deplorably vulnerable" to proselytizing by Protestant denominations.
This was a leitmotif of the synod, where many Latin American bishops complained about the "invasion" of Protestant sects, whose financing mostly comes from North America. And that challenge from Christian rivals is as vexing to the Vatican as the spread of liberation theology was 20 years ago.
It was at a bishops' conference in Puebla during his 1979 trip that the Pope warned against liberation theology. By the end of the 1980's, Marxist-leaning priests and bishops in Latin America had been removed, and the movement lost much of its support among the clergy. The inequities still rampant under the free market system has raised the consciousness of many in the church hierarchy, however. They may abhor the doctrine of liberation theology, but church leaders in Mexico and throughout Latin American and have adopted some of the language.
"When Marxism fell, we thought everything would be resolved, but instead, no," said Archbishop Javier Lozano Barragan of Mexico, a Vatican official who attended the Puebla meeting. "Now we have a neo-liberalism on which the poor get poorer and the hungry are marginalized. There has to be something besides the free market."
But the Pope is returning at a time when the role of the church as a champion of the poor and oppressed in Mexico is being challenged in Chiapas, a Southern state in Mexico where leftist guerrillas are battling Government forces. Catholic priests serving Indian populations have come under attack by the Government. Some, like Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, who until last year served as a mediator in peace talks between the Government and the rebels, are accused by Government officials of being supporters of the rebels. A group of conservative activists and landowners in Chiapas sent a public letter to the Pope on Tuesday asking him to remove Bishop Ruiz.
Some Vatican officials believe that Bishop Ruiz has gone too far. Mexicans will be anxiously awaiting to hear whether the Pope will address the problem of Chiapas while visiting the country.
While the Pope is in St. Louis, many Americans will be riveted by the Pope's meeting with President Clinton. The Vatican, which has studiously avoided any comment on the impeachment trial clouding Mr. Clinton's Presidency, views the visit as a courtesy call from one head of state to another. "They never asked, never commented," said Lindy Boggs, the American Ambassador to the Holy See.
But the American news media is likely to give greater weight to the iconography of a handshake between one of the world's most respected moral leaders and a President who is on trial on charges that he lied under oath about an extramarital affair.

HEADLINE: WORLD BRIEFING

BYLINE: Compiled By Christopher S. Wren

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
ITALY: POLITICAL SHAKE-UP AVERTED -- A new political shake-up was averted after a key member of the ruling center-left coalition failed to withdraw his party's support. Francesco Cossiga had urged his centrist colleagues in government to resign, but Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, left, dissuaded them. "The Government is working well and cannot be exposed to these continuous tensions," he said. Alessandra Stanley (NYT) 

BRITAIN: PINOCHET CASE CONTINUES -- The Law Lords, Britain's highest court, were told that England's State Immunity Act did not protect Gen. Augusto Pinochet from arrest because the crimes against humanity with which he is charged cannot be considered the functional acts of a head of state. The argument was made by Ian Brownlie on behalf of Amnesty International on the fourth day of a rehearing of the former Chilean dictator's plea to be freed from house arrest and permitted to return home. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
FRANCE: A WARNING TO GERMANY -- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said France would demand damages from Germany if Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's new Government went ahead with plans to cancel contracts with a state-run French company, Cogema, for reprocessing waste from German nuclear reactors. Cogema has estimated the possible losses at $5.3 billion over 10 years if Germany goes ahead with plans to close all its nuclear power plants. Craig R. Whitney (NYT)
 
FRANCE: AWARD TO SATIRICAL WEEKLY -- The European Court of Human Rights told France to pay the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine more than $12,000 in damages and legal costs for violating its right to free speech. French courts fined the Parisian weekly $1,200 in 1993 for publishing the tax forms of Peugeot's president, Jacques Calvet, during a strike for higher wages, revealing that his salary had increased by 50 percent over a two-year period. (NYT)
 
GERMANY: U.S. EMBASSY SNAG -- A dispute over rerouting two streets running past the planned United States Embassy in Berlin could further delay its construction. The United States requires a minimum distance of 100 yards between the embassy and the street to protect it from car bombs. The Berlin traffic authority said accommodating such demands would mean cutting into the city's Tiergarten park as well as land set aside for a planned Holocaust Memorial. (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: NEW DRIVE ON CORRUPTION -- Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov began a new crusade against corruption, saying it threatened Russia's economic foundations. Mr. Primakov said the Government would create a body to combat illegal seizure of state property set off by an accelerated bankruptcy process. Another group will be charged with plugging holes in existing legislation exploited by criminals. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
INDIA, PAKISTAN: CRICKET THREAT LIFTED -- As the Pakistani cricket team arrived in New Delhi for a series of matches with India, Bal Thackeray, head of the Hindu militant Shiv Sena party, withdrew his threat to disrupt the series. Earlier this month members of his party dug up a cricket field in New Delhi. They had said India should not play Pakistan, which they accuse of sponsoring terrorism against India. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
JAPAN, MYANMAR: A DEMOCRACY PLEA -- Japan, one of the few world powers that still gives substantial aid to Myanmar, the former Burma, urged its military rulers to start talks with pro-democracy groups led by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said State Foreign Secretary Nobutaka Machimura made the reguest during a "frank" exchange of views in Tokyo with Brig. Gen. Kyaw Win, the top aide to Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt of Myanmar's ruling State Peace and Development Council. (Reuters)
 
TURKEY, AZERBAIJAN: CASPIAN OIL TALKS -- Negotiations to carry Caspian Sea oil to the West are progressing, and "a clear road map" may be set out in the next year, Richard Morningstar, the Clinton Administration's special adviser, said in Washington. He said the estimated cost had declined by about $1 billion, to a range of $2.3 billion to $3 billion. The negotiations involve Azerbaijan, Turkey and oil companies. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
BARBADOS: BIG WIN FOR PREMIER -- Prime Minister Owen Arthur, left, was returned to office in one of the biggest electoral landslides in the history of the Caribbean nation. His Barbados Labor Party captured 26 of 28 seats in the country's Parliament in voting Wednesday. Under Mr. Arthur, Barbados's economy, weighted toward tourism and developing a strong offshore financial sector, has grown every year since 1994. (Reuters)
 
HAITI: POLITICAL DISPUTE WORSENS -- President Rene Preval's dispute with members of the Haitian Parliament has worsened since he threatened last week to appoint a new prime minister by decree. BBC News reported that Mr. Preval has ordered the legislators' diplomatic passports annulled and returned to the Government. The President and Parliament have failed for the last 19 months to agree on a new prime minister. 
 
AFRICA
 
ERITREA, ETHIOPIA: A TRAVEL ADVISORY -- The United States warned Americans against traveling to Eritrea and Ethiopia, which are involved in a border dispute. Washington also indicated concern about the possibility of terrorist strikes against American and British diplomatic missions in Ethiopia but did not elaborate. Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, but their border was never officially delineated. (AP)
 
GABON: NEW TERM FOR BONGO -- President Omar Bongo, who has ruled Gabon for 30 years, was sworn in for a further seven-year term at a ceremony attended by seven other leaders from central Africa.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
2 Companies Announce Purchases

BYLINE: By Greg Farrell 

 BODY:
Two large media and agency companies are making acquisitions.
United Information Group in London, a media research company with American units including Mediamark Research Inc. and Bruskin/ Goldring Research, agreed to acquire Audits and Surveys Worldwide Inc. in New York for $42.5 million. 
 Audits and Surveys will continue as an autonomous company under that name; the deal will double the American market research revenue of United Information, a unit of United News and Media P.L.C.
Lou Bender, 53, president and chief operating officer at Mediamark in New York, will also become president and chief executive of Audits and Surveys. As chief executive, he succeeds Solomon Dutka, 75, who will continue as chairman; Arthur H. Bellows, 60, who had been president of Audits and Surveys, will serve as a consultant.
And the Jack Morton Company in New York, part of the Allied Communications Group unit of the the Interpublic Group of Companies, agreed to acquire Denby Associates, a company in Princeton, N.J., that specializes in designing, producing and managing exhibits and events for trade shows. Though terms were not disclosed, Morton said the deal would increase its exhibits revenue to an estimated $16 million in 1999 from $5.3 million in 1998.
Denby will be renamed Denby, a Jack Morton Company, and will operate as the exhibits and environments service group of Morton. Bob Denby, president of Denby, will continue in that role, reporting to Laura Shuler, senior vice president for business development at Morton.

President Clinton's State of the Union Message and the Republican response (front page, Jan. 20) call for a weighing of the two sides against one another. 
 President Clinton: terrific economy, a Federal surplus, lowest peacetime unemployment in 40 years, a five-point program for education on the state level, saving Social Security, raising the minimum wage, equal pay for women, a patient bill of rights, fighting the tobacco lobby, and legislating gun locks to keep guns out of children's hands.
The Republicans' plan: cut taxes, and impeach the best President in my lifetime.

HEADLINE: CLINTON DESCRIBES TERRORISM THREAT FOR 21ST CENTURY

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER and WILLIAM J. BROAD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that it is "highly likely" that a terrorist group will launch or threaten a germ or chemical attack on American soil within the next few years.
In an interview in the Oval Office late in the day, Mr. Clinton said he had been persuaded by intelligence reports that the United States needs to bolster its defenses. 
 "I want to raise public awareness of this," the President said in the 45-minute interview, "without throwing people into an unnecessary panic." Excerpts, page A12.
He said he wanted Americans "not to be afraid or asleep. I think that's the trick."
Without providing specifics, Mr. Clinton warned that any attack with germ or chemical weapons would prompt "at least a proportionate if not a disproportionate response." The United States has signed treaties not to use chemical or germ weapons.
He made the assertions as the White House disclosed that the Administration planned to ask Congress for $2.8 billion in the next budget year to fight terrorists armed with such unconventional weapons as deadly germs, chemicals and electronic devices. Mr. Clinton insisted during the interview that his drive to expand the budget for these programs was rooted in the growing danger of such threats.
Elaborating on some of the initiatives he intends to unveil on Friday, Mr. Clinton said he is weighing a proposal from the Defense Department to establish a commander in chief for the defense of the continental United States, a step that civil liberties groups strongly resist.
Such a step would go far beyond the civil defense measures and bomb shelters that marked the cold war, setting up instead a military leadership to help fight chaos and disarray if an attack occurred. The Pentagon has commanders overseeing regions around the globe, but none for the continental United States.
Critics fear such moves could open the door to rising military influence and a loss of individual rights, but Mr. Clinton insisted that such erosions would never occur, even while acknowledging the danger.
"We've got to preserve civil liberties, resolve all doubt in favor of that, and if there's a question, bring it to me," Mr. Clinton said, while acknowledging there were specific concerns in areas like computer security. He did not offer details on how he would insure protection.
The President gave the interview as his lawyers ended their defense presentation at his impeachment trial in the Senate. Since the Monica S. Lewinsky issue surfaced a year ago today, the President has given almost no interviews to major American news organizations.
At the very end of the interview, he answered one question related to impeachment by agreeing that the impeachment ordeal had placed a great strain on his family and by expressing the hope that the worst was over.
Despite the political pressures, Mr. Clinton appeared relaxed and deeply engaged in the complex scientific and policy issues raised by what the White House has called 21st-century threats. He smiled repeatedly, yet spoke of sleepless nights pondering new security challenges.
In the interview, Mr. Clinton said he hoped that a major legacy of his Presidency would be to stave off unconventional attacks. He said he would be delighted if, decades later, Americans looked back on any such threat as "the dog that didn't bark."
Among other new considerations, Mr. Clinton said he was weighing a proposal to give anthrax vaccinations to police, fire, public health and other emergency officials in cities throughout the country. That would be in addition to the current drive to vaccinate more than two million soldiers.
He declined to say whether he himself had been vaccinated against deadly germ agents, saying that the Secret Service had advised him to remain silent.
He also vowed to forge ahead despite Congressional criticism with cooperative programs with Russia aimed at providing jobs to 8,000 former weapons scientists who might otherwise be tempted to work with rogue states or terrorist groups.
Among the programs he will highlight on Friday are developing new vaccines, stockpiling antibiotics, setting up emergency medical teams in major cities and a corps of computer experts who could respond quickly to electronic attacks.
With his Presidency under fire, it is unclear how much of the proposed $2.8 billion in military funds and programs Mr. Clinton will be able to get through the Republican-dominated Congress. But lawmakers have usually supported White House efforts to fight terrorism.
Mr. Clinton said that of all the new threats, the one that "keeps me awake at night" is the possibility of germ attack. "A chemical attack would be horrible, but it would be finite," he said, adding that it would not spread. But a biological attack could spread, he added, "kind of like the gift that keeps on giving."
Mr. Clinton said he had begun worrying about biological terrorism and other unconventional threats six years ago, in February 1993, after Islamic radicals exploded a bomb under the World Trade Center in New York. The bombing one month after he came into office killed six people and injured more than a thousand.
He said his concerns about the danger of germ or chemical attack were deepened by the Oklahoma City bombing, terrorist attacks in the Middle East and Africa on American embassies and facilities, and reports that Iraq had retained chemical weapons it claimed to have destroyed. Mr. Clinton said he was also troubled by the activities of a Japanese cult, Aum Shinrikyo, which attacked the Tokyo subway system in 1995 with a nerve agent, killing 12 and injuring 5,000.
He said today that terrorists were probably a greater danger than rogue states, which would be afraid to openly attack American targets for fear of retaliation.
He noted that Osama bin Laden, a Saudi fugitive who is accused of masterminding the United States Embassy bombings in Africa in August, has "made an effort to get chemical weapons" and "may have" tried to get germ weapons. "We don't know that they have them," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton asserted that "a lot of what we've done already," some of it secret, "has delayed" foreign efforts to develop and deploy chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
He said that ultimately, America's best defense against unconventional warfare and bioterrorism in particular would be scientific strides in deciphering the genetic material in microbes and humans, so that vaccines could be tailored for quick response to an attack.
This, he said, would allow defense to stay ahead of the offense. His hope, he said, was that America would use "each new wave of technology to close the gap between offense and defense."
He specifically endorsed the Human Genome Project, a costly federally financed effort to map out human genetic material, saying it would be an important part of the defensive shield his Administration is building.
Mr. Clinton's personal interest in the threat, aides agree, has become a powerful force behind a series of secret Federal meetings, actions and directives meant to bolster the nation's anti-terrorism work and to counter what they describe as a growing danger to civilians.
The new budget outlined by the White House today and to be formally unveiled Friday by Mr. Clinton includes a total of $10 billion to defend against terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, and cyber attacks, according to a White House statement.
Most of the money -- about $8.5 billion -- is earmarked for efforts to defend American embassies and other United States buildings and personnel against conventional weapons such as car and truck bombs. The rest, or about $2.8 billion, is divided among existing and a few new programs to counter biological, chemical, and computer attacks, especially those that would cripple key parts of the Government or the economy.
Mr. Clinton insisted in the interview today that such money would be "well spent," despite detractors and skeptics of the new exotic threats.
"And if there is never an incident, nobody would be happier than me 20 years from now if the same critics would be able to say, 'Oh, see, Clinton was a kook, nothing happened.' I would be the happiest man on earth."

Unemployment Picture

 BODY:
New York State's unemployment rate declined six-tenths of a percentage point over the last year, the state announced yesterday, on the strength of 142,900 new private sector jobs, a 2.1 percent increase.
The state's unemployment rate for December of 5.5 percent remained unchanged from November, according to the State Department of Labor. The rate puts New York well behind the nation as a whole, which posted a 4.3 percent unemployment rate last month. 
 New York's improvement during the year was reflected throughout the state. New York City's unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent last month, from 8.5 percent in December 1997. The unemployment rate in the rest of the state fell to 3.9 percent last month, from 4.6 percent in December 1997. The state's overall unemployment rate in December 1997 was 6.1 percent.
Thomas A. Rodick, director of research and statistics for the New York State Department of Labor, said the New York economy had experienced "the strongest December-to-December private sector job growth in 11 years."
Rockland and Putnam Counties were among the top performers in the state, with the number of non-farm jobs in each growing by nearly 6 percent.
New York City gained 97,600 non-farm jobs, up 2.8 percent for the year.

HEADLINE: Income-Based Medicare Proposal Is Offered

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Higher-income Medicare beneficiaries would have to pay higher premiums under proposals outlined today by Senator John B. Breaux, the chairman of a bipartisan commission seeking ways to avert a financial crisis in the health insurance program for the elderly.
In his State of the Union Message on Tuesday, President Clinton proposed using some of the Federal budget surplus for Medicare. Mr. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, said that would help shore up Medicare but would not solve its long-term financial problems and did not reduce the need for radical changes in the program. 
 The 17-member commission plans to meet on Tuesday and is to submit final recommendations to the President and Congress by March 1. Mr. Breaux's proposals are the text from which the panel will work, and he said he thought he could win the necessary 11 votes on the panel.
Mr. Breaux said his proposal would transform Medicare into an arena for competition between the fee-for-service Federal program and dozens of private health plans. Instead of paying separately for each medical service, the Government would offer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to buy insurance, and the original Medicare program would be one option among many.
Senator Breaux said private health plans would have to offer benefits at least equivalent to those offered in the Government-run program. A new Federal agency, the Medicare Board, would be established to supervise and negotiate with the private health plans.
Federal payments to health plans would be set through a process of competitive bidding, Mr. Breaux said. Health plans would submit bids to the Medicare Board, and the Government would pay a fixed percentage of the average premium charged by all health plans participating in Medicare. There would be a limit on the Government's contribution, and beneficiaries would pay any costs above that limit.
In addition, Mr. Breaux said, "higher-income Medicare beneficiaries should be required to pay a larger share of their Medicare premiums than moderate- and low-income beneficiaries." The extra revenue would subsidize the premiums of low-income beneficiaries.
The eligibility age for Medicare would be increased to 67 from 65, over 24 years, from 2003 to 2027.
John C. Rother, director of legislation and public policy at the American Association of Retired Persons, deferred judgment on Mr. Breaux's proposal. "It could be positive for beneficiaries, or it could be negative, depending on how it's structured," he said. "We don't have enough details, enough numbers, to know."
To judge the impact on consumers, Mr. Rother said, it is necessary to know how much of the average premium they will pay, and how much will be paid by the Government.
Senator Breaux bristled at suggestions that he was proposing to give each Medicare beneficiary a "voucher" to buy health insurance.
"A voucher just says to somebody, 'Here's X amount of money, go find yourself a health plan,' " Mr. Breaux said. "My proposal uses the strength of the Federal Government to negotiate on behalf of people so they can get the best deal. We're not leaving people at the mercy of the marketplace. There would be quality standards and a minimum package of benefits."
Mr. Breaux said Medicare's financial problems were more urgent than those of Social Security. "This is much more important than Social Security, as far as the timing is concerned, because the due date is much earlier," Mr. Breaux said. "We have a much more immediate problem with Medicare."

HEADLINE: Ex-Latin King Says U.S. Reneged;
Killer Turned Informer, Seeking Leniency, Fears for His Life

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
One day a few years ago, Federal prosecutors investigating the Latin Kings, one of the most brutal and highly organized gangs in New York, got the break they were looking for. A high-ranking member of the gang offered to act as an informer.
The volunteer, Jose Melendez, then in Federal custody, said he was seeking a cooperation agreement with the Government in hopes of receiving a lesser sentence for his crimes. 
 Mr. Melendez gave detailed information to prosecutors about the gang's previous and current activities, but now, in secret court hearings in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Melendez has accused the authorities of reneging on a promise to give him a deal, thus placing his life in jeopardy.
"I believe no cooperating witness in the whole Latin Kings case gave them more information in our case than I did," he said in an interview in the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
Mr. Melendez met with Federal prosecutors in Manhattan more than 20 times, records show, giving details of killings and other crimes. He even called with a tip that allowed prosecutors to break up a jail house plot to kill Luis Felipe, the imprisoned leader of the Latin Kings.
Prosecutors made good use of the information, the records show, but eventually rejected Mr. Melendez's bid to become a Government witness, which would have given him a signed agreement from prosecutors and a letter to the judge describing his assistance, the first step toward substantial leniency in sentencing.
Prosecutors contended that even though Mr. Melendez pleaded guilty in a secret proceeding to racketeering and admitted conspiring in at least eight murders, he lied repeatedly about his involvement in various crimes. As a result, prosecutors said, they refused to give him a deal.
Mr. Melendez's case sheds light on a recurring problem for prosecutors: how to treat witnesses who are participants in heinous crimes.
The Government often makes deals with criminals to further some larger objective, such as bringing down a criminal enterprise or convicting its leaders. But there is a debate over where to draw the line.
"We like to think of justice as absolute and indivisible," said Michael J. Sandel, a professor of government at Harvard University. "But in fact it is subject to a kind of moral economy, which involves trade-offs, concessions and prosecutorial discretion."
"It makes us uneasy," he added, "for the Government to be in the business of bargaining with criminals, but it is unavoidable if prosecutors are to seek the greater measure of justice on behalf of the society as a whole."
In one prominent case, prosecutors argued for leniency for Salvatore Gravano, known as Sammy the Bull, whose testimony helped convict John Gotti and nearly 40 others. Mr. Gravano received only five years in prison despite his admitted involvement in 19 killings.
But most such deals occur out of public view, as in the case of Mr. Melendez, whose dispute with the Government has been fought out behind closed doors at the order of Judge Lawrence M. McKenna, apparently to protect Mr. Melendez's role as an informer.
But details were gleaned from several recent court documents that were filed publicly, as well as documents Mr. Melendez provided to The New York Times. Those included a 50-page letter detailing his cooperation that he sent to Judge McKenna, due to sentence him next month.
Saying he was duped by prosecutors and now fears for his life, Mr. Melendez has asked the judge to rule that the Government unlawfully denied him a deal, and to sentence him as if he had received one. That would mean he could be given time served and be released immediately.
"The Latin Kings want me dead for my cooperation," he told Judge McKenna, a transcript shows.
The Government wants him to serve 20 years, the maximum for the racketeering charge, saying he would have served far longer had he been convicted in the murders. Mr. Melendez described the trade-off as inadequate considering the "substantial assistance" he gave prosecutors.
Even within the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan, where the rule is "you either cooperate or you don't, there's no middle of the road," as one prosecutor said in court, the decision to allow Mr. Melendez to plead to a charge carrying 20 years spurred debate. The prosecutor, Steven M. Cohen, acknowledged to the judge, "It was not a popular decision in our office."
The dispute over whether Mr. Melendez deserves a deal centers on whether he was completely truthful in what he said to prosecutors.
Mr. Melendez denied that he ever lied to prosecutors or minimized his own role in crimes. In his defense, he has cited the Government's own accounts crediting him with substantial assistance.
Lloyd Epstein, a lawyer for Mr. Melendez who entered the case after he had pleaded guilty and met with prosecutors, would speak only generally about his client's case. "There has to be some compensation given to somebody who has taken a risk by cooperating," Mr. Epstein said. "I don't think the public at large would want criminals not to cooperate."
Prosecutors told Judge McKenna that Mr. Melendez did provide them with "a voluminous amount of information," but they also said he violated the Government's policy requiring a potential witness to be truthful from the start.
A spokesman for the United States Attorney's office declined to comment on the case.
The 1994 racketeering indictment against the Latin Kings charged Mr. Melendez and 19 others with a pattern of murders, robberies and drug dealing. Officials described Mr. Melendez as third in command of the gang, which included beheadings and burnings in its methods used against rivals and wayward members.
The indictment outlined the gang's rigid hierarchy and cultlike rules, and said violations could result in a "B.O.S.," beating on sight, or a "T.O.S.," termination on sight.
Mr. Melendez, known as King Epic, was one of the gang's most violent men, the indictment charged, giving and carrying out termination orders. In one killing, prosecutors said, he dragged a rival gang member from a car and shot him in the head.
Today, Mr. Melendez, 29, says he accepts responsibility for his crimes, and contends that helping the Government was a means to reform his ways.
"I know I did some bad things," he said in the interview, "and nothing can ever change that for the victims' families, and the suffering they have gone through.
"I feel a lot of remorse, regret," he added. "But at the same time, I feel that I have, through these years, gone through a very great transformation in life."
Federal prosecutors said Mr. Melendez got in touch with them in 1994, saying "that he was willing to truthfully disclose his own criminal activities and his knowledge of the activities of the Latin Kings."
It was understood that the process could lead to a formal deal, but he would have to be truthful.
Prosecutors say Mr. Melendez ultimately "provided a relatively accurate version of events," except for denying or minimizing his role in killings and other crimes.
Only later, prosecutors told Judge McKenna, after they gathered more evidence and confronted Mr. Melendez with accounts of his role in the crimes, did he admit that the Government's version was accurate. But he "would typically deny that he ever had misled or lied," the prosecutors said.
Mr. Cohen said prosecutors concluded that Mr. Melendez would not be a reliable witness. "We really didn't want to deal with Mr. Melendez any more," Mr. Cohen told the judge.
Still, Mr. Melendez persisted in offering information.
One day in March 1995, Mr. Cohen told Judge McKenna, Mr. Melendez called another Federal prosecutor, Richard Zabel, and said "he had crucial information" about a plot to kill the gang's leader, Mr. Felipe. Mr. Melendez said a homemade knife would be left in the recreation area on the jail's roof, where it would be used to kill Mr. Felipe the next day, Mr. Cohen said.
He said the authorities moved quickly and found a knife and some documents indicating that a plot was under way. There was "no question Mr. Melendez was the cause of Mr. Felipe's life being saved," Mr. Cohen said in court.
But prosecutors told the judge that they also received information suggesting that Mr. Melendez had been involved in the plot from the start. Mr. Cohen said prosecutors wondered whether the entire scheme was an "elaborate manipulation" by Mr. Melendez so that he could call the Government with a dramatic piece of news and win credit toward a deal.
Mr. Melendez denied any role in the murder plot. Mr. Cohen acknowledged in court papers that prosecutors did not have enough evidence to charge him.
Mr. Cohen told Judge McKenna that he and Mr. Zabel "struggled with the fact that we had received a lot of information from Melendez."
"It was decided that fairness dictated that Melendez receive some kind of benefit for the assistance he rendered," Mr. Cohen said in a court document.
The prosecutors allowed Mr. Melendez to plead guilty to one racketeering charge, which carried a maximum term of 20 years. The plea bargain made no mention of a cooperation agreement, although Mr. Melendez said he was led to believe that one was forthcoming.
Prosecutors told Judge McKenna that 20 years was a reasonable reward for Mr. Melendez, considering the number of killings he was involved in and that he had no formal deal. Had he been convicted, he would have faced life in prison.
But in his letter to Judge McKenna, Mr. Melendez asked for a hearing to "seek out the true facts of this case."
In court, he said: "I dealt in good faith with the Government. I never lied to them."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Journalists all over the country are scrambling for ideas to fill out their coverage of Pope John Paul II's visit to St. Louis next week. Pity them. It is really not so easy to come up with a fresh approach after the news media blitz that surrounded the Pope's trip to the United States less than four years ago and the many overviews of his papacy, which marked its 20th anniversary last fall.
Well, here's a suggestion. On Dec. 17, Dr. Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the Pope's spokesman, who will be accompanying him on his American visit, made a brief statement about the bomb and missile strikes against Iraqi targets that had begun a day earlier. The statement included this sentence: "The Holy See hopes that this aggression ends as soon as possible and that international order is re-established." 
 "This aggression"? A very strong term, to put it mildly. Given the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on just and unjust war, it appears to mean that American and British forces were acting immorally in hitting Iraqi targets while Iraq's military was simply exercising justifiable self-defense.
The condemnation was echoed, although in words less stark than Dr. Navarro-Valls's, by a flurry of other statements: from Vatican Radio; from Patriarch Raphael I. Bidawi, who heads the Chaldean-rite Catholic community in Iraq and was then visiting Rome; from Achille Cardinal Silvestrini, head of the Vatican office for Eastern churches; from Angelo Cardinal Sodano, the Vatican Secretary of State, and from the Pope himself.
Much of this flew beneath the radar -- pardon the metaphor -- of the American news media, the Catholic press included. The Catholic News Service did begin an article on the attacks with a sentence saying that "the Vatican called the move an act of aggression," and a few Catholic papers picked up that blunt language in their headlines. But even that did not seem to stir up much reaction, pro or con, among the American Catholic population.
Church leaders' concern was manifest, however, in a letter that Archbishop Edwin F. O'Brien, who is responsible for the pastoral care of Catholics in the United States armed forces, sent to Catholic military chaplains.
Archbishop O'Brien was visiting troops in the Middle East when the action against Iraq occurred, and his letter almost certainly reflects a desire not to appear to be blessing the bombs and missiles that the Pope was at that very moment decrying. The result is a carefully composed statement.
First, Archbishop O'Brien praises "the courage and professionalism" of American troops risking themselves "in the role of peacekeeper" in Bosnia, the Middle East and elsewhere.
Second, he affirms that "once civilian leadership decides a policy requiring military action, it is the sworn obligation of all in our armed forces to execute their mission in complete obedience unless in a specific instance the required action is judged clearly illegal or immoral."
Third, he reviews all the misgivings about military action against Iraq voiced by the Vatican, and last fall by the American Catholic bishops, and whether that action meets "just-war requirements" that civilians not be made targets, that expected good results outweigh the expected harm and that there be likely prospects of success.
And finally he leaves military personnel with a two-sided admonition. "In executing orders that might violate just-war requirements," he reminds them, they "are not exempt from making conscientious decisions." But when they lack sufficient evidence to reach a clear conclusion of their own, they may follow "the presumably better-informed decision" of their military superiors.
This letter resurrects a perennial debate, of course, about the relevance of just-war teachings not so much to policy makers as to those in the military. Moralists of differing views may ponder why a Catholic bomber pilot should prefer the "presumably better-informed decision" of a military superior in a moral judgment call to that of the Pope -- and also ponder the prospect of chaos within the chain of command if the pilot did not.
This entire episode can spark other reflections quite pertinent to the approaching papal visit.
It shows how far the Catholic reality is from the model of Pope commands and Catholics follow (unless they are "dissenters") that still dominates the imagination of a surprising number of people. Rome seldom speaks with an utterly single voice. The subtle but significant differences between Dr. Navarro-Valls's characterization of American-British "aggression" and, say, the Pope's vaguer lament for "peaceful solutions" and Iraqi civilians are typical indicators of the range of opinion that almost always creates a space for Catholics to continue the discussion.
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark, chairman of the American Catholic hierarchy's International Policy Committee, recognized this reality in a Dec. 17 statement that Archbishop O'Brien quoted. "In my view," Archbishop McCarrick said, "these military strikes unduly risk violating just-war criteria." But he also granted that "these questions are not easy, and people of good will may come to different conclusions."
The Iraq episode also illustrated the Pope's profound ambivalence about the use of military force. John Paul II swings between just-war teaching and something approaching pacifism, between declaring that "the aggressor must be disarmed" in regard to Bosnia and that war "will never be an appropriate way to solve problems" in regard to the Middle East.
Finally, the episode adds to the impression that the extent of contemporary Catholics' adherence to papal positions will never be separated from the strength of the arguments backing them. The Vatican is understood when it denounces economic sanctions on Iraq for the toll they take on innocent civilians. It is understood when it abhors military destruction. But it does not offer any comprehensive moral analysis of what should be done about a regime like Saddam Hussein's and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Is this not really a problem? Or, if it is, should it be left in God's hands?
Perhaps it is because the Vatican's positions appear ad hoc and incomplete that Catholics here so easily deflect even the language of American "aggression."

HEADLINE: Caldor, in Bankruptcy, to Shut Its Stores

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn., Jan. 22

 BODY:
The Caldor Corporation, the discount retail chain that filed for bankruptcy more than three years ago and has since struggled to stay afloat, announced today that it would liquidate its holdings and close all of its 145 stores in nine East Coast states.
The decision, company officials said in a statement, stems from its inability to negotiate a reorganization plan with a group of creditors. 
 Caldor's chairman, Warren D. Feldberg, said that the company had explored a number of options, including court-ordered mediation with its creditors, since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 1995.
"The company was left with no alternative but an orderly wind-down and liquidation," Mr. Feldberg said.
The statement added that Caldor would begin going-out-of-business sales in the next several weeks and that the closing of the stores should be complete by mid-May. Besides selling its inventory, company officials said they intended to sell off Caldor's real estate holdings. The size of those holdings was not immediately known; the company leases all but three of its stores.
Mr. Feldberg also said that many of the company's 20,000 employees would be retained during the liquidation process, but it did not say how many, or what sort of severance program would be offered.
"The company is working on a package for severance and extended medical care but it is too early to discuss any specifics," said Wendi Kopsick, a Caldor spokeswoman.
Ms. Kopsick said that the staff at the corporate headquarters here was being reduced immediately to a core group, although she would not say how many employees worked there or how many would continue to do so for the next few months.
"There were layoffs," she said.
The terminal condition of the company, which was founded in Port Chester, N.Y., in 1951 and has $2.5 billion in sales, clearly unnerved employees today. At the corporate headquarters, workers carrying cardboard boxes filed out of the building after learning of the liquidation at noon.
Not far away, at a Caldor store in Norwalk, employees looked shellshocked. Some of them learned of the liquidation today through an article in The Hour, a local afternoon newspaper. The paper's top headline, stretched across page 1, read, "Caldor Near Death."
"Most of the employees here are worried, but not scared, because soon they will not have jobs," said Luis Mejia, the store manager.
He said he was not too worried about being unemployed because the local economy was strong and there was continued demand for retail managers. "I'll get a job," he said.
Joseph C. Carbone, 62, of Southampton, N.Y., was almost as sanguine. He and other employees were notified of the closing at a meeting in the Bridgehampton, N.Y., store today.
"It's a little sad, but we're hoping someone else takes it over," said Mr. Carbone, who has worked for nine years in the auto and hardware sections. He added, "There's a certain amount of sadness but no tears."
Many shoppers were distressed at the news. "I'm going to miss it," said Ursula E. Thomas, a flight attendant from East Hampton, N.Y. "It's a pretty good store, very reasonable prices, fairly good quality, and you can get very good buys at the sales."
"Working people shop here," she said. "Where will they go now?"
Richard La Bella, 65, a beauty parlor owner from Greenwich, Conn., said he shops at the Caldor in Norwalk. "It's a shame," he said of the closing. "It's been here how long? I like it. I've been coming here a long time. It will be a great loss."
Watching his 2-year-old grandson, Cole, riding a coin-operated merry-go-round, Mr. La Bella said, "He's going to miss the rides."
Though some employees and shoppers expressed shock over the closures, it was not a complete surprise. The company, which was delisted last year by the New York Stock Exchange, announced two weeks ago that it was no longer placing orders or accepting deliveries from suppliers.
There have also been recent reports that Caldor was trying to sell 64 of its stores to other retailers, including Kohl's, a chain of department stores mainly located in the Middle West; Dayton Hudson Corporation, which owns the Target discount chain, or Kmart. Indeed, some Caldor employees said they expect another company to take over the stores.
Calls to Kohl's and Dayton Hudson late yesterday were not returned; no one answered the telephone at Kmart headquarters in Troy, Mich.
"There has been a lot of interest in the sites, but it is too early to discuss specifics of the sale of any store locations," Ms. Kopsick said.

RUSSIA: REJECTS EASING MISSILE TREATY Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov ruled out any amendments to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the United States. In a letter this week, President Clinton asked President Boris N. Yeltsin to discuss changes to the treaty because Washington is considering a new defense umbrella against threats from rogue states like North Korea.

RUSSIA: KEEPING MIR ALOFT, IF OTHERS PAY Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov ordered the aging Mir space station to remain in orbit for three more years if private investors pay all its expenses, estimated at $250 million a year. Russia had agreed earlier to abandon the Mir, which is nearly 13 years old, in June and concentrate its meager resources on an international space station. (AP)
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: CHANCELLOR MITCHELL George Mitchell, left, the former United States Senator and broker of Northern Ireland's peace accord, will become Chancellor of Queen's University in Belfast in May, a spokeswoman for the university said. Mr. Mitchell, who is advising President Clinton on his impeachment trial, will probably not move to Belfast, but will preside over ceremonies like graduations. (Reuters)
 
 
BRITAIN: LIMIT ON VIAGRA PRESCRIPTIONS The Government has ruled that the National Health Service will limit treatment with the impotence drug Viagra to patients whose conditions stem from surgery or serious injury. It is the first instance in its 50-year history that the service has excluded care for cost reasons. Frank Dobson, the Health Secretary, said unlimited prescriptions would increase tenfold the $20 million now spent on impotence treatments.

ARGENTINA: A PESO-DOLLAR SWITCH Stock and bond prices rallied after the Government suggested replacing its currency with the United States dollar, calming fears of a run on the peso. The Central Bank's president, Pedro Pou, said on Thursday that the bank was considering opening talks on such a treaty with Washington. The switch would help shield Argentina from currency crises like the one caused by Brazil's devaluation. (Bloomberg News)
 
CANADA: CHARGES AGAINST CLERIC DROPPED Stalking and harassment charges against a Vatican envoy to Canada have been dropped because of insufficient evidence. The police had charged the cleric, Msgr. Vito Rallo, the second-highest official at the Vatican's Embassy in Ottawa, with criminal harassment on Nov. 10 after a 10-week investigation prompted by a complaint from woman who had worked there. (AP)
 
CUBA: PROTESTING JOURNALIST'S SENTENCE The French free-press group Reporters Without Borders has protested the conviction of a Cuban journalist for antisocialist conduct. The newsman, Jesus Joel Diaz Hernandez, was sentenced to four years in prison by a court in Ciego de Avila province for "social dangerousness." In a letter to Fidel Castro, Reporters Without Borders demanded his release. (AP)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
JORDAN: PRINCE OUT OF SUCCESSION King Hussein, seen far left with his brother Prince Hassan, has told the Prince that he is removing him as heir to the throne and moving his sons in line for the crown. Hussein told Hassan through aides that he would appoint him as his deputy, a new post that appears to entail limited authority. (AP)
 
ISRAEL: A DRIFT AWAY FROM LIKUD Yitzhak Mordechai, the popular Defense Minister, seems poised to abandon the Likud Party to join a new center party, or perhaps even lead it. He declined to meet a deadline Friday to place his name on a Likud list of parliamentary candidates for the May 17 elections. But a statement from his office warned reporters not to jump to conclusions, and said he was still a member of Likud.

HEADLINE: Medicare Safety Nets Fail To Catch Many of the Poor

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Many of the poorest among the nation's 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, people with incomes below $10,000 a year, are going without aid from government safety net programs that are intended to help them pay their health care expenses.
The biggest, most generous of the programs covers doctor and hospital care that Medicare does not cover, typically 20 percent to 30 percent of the elderly's health care expenses. It also exempts its enrollees from paying Medicare's $45.50 monthly premium for doctors' office visits, deducted from Social Security checks. Two other programs exempt Medicare recipients with slightly higher incomes from paying the premium. 
 But studies by Families USA, a consumer advocacy group, as well as the Urban Institute and research philanthropies like the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund, estimate that three million or four million people, about 40 percent of those who are eligible, have never enrolled in the biggest safety-net program. Somewhat higher proportions have not joined the other programs, the groups report.
The studies, the gist of which the Clinton Administration does not dispute, attribute the low enrollments to conflicts between Federal and state agencies as well as a dearth of program leadership and coordination, labyrinthine red tape and demeaning application procedures.
"A lot of people think we have a generous safety net for health care," said Marilyn Moon, a health policy economist at the Urban Institute and a public trustee of the Medicare trust fund. In reality, Ms. Moon said, the shortfall in enrollment "is kind of a secret that people don't want to talk about very much."
Most of the aid has been available for a decade, but until a study last year by Families USA, little was known of the shortfall.
"We were all surprised by the low levels," of enrollment, said Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, head of the Health Care Financing Administration, which manages Medicare, the program for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor.
President Clinton is concerned, Ms. DeParle said, "and we have a campaign this year to raise awareness of it."
Congress, she noted, has given the Social Security Administration a $6 million grant to test ways of expanding the programs' coverage.
For the poor, the issue is urgent, said William Waldman, executive director of the American Public Human Services Association, formerly the American Public Welfare Association, with Medicare looking for ways to cut costs. A bipartisan national commission is grappling with overhauling Medicare to prevent insolvency soon after the year 2000.
Prominent proposals before the commission ask beneficiaries to bear more of their medical costs, which would further strain the poor.
In all, Congress has enacted four health-insurance safety nets for Medicare recipients, with all of them based on the Federal poverty guideline. The programs limit enrollees' assets, excluding a home, a car, some life insurance and a burial plot, to less than $4,000 for individuals and $6,000 for couples. Applicants must apply for the coverage to state agencies that supervise welfare services.
The biggest of the programs, enacted 11 years ago, is the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program. It is open to individual recipients with incomes of less than $8,292 a year and couples with less than $11,100 in income.
People who qualify are exempted from paying Medicare's monthly premium, the 20 percent share of the charges for doctors' office visits and the initial $768 in charges for hospitalization that Medicare requires of other recipients.
Individuals earning up to $9,900 annually and couples with incomes up to $13,260, figures that are 20 percent above the poverty guideline, can enroll in the Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries program. This program picks up Medicare $45.50 monthly premium.
Both programs require that the states pay 23 percent to 50 percent of their costs, which are calculated on formulas based on the strength of the states' economies. The same formulas are used to prescribe the states' share of Medicaid, with the rest paid for by the Federal Government.
Two newer programs, created by the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997, both of which terminate in 2002, are paid entirely by the Federal Government. But unlike the other programs, Congress limited the financing, so that if demand for them was high, late applicants would be turned away. The maximum spending is $1.5 billion over five years.
One, called Qualifying Individuals-1, raises the threshold for exemption from the Medicare premium to 135 percent of the poverty line, or $11,112 for an individual and $14,892 for couples and could aid about 500,000 Medicare recipients. Although enrollment began a year ago, Ms. Moon said only 16,000 people had signed up.
The second program, Qualifying Individuals-2, has proved of little benefit and enrollment is almost nil.
The first two programs are stirring the most controversy because states must share the cost while they have little flexibility in managing the benefit.
"The states have no control," said Bruce Bullen, the Massachusetts commissioner for medical services and chairman of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors. "They must follow these Medicare, cookie-cutter approaches to providing services to seniors."
Struck by the reports of the shortfall in the programs' enrollments, many states say they are redoubling their efforts to find low-income people eligible for them.
"It would be unfair to allege that Ohio has done anything to hide from these folks," said Barbara Coulter Edwards, Ohio's Medicaid director. But she said, "We are asking, 'Are there some things we could do to encourage a higher rate of participation?' "
There is no federally organized method for seeking out Medicare recipients who would be eligible for the two main programs.
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, explained part of the shortfall this way: "Social Security says, 'We don't run these programs. They're run by" the Health Care Financing Administration. "H.C.F.A. says, 'We have oversight, but they're administered by the states."'
To streamline the process and get around the welfare stigma, Denise Cross, Missouri's director of family services, said her state, like some others, was encouraging application by mail and phone.
And Congress has granted the Social Security Administration $6 million to test new approaches, like assigning state welfare aides to Social Security offices to take and screen program applications.
But given the magnitude of the shortfall, critics call that tokenism.
"I think it would take a substantial effort to get more people signed up," Ms. Moon of the Urban Institute said. "I doubt that $6 million is going to do it."

HEADLINE: Internet Stocks Falter, Causing Wider Worries

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
George E. Nichols, a 22-year-old management major at the Georgia Institute of Technology, put more than $1,500 of his student loan money in a mutual fund investing exclusively in high-flying Internet stocks.
Shalin Madan, 23, left his job as an accountant at State Street Bank in San Francisco to become a full-time "day trader," moving his money frantically in and out of stocks like America Online, Amazon.com and Yahoo, often every few minutes. 
 As this delirium has spread, Internet stocks have soared. Shares of newly public companies like Marketwatch.com and Theglobe.com have risen three- or fourfold in a day; more established companies like Yahoo or Amazon.com more than doubled over the last three months. Marketwatch now sports a market value of nearly $950 million -- bigger than a host of established companies such as Reebok, Polaroid and Tupperware.
But this week, a bit of the air leaked out of what many Wall Street pros call the Internet bubble, with some highfliers falling sharply from recent highs. And while most of the stocks are still ahead for the year, many analysts are warning of a steep decline that could rattle the wider market.
That's because Internet fever has spread in recent months to other kinds of technology companies and even to companies with only the most tangential connections to the Internet. And it leaves investors in 401(k) plans and mutual funds who have not bought into companies with "dot com" after their names increasingly vulnerable.
The latest warning about an Internet selloff comes from Barton Biggs, a Morgan Stanley strategist who has been bearish on the market for some time. "I promise you, like all bubbles, this bubble will come to a very bad end," he said on Thursday.
If it does, it's not just Amazon and Broadcast that will suffer. Pension and fund managers who are worried about the high prices of Internet stocks or who are having trouble buying large stakes in these small companies have driven up the stock prices of companies like Cisco Systems, which builds equipment that connects computers to the Internet, and Oracle, whose data-base software is used by on-line retailers.
Even more cautious fund managers have turned to companies like Walt Disney, CBS and Sotheby's. When Disney unveiled its Internet joint venture, Go Network, earlier this month, investors bid up Disney's market value by $5.6 billion.
While valuations of Internet stocks remain in the stratosphere, those of technology stocks have doubled in three months. And those of broad market indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 have leaped by 50 percent.
The prices of Internet stocks have risen so high so fast that even analysts enthusiastic about the Internet's long-term effect on the economy have warned that prices in the entire sector are likely to fall more than 50 percent.
A sharp, widespread decline would cause headaches for regulators and could cause problems for many on-line investors, who dominate the trading in many Internet stocks. A group of senior officials from several big Nasdaq trading firms has met to discuss recent volatility among the Internet stocks, virtually all of which trade on the Nasdaq.
Several brokerage firms have acted to squelch speculative trading by restricting on-line transactions. Among other things, they have made it more difficult to borrow to buy Internet stocks and put certain limitations on initial public offerings.
But this has done little to dampen the enthusiasm of investors like Mr. Madan. "It's a gold mine," he said. "The Internet stocks are the epitome of the 90's. They're a reflection of what is going on in the stock market. It's just more extreme."
Last week's initial public offering of Marketwatch, which provides financial data to Internet sites, was one of the hottest ever. The shares were initially offered to select investors at $17; but public trading opened on Jan. 15 at $90. The stock finished the first day at $97.50 but has since fallen to $80.50. That means most investors who bought after trading began have suffered a loss, as have recent arrivals to most Internet stocks.
Like Marketwatch, nearly every Internet company boasts an outsized valuation. America Online is worth more than half the companies in the Dow Jones industrial average. Yahoo is valued higher than Eastman Kodak. And the market value of Amazon.com exceeds the combined value of Barnes & Noble, Nordstrom and Federated Department Stores.
Richard Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation, recalls that a similar frenzy for computer stocks emerged in the summer of 1983, about the time the personal computer was introduced. But few of the favorites then -- like Prime Computer and Coleco -- are around today.
"The enthusiasm over the growth of technology as an industry was well founded," Mr. Hoey said. "But we learned that today's hot stock is not necessarily a long-term winner."
Judging by market values, though, few Internet stock prices reflect the possibility of failure. Consider Broadcast.com, which offers audio and video from 345 radio stations and 17 television stations, as well as its own coverage, over the Internet. The company has a market value of $2.33 billion. That amounts to $9.3 million for each of its 250 employees -- a benchmark for valuing Internet companies since they rarely have earnings and sometimes no revenues. By that measure, Broadcast. com's value is more than 15 times the $600,000 per employee at Infinity Broadcasting, which operates 160 radio stations in the United States and sells billboard space.
Yahoo is worth $35 million per employee, and Ebay, an Internet auction site, $61 million. That compares with $14 million at Microsoft and $5 million at Coca-Cola.
While Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Infinity earn millions of dollars each quarter, most Internet companies are years away from profits. Broadcast.com, for example, lost $10.5 million on revenues of just $11.4 million in the first nine months of last year.
Even people who expect the Internet to bring fundamental changes in the economy say there is no sense to the huge valuations.
"The Internet is making huge changes in how we live our daily lives," said Lise Buyer, an analyst who follows Internet companies at Credit Suisse First Boston. "But there is no way to correlate what is happening with these stocks to the underlying businesses. What we have is a mania."
The recent Internet frenzy has come in two phases. The first began on Oct. 8, after stock prices had fallen sharply on worries about the turmoil in emerging markets.
When the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in a matter of weeks, investors began to believe the American economy could withstand any pressure. At about the same time, the technology bellwethers Intel and Microsoft reported robust earnings and said they expected profits to continue to grow.
"All that got technology stocks going, and they kept going," said Charles A. Morris, manager of the T. Rowe Price Science and Technology fund.
Mr. Morris said he had little doubt that the madness swept up stocks like Cisco and Oracle. "Everyone got caught up in the Internet excitement, and that has dragged along all of the technology stocks associated with it," he said.
Internet stocks shifted into overdrive on Dec. 16, when a little-known Wall Street analyst, Henry Blodget, stirred speculative juices with a seemingly outrageous prediction.
Mr. Blodget, a 32-year-old analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer, forecast that Amazon.com, its shares then trading for $242, would reach $400 in 12 months. They surpassed that level in early January, and the stock split.
Even though Amazon shares have since fallen, they are up 52 percent since Mr. Blodget's report when adjusted for the split. But Mr. Blodget now says Internet stocks have gotten ahead of themselves, and predicts they will fall 30 to 60 percent from their highs.
"I don't think there's a sector in history that's been valued at these heights," he said. "It's frightening."
Mr. Blodget said part of the reason for the rapid climb is that there are only about four dozen "pure play" Internet stocks, and fewer than 10 of those have moved much beyond the planning stage.
Among them is Yahoo, which operates an entry site, or "portal," to the Internet. Investors hope that the services offered by portal companies, like free E-mail and connections to shopping sites, inspire loyalty among users, which the companies can capitalize on by selling advertising.
Other big favorites are on-line shopping sites like Amazon.com, which, although unprofitable so far, hopes to capture customer loyalty as it expands.
Because many young companies have relatively few shares outstanding, big investors like pension and mutual funds have found it hard to buy large stakes without significantly moving share prices. Broadcast.com, for example, has 17 million shares outstanding, but until this month only 2.5 million of those were available to be traded.
With an average of 900,000 of its shares trading each day, the price rose from less than $40 three months ago to $289.50 this month, before falling back to $136.25 yesterday.
So limited is the supply of pure Internet investments, in fact, that many institutional investors have tried to ferret out Internet opportunities elsewhere.
That is what caused people to bid up shares of CBS, which owned 50 percent of Marketwatch -- a stake reduced to 38 percent in the recent public offering. In addition, CBS owns 10 percent of Sportsline USA, which operates sports-related Internet sites.
Shares of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette rose last week after the brokerage firm said it might offer to the public shares of its on-line brokerage unit. And since December, when Sotheby's made clear its intention to use the Internet for some auctions, its shares have risen 50 percent.
The heavy trading in pure Internet stocks like Broadcast.com appears to be driven by individual investors: the average size of Internet trades is in the hundreds of shares, far smaller than the thousands typical for companies like Microsoft or Intel, according to Birinyi Associates, a research firm.
And those individual investors are starting to feel a bit of pain as some of the frenzy has subsided.
"I'm worried, but I was kind of expecting this," said Mr. Nichols, who recently graduated from Georgia Tech and took an accounting job. "But I'm in for the long term."

HEADLINE: A Challenge to Scientific Economics;
An Older School Looks at a Broad, More Intuitive Picture While Modernists See Just the Numbers and Facts

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Ask economists in the baby boom generation why they became economists, and any number will give some credit to Robert L. Heilbroner. His 1953 book, "The Worldly Philosophers," which has sold nearly four million copies, is a "Profiles in Courage" of the great thinkers who shaped modern economics. So it is somewhat surprising to find Mr. Heilbroner increasingly critical of the economists he helped inspire. They have missed the point, he says.
Mr. Heilbroner, 79, is at one end of a growing debate over whether economics, as practiced today, is effective. Sure, economists do a lot of good research, Mr. Heilbroner acknowledges. Some of it yields important insights. But their models are too simplistic. They overlook factors that shape the economic and social system and in doing so forfeit the deep understanding achieved by an Adam Smith or a John Maynard Keynes, two of his worldly philosophers. 
 "The worldly philosophers thought their task was to model all the complexities of an economic system -- the political, the sociological, the psychological, the moral, the historical," Mr. Heilbroner said. "And modern economists, au contraire, do not want so complex a vision. They favor two-dimensional models that in trying to be scientific leave out too much and leave modern economists without a true understanding of how the system works."
The worldly philosophers would have agreed.
"Noneconomic motives are an essential element of economic theory," Joseph A. Schumpeter wrote in 1942, two years after Mr. Heilbroner graduated from Harvard, where he had heard Schumpeter lecture. A few years earlier, Keynes had said that "no part of man's nature or his institutions must lie entirely outside an economist's regard." And Alfred Marshall, the 19th-century British economist, warned that "economics cannot be compared with the exact physical sciences, for it deals with the ever changing and subtle forces of human nature."
The shift from this way of thinking came after World War II, when economics gradually ceased to be a social science and took on the techniques of a natural science. Mathematics became the language of economics, and computer models of the economy became the chief research tool. These models require assumptions about the way markets and people behave, assumptions that are often unrealistic, although in recent years economists have fed more and more actual data into their equations in an attempt to approximate the real world.
"If math is correctly used, then it can incorporate all kinds of things that really make the analysis very much broader," said George Akerlof, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. "The best of this new work pays attention to psychology and sociology."
That still falls short of what Mr. Heilbroner has in mind. The modern economists separated out the subjective, often intuitive judgments that earlier economists had considered so important. These were considered not susceptible to scientific inquiry, not measurable.
In the process, economists also squeezed out the word capitalism, the once traditional name for the market system, with its subjective connotation of class struggle between owners or managers and workers and with its suggestion of the privileges that go with various levels of wealth. The word capitalism rarely appears in popular textbooks for Economics 101.
Explaining why, N. Gregory Mankiw, 40, a Harvard economist and author of a popular new textbook, "Principles of Economics," said: "We make a distinction now between positive or descriptive statements that are scientifically verifiable and normative statements that reflect values and judgments. The question is, can you do positive economics without normative economics. I think so."
The science of economics, for example, has found that the causes of extreme income inequality, a relatively new phenomenon, can be objectively measured.
Those who are well educated are well paid in the American high-tech service economy, and those who have not gone beyond high school are not well paid. For Mr. Mankiw, that is a "positive" statement in that it is verifiable.
But left out of this finding are factors like job insecurity, which tends to make wages more unequal -- whatever the education level -- and labor union bargaining power, which helped to equalize wages until union power declined. These are subjective observations that Mr. Mankiw or Paul Romer, a 43-year-old Stanford University economist, would classify as political or public policy issues but not part of a scientific explanation of the workings of the economic system.
"There was a kind of a hubris among earlier generations of economists who thought they themselves could make the scientific statements and then the value judgments," Mr. Romer said.
He likens an economist's role to that of a doctor who explains what will happen if a cancer patient is taken off an aggressive program of chemotherapy and radiation. "You can let the pastor, the legislator, the family and the philosopher struggle with the moral question of whether to actually stop the treatment," Mr. Romer said, "but what you want from a doctor is correct scientific statements about what will happen if."
Keynes made no such distinctions. Drawing on intuition, observation and his own broad experience, he concluded that the United States and other nations found themselves stuck in the 1930's Depression in large part because business refused to invest, although the nation offered plenty of savings to finance investment. Keynes's sweeping insight forever changed the way economists think about the way a capitalist system functions. And Keynes, having found the problem, saw no reason to be shy about solutions, calling for enormous Government spending to offset the decline in business investment.
"Keynes certainly had a view of what was a good society," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "And he tried to save society from itself."
 
Leaving Politics To the Politicians
Modern economists reject such a role. Mr. Romer's father, Roy Romer, the former Governor of Colorado, had to decide while in office whether to cut taxes or spend more on education, a value judgment properly left to politicians, in the son's view. "I saw my father as someone very skilled at what he does," the son said. "I have sought to be as skilled on the scientific side."
The father chose more education, partly on the advice of his son, who told him of the scientific finding of economists that income inequality is a result of unequal education.
But in this sort of a case, science does not take you far enough, says Mr. Heilbroner, an economics historian at the New School for Social Research. "You have to ask, what is the correlation between high levels of education and high levels of wealth," he said. "Is education in our system a privilege of wealth and a function of the class structure?"
These are questions that science cannot address but economics must, says Mark Blaug, an economics historian. Otherwise, the findings are skewed. "There are so many things going on in the economics world at the same time," he said. "Not just standard economic forces, but all the other elements that shape an economy -- politics, morals, psychology, sociology -- and therefore economics will always be vague and imprecise, more like history than math."
Going beyond science sits easier with older economists like Mr. Heilbroner or Mr. Blaug, who is 71, or Mr. Solow, who is 74 and, like Mr. Heilbroner and Mr. Blaug, came of age as an economist in the 1950's, while Keynesianism was still in its heyday and the cold war had not yet helped squeeze value judgments out of economics.
Mr. Solow, however, is a pillar of mainstream economics. His economic growth theory, in which he explained the interactions of capital, labor and technology in generating economic expansion, is a model of economics practiced as a science. He would never, he said, "advise a student to go to work on the nature of the class structure."
"You are condemning him to failure," he continued. "We do not know if there are applicable rules."
And yet in an autobiographical sketch, he argued against thinking of economics as science with a capital S. "That is perfectly consistent," he wrote, "with a strong belief that economics should try very hard to be scientific with a small s. By that I mean only that we should think logically and respect fact." Fact, he said, should be enlarged "to include, say, the opinions and casual generalizations of experts and market participants, attitudinal surveys, institutional regularities, even our judgments of plausibility. My preferred image is the vacuum cleaner, not the microscope."
And gradually economics is moving this way. The younger generation, while holding tight to its scientific approach, is nevertheless opening up its equations, feeding into them all sorts of new data from other disciplines, then trying, more than in the past, to make the hypotheses fit the data. Surveys are increasingly being used, and old assumptions -- that supply and demand, for example, balance at a healthy level -- are being amended or put aside.
The new approach was on display at the recent annual meeting of the American Economics Association, where economists at one session reviewed their research into today's unusual spectacle of an unemployment rate and an inflation rate falling together instead of moving in opposite directions, as economic theory dictates and as they once did. Drawing on psychology, the researchers have even tried to quantify how people actually behave or feel about work. "Our modeling now is much more flexible," said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard labor economist. "I really think we are seeing a blossoming of a broader social science field, where the core research techniques are maintained but are supplemented with findings from other fields that were once quite separate."
 
Judging Numbers, Not Just Calculating
And Mr. Heilbroner applauds. But it is not, in his view, enough. The questions that absorb the younger economists are too narrow, he says. From Adam Smith's day, economics has always been an inquiry into the nature of capitalism in its various forms, an inquiry that requires as much history, sociology and ethics as it does science, Mr. Heilbroner says.
Economists, for example, cannot just chronicle the rise of output as an economy grows. There must also be a judgment about the quality of that output: Does it show up as more school construction or warmer clothing in winter or as more channels of bad television programs and higher pay for chief executives. That is how the worldly philosophers would have thought, Mr. Heilbroner suggests in a new chapter added to the seventh edition of "The Worldly Philosophers," to be published in the spring by Simon & Schuster.
"Economics will not, and should not, become a political torch that lights our way into the future," he writes, "but it can and should become the source of an awareness of ways by which a capitalist structure can broaden its motivations, increase its flexibility and develop its social morale."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Led by I.B.M., Dow Closes 1.6% Lower

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market finished lower yesterday as I.B.M. fell sharply after mainframe sales in the fourth quarter disappointed some investors. The economic crisis in Brazil was also bothersome, helping send bank and financial stocks lower.
Despite the selling, investors did not seem to extrapolate the problems at I.B.M. to the expectation of poor results elsewhere. And that is why although the Dow Jones industrial average, which includes I.B.M., dropped 1.6 percent, the rest of the major stock indexes were down far less. 
 "A couple of tech companies have already reported good earnings," said Douglas R. Cliggott, a United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. "So the market said tech was strong and a couple of disappointing revenue or earnings numbers have not led to widespread selling."
It was a volatile day of trading, however. The market opened down across the board, with the Dow 175 points, or 1.9 percent, lower by 10:30 A.M. while the Nasdaq index dropped 40 points, or 1.7 percent.
Along with the fall in I.B.M., market-opening declines in Amazon.com, Yahoo, Excite and other Internet stocks set a gloomy tone early. The selling came on top of sharp losses Thursday and a general Internet selloff for the last week and a half.
At their intraday lows yesterday, Yahoo was 43 percent below its intraday high of 445 on Jan. 11 and Amazon.com was 50 percent below its high of 199 1/8 on Jan. 8. But the concerted selling recently seemed to get prices back down to levels that attracted investors again and these and other Internet stocks turned around to end the day higher.
Yahoo, which fell 12 at the opening, rallied to close up 21 at 286, and Amazon.com rose 17, to 123, after beginning the day down 7 5/8. This Internet turnaround helped the Nasdaq rebound. It was up 20 points at one point but finished the day down just 5.84 points, or one-quarter of a percentage point, at 2,338.88.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 9.97 points, to 1,225.19.
The Dow finished down 143.41 points at 9,120.67. It had rallied in the early afternoon but then fell the rest of the day.
I.B.M., which is the heaviest- weighted stock in the Dow, accounted for almost half of the day's decline as it plunged 17 1/4, or 8.76 percent, to 179 3/4. Although I.B.M.'s fourth-quarter earnings, which were released after the market closed Thursday, beat expectations, analysts said that they were disappointed that both mainframe and server sales were down because I.B.M. cut prices to compete with Hitachi and Fujitsu.
Other stocks leading the Dow lower were American Express and J. P. Morgan, which weaken when the crisis in Brazil looks worse, and the Dow's two drug stocks, Merck and Johnson & Johnson.
In the bond market, concerns about Brazil helped push prices higher as some investors sought the safety of Treasury securities. Brazil's Bovespa index dropped 1.8 percent and the country's currency, the real, continued to decline in value. It is now down 29.4 percent since it was allowed to trade freely last week.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 28/32 , to 102 22/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.07 percent, from 5.13 percent.

HEADLINE: Tax Rebates in New Jersey

 BODY:
Like two-thirds of the nation's governors, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey is now wrestling with the "problem" of fat budget surpluses brought on by a booming economy. This month, to no one's great surprise, Mrs. Whitman proposed in her State of the State Message to send money back to taxpayers in the form of a rebate for their local property taxes. The proposal is certain to be popular, but there is a worrisome catch. The cost of the rebate would grow from $200 million the first year to $1 billion annually in five years, raising questions about whether the money will be there to pay for it if the economy turns down.
Mrs. Whitman's zest for tax-cutting is a signature of her career and crucial to her claim for consideration as a nominee for Vice President in the next national election. She first ran in 1993 on a pledge to cut the income tax, and then kept her word by using budget gimmicks to make up for the lost revenues. Her past tax cuts now amount to about $1.2 billion in annual lost revenue. Currently she proposes to cut taxes in the next five years by nearly as much as in the last five. But since Mrs. Whitman cannot run for a third term, it will probably be up to her successor to deal with any adverse long-term consequences of her actions. That should give pause to the State Legislature. 
 In her re-election campaign in 1997, Mrs. Whitman discovered that voters were less grateful about the enacted state income-tax cuts than angry over rising property taxes and insurance rates. Her victory over a little-known Democratic opponent was close and hard-fought. Mrs. Whitman's response, an average $600 rebate for homeowners, is politically understandable. But it fails to address the basic structural problems that drive up property tax rates, which include the duplications and inefficiencies in New Jersey's 566 municipalities and 611 school districts.
The Governor's State of the State address featured several commendable but modest spending initiatives, including more money to maintain parks and open space, as well as an expansion of health services for children and the elderly. Some of the money for the health programs may come from $7.5 billion that New Jersey is to receive over the next 25 years in the tobacco suit settlement. Over all, Mrs. Whitman's preference for being known as a tax-cutter rather than a spender is likely to be noticed by the national Republican Party.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
In Utah, More Investigations and More Anxiety

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 22

 BODY:
When the 2002 Winter Olympics were finally awarded to this city after years of struggle, many residents said Utah's capital, long regarded as clean and quiet and little else, had finally arrived on the world stage, equal to the best.
But now, many people here say that the other shoe has dropped. With revelations in recent weeks that money and gifts had been given to International Olympic Committee officials to influence the bidding process, and with state, Federal and independent investigations churning behind closed doors, Salt Lake City, its residents say, has also revealed itself to be no better, either. 
 Bryan De Vries, for one, is glad.
"Most people think of it as the capital for the Mormons, the headquarters of the church, and we shouldn't have any problems," said De Vries, a computer programmer who works and lives in the city. "But we do. We've got gang-related problems. We've got corruption in politics. We've got this, that and the other, just like any other city."
De Vries said he hoped the collective soul-searching that has become part of the debate here on the Olympics will have a positive effect on how the city regards itself in the future. "Maybe it will help us focus on our other problems," he said.
Victoria Ostradicky, a land surveyor who was on her way downtown to work this morning, said reaching for the Olympic rings had simply proved the city had feet of clay. "I guess we are just normal humans like everybody else, and business is business," she said.
The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has admitted to giving hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts, medical treatment, tuition reimbursements and other perks to I.O.C. members or their families. But the gifts, the officials have said, were humanitarian aid, or tokens of good will, and not bribes. No criminal charges have been filed against any current or former official involved in the Olympic bid.
But the multiple investigations under way have accentuated the sense of held breath. In one downtown building, for example, a team of United States Justice Department lawyers from Washington has been questioning witnesses this week in the local F.B.I. offices. Six floors below, a separate independent ethics investigation by the organizing committee was conducting its work. A few blocks away, at the State Capitol, the Attorney General had begun her investigation into possible violation of state laws.
With so many questions still unanswered, perception has heightened this city's Olympic anxiety.
Some residents and local leaders say, for example, that they think some members of the national and world news media have falsely elevated the city's supposed ethical and moral purity as a device to make the bribery allegations appear more newsworthy and more shocking than they are -- that it could happen (gasp) even here.
Others say they think that Salt Lake City should genuinely be held to a higher ethical standard, because of its religious heritage, and that the costs to the city's psyche of what appears to have been involved in bidding for the Olympics are yet to be calculated.
The reality is somewhere in the middle. Economists and securities law experts say, for example, that Salt Lake City's past ethical pedigree is not as pristine as local idealists or outsiders have suggested.
For many years, for example, it was one of the centers in the nation, along with Denver, in penny stock trading, which was notorious for its swindles and scams, in which low-priced shares in often nonexistent companies -- especially in things like gold mines and oil wells -- were sold to gullible investors.
A spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Michael Otterson, also said it would be the "height of arrogance" for him to say that Salt Lake City was more moral or ethical than other places. What the church does, he said, is teach principles, and then allows people to govern themselves.
In the Olympic bidding process, Otterson said, the church took no formal position and donated no money. Individual corporations owned by the church, however, including The Deseret News and the company that owns the local CBS television affiliate, did make contributions to the bid committee totaling about $211,000. And Otterson said many church members were involved in the bidding process, including the former president of the organizing committee, Tom Welch.
"The church believes in following the highest moral and ethical principles," Otterson said. "There seems to be at least prima facie evidence that that wasn't done here."
Just as big a question as right and wrong, however, is who is talking and who is not. The lawyer for Welch, who ran the Olympic bid committee until his resignation in 1997 after being accused of spousal abuse, said his client had not been subpoenaed. The lawyer, Thomas A. Schaffer, said Welch had not been questioned by any state or Federal authorities or asked to appear. He said the facts, in any case, would show Welch had done nothing illegal.
Welch's secretary, Stephanie Pate, however, was interviewed by Justice Department lawyers and F.B.I. agents on Wednesday, with questioning to resume next week. Her lawyer, David B. Watkiss, declined to discuss anything about the questions or answers but said his client had done nothing illegal and had not witnessed anything illegal.
Residents here today said that rumor and perception were making them confused about what to think of themselves. "In some ways, when the world is looking at you like this, you could look at it as a compliment, too -- that Salt Lake lives at a higher standard than the rest, so they shouldn't have been involved," said Duane Carter, who works in computer security for a local utility company. "But right now, it's kind of an embarrassment."
Donna Caporale, an insurance agent, said she believed there might be a badge of honor, of sorts, yet to be found. The fact that questions about the Olympics happened to blow up here is partly a result, she said, that people began admitting what they had done.
"We're not too smart," she said. "Or we're too honest."
