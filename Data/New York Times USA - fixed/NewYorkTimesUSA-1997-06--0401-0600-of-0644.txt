HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Sounds of Summer: W.N.B.A. to Take Center Court

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The behemoth is racing Gary Cavalli's way, dribbling a two-toned basketball. The co-founder and chief executive of the American Basketball League awaits Saturday afternoon's start of the Women's National Basketball Association, which insists that it has come to coexist with the A.B.L., not to bury it.
"In print they say they want both leagues to succeed, and I'll take that at face value," Cavalli said. "I don't want them to bomb. If they do, people will say that even with the N.B.A.'s support, women's basketball can't succeed." 
 By being first, the A.B.L. capitalized on the United States women's team's gold medal victory in the Summer Olympics in Atlanta; the W.N.B.A., in turn, is benefiting from the continued attention on the sport provided by the A.B.L.
"The fact that women's basketball has been in the news for most of the last 10 months is only good for us," said Val Ackerman, the W.N.B.A. president.
Now, by trying to execute a 10-week summer schedule, one that may extend in future seasons, the W.N.B.A. is trying to rewrite the basketball equation. The league wants to shift players from traditional schedules and lure fans, old and new, into arenas during the summer. If the W.N.B.A. succeeds, Commissioner David Stern's Mother Ship will have created a year-round presence.
Despite major differences, the leagues share one common element: all teams are centrally owned and the players are signed and paid by the leagues. There are no team owners, a structure designed to control marketing and costs.
The same single-entity structure of Major League Soccer, which is two years old, was challenged in a Federal lawsuit filed last February by 10 players who charged that the league violated antitrust laws by holding down salaries.
So far, A.B.L. salaries are higher than the W.N.B.A.'s, but the latter offers the promise that some of its players can augment their paychecks by appearing in advertising from its blue-chip sponsors.
The idea of extending the National Basketball Association's reach into the summer -- the W.N.B.A. will start eight days after the N.B.A. finals end -- has been kicked around the league for a decade, but the economic moment had not arrived.
That changed because of several factors: the N.B.A.'s marketing alliance with USA Basketball; the success of the women's national team from 1995 to 1996; the popularity of the college game; the embrace of the sport by Reebok and Nike, which created a shoe named for Sheryl Swoopes, and the Olympic victory.
"By calling it the W.N.B.A., we are putting our brand into play, and at risk at some level," said Rick Welts, the president of N.B.A. Properties and the chief marketer of the women's league.
Now unleashed, the W.N.B.A. comes to the sport nurtured as no new league has ever been, armed with the privileges of the pampered child of the marketing-mad N.B.A.: some of its sponsors, eight of its arenas, and its employees.
Also, General Motors, Lee Jeans, Sears Roebuck, Nike, Reebok, American Express, and Coca-Cola are fortifying its debut.
NBC, ESPN and the Lifetime Network will show 33 games; games will be carried to 150 nations; league ads ran during the N.B.A. playoffs and a Reebok spot starring the New York Liberty's Rebecca Lobo ran during Game 6 of the finals.
Reebok is sponsoring both leagues. "By supporting both, we show that Reebok stands for women's basketball," said Kathy O'Connell, group director of the apparel company's women's sports marketing.
Champion designed the players' uniforms; advertising inserts appeared in Glamour and Self magazines; player profiles ran in major publications; the league mantra, "We Got Next," is catching on with young girls; season previews have run on NBC and ESPN, and Lifetime is eager to make broad use of the W.N.B.A. as the flagship of its fledgling sports division.
Then there is the official ball: orange and off-white, smaller than the N.B.A. and A.B.L. version, but sure to call attention to itself on television.
Ackerman and Welts have no doubts that the June-August season -- avoiding competition for television exposure and advertisers with college and pro basketball and football, and the National Hockey League -- was the only viable strategy.
"When you take into account how deep into the summer the N.B.A. season runs and you look at everything that happens with camps, clinics and summer leagues, summertime and basketball really go together," Ackerman said.
It is also easier to book arena time during the summer, and to use N.B.A. team personnel.
"It's a wonderful time to redefine the best time to play basketball," said Nancy Lieberman-Cline, 38, the doyenne of women's basketball, and a guard for the W.N.B.A.'s Phoenix Mercury. An Olympic silver medalist in 1976, she played in the old Women's Basketball League.
The A.B.L. counters that an October-to-March schedule is more suitable, especially in the eight (now nine, with expansion to Long Beach, Calif.) college basketball-oriented markets that host its teams.
"I wanted to play a regular basketball season," said Jennifer Azzi, a 1996 gold medalist now with the A.B.L.'s San Jose Lasers, "not at a time where you start from the bottom up."
Cavalli said: "We believe women's basketball deserves to have a legitimate season in terms of length and when it's played. It should be the main event, not a subsidiary stuck in the summer for convenience and marketing reasons."
A.B.L. players are barred from playing in European leagues or elsewhere, while the W.N.B.A.'s players are free to play anywhere, even in the A.B.L. The two leagues have similar views of their talent levels: Each believes it has the best players. The A.B.L. boasts it has 7 of the 12 members of the 1996 Summer Olympic team, but the W.N.B.A. crows about having 3 of the 5 starters. The A.B.L. signed college stars like Kate Starbird and Kara Wolters, who will play for the New England Blizzard, and be coached by K. C. Jones, an N.B.A. lifer; the W.N.B.A. has Lobo, Lisa Leslie, Ruthie Bolton-Holifield and Swoopes, and a crop of European players like Yelena Baranova of Russia.
"It's great to have an option but I chose the W.N.B.A. because it's the credible one for the long term," said Pam McGee of the Sacramento Monarchs.
Both leagues have modest attendance goals. The A.B.L. projected a 3,000 average a game last year, and got 3,500, with a 4,200 average last February. It hopes for greater attendance this season, and added a team in Long Beach. But the league lost about $5 million on its partners' $4 million investment.
Cavalli admitted that he must improve the A.B.L.'s sponsor roster and that being carried on SportsChannel's network of regional sports services is inadequate.
"We're spending all our time working on it," he said.
The league is also trying to raise capital by selling investors team-operating agreements -- not franchises -- for up to $3 million to raise capital.
The W.N.B.A. is hoping to average 4,000 fans a game. Each arena will be draped to create sites with no more than 10,647 seats. Optimism abounds, not only from exhibition-game attendance, which was as high as 9,677 in Phoenix, but from the juggernaut of marketing and hype orchestrated by the N.B.A.
"I have no doubt we will see the W.N.B.A. at 50," Lieberman-Cline said.
Azzi is almost as confident about the A.B.L. and likes its more shoestring appeal. "A lot of people thought we wouldn't make it, but we surprised a lot of people, basically with no marketing money," she said.
Still, the suggestion that the W.N.B.A. will swallow the A.B.L. lingers.
"People question our motivation," Welts said. "That's blatantly unfair. Our motivation is this is the right time. We're as transparent as we can get. That's why we're doing this."

Turkish Leader Resigns After Military Pressure
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, the first head of an Islamic party to lead Turkey, yielded to pressure from the military and resigned after nearly a year in power. President Suleyman Demirel did not indicate who he would name as Mr. Erbakan's successor. A1 

Pol Pot Is Said to Surrender
Pol Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, surrendered to former comrades who turned against him, according to a clandestine radio broadcast. It was not clear whether he would be turned over to the Government or the international community and be put on trial for the killings of more than a million Cambodians during his reign of terror from 1975 to 1979. A1
 
Man Charged in C.I.A. Killings
Mir Aimal Kansi, who was seized Sunday by F.B.I. agents in a hotel in Afghanistan, appeared in a courthouse in Fairfax, Va., and was charged with the murder of two C.I.A. agents. Mr. Kansi, who fled the United States four years ago but was eventually captured by a coalition of C.I.A. and F.B.I. agents, Pakistani spies and Afghan warriors, said he did not have money to pay for a lawyer but understood the charges against him. A3
 
Deported Saudi Pleads Guilty
Hani Abdel Rahim Hussein al-Sayegh, a Saudi dissident suspected of having a minor role in the bombing that killed 19 Americans in Dhahran last year, has agreed to plead guilty to charges that he tried to kill Americans in an earlier plot that was never carried out. Mr. Sayegh has said that he would cooperate with United States officials in the investigation of the blast. A3
 
Israeli Cabinet Member Resigns
Finance Minister Dan Meridor quit the Israeli Government in a dispute over exchange rates, angrily asserting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had deliberately raised the issue to force him out. Mr. Meridor is the second Likud politician to quit the Cabinet. A7
 
Oxford Accepts Huge Gift
Reversing an earlier vote, Oxford University academics have voted overwhelmingly to accept the $32 million gift of Wafic Said, a Saudi billionaire. The gift will be used to build a new business school. The dons had voted against the plans last November because of concerns over the proposed location for the school and questions about the background of the donor, who used his contacts with the Saudi royal family to help Britain win a $1.7 billion arms contract in 1988.

Guerrillas Arrested in Colombia
Five leftist guerrillas were arrested in Colombia in raids carried out after an explosion that killed 8 policemen and injured more than 10 others, authorities said. The National Police said the suspects were known members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a pro-Cuban group founded in 1964. (Reuters)

Broad Changes Proposed In Structure of Medicare
The Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved sweeping legislation that would modernize Medicare, increase Medicare charges for affluent elderly people, provide new money for health coverage of uninsured children and restore welfare benefits for more than a half-million legal immigrants. A1
 
Disney Boycott Proposed
The Southern Baptist Convention called for a boycott of Walt Disney to protest what it said was the company's accommodation of gay issues and portrayal of violence in its entertainment products. Gay rights and civil liberties groups called the measure an attack on homosexuals and free speech that would fail, while Disney said it was dedicated to providing family entertainment. A10
 
Benefit From Hormone Use
Hormone replacement after menopause can significantly reduce a woman's risk of death as long as she continues it, a study has found. In the first decade of hormone use, the chance of dying was 37 percent lower among women in the study who were using hormones than among women who never took them, primarily because of fewer deaths from heart disease among hormone users. A1
 
Congress Criticizes C.I.A.
The C.I.A. and the rest of the nation's intelligence services do not have "the analytic depth, breadth and expertise to monitor political, military and economic developments worldwide," the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said. The committee, whose chairman is a former C.I.A. officer, said the services had a largely inexperienced work force that was unfamiliar with the countries they analyzed. A13
 
Tax Compromise Offered
Representative Bill Archer, the chief Republican tax writer in the House, dropped a provision from his tax-cutting bill that has drawn heavy criticism from Democrats, saying he hoped the Clinton Administration would offer a compromise in return and help avert partisan warfare over the legislation. A13
 
Speaker Outlines Program
Speaker Newt Gingrich sketched out a 10-point program to promote racial healing and black achievement in the first clear-cut Republican response to President Clinton's recent speech on race relations. Mr. Gingrich said his program relied more on specific steps and less on theory, talk and affirmative action. A12
 
Charges in Drug Case
Two wealthy San Francisco interior decorators, who lived in an expensive house with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge, owed their success to the Cali drug cartel in Colombia, Federal prosecutors charged. They said the two men had financed a lavish life style by laundering more than $30 million for the Cali cartel by converting narcotics money into artwork and furniture. A10

Judge Orders Family Courts To Remain Open to Public
New York State's Family Courts, which handle some of the system's most private and wrenching cases, from custody fights to crimes committed by children, should routinely be open to the public and news organizations, the state's Chief Judge said. Judges will still have the discretion to close cases under the new rules, but only for compelling and specific reasons, like insuring the privacy of a child who was the victim of sexual abuse. A1
 
One Times Square Sold
One Times Square, the skinny tower that is an international landmark and home to the New Year's Eve ball drop for nearly a century, is being sold to German investors for four times the price paid by Lehman Brothers a little more than two years ago. The building is vacant and, aside from a possible theme restaurant in its base, is likely to remain mostly empty, serving as little more than a gigantic billboard. A1
 
Helmsley to Sell Holdings
Leona Helmsley said she intended to sell most or perhaps all of her hotels, office buildings, apartment houses and other properties, valued at close to $5 billion. Mrs. Helmsley's decision comes amid a bitter falling out with business associates of her deceased husband, Harry Helmsley, who accumulated the real estate holdings over five decades of investing in which he was widely regarded as one of the shrewdest deal makers in the industry.

HEADLINE: Pataki Assails 'Vile Remarks' On Black City University Trustee

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 18

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki and his aides today assailed a Democratic lawmaker who questioned the qualifications of the black educator he nominated for the City University of New York's board of trustees and claimed the Governor's choice amounted to racial pandering.
The administration's criticisms focused on comments made by Emanuel R. Gold, a Democratic Senator from Queens. During a vote on Tuesday to confirm the nominee, Kenneth E. Cook, Mr. Gold strongly suggested that the Governor nominated Mr. Cook solely because of his race, not his qualifications. The nomination of Mr. Cook, a retired junior high school teacher, was ultimately approved by the Republican-dominated Senate. 
 Mr. Gold made it clear that he and other members of the Democratic minority in the State Senate wanted the board to have more black representation. But speaking on the Senate floor before the vote, he added that "it is an insult to the Afro-American community to say we'll put somebody on the board that has a dark face regardless of intellect and that ought to shut up the community."
The Pataki administration went on the offensive today, distributing transcripts of Mr. Gold's comments to reporters and quickly arranging a news conference that was attended by about two dozen black, female and disabled members of the administration. Ranging from high-ranking officials to low-level bureaucrats, they denounced the Senator.
"We take it personally," said Randy Daniels, a senior vice president for economic revitalization at the Empire State Development Corporation who is black. "We understand what attacks on the intelligence of black people historically have meant in this country."
At a news conference later in the day, Mr. Gold refused to apologize and stressed that he meant no offense. He was flanked by seven black Democratic senators who defended him, saying he had merely echoed their concerns. Mr. Gold and his colleagues said they were deeply troubled that Mr. Cook was unable to answer the most basic questions about City University during confirmation hearings, such as how many students and campuses are in the system. "We were talking about his qualifications," said Alton R. Waldon Jr., a black Senator from Queens.
The administration released a letter that Mr. Pataki sent to Mr. Gold. "I was shocked and appalled by your vile remarks on the Senate floor," he wrote. "You have set a new low for public discourse in the State Legislature."

Errata and Incongruities At Isaac Bashevis Singer's Grave

What writer has not suffered the indignity of a typo? But for Isaac Bashevis Singer, this particular typo was the ultimate indignity: It was on his gravestone.
To some of his friends it was a cruel insult, a mistake set in stone. Others saw it as a comic absurdity, one that would have certainly been appreciated by Singer himself. His widow, like an antic Singer character afloat in her own world, was willing to let it pass. 
 But yesterday, nearly six years after the death of the Yiddish writer who won the 1978 Nobel Prize for Literature, a monument engraver finally corrected Singer's honorific. Singer at last is a "Nobel" laureate, and no longer a "Noble" one, as his stone has proclaimed since 1992.
The correction brought to an end not only the unintended pun but also a saga of love and abandonment that was, in essence, Singer's longest and last short story.
"Isaac would have enjoyed the irony," said Eve Friedman, the co-author with Singer of the play "Teibele and Her Demon." "But there was something kind of sad about it. Isaac in that stone was the butt of a joke."
The typo was one of several unfortunate leitmotifs in the tale surrounding Singer's final resting place. Another was his son's anger over the site of his father's grave: why did the author of "Gimpel the Fool," who wrote such farcical stories about the ambiguities of sex and death, end up buried in suburban New Jersey, in a tree-bordered but casually kept grave site within view of an encroaching subdivision? Yet another was the family's incredulity that Singer, described by his son as a "Jewish Casanova," was laid to rest three gravestones away from the man, Walter Wassermann, from whom he stole his second wife. That woman, Alma Singer, who died in 1996, now lies next to Singer, but within feet of Mr. Wassermann -- a woman buried between her first and second husbands.
If this were a Singer short story ("The Reencounter" comes to mind), Walter and Isaac would continue to glare at each other in death, through the yew bushes. "They hardly got along in life, so it's kind of ironic that they're neighbors in death," said Alma Singer's grandson, Stephen R. Dujack, who, like the rest of the family, first noticed the proximity of the graves at what he called Singer's 1991 "funeral from hell."
(When the Singer limousine was departing the Beth-El cemetery in Paramus, N.J., it was stopped at the gate for nonpayment of the plot. Mr. Dujack offered his credit card, but Beth-El did not take Visa; Mrs. Singer had to write out a check for $3,026 on the spot.)
The typo was discovered a year later, in the summer of 1992, at the unveiling of the gravestone in Beth-El before family and friends. Roger Straus, a founder of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Singer's publisher, was horrified, and immediately pulled Mrs. Singer aside. "I said 'This is awful, what are we going to do?' " he recalled. Mrs. Singer responded, he said, that "Noble" was "an acceptable alternative."
At that, Mr. Straus said, "I thought it was time to go for lunch."
The story really begins in a Catskills resort. The then-Alma Wassermann, a stylish, self-absorbed, 30-year-old refugee born in Germany, was married to Walter Wassermann, a wealthy businessman. They had two young children. The family had recently fled Nazi Germany and settled in Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan. In the summer of 1937, they took their first American vacation at a farm in Mountaindale, N.Y. Nearby was Green Fields, a colony of Jewish writers, where Singer, 33, the son of a Warsaw rabbi and himself a recent immigrant, was staying.
Mrs. Wassermann and Singer became friends, and went for long walks with her children. The relationship continued in the city, in clandestine meetings at the New York Public Library, and grew into a romance. By 1940, Mrs. Wassermann had left her husband, who had grown withdrawn and morose, as well as Inge, 10, and Klaus, 6, to marry Singer. The newlyweds settled in Brooklyn. Inge and Klaus remained in Washington Heights, to be raised by their father and housekeepers.
"I just felt that I had to spend the rest of my life with him and therefore I had to give up my marriage and my children," Alma Singer later told Janet Hadda, the author of "Isaac Bashevis Singer: A Life," a new biography. Mrs. Singer called it "a very difficult and, really, a very terrible decision to make."
Alma's daughter, Inge, never forgave her -- a mother-daughter chasm that is a large part of the story behind Singer's grave. Inge grew up, married Raymond Dujack, now an economist, and settled in the small New Jersey town of Emerson.
In 1964 Inge's father, Mr. Wassermann, died. Inge, who had always loved the nearby Beth-El Cemetery, bought four plots near a tree, and buried her father in one. In 1990, Inge died of cancer at 60 and was buried in front of her father. Her mother, who by this time had been married for half a century to Singer, had not come to see her daughter during her illness. Inge was instead cared for by her friend and next-door neighbor, Leah Feingold.
The following year, Singer was dead. Mrs. Singer, searching for a suitable plot, called Mrs. Feingold, knowing she had been her daughter's friend and knowing that Mrs. Feingold lived close to Beth-El. Would Mrs. Feingold, she asked, select a nice plot for Isaac? And one where there would be room someday for her, too?
"She said she wanted it as close to Inge as possible," Mrs. Feingold said. "She had a lot of guilt about her daughter. A lot of guilt."
So Mrs. Feingold found the grave for the Nobel laureate, which was just three stones away from Walter Wassermann, Alma's ex-husband. "Alma didn't care about that," Mrs. Feingold said.
A miserable time was had by all at the funeral. Israel Zamir, Singer's son from a common-law marriage in Poland, could not fit in the single, crowded limousine and had to beg a ride to his father's burial. In his book, "Journey to My Father," Mr. Zamir wrote that the "Godforsaken place would attract no one," but that if Singer had been buried in Israel, the grave would have been the destination of pilgrimages.
At the unveiling the following year, the family found the "Noble" typo -- and two others on the smaller footstone marking Singer's grave. There, Nobel was spelled wrong, and worse, at least in Mrs. Singer's view, the "h" had been dropped from her husband's middle name.
Mrs. Singer complained to Shastone Memorial Corp. in Great Neck, N.Y., the company that had made the stones. Shastone retorted that Mrs. Singer had specified both the "Noble" and "Basevis" spelling in her original instructions , and produced documents showing her signed approval of blueprints of the stones, with all three mistakes.
"We told her the spelling of Nobel was incorrect," said Arnold Haskel, who was then the owner of Shastone. "She said, 'Do it as I gave it to you.' "
After much mutual fingerpointing, Shastone replaced the footstone with a corrected one in June 1993, at a cost of $430 to the Singer family. (The original is now just inside the door in Shastone's Great Neck showroom, in a place of honor.) "Noble" on the big stone stayed as it was.
Over the years, the mistake gnawed at the family. In 1996, after Alma died, Susan Dujack, Alma's granddaughter and an heir to the estate, called a lawyer. Soon Shastone said they could make the change -- for $625, which Israel Zamir would pay for -- but not without the approval of the two other heirs, Steven Dujack, Alma's grandson, and Klaus Wassermann, Inge's brother. Mr. Wassermann quickly said yes, but Mr. Dujack balked.
"Alma had chosen not to change it," Mr. Dujack said. "Why should I interfere with history? It had happened."
Mr. Dujack then spoke to Ms. Friedman, who reasoned with him. "Isaac," she told him, "would never want his dignity punctured to make a point about humanity."
That settled it. Yesterday in Beth-El, under an overcast sky, a monument engraver, Reed Frankel, knelt near the scruffy crabgrass that edges Singer's grave, and carefully drilled away the past. "I don't want to make a correction," said Mr. Frankel. "I want to make it look like it wasn't a correction. "
Would Singer be amused or annoyed by the fuss? A clue may lie in "The Reencounter."
"Of all my disenchantments," a dead character says, "immortality is the greatest."

Embroidery Industry Loan

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: WEST NEW YORK

 BODY:
Last fall, the state announced a nine-point plan to gird Hudson County's $300-million-a-year embroidery industry against cheaper oversees competitors. Yesterday, the State Economic Development Authority announced the first low-cost loan under the plan.
The $2.1 million privately financed loan will allow Carolace Embroidery of Ridgefield to expand its West New York operation, said Nicole Esposito, a spokeswoman for the agency. 
 The expansion will create 17 new jobs in order to fill a large order from a retailer, Fabri-Centers of America, Ms. Esposito said. The county's embroidery industry, which employs 4,000 people, accounts for 70 percent of the domestic market, but sales have dropped 20 percent in the last 15 years.

HEADLINE: Diverse Strategies Offered As Response to President

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 18

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich, in a speech to the Orphan Foundation of America, outlined 10 steps tonight to improve race relations in the United States. They are excerpted from his prepared text.
1. LEARNING -- Create better opportunities for all children to learn by breaking the stranglehold of the teachers' unions and giving urban parents the financial opportunity to choose the public, private, or parochial school that's best for their children. 
 2. SMALL BUSINESS -- Set a goal of tripling the number of minority-owned small businesses by bringing successful small-business leaders together to identify -- and then eliminate -- the government-imposed barriers to entrepreneurship.
3. URBAN RENEWAL -- Create 100 Renewal Communities in impoverished areas through targeted, pro-growth tax benefits, regulatory relief, low-income scholarships, savings accounts, brownfields clean-up, and home-ownership opportunities.
4. CIVIL RIGHTS -- Clear the existing backlog of discrimination cases at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by enforcing existing civil rights laws, rather than trying to create new ones by regulatory decree.
5. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY -- Make America a country with equal opportunity for all and special privilege for none by treating all individuals as equals before the law and doing away with quotas, preferences and set-asides in Government contracts, hiring, and university admissions.
6. RACIAL CLASSIFICATION -- Break down rigid classifications. A first step could be to add a "multiracial" category to the census and other government forms to begin to phase out the outdated, divisive, and rigid classification of Americans as "blacks" or "whites" or other single races. Ultimately, our goal is to have one classification -- American.
7. HOME OWNERSHIP -- Ease the path toward home ownership by giving local communities and housing authorities the flexibility and authority to more effectively and efficiently house low-income Americans. We must also expand faith-based charities such as Habitat for Humanity, which grow families as well as build homes.
8. VIOLENT CRIME -- Make our cities safe and secure places to live and work through community policing, tougher sentences for violent criminals, and innovative anti-crime programs. Dramatically expand the community-based anti-drug coalition efforts and create a victory plan for the war on drugs.
9. ECONOMIC GROWTH -- Expand economic opportunities for all Americans by promoting continued economic growth with low inflation and rising take-home pay, through tax cuts, tax simplifications, litigation reform, less regulation and overhaul of the burden of government on small business. All in all, for welfare-to-work to be successful, work needs to be available.
10. WELFARE REFORM -- Take the next step in welfare reform by fostering and promoting innovative local job training, welfare-to-work, and entry-level employment programs to move welfare recipients into the work force.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
A Trade Gap Below Forecasts Helps Dollar Rise Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen yesterday on news of a narrower-than-expected trade deficit in April but fell in most other foreign exchange dealings as the mark and pound rallied.
The Commerce Department's report showing an $8.36 billion shortfall in trade was less than the $10 billion widely forecast, and the gap with Japan widened only marginally. 
 Traders bought dollars on the assumption that the deficit would not emerge as a contentious issue at a meeting of the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations, which begins today in Denver.
There had been fears that a major deterioration in the United States trade imbalance might make Washington take steps to push the dollar lower, which would raise the price of Japanese imports and help narrow the shortfall.
"There's less chance now of official rhetoric between U.S. and Japan officials using the dollar as a tool," said Robert Gilmartin, a dollar-yen trader at the First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C.
The dollar reached an intraday high of 114.30 yen on the trade data before settling in New York at 113.98 yen, up from 113.65 yen Wednesday. The dollar fell to 1.7237 marks, down from 1.7333. The pound cost $1.6488, up from $1.6388 and the highest level in a month.
The dollar initially rallied against the yen and mark on the trade data, but traders said the Japanese currency's broad weakness also helped create the basis for a rally in the mark against the yen. As the German currency kept climbing against the yen that set off more mark buying for yen and helped indirectly weaken the dollar against the mark.
"What we really had was a case of the mark strengthening, not the dollar weakening," said Jan Alvarez, senior foreign exchange trader at the Corestates Bank in Philadelphia.
The pound's surge largely reflected a consumer spending boom in Britain, raising the probability of further interest-rate increases by the Bank of England to suppress demand and reduce inflationary pressure. The broadest measure of Britain's money supply rose sharply in May to an annual expansion rate of 11.1 percent, well above the 9 percent maximum in the central bank's target range.

HEADLINE: France's Premier Says Shaky Finances Put a Brake on Jobs Plan

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 19

 BODY:
France's Prime Minister told Parliament today that the country's precarious finances would force him to move cautiously on the job-creation programs he promised during the election campaign last month.
Making his first policy speech in Parliament and asking for a vote of confidence from his leftist coalition majority, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, a Socialist, reaffirmed the intention of France to join the common European currency when it begins in 1999. He said nothing, however, about whether the country would meet the strict limits on budget deficits set for the currency. 
 "The first indications given to me lead me to think that public finances are in a serious state," he said.
Newspapers here reported today that the budget deficit by the end of this year might be as high as 3.8 percent of France's gross domestic product. That would be well above the 3 percent ceiling called for in the European Union Treaty that established the currency project.
Foreign diplomats who heard the speech today said they feared that Mr. Jospin's proposals would set back France even further in its efforts to satisfy criteria for the common currency.
During his campaign, Mr. Jospin said that his first priority would be doing something about the 12.8 percent unemployment rate, not tightening budgetary screws to suit European central bankers. Today he again promised to put jobs first, but told legislators that he would report back to them on the new Government's budget plans only after a more thorough review of the state of the country's finances.
Another campaign pledge, reducing the workweek to 35 hours, from 39, would also take time, he said -- possibly even five years, the term of the new legislature.
As an immediate small step to stimulate economic demand in France, Mr. Jospin announced today that the Government would raise the minimum wage by 4 percent on July 1 to the equivalent of $6.76 an hour.
Mr. Jospin also said that he would call a national jobs conference in September and that the first of the 700,000 jobs for young people he promised during his campaign would be created then.
He promised to raise French Government spending on culture to 1 percent of the budget, and said that the policy of his conservative predecessor as Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, of not hiring replacements for all retiring Government workers, a deficit-cutting measure criticized by public service unions, would be halted immediately.
He even announced that 35,000 people would be hired to help the police patrol the streets and improve public safety, as great a concern in French cities as it is in the United States.
In one major break with French tradition, Mr. Jospin proposed limiting family allowances, payments from public funds to people rich and poor depending on how many children they have. Under his proposal, allowances would go only to families with an income below $50,000 a year, provoking cries of protest in the chamber from opposition conservatives.
Mr. Jospin also said he would not reverse a conservative decision last year to end the French military draft.
But in a major break with conservative policy, he said the new Government would undo changes in French immigration laws that made it difficult for children of foreign immigrants born on French soil to claim citizenship.

HEADLINE: Europeans Have Long Agreed to Disagree

 BODY:

To the Editor:
William Safire ("Waiting for Euro," column, June 18) ridicules the decision-making process of the European Union by citing the contradictory pronouncements of the participants in the Amsterdam summit meeting. 
 Nobody knows whether the euro, the common currency, will come or not, whether it will be strong or weak, whether it will be beneficial or not. However, the habit of putting contradictory positions into agreements is as old as the European Union itself.
The Common Market treaty, which came into force in 1957, stipulated free international trade and the protection of agriculture at the same time, two mutually incompatible aims. The European Union has nevertheless lived with this contradiction for 40 years and has become so successful that it has grown from 6 to 15 members, with a waiting list for more countries to be admitted.
The Common Market was forced together by the threat of the Soviet Union and by the economic preponderance of the United States. Now, as the European Union, it will be condemned to success by global competition.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise Unexpected 8,000

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19

 BODY:
The number of Americans applying for state unemployment insurance rose a surprising 8,000 in the week ending last Saturday to a seasonally adjusted level of 347,000, the Labor Department said today.
The increase in claims was the opposite of analysts' expectations for an 8,000 decline and reflected a continuing moderation in the nation's labor markets. Though employment growth remains robust in the second quarter, economists say it has lost some forward momentum from earlier in the year. 
 Jobless claims, which rose an unrevised 1,000 in the previous week, now stand at the highest level since the May 3 week. The four-week moving average -- a closely watched barometer of labor market conditions -- is also at the highest level since early May. It rose 6,250 in the latest week to 335,5000.

HEADLINE: Nation's Trade Deficit Rose 7.8% in April

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

 BODY:
The nation's foreign trade deficit rose 7.8 percent in April, calling new attention to trade tensions with Japan and China as President Clinton and other world leaders gathered yesterday for a summit meeting in Denver.
The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit in goods and services increased to $8.4 billion in April from a revised $7.8 billion in March. Economists said the biggest surprise was that American exports kept growing at a record pace in April, keeping the deficit from swelling more. 
 But the latest numbers also showed that America's trade balances with Japan and China "just keep deteriorating," said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at First Union Corporation.
President Clinton was expected to bring up the trade frictions with the Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan, and other leaders in discussions this weekend.
The tensions with Japan over trade had eased in 1995 and the first half of 1996, but they have returned in recent months as the Japanese have started pouring out exports again, bolstered by a weaker yen, to rev up their economy.
America's deficit with Japan, the difference in the value of imports and exports, increased 5.1 percent in April to $4.8 billion, the highest monthly total since last October, the Commerce Department said.
That also was America's highest deficit with any country, with China following not far behind. The United States' trade gap with China jumped 33.3 percent in April to $3.5 billion from $2.6 billion in March.
In fact, Japan and China have alternated recently at the top of the list of countries that have a surplus in trade with the United States, and in April about 60 percent of the total deficit in goods and services came from trade with those two countries.
"That really brings the whole problem into focus," Mr. Naroff said. "Yeah, we have a trade deficit. But we basically have a trade deficit with two countries."
The rise in the deficit with Japan has led to renewed calls from Washington that it open its markets further to American goods and services. The sharp increase in the deficit with China is likely to give ammunition to some in Congress who oppose renewing its status as a most-favored trading partner.
While Americans bought $51.5 billion of Chinese goods last year, they sold just $12 billion worth of products to China, meaning there was a $39.5 billion deficit. Some analysts believe this deficit could top $50 billion in 1997.
Still, economists said there was some good news in yesterday's Commerce Department report. In most other parts of the world, American exports "are back in force," said Michael P. Niemira, a vice president and senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. He said that reflected a strength in American manufacturing and "basically a pretty good picture for the economy."
Total exports of goods and services had surged in March to a record $78.2 billion, and some analysts thought that might cap several years worth of growth. But exports edged up even more in April, by two-tenths of 1 percent, to $78.4 billion.
That offset some of an expected nine-tenths of 1 percent rise in imports, which climbed to $86.7 billion as Americans bought more computer parts, toys, apparel and pharmaceuticals from overseas. Declining oil prices, the lowest in a year, also helped restrain the increase in the value of imports even as the volume of oil imports jumped by 6.8 percent.
Still, Mr. Niemira cautioned that the growth in exports could slow soon. He said his bank's surveys of trade executives showed that they had been expecting only gradual gains, and not the sharp pickup that occurred in March and April.
One other improvement in April came in North American trade, the Commerce Department report showed. While the United States continued to run deficits with Canada and Mexico, both narrowed, buoyed by strong export sales.
The deficit with Canada declined by 26.3 percent, to $970 million, the lowest in two years. The gap with Mexico dropped by 5 percent, to $1.4 billion.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department also announced that the overall current account deficit, which includes trade in goods and services as well as flows of investment capital, totaled $148.2 billion in 1996. That was down from an earlier estimate of $165.1 billion. But it was also the second-largest gap ever, after $168.1 billion in 1987.
The department also said that by this measure, the broadest way to account for foreign trade, the deficit totaled $41 billion in the first quarter of 1997. That compared with a revised total of $36.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 1996.

HEADLINE: Willard Hurst, 86, Legal Scholar And Pioneer in History of Law

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
J. Willard Hurst, professor emeritus of the University of Wisconsin Law School and internationally recognized as the dean of American legal historians, died on Wednesday at his home in Madison, Wis. He was 86.
The cause was cancer of the larynx, said his wife, Frances. 
 In linking law and social history in his studies, Professor Hurst broke with a school of thought in which law was regarded as a self-contained society and the law library as its laboratory. How the law actually affected people or how legal institutions evolved was ignored in favor of the study of appellate decisions, according to that thought.
In 1937, after clerking at the Supreme Court, he joined the Wisconsin law school faculty and was urged to create a program in law and society, to examine the cross-pollination between Wisconsin's legal system and economy. In the 20-year study that laid the base for his seminal work, "Law and Economic Growth," published in 1964, Professor Hurst focused on the state's lumber industry.
His work illuminated the underlying social and economic forces involved in the exploitation of the state's forests and determined how the industry both used and shaped laws of property, contracts, banking, transportation, accident compensation and other relationships.
"Willard Hurst is renowned in this country and abroad as the founder of the field of legal history," said Shirley Abrahamson, the Chief Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court and a former student.
James Willard Hurst was born in Rockford, Ill. He received a bachelor's degree in 1932 from Williams College and a law degree in 1935 from Harvard University, where he graduated at the top of his class and edited The Harvard Law Review.
He then became a research fellow for Felix Frankfurter, a professor at Harvard at the time and later Justice of the Supreme Court, and in 1936 became a clerk for Justice Louis D. Brandeis.
In 1967, Professor Hurst received a master's degree from Cambridge University, where he was the Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions and fellow of Trinity Hall in 1967-68. He was also a visiting professor at Northwestern University, Stanford University, the University of Utah and the University of Florida. He retired in 1980.
Besides contributing to law reviews and other publications, Professor Hurst wrote over a dozen books, among them "The Law Makers" (1950), "Law and the Conditions of Freedom" (1956), "Law and Social Process in U.S. History" (1960), "Justice Holmes on Legal History" (1964) and "A Legal History of Money in the United States" (1973).
He is survived by his wife, the former Frances Wilson; a son, Thomas Robert, a professor of law at the University of Florida; a daughter, Dr. Deborah Hurst of Berkeley, Calif., and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Price of 30-Year Bond Edges Up as Yield Stays at 6.68%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities bounced around yesterday in choppy trading before finishing slightly higher. The market fell early in the day on fears that signs of strength in the economy would lead to inflation, but it later recovered.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 3/32 , to 99 11/32 , keeping the yield at 6.68 percent, unchanged from Wednesday. 
 Among the reports that alarmed investors early was one from the Philadelphia branch of the Federal Reserve. The bank's manufacturing survey, one of the earliest indicators of the economy's state in June, suggested a pickup in business activity, with its index rising to 25.2 points from 1.6 in May.
But counteracting the effects of that number was a report showing that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose somewhat unexpectedly in the latest week, by 8,000, to 347,000. Together with some other recent numbers, that suggested a possible moderation in the labor market, which had been gaining strength.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the economic statistics released this week solidified the case for no change in interest rates when the Fed's Open Market Committee meets in early July.
"Without question, it would be difficult for the Fed to tighten pre-emptively while inflation is still declining and aggregate demand shows signs of slackening," Mr. Fine said. He pointed to other recent reports -- including one showing weakness in housing starts during May and one showing strength in industrial production last month -- as painting an unclear picture.
Further readings on the economy will be provided by a smattering of statistics next week as the F.O.M.C. meeting approaches.
Some analysts said they thought the bond market was at or near the top of its current range. But Mr. Fine saw positive signs for the future.
For example, he pointed to the widening of the United States trade deficit, reported yesterday, which added further evidence that the gap for the year will be bigger than the Federal budget deficit. That implies that foreign buyers, whose purchases of Treasury bonds are included in the trade balance, have been active buyers in the market and will continue to bolster it, he said.
At the Treasury's auction of $13 billion in new one-year bills yesterday, the average rate at auction was 5.35 percent, down from 5.55 percent last month and the lowest since 5.34 percent on Jan. 30. Next week, the Treasury will auction new two- and five-year notes. In when-issued trading ahead of those sales, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.01 percent, and the five year at a price to yield 6.28 percent.
With rates the lowest in months, debt issuance is up. The Philippine central bank yesterday priced $500 million in bonds through Salomon Brothers. It is the first international bond sale by the Philippines. Two months ago it tried unsuccessfully to sell a larger amount, $1.25 billion, but borrowing rates are now lower, making it less costly for the Philippines to come to market.
Taking advantage of declining rates, the central bank sold $400 million of 30-year bonds at a price to yield 8.609 percent, or 184.9-hundredths of a percentage point more than a 30-year United States Treasury bond. It also sold $100 million of a 100-year bond at a price to yield 8.735 percent, or 197.5-hundredths more than a long United States Treasury bond.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new 52-week bill:

HEADLINE: Stocks Regain Steam as Dow Jumps 58.35

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market roared back to life yesterday, sending all the major indexes back into record territory.
After suffering through a technology selloff on Wednesday, investors surged back into the market and went on a late afternoon buying spree. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average overcame a slow start to gain 58.35 points and close at 7,777.06, just five points off its record high.
And the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 14.71 points, or 1 percent, to close at a record 1,447.14.
Early in the day, there were some renewed concerns about inflation after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that factory production in its region had risen for the sixth consecutive month in June.
But investors, increasingly confident about an economy that is strong but not yet inflationary, were not discouraged for long.
"We're a very resilient market," said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. "There's so much money coming in that even when stocks break, there's a tendency to buy them back. And in the final analysis, a bull market doesn't stop cold in its tracks."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, with more than 537 million shares trading hands. And winners outnumbered losers by better than 2 to 1.
Since mid-April, the market has been soothed by good news about inflation and falling interest rates. As a result, stock prices have surged, with investors pouring billions of dollars into stock mutual funds.
And unlike July 1996, when technology stocks suffered huge losses after several companies warned of slowing earnings, this year the sector has been able to bounce back strongly from similar warnings.
Yesterday, the Morgan Stanley high tech index rose 5.48 points, or 1.1 percent, to 436.16. A day earlier, the market had slumped on news that Seagate Technology, among others, was forecasting slower growth.
Among the technology issues gaining yesterday were Cisco Systems, up 2 points, to 69, and Tellabs Inc., up 3 7/8, to 56 7/8. Shares of Tellabs, which makes voice and data transport and network systems, are up 51 percent this year.
The market also benefited from strong tobacco shares, which rose on expectations that there could be a settlement regarding health-related lawsuits. Some investors believe that could relieve the industry of some of the uncertainty surrounding future profits.
RJR Nabisco, whose subsidiary produces Camel cigarettes, rose 1 3/8, to 35 7/8. Philip Morris, the nation's leading cigarette maker, rose 1 1/2, to 47 1/2, a 52-week high.
But the day's best performers were drug stocks. The American Stock Exchange pharmaceuticals index soared nearly 3 percent yesterday, well ahead of the market, to 476.53.
Merck, a Dow component stock, rose 3 3/8, to 99 3/4. Pfizer was up 4 1/8, to 112 1/2. And Warner-Lambert surged 6 7/8, to 112 3/4. The Dow was led by Procter & Gamble, which rose 3 3/8, to 142 1/8.
William Paternotte, a market analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, said that investors continued to favor blue chips over smaller company stocks, largely because the multinational companies have had superior earnings performance this year.
"Those stocks are already highly valued compared to the rest of the market," he said. "But money keeps pouring into them."

HEADLINE: Golden Arches Are Victorious, But Bloodied, in a British Court

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 19

 BODY:
McDonald's has had more than its fair share of grief lately: hamburger sales are down, hackers are spreading nasty tales through the Internet, and the company's 55-cent burger campaign in its native United States fell flat.
Today the company had some good news. After the longest trial in British history, a judge in a libel case ruled that McDonald's does not destroy the world's rain forests, discriminate against employees or poison its customers. 
 But the $96,000 judgment the judge issued, after the company had spent millions in legal fees to defend its reputation, was a decidedly Pyrrhic victory.
After two and a half years of testimony, the judge agreed with the claim of two anti-McDonald's activists that the company is cruel to animals, that it exploited children in its advertising and that its low wages in Britain tended to depress salaries in the fast-food industry.
The case, which came to be known as the McLibel trial, was undoubtedly something of a nadir in the hamburger chain's public relations history.
The defendants, Helen Steel and Dave Morris, were respectively a part-time bartender and an unemployed ex-mailman, and the sight of the multi-billion dollar corporation hauling them into court provoked innumerable stories about Goliath taking on David.
Ms. Steel and Mr. Morris were sued for libel after they helped distribute a detailed pamphlet attacking McDonald's some eight years ago.
In summarizing his exhaustive decision, which filled three hefty volumes, Justice Rodger Bell said that while some of the defendants' assertions -- touching on everything from the sorry living conditions of the company's future Chicken McNuggets to the fat and salt content of a Big Mac and fries -- were true, the preponderance were, in fact, false.
Accordingly, he said, Mr. Morris and Ms. Steel had harmed the reputation of the McDonald's chain and were liable for the damages.
McDonald's said today that it was "broadly satisfied" with the judgment.
"For the sake of our employees and our customers, we wanted to show these serious allegations to be false, and I am pleased that we have done so," said Paul Preston, chairman and chief executive of McDonald's in Britain.
But Michael Mansfield, a lawyer who has been advising Ms. Steel and Mr. Morris, called the result "a major victory" for the defendants, who are known in the anti-McDonald's movement as the McLibel 2.
"They have dared to tread where no others have dared to tread, where those with resources have not dared to go, to raise issues that matter to us all," Mr. Mansfield said, speaking of Mr. Morris and Ms. Steel at a raucous news conference attended by many people waving signs saying things like "We will not be silenced."
The case dates to the late 1980's, when Ms. Steel joined London Greenpeace, an informal group that campaigns for a range of social issues and is not connected to the international Greenpeace organization. In 1989 and 1990, London Greenpeace distributed the pamphlet in question, "What's Wrong with McDonald's," which made seven broad charges against the company.
McDonald's, which is well-known for being fiercely protective of its reputation, was decidedly displeased and sued five members of the groupfor libel. Three said they were sorry and would not do it again; Mr. Morris and Ms. Steel decided to fight on.
The trial began in June 1994, with McDonald's represented by a top-drawer lawyer in wig and gown, and Mr. Morris and Ms. Steel representing themselves, in jeans and sweat shirts.
Under British law, the burden of proof is on the defendants to show that their statements are true. This meant that Mr. Morris and Ms. Steel had to call experts in nutrition, in deforestation and in employment practices, among other things, in an effort to prove the veracity of even the most far-reaching generalizations in their pamphlet.
With no legal experience and no free time, the defendants held strategy meetings on the subway each day and turned to a motley group of vegetarians, environmentalists, libertarians and animal-rights campaigners around the world for both moral and substantive support.
An anti-McDonald's site was set up on the World Wide Web, so that an expanded version of the pamphlet that so upset McDonald's became available to anyone with a computer and a modem.
By the end of the case, the court had heard from 180 witnesses, sat for 313 days over two and a half years and generated 60,000 pages of transcripts and other documents.
At a news conference, Mr. Preston said that McDonald's had "no intention of bankrupting" Mr. Morris or Ms. Steel by demanding the $96,000 if the two could not afford to pay it. And, when asked whether he thought McDonald's reputation had been hurt by the case and the attendant publicity, Mr. Preston said he did not.
"I think our reputation is valuable," he said, "and it is something you must be willing to stand up and protect."

HEADLINE: In Denver for Economic Talks, Clinton Calls for Freer Trade

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: LITTLETON, Colo., June 19

 BODY:
On the eve of an economic summit meeting of eight nations in Denver, President Clinton chided critics of his free-trade policies in a speech in this suburb today and called on Congress to give him greater flexibility in negotiating trade agreements with Latin American countries like Argentina, Brazil and Chile.
He also urged Congress not to revoke China's trading privileges with the United States, in a vote on its so-called most favored nation status that is scheduled for next week. 
 Basking in the strength of the United States economy, Mr. Clinton ticked off a series of rosy economic indicators that he said demonstrated the virtue of his policies. He swatted aside criticism of free trade, which is heard from such influential members of his own party as the House minority leader, Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
"Protectionism is simply not an option because globalization is irreversible," Mr. Clinton said. "If we try to close up our economy, we will only hurt ourselves."
He added: "It seems to me difficult to imagine that this is even a serious debate now."
Mr. Clinton arrived in Denver today to serve as host for the "Summit of the Eight," the international conference known as the Group of Seven before Russia this year was admitted to all but one of the meetings.
In a bid for support for his China trade policy, Mr. Clinton sent a letter today to Representative Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, in which he pledged to increase broadcasts into China by the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. He said that he would seek to have the broadcasts extended to 24 hours a day, and diversified to include more dialects to reach more Chinese.
Tonight, another influential conservative, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said tonight that he would support retaining China's trade status.
"We must recognize free trade as a basic human right," Mr. Armey said in a speech at Johns Hopkins University's School for Advanced International Studies in Washington. He said he would like to oppose China's trading privilege to express his "deep repugnance" for Beijing, but that trade relations offer "the best prospect for liberating" the Chinese.
Mr. Clinton hailed Denver today as an avatar of American economic transformation, calling it a city that "once drew its wealth from mine shafts and factories and the land," but was now "thriving on telecommunications, aerospace, banking, computer software, and the magnificence of its environment."
To underscore his point, Mr. Clinton spoke before a crowd of hundreds seated in a baking parking lot outside the National Digital Television Center, which beams movies and other programs to satellites for cable systems around the country. Behind him stood a a thicket of satellite dishes, tilted skyward and ranging in size from that of a large pizza to 30 feet. To the west, the jagged Rockies gleamed white in the sun.
Mr. Clinton made a pitch for so-called "fast track authority," saying it would allow him to "go and negotiate a trade agreement with Chile or with Argentina or with Brazil." Congress would then have to vote for or against the treaty, but would be unable to amend it. Latin American nations have said they would refuse to negotiate if Congress had the power to reopen agreements after the Administration finished talking.
"We have nothing to fear from these countries," Mr. Clinton continued. "They are our partners in democracy. They are our partners in opportunity."
On the subject of trading disputes with another major partner, Mr. Clinton said today that the Administration had made progress in long-running negotiations over how Japan would deregulate important sectors of its economy, including telecommunications and medical equipment.
Today the two nations agreed to would meet more frequently on how the Japanese would deregulate those specific areas of their market. Mr. Clinton's aides said that American officials would have an advisory role in the Japanese deregulation. But before meeting with Mr. Clinton here this afternoon, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan rejected that view, saying the Americans would have no "advisory role."
"We have no intention of being supervised," he said. But Administration officials said later that during his meeting with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Hashimoto said he would welcome American advice.
Dan Tarullo, the Assistant to the President for International Economics, said that during the meeting Mr. Clinton "voiced quite specific concerns" about the rising American trade deficit with Japan.
While he repeatedly touted the American economy as the world's leader today, President Clinton acknowledged that in some ways, the United States lagged behind.
"To be fair, a lot of countries have more generous benefits for child care than we do," he said. "They cover all their children with health care, and we're going to cover half of those without insurance in this budget agreement. And I won't rest until we finish the job."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Whoever Came to Bat, Interleague Play Proved a Big Hit

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Stan Javier hit three home runs against American League pitchers after not having hit a home run all season against National League pitchers. Rickey Henderson and Tony Phillips each hit a home run playing designated hitter in one of the first games involving the N.L. and the d.h. In a game in which A.L. pitchers had to hit, Matt Stairs batted for a pitcher in the seventh inning, got a hit, stayed in the game and stroked two more hits.
But the long anticipated batting game of "can you top this" between Barry Bonds and Ken Griffey Jr. was a dud. 
 Three sellout crowds saw the Yankees play a scintillating series against the Mets. Chicago fans belatedly woke up, filled the stands twice and were equally enthralled watching the White Sox and the Cubs. The Pittsburgh Pirates experienced a 115 percent increase in their average attendance. But the Minnesota Twins and the San Diego Padres fell embarrassingly flat in their quest for economic and esthetic riches.
Major League Baseball's first attempt at interleague play did not deliver 100 percent of what it promised, but is 98 percent so bad?
It even enabled history to be made. In the Wednesday night game between the Anaheim Angels and the Dodgers in Los Angeles, two Japanese pitchers were in a game at the same time for the first time in a major league game in the United States. Hideo Nomo had started for the Dodgers and was still in the game when Shigetoshi Hasegawa relieved for the Angels in the sixth inning.
The only real blight on the interleague landscape cropped up in Milwaukee, where Bud Selig, owner of the Brewers and acting commissioner, tried to imitate Nolan Ryan but flung the ceremonial first ball somewhere in the direction of Green Bay instead of home plate.
"When I was 15 or 16," Selig said by telephone from Milwaukee yesterday, "I knew if I was going to have a career in baseball, it wasn't going to be on the field."
The Brewers, however, overcame Selig's foray into fantasy land, swept the St. Louis Cardinals and drew nearly double the average number of fans for each game as they had attracted for those mundane intraleague games.
Of all of the figures that emerged from the first round of interleague games, the most dramatic was attendance. The 84 games drew 2,933,407, an average of 34,922 that was 35 percent over the average of 25,851 for all previous games.
The Seattle Mariners drew the most fans, 208,387 for four games, while the Yankees had the highest average, 56,240, for their three games with the Mets.
"This is good for the game and good for New York especially," said Joe McIlvaine, the Mets' general manager, who was delighted with the experience despite his team's two losses. "Look at the crowds, look at the enthusiasm. Baseball in New York was hit harder by the strike than just about any other city. People here love their baseball. A lot of people felt betrayed. They want to come back to baseball. They want to love the game. This series certainly hasn't hurt that."
Chicago fans were slow in embracing the all-city series at Comiskey Park. One theory was that the fans resented the White Sox attempt to shove a multigame ticket package at them. In the end, though, they could not stay away and filled Comiskey for the last two games.
Most stunning, though, was the reception interleague play received in Pittsburgh, where 108,536 turned out for three games with the Kansas City Royals. A common explanation was that the fans went to see two former Pirates, Jay Bell and Jeff King. But countering that view was the one that said the fans didn't go to Three Rivers Stadium to see Bell and King when they were there as Pirates.
Only two teams, the Twins and the Padres, drew crowds that averaged fewer fans than the pre-interleague attendance.
Speaking of the Twins' average of 15,530 for their series with the Pirates, Terry Ryan, the team's general manager, said: "I'm going to attribute that to a lot of the uncertainty of the future of this club in this market. It's not who we played, it's not interleague play. I don't know if we had brought the Cubs or the Cardinals here it would have been any different. I thought we'd be in the 20's, but it didn't happen. People don't know if we're going to be here or not. People are thinking we're a lame duck franchise."
But when the Twins played in Houston, Ryan added, "There was a different energy to our club. Our players enjoyed it."
Two players, Bonds and Griffey, were unable to produce the fireworks expected when the Giants played the Seattle Mariners twice in San Francisco. They each got one hit in each game and did not hit a home run or drive in a run between them.
A Bonds teammate, on the other other hand, produced enough for both of them. Javier had not hit a homer in 129 at-bats this season and only two in 403 at-bats this season and last, but he hit three in 21 times at bat in six interleague games.
On the first day of the interleague schedule, Henderson, the d.h., for San Diego, and Phillips, the d.h. for Anaheim, each hit a home run. Last Tuesday, with the Athletics playing in San Diego and their pitchers hitting, Stairs batted for Dane Johnson in the seventh inning and singled. He remained in the game as the right fielder and added two singles in the nine-inning game.
The hottest hitter in the week-long span of games was Rusty Greer of Texas, who batted .591. Mike Piazza of Los Angeles took advantage of the d.h. rule to rest his weary catcher's body for a couple of games, found his bat rejuvenated and hit .542. King drove in the most runs, 12, and tied Eric Karros, Piazza's teammate, for most homers with four. Mike Stanton, the Yankees' reliever, emerged with the most victories, two.
American League teams won 48 games, the National 36. More games were played at A.L. parks, but A.L. teams prevailed in N.L. parks, too, winning 20 of 38 games. The outcome of East and West Division games was close, 16-14 for the A.L. East and 13-11 for the A.L. West, but the A.L. Central clobbered its N.L. brethern, 19-11.
A.L. designated hitters outhit their N.L. counterparts, .253 to .238, and N.L. pitchers outhit the neophyte A.L. pitchers, .169 to .108.
Omar Olivares of Detroit had the most productive game among A.L. hitting pitchers, rapping a triple and a single against Montreal. But he lost that game. When he pitched against Florida, he didn't bat because the game was in Detroit, and he won.
Probably the greatest indignity suffered because of the N.L.'s use of the d.h. was the 1-0 decision Jimmy Key and the Baltimore Orioles lost to the Expos. The run was a home run by Sherman Obando, the Expos' designated hitter. The outcome also made the Orioles a series loser at home for the first time this season.
Win or lose, it seemed, players enjoyed the experience.
"I know there are some valid arguments against interleague play," David Cone said, "but as a player you have to love facing the best players in the other league, the best players in baseball. It was tremendously exciting to be able to go to Miami and face Gary Sheffield. To be able to face Todd Hundley or John Olerud again, is such a unique opportunity."
Don Baylor, the Colorado manager, said he saw a lot baseballs going back and forth. "Guys were signing balls for each other," he said. "It's good where guys admire guys who play in the other league and never get a chance to see them play."

HEADLINE: U.S., Lauding Its Economy, Finds No Summit Followers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: DENVER, June 19

 BODY:
It may not be polite to gloat about your good fortune in front of your guests. Nonetheless, as President Clinton and his economic team prepare to open the annual summit meeting of major industrial nations, which starts here on Friday, they just cannot resist.
"We host our partners at a time when America's economy is the healthiest in a generation and the strongest in the world," Mr. Clinton said today. He boasted of "a new American approach" to managing the economy, a strategy that he maintained "enabled us to move earlier and more strongly than most other nations into the new global economy." 
 Others in his Administration are using even stronger language. The Deputy Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, described the United States the other day as "the world's only economic superpower" -- a proclamation that grates on Japanese ears -- and "the world's most flexible and dynamic economy." He suggested that other nations "have things to learn from us."
Perhaps so, but the lessons of the American boom of the 1990's are not exactly resonating around the globe. While the leaders arriving here this afternoon may envy the recent performance of the United States economy, few of them are rushing to emulate all the elements of Mr. Clinton's "American approach," which he spelled out in a speech today. [Page A10.]
In fact, the unstated message from the Denver summit meeting may be quite the opposite: The French already made their views quite clear in elections this month, rejecting the deficit cutting, the corporate downsizing and the thinning of social safety nets that were all key elements of the rebound Mr. Clinton is touting here.
Now all of Europe is debating whether it can tolerate the kind of austerity and corporate bloodletting that the world's financial markets increasingly demand around the world -- and that they richly rewarded here.
"Just a few months ago the consensus among the world's leaders seemed to be that there was a right way to guide your economy, and it looked like the American way," said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International and a veteran of the delicate pirouettes that countries perform at these meetings to create the illusion of common strategy.
"The consensus that we thought was universal among leaders turns out not to be shared by voters," Mr. Hormats said. "We are coming to the limits of the political acceptance of these approaches."
Mr. Clinton alluded to that quandary this afternoon, declaring: "Now, all the countries in the world face the same choices we do. They're having to decide, can they reduce their deficit and still invest in their people, can they target people programs, can they maintain a social safety net."
Clearly Mr. Clinton intends to use this meeting to push them along. He announced a mini-program with Japan to send American experts to advise Tokyo on deregulating key segments of its economy -- though Japanese officials bridled today at suggestions that they needed American advisers.
The President also argued today that other nations had to break out of what he called "old thinking" about the trade-offs between deficit reduction and spending on worker retraining and other social investments.
But the fact is that none of the leaders of those nations -- with the possible exception of Tony Blair, the new British Prime Minister -- seem eager to sit still for such lectures.
While the jobless rate in the United States shrank to 4.8 percent last month, unemployment in Germany is over 11 percent, and it is over 12 percent in France and Italy. Russia's economy, whose condition is always impossible to measure accurately, appears to have actually shrunk in the last six months. And the economic policy makers in all those countries point out that precisely the factors that make the United States economy so dynamic -- the globalization of businesses, rapid-fire technological innovation, brutal cost cutting -- are the same forces that create enormous insecurity in the workforces accustomed to stability.
"I think there is a sense around the world that the steps that worked in America do not easily translate into other cultures," said Park Ungsuh, the president of the Samsung Economic Research Institute, which is owned by the South Korean electronics giant.
Dr. Park, who is a frequent economic adviser to President Kim Young Sam, noted that as South Korea has struggled with its own competitive woes in recent years, it may have looked to the United States but not adopted many of its solutions wholesale.
"South Koreans would not stand for that kind of economic instability," he said.
Or as one senior European Union official said recently, "It's a bit arrogant of the Americans to assume that what works in Illinois will work in Frankfurt."
Clearly there is plenty for Mr. Clinton to celebrate: the lowest unemployment in a quarter-century, the best inflation numbers in almost as long. That alone changes the dynamics of this meeting.
Summit conferences were rarely happy events for Washington in the late 1980's and early 90's. The Japanese usually delivered a stock lecture about the evils of large budget deficits, which they said pushed up interest rates and dragged down America's trading partners. "When I first came to Washington, what you'd hear at summit meetings is that we were yesterday's economy," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin noted the other day.
During the review of American economic conditions that is part of every summit meeting, Mr. Rubin plans to make the point that this year the Federal budget deficit may drop to 1 percent of gross domestic product. Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan will be arriving with one of the largest deficits: nearly 7 percent of the country's G.D.P., what Japan's Government spokesman called the other day "a record budget deficit" that seems likely to force a 10 percent reduction in the country's foreign aid budget, among other cuts.
So will the United States be dusting off some of the old lectures it received so often at past meetings?
"I'm tempted," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers said the other day, "very, very tempted."
Perhaps the most interesting encounters will be between Mr. Clinton and the leaders of the European Union, whose leaders have spent the week in Amsterdam trying to patch up differences with the French that are making their single currency project look more fragile than ever.
The new French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, a Socialist, came to office pledging to create 350,000 state-financed jobs, to cut the workweek to 35 hours from 39 without a commensurate loss of pay, and to resist the sale of state-owned companies, which would presumably shrink once they were privatized.
All of those run counter to the American model of cutting deficits to free up capital for entrepreneurship, venture capital and new technology. To paper over the differences with France, the European Union on Monday came up with some vague wording about job creation.
Even Germany, the economic disciplinarian of Europe, attempted a bookkeeping gimmick -- revaluing its gold supplies -- to keep from making painful budget cuts needed to meet the requirements of joining the European Monetary Union. That failed, and now Germany's embattled Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, is facing such a political crisis at home that he is taking the rare step of not showing up at the Denver meeting.
None of this will break out into the open, of course. The economic communique was precooked weeks ago, stuffed with the usual bland pronouncements that create the illusion of unanimity.
Mr. Rubin has made it clear several times this week that the United States plans to stay out of Europe's debate over the euro.
But in the private meetings that take place on the fringes of the summit talks, there will probably be some subtle reminders that the markets would punish countries that waver from the deficit-cutting path. Hardly a week passes without seeing Mr. Rubin make the point that the markets surged in the United States in response to "a deficit-reduction plan that investors came to view as very serious."
The question looming over this conference is whether the retreat from Mr. Rubin's prescriptions is a fundamental change, or just a temporary setback.
"There are people in every country, our own included, who want to turn their backs on reality," Mr. Rubin said. "But we're talking here about fundamental pressures, fundamental movements that no country can insulate itself from.
"The real lesson is that if you don't have the fiscal discipline you need, you pay a price. That message may take a long while for people to understand."

HEADLINE: Whitman and Legislators Plan $16.8 Billion Budget

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 19

 BODY:
After three years of cutting taxes and reining in government spending, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Republican legislative leaders agreed today on a $16.8 billion election-year budget that increases spending for public schools, state colleges, child protection workers and municipalities struggling to pay for school construction projects.
In contrast to last year's budget, which included cuts at almost every state agency, the new budget would increase spending by more than a half-billion dollars. The total is $260 million more than the proposed budget that Governor Whitman unveiled in January, in which she included additional money for more than a dozen modest initiatives attractive to Democratic and swing voters, like increasing the number of openings for children in state-subsidized day care. 
 The boom on Wall Street and a thriving state economy are largely responsible for making the new spending possible. The state expects at least $600 million more than anticipated in January from tax revenues pouring into the state's coffers. The Whitman administration was also able to win legislative approval earlier this month for its pension borrowing proposal, which allows the state to skip this year's $590 million scheduled pension payment.
Once the plan to borrow $2.75 billion for the pension system was passed, there was little wrangling during the budget negotiations between the Governor's staff and the Republican-controlled Legislature. The budget for the new fiscal year, starting July 1, is expected to be signed into law next week, while the New York State budget is more than two months overdue.
Under the agreement, the new New Jersey budget meets the State Supreme Court's order last month that the state spend $246 million more to end the disparity between the state's poorest and richest school districts. This is in addition to the $286 million increase in school spending that was included in the Governor's proposed budget in January.
The extra tax revenues and the pension borrowing also helped provide more money than Governor Whitman had originally budgeted for state colleges, school construction and the troubled State Division of Youth and Family Services.
To keep down threatened college tuition increases, the new budget includes $29 million more for community colleges and state colleges and universities. The Legislature added $25 million to help school districts pay off their loans on construction projects and $18 million to hire 175 workers to improve the monitoring of cases involving allegations of child abuse and neglect.
State lawmakers predicted earlier this week that the new budget would reach $17 billion. But Republican leaders and Governor Whitman rejected several other spending proposals, including a $55 million plan to provide new child-care tax credits to about 150,000 middle-class families, out of concern that they would jeopardize their standing as fiscal conservatives with voters.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Affordable Apartments Open Way for Financing

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A 33-story mixed-income apartment tower rising on a plot running from 42d to 43d Street between 10th and 11th Avenues underscores both the city's hearty rental market and continued developer interest in the so-called "80-20" method of tax-exempt financing, in which some apartments are leased to low-income tenants.
When completed by year's end, the building, whose entrance will be at 530 West 43d Street, will have 375 studio to two-bedroom apartments. It will also have 3,700 square feet of ground-level retail space fronting 42d Street. 
 Eighty percent of the rentals, averaging 400 to 950 square feet, will be leased at market rates. The remaining 20 percent will be made available to tenants whose annual income is $14,000 to $24,500, depending on family size. The $55 million project is being developed by the Gotham Organization, which is based in Manhattan. It owns the building through a subsidiary in partnership with the housing arm of Sun America, the Los Angeles insurer. It marks Gotham's return to building market-rate housing after a seven-year absence.
Gotham bought the vacant midblock site, which extends from 43d Street through to 42d Street and was once the location of a piano factory, in 1994 from a subsidiary of Chemical Bank. Gotham paid $2.5 million, which David L. Picket, its executive vice president, said "makes the economics of the project work." But he said his company waited until financing opened up to build it.
In return for keeping 20 percent of the rentals affordable to low-income tenants, the city or state issues tax-exempt bonds to provide permanent financing to builders, who are also eligible for a 20-year property-tax abatement from the city.
The program remains a primary financing vehicle, indicating the reliance of new construction on public benefits.
"The market is stronger and hotter and financing has loosened up to an extent," said Alan H. Wiener, chairman of American Property Financing, a lending and real estate consulting firm in Manhattan. "But the reliance on this program has not abated because on large sites in areas that have not seen development in a number of years lenders won't go in without the abatement and tax-exempting financing."
Gotham's project received $55 million in bond financing from the city's Housing Development Corporation. The developer also secured a letter of credit from Fleet Bank and Dime Savings Bank -- a requirement of the program to protect bond holders against default. Gotham and Sun also financed $18 million internally. This is the third mixed-income rental Gotham has built in Manhattan.
With the economy and housing market strengthening and with the 42nd Street redevelopment taking place, it is also a good time to build, Mr. Picket said.
Those factors, along with the availability of development sites, has helped restart the area's revival, which began in the last decade but was halted by the recession. Seven residential projects, many conceived during the mid-80's building boom but never built and now rekindled by new owners, are under way or planned in the area. The projects could produce a total of 3,200 apartments, many of them mixed-income rentals, according to data from Community Board 4, which guides the neighborhood's growth.
"There is no question the Clinton area is being developed," said JoAnn Macy, chairwoman of Community Board 4. "What we've always been interested in is controlled growth and encouraging housing for a mix of incomes, ages and professions, which Clinton has always had."
Despite the competition "there are no signs demand for rentals is not there," Mr. Picket said.
Rents continue to rise, said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a rental brokerage firm in Manhattan. In a preliminary midyear market survey, her firm estimates that average rents for all sizes of apartments on the Upper East and West Sides rose by 6.64 percent since the end of 1996. For example, the average rent for two-bedroom apartments in 24-hour doorman buildings in the two neighborhoods is $3,738.
"This rise is being reflected throughout the Manhattan rental market," Ms. Packes said.
Gotham's building, designed by the Manhattan firm of Schuman Lichenstein Claman & Efron, will have a masonry facade with a granite and limestone base. Stephen Alton Architects is designing the common areas in the building where the apartments will have floor-to-ceiling windows. Planned amenities include a health club, children's play area and a sun deck.
Monthly rents for the market-rate apartments have not been set. But Mr. Picket said they would be competitive to those in the area, which Feathered Nest put at $1,350 for studios to $2,800 for two-bedroom apartments. Rents for the low-income units will be about $303 to $496. Leasing will begin in December, Mr. Picket said.

U.S. Trade Deficit Grows, But Exports Stay Strong
The trade deficit rose 7.8 percent in April, calling new attention to tensions with Japan and China as world leaders gathered for a summit meeting in Denver, left. 
 But economists said they were surprised by a continuing surge in exports, which kept the deficit from swelling more. [Page D4.]
 
Indeed, President Clinton focused on the importance of exports in a speech, chiding critics of his free-trade policies and asking Congress to give him more flexibility in trade negotiations with Latin America. [A10.]
 
In preparing for the meeting, the President and his economic team have been unable to resist gloating about America's good fortune. But few other countries are rushing to emulate the United States' approach. [A1.]
 
Murdoch in Sports Investment
Fox Sports Net, a joint venture of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Liberty Media, is expected to invest $850 million for 40 percent of Rainbow Programming, a holding company controlled by Cablevision Systems that owns the New York Knicks and Rangers and a number of cable channels. [B12.]
 
SBC to Take Big Charges
SBC Communications said that it would take charges of up to $2.3 billion in 1997 in connection with its purchase of Pacific Telesis as the company pares its operations. [D3.]

Unisys Chief to Depart
Unisys said James A. Unruh, its chairman and chief executive since 1990, would step down, paving the way for new management at the struggling computer company. [D3.]
 
LVMH Raises Grand Met Stake
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods company, spent $1.31 billion to increase its stake in Grand Metropolitan to 6.3 percent in another attempt to thwart the British food and drinks company's merger with Guinness. [D4.]

Concerns About a Tobacco Deal
As negotiators declared that a settlement in the tobacco talks appeared imminent, the White House grew more concerned that the costs of signing a deal with the industry might outweigh the political benefits. [A1.]
 
McDonald's Wins British Libel Case
McDonald's won the long-running "McLibel" case in Britain when a judge ruled that the company did not destroy rain forests, discriminate against employees or poison its customers. [A1.]
 
Court Sides With U.S. Over Alaska
The Supreme Court declared that the Federal Government owns ecologically fragile offshore areas along Alaska's coast, preventing Alaska from going ahead with plans to drill there for oil and natural gas. [A14.]
 
Stocks Return
To Record Territory
Stocks bounced back, with all major indexes at or near records. The Dow industrials overcame a slow start to gain 58.35 points and close at 7,777.06, just 5 points off their record high. And the Nasdaq composite rose 14.71 points to close at a record 1,447.14. [D8.]
 
Talks on TV Ratings Break Off
Negotiators for the television industry broke off talks with parent advocacy groups that are seeking changes in the TV ratings system, after Vice President Al Gore issued a statement supporting the position of the advocacy groups. [A13.]

Award for McDonald's In British Libel Suit
The longest trial in British history ended with McDonald's winning a $96,000 judgment against two activists who helped distribute a pamphlet denouncing the company's practices. But the judge agreed with the claim of the activists that the company is cruel to animals, exploited children in its advertising and that its low wages tended to depress salaries in the fast-food industry.

Clinton Praises Trade Policies
President Clinton chided critics of his free trade policies in a speech given on the eve of an economic summit meeting of eight nations in Denver. Mr. Clinton called on Congress to give him greater leeway in reaching trade accords with Latin American countries and not to revoke China's trading privileges with the United States in a vote next week. A10
 
Execution Draws Mexico's Ire
The execution in Texas of a Mexican citizen convicted of murdering an American motorist drew criticism from the Government of Mexico and protests from several groups. Thirty-three other Mexican citizens are on death row in 10 states. A6
 
Ban Relaxed on Ivory Sales
A worldwide ban on the sale of ivory has been eased to give Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe the opportunity to sell some of their stockpile of ivory. The three southern African countries have healthy, growing elephant populations but little money to take care of them. A3
 
No Apology in South Africa
The head of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said he had no intention of apologizing for his remarks questioning the credibility of former President F. W. de Klerk's testimony before the panel. Mr. de Klerk, the leader of the National Party, said he would ask the courts to stop the panel's inquiry on the grounds that commission officials were biased against him. A3

Medicare Plans in Senate Face Mounting Opposition
Senate efforts to revolutionize Medicare and protect its finances encountered pained silence from House Republicans and withering attacks from Democrats. On both sides of the Capitol, high-ranking Congressional aides said the central elements of the plan -- to raise the Medicare eligibility age to 67 from 65 and increase payments by the well-off elderly -- were unlikely to become law. A1
 
Tobacco Pact Imminent
The White House grew increasingly concerned that the costs of signing a deal with the unpopular cigarette industry may far outweigh the political benefits even as negotiators declared that a settlement appeared imminent. A1
 
Court Upholds Redistricting
The Supreme Court upheld a court-ordered redistricting plan that left Georgia with only one black majority Congressional district instead of the two that the Justice Department said was required by the Voting Rights Act and the Court's own precedents. A14
 
The Federal Government won a complete victory in the Court in an 18-year-long boundary dispute with Alaska over control of offshore areas along the state's Arctic coast that are both ecologically fragile and rich in oil and gas deposits. The Court's declaration that the United States owns the entire area in question forecloses Alaska from carrying out its plans to drill there for oil and natural gas. A14
 
Senate Revises Tax Bill
The Senate Finance Committee changed its tax-cutting bill substantially, making concessions to members of both parties on their priority issues. The committee agreed to add $8 billion in new funding for children's health insurance by raising the tax on cigarettes by 20 cents a pack. A16

HEADLINE: In Election Year, Debate Rages Over Using Public Money for City Ads

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
As the television camera glides through the picture-perfect streets of New York City, the voice of the actor Tony Roberts makes some very familiar points.
"There's never been a better time to find more motivated workers, to find safe neighborhoods to work and live in, or clean parks to play in," he says. "In a city that's the world's banking, arts and entertainment capital, with streets now safer than in any other major city in America." 
 It sounds like one of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's campaign advertisements, which are scheduled to begin running on television next week. But, in fact, the commercial was placed last week by the city's Economic Development Corporation -- not to re-elect the Mayor but to lure businesses to the city. It cost the taxpayers $1 million.
The advertisement never mentions the Mayor and doesn't use his voice. It does, however, work to create the same glowing picture of the city that Mr. Giuliani regularly invokes in his campaign appearances.
A separate radio commercial that was first broadcast this week links the Mayor in a far more explicit way to the new Metrocard free transfer between buses and subways that is to begin on July 4. That advertisement, which was written by the Mayor and features him speaking for a full minute, was placed by the Economic Development Corporation and the city's Department of Transportation. It cost the public $200,000.
"New Yorkers have a lot to celebrate these days, and come this Fourth of July, we'll have even more," the Mayor says in the advertisement. "Independence from two-fare zones. Free transfers. Free ferries. One city, one fare. I'm Rudy Giuliani." One of those phrases, "One city, one fare," sounds very much like the Mayor's old campaign slogan, "One city, one standard."
The Giuliani administration was not actually involved in developing the free transfer, but the city has agreed to spend about $35 million to subsidize transfers from private bus lines in Queens and from the Staten Island Ferry -- both in boroughs crucial to the Mayor's re-election.
The use of public money to directly or indirectly promote the Mayor's accomplishments during a re-election campaign drew criticism yesterday from his leading opponent and from two civic groups that monitor the often porous wall separating the political from the governmental.
Ruth W. Messinger, the leading Democratic challenger for mayor, issued a statement attacking the advertisements as "Radio Free Rudy," making it clear that she considered them political. "The timing of the ads right in the middle of the campaign just doesn't pass the ethical smell test, " said Leland Jones, her spokesman.
The leaders of Common Cause New York and the New York Public Interest Research Group wrote a joint letter to Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro yesterday, urging that the advertisements either be pulled or be paid for with campaign funds.
Mr. Giuliani defended the advertisements yesterday as having an "appropriate governmental purpose," and said they were similar to actions by other mayors. The Metrocard advertisements, he said, were necessary to educate the public about free transfers.
"This is a big transition that's taking place in the city," he said. "We want people to know about it, understand it and inculcate it."
Mr. Mastro said the administration decided to use the Mayor's voice in the advertisement because, as city government's most recognizable figure, Mr. Giuliani would be able to make the free-transfer program a much greater popular success.
A spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation, Russell Harding, said the agency's advertising campaign was begun as retaliation for a similar advertisement promoting the business-friendly atmosphere of New Jersey. Had that state not tried to lure away city businesses, the city would never have paid for the advertisements, he said.
"We have to talk about the positive aspects of the city," said Mr. Harding, the son of Raymond B. Harding, the Mayor's closest political adviser. "Things here are better, and we want to communicate that to business decision makers."
The issue of public advertisements that resemble campaign commercials comes up frequently at election time, and has embroiled Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Messinger in the past. In June of 1993, when Mr. Giuliani was in a tight race against former Mayor David N. Dinkins, the Giuliani campaign complained to the city's Campaign Finance Board that Mr. Dinkins was advancing his candidacy with an advertisement that promoted city bonds. The board eventually ruled that the advertisement was not campaign-related.
Last December, Ms. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, spent $7,400 in city funds on radio advertisements criticizing the Mayor's plan to build superstores around the city, an act that outraged the Giuliani camp. The Mayor responded by raising $67,000 from real estate and construction interests to run advertisements promoting his plan.
Mr. Giuliani has also spent taxpayer money on advertisements to build public support for his proposal to drop the city sales tax on clothing and to preserve the city's rent laws. Ms. Messinger also used some of her public funds recently to urge that the rent laws not be changed.
In March, after receiving criticism, two utility companies ended a television advertising campaign that highlighted Gov. George E. Pataki's role in devising a plan to reduce Long Island's utility rates.

Divorce Lawyer Switches

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
One of of New York City's premier divorce lawyers, Eleanor B. Alter, is leaving Rosenman & Colin, her law firm of 15 years, and taking a team of family-law attorneys with her.
Famous for celebrity clients like Mia Farrow and Christie Brinkley, Ms. Alter will become a partner at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman. The 76-lawyer firm, which she officialy joins July 1, is only four years old and currently has no divorce practice. Ms. Alter, 58, is making the switch with a large crew: five associates, three secretaries, two paralegals and a file clerk, as well as Helene Brezinsky, a family law partner. 
 This is not the first time Rosenman & Colin, a 240-lawyer firm, has suffered a brain drain at the hands of Kasowitz, Benson. Eric J. Wallach, head of Kasowitz, Benson's employment practice, left Rosenman after 20 years last September, taking four associates with him. Three of the four men in the firm's name -- Marc E. Kasowitz, Daniel R. Benson and Hector Torres -- are also Rosenman alumni.

HEADLINE: From the Real World, a Critique of the E.P.A.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Imagine reading this in your paper: "The Environmental Protection Agency has announced that it intends to set strict limits on oxygen. Agency spokesmen say, 'Oxygen is toxic in high doses, is explosive, causes fires and can cause airplanes to crash.' Moreover, the Clean Air Act precludes the agency from considering the costs or the 'disbenefits' of banning oxygen. 'Business and conservative analysts have a history of overestimating the costs of environmental regulation,' officials say. 'To protect public health, especially children, Americans can learn to live with less oxygen.' " 
 It's great sport to poke fun at opposing views by taking an argument to the extreme, as we do using the E.P.A.'s logic in the above paragraph and as T. H. Watkins did to our research in his June 17 Op-Ed article. But Mr. Watkins did more than that; he made some statements that were not true. We have not "wondered out loud whether tropospheric ozone has anything to do with respiratory problems." Our article in The Wall Street Journal simply called for recognition of the trade-offs involved in E.P.A. regulations.
We rather like Mr. Watkins's world. Everything is good or bad. No trade-offs or difficult decisions need be made. As appealing as it may seem, we'll stick in the real world, where E.P.A. regulations can do more harm than good when they're based on poor science and bad economics.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against the Yen As Trade Tension Seems Eased

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen yesterday as the prospect of trade tensions between the United States and Japan appeared to ease as a summit meeting of world leaders began in Denver.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan pledged his commitment to an agreement with President Clinton on ways to smooth access to Japanese markets, soothing concern that leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations would dwell on Japan's trade surplus at the three-day meeting. 
 Later, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said he and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin had agreed to cooperate closely on stabilizing exchange rates.
"There will be a little talk on the trade surplus, but currencies won't be too much of a topic," said Robert Katz, chief currency trader at MTB Bank. They "won't dominate like they have in previous G-7 meetings," he said.
Fernando Medina, senior currency trader at Banco Atlanticom, said that "people are buying dollars in the event that nothing serious about trade is said" at the summit meeting. Even so, the dollar did not rise more because traders were thinking, "Don't go crazy, because you might get burned," he said.
Trade tension between the United States and Japan often hurts the dollar by causing speculation that the Clinton Administration will retreat from its longstanding support for a strong currency. That concern ebbed on Thursday when Mr. Clinton reiterated support for a strong dollar.
In New York, the dollar settled at 114.81 yen, up from 113.98 yen on Thursday and its highest closing level of the week. The dollar rose to 1.7275 marks from 1.7237 marks.
The pound, meanwhile, surged to a five-year high against both the mark and the dollar, lifted by expectations of higher British interest rates.
A survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed improving demand for manufacturing goods, reinforcing speculation that Britain's base lending rate, recently raised to 6.25 percent, might soon rise again.
In New York, the pound rose to $1.6559, from $1.6488 on Thursday, and its highest level since Jan. 21.

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit Narrowed in May

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
 The budget deficit narrowed in May from a year earlier, keeping the annual shortfall between revenues and expenses on track to fall to the lowest level in almost two decades.
The deficit totaled $48.494 billion last month as Federal spending fell below the total a year earlier, figures from the Treasury's monthly budget statement showed today. That is down from last May's deficit of $53.051 billion -- the largest ever in a single month. Analysts forecast a budget shortfall of $50.6 billion for May. 
 The Treasury is benefiting from strong tax collections as the healthy economy is bolstering paychecks and corporate profits. Americans "made gobs and gobs of money last year," said Astrid Adolfson of MCM Moneywatch in New York. "We're sharing the wealth with the Treasury."
Moreover, the growth rate of Federal discretionary spending has been restrained. The Treasury, which recorded a record monthly budget surplus in April of $93.939 billion, plans to pay down a record $65 billion in debt this quarter.

Old Rebuffs Spur Efforts On Racism

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THE Rev. Dr. Suzan Johnson Cook still remembers the day she hopped on a school bus, all eager to make that first ride alongside another little girl from her Gun Hill Road neighborhood. Ms. Johnson Cook's parents had been the first black family to move into a block in the Bronx that had been home to many Jews and Italians.
"I invited a Jewish girl who was going to be in my class to sit next to me," Ms. Johnson Cook recalled. "She said, 'My mother said I can't sit next to a black person.' I told her I was brown, but that was it. The seeds of racism were already planted. In the life of every African-American there is a turning point when you recognize there is a difference." 
 More than 30 years later, the girl who was shunned on her way to school has been invited to sit with the President of the United States. Ms. Johnson Cook, the senior minister of the Bronx Christian Fellowship, has been appointed to President Clinton's seven-member advisory panel on race relations. She admits that the panel is not capable of erasing centuries of fear and distrust, but she says that its formation is a sign that the time has come to begin talking about issues glossed over by others who feel that civil rights is just a lesson in a history class and that affirmative action has run its course.
Coming from the Bronx, a borough whose black and Latino majority renders the word minority meaningless at times, Ms. Johnson Cook said that the experiences of communities like hers can teach the rest of the country how different groups can move forward into the next century.
"WE'RE trying to figure out where do we go from here," she said. "The President is raising the question can we be one America. On the local level, we ask if we can be one Bronx."
She had begun to answer that question three years ago, when she returned to her childhood borough to begin her new ministry. A former television producer, she had been ordained in the 1980's in the American Baptist Church, and had been the pastor of the Mariners' Temple in Chinatown. In 1993, wanting to gain a larger perspective on urban problems, she became a White House Fellow in urban policy. Soon, the Bronx beckoned.
"I wanted to embrace the community which had produced and nurtured me," she said. "The Bronx was the place to be. It was multi-ethnic, progressive and an undiscovered borough. It was the untapped borough."
While some lament the passing of the halcyon days when the Concourse was grand and egg creams flowed like water, Ms. Johnson Cook preferred to focus on those who stayed behind, as well as those who moved in, who worked to improve housing and social conditions. Her own ministry, inside a former bank at 161st Street and the Grand Concourse, stresses reaching out to all, regardless of race or class. During her Thursday afternoon prayer sessions, the room is filled with court officers, young professionals and church ladies smiling as they offer one another "holy handshakes."
"People can try to live segregated lives, but it's not healthy," she said. "The Bronx can teach us something. We have two predominant groups here in African-Americans and Latinos, and within that there are different cultures and nationalities. They live together. It's a small paradigm, but it's a beginning."
SHE sometimes wonders if that message has been heard by outsiders. She is especially worried about the dangers that await young black children, even those like hers who come from middle-class homes.
"You see them stopped by law enforcement and you fear," she said. "You see the lead stories on the news and the top 3 or 5 are of racial minorities in cuffs. Then there's the violence of kids going to school and getting killed. You think you're able to buffer the storm. But you feel for your children."
Those who don't live there wouldn't understand that, she said. Which is why it is important to her that these issues be talked about, to understand her community's strengths and remind others of the need to reach out and build economic and social bonds. The process will be painful at times, she said, but at least race will be on the table. So, too, will be the advice and hopes of her Bronx neighbors.
"How they experience life will be heard," she said. "When the advisory board is over, I'm still coming back to sleep in the Bronx."

HEADLINE: Baptist Rank and File Split on Disney Boycott

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: FALLS CHURCH, Va., June 20

 BODY:
The resounding vote this week in Dallas by the Southern Baptist Convention to boycott all things Disney seemed to carry the weight of a religious crusade.
Yet here in this middle-class suburb of Washington, where 3,000 local residents claim the Columbia Baptist Church as their principal house of worship, congregants expressed mixed views about a declaration adopted by 12,000 conventioneers to govern the leisure habits of 15.7 million people across the country who make up the nation's largest Protestant denomination. 
 In interviews today, six members of the Columbia church discussed the stand taken in Dallas. All agreed that the Walt Disney Company might be taken to task in some way for promoting homosexual life styles through so-called "Gay Days" at Disney World in Florida and for the ABC television sitcom "Ellen," which features a lesbian actress playing a store manager who is a lesbian.
But some questioned whether parents would honor a boycott that would also deny a child the opportunity to watch Disney films like "The Lion King" or "101 Dalmatians."
"An economic boycott is a good idea, but it should be more targeted," said K. Randel Everett, Columbia's senior pastor. He said he would prefer a boycott of a specific Disney property for a fixed period of time, like a week of turning off a Disney-owned network like ABC, ESPN or Arts & Entertainment. "I like to watch "Nightline" and ESPN. More than any other channel, I like ESPN. But if I vote for a boycott, I want to be able to keep it."
Joy Brody, a mother of three young boys, said she would not boycott Disney and instead would do what thousands of other Falls Church residents did in a recent five-year campaign to end sex education in the local public school system: "Make lots of calls and write lots of letters."
"I don't have to boycott," she said. "In fact, we're going to Disney World for a week this summer. But I will write a letter of protest." Turning quickly to Mr. Everett, she asked jokingly, "I'm not going to get thrown out of the church, am I?"
Brian Kirby, an elementary school music teacher, also disagreed with a widespread boycott, but not so much for the impracticality of it as for the image it creates for Southern Baptists.
"Rather than capitalize on the negative, I would love to see our convention as a whole capitalize on the positive," he said. "I would have rather seen us publish a list of things we're happy with, praise Disney for the positive things the company has done. You see lots of black lists; let's see some praise lists."
Lois Cox, a receptionist at the church, was the only person in the group who wholeheartedly supported the boycott. She said its expansive reach was the best way to demonstrate that Southern Baptists will not tolerate the promotion of lifestyles that violate Christian traditions.
"I'm glad they made the statement," Ms. Cox said. "I'm glad they are taking a stand. I object to Disney being a vehicle that promotes evil, and it's important for the leaders of our faith to say what we believe in."
But Barbara Wever, a retired administrator with Bell-Atlantic, said she would just as soon speak for herself. She objected to a group of Baptists she described as far more conservative than herself setting policy for so diverse a religious group.
"Other people don't think for me," she said. "I ultimately have to answer for what's right and wrong. I don't know if the boycott is a good idea. I buy every Disney video that comes out and give them to my grandchildren, but I never get anything for them that I don't sit down and watch with them. If there's something negative in there, my husband and I discuss it with them."
"Ultimately, it's a personal decision: you have to decide," said Enrique DePaz, pastor of Columbia's Hispanic members, who attended the Dallas convention and voted for the boycott.
But upon reflection, he acknowledged a certain ambivalence, born of the fervor when the vote was taken and the unlikelihood that compliance could ever be monitored.
"The need to boycott means the need to shut down your TV and boycott ABC," he said. "More than 80 percent of the people in Dallas agreed that was right. Maybe it's not the best way, but at least it's a place to start."
Mr. Kirby, the teacher, was not so sure. He said he was bothered by the notion that a call to boycott Disney might suggest to outsiders that Southern Baptists are not already discerning enough to tune out what they would consider offensive behavior.
"I would hope we have not come to the point where it takes a group of people to challenge us to be discerning Christians," he said. "I was discerning way before the convention Baptists made this decision."
As a result, Mr. Kirby said, the declaration in Dallas would have virtually no effect on his life, other than to strengthen his resolve to choose his entertainment ever more carefully.
But others who disagreed with the declaration said they have already experienced one residual benefit, a new dialogue within their families. Mr. Everett, the pastor, has a daughter who just graduated from high school and a son in college. "For us," he said, "it was a trigger for conversation. We're not all in harmony over this, but it did give us the opportunity to discuss what we should and should not tolerate."

HEADLINE: Big Volume Pushes Stocks To More Highs

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
The stock market drifted into the record books again yesterday, but just barely, in one of the busiest trading sessions ever.
The heavy activity resulted from what Wall Street terms a "triple witching day" -- the period once a quarter when the options and futures on stock indexes expire. But despite the volume, market gains were slim. 
 Among the most heavily traded shares yesterday were those of tobacco companies. Down for much of the day, tobacco issues rose just after reports of a historic settlement with regulators, but then tumbled near the close.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.45 points, to a new closing high of 7,796.51. For the week, the Dow was up just 14 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also set a closing high, with an even slimmer gain. It was up 0.71 point, to 898.70.
In the last 10 weeks, though, the S.& P. 500 has soared 21.8 percent, its best 10-week run since October 1982, when the market exploded out of a downturn.
The powerful run for stocks this year has been fueled by strong corporate profits, falling interest rates and diminishing fears of inflation.
"The market continues to react positively to the absence of inflation," said William LeFevre, a market analyst with Ehren krantz King Nussbaum. "And as long as individuals continue to put money into mutual funds, it's unlikely you'll have a significant selloff."
As a result, in recent days several Wall Street bulls have raised their forecasts for the coming year.
Ralph Acampora, a market analyst with Prudential Securities, said he had raised his year-end estimate to 8,750 points for the Dow, from 8,250. He also said he expects the Dow to reach 10,000 by next June.
"I don't see froth," he said. "I don't see speculation. I see the market broadening out, and it's broadening out because people feel comfortable. And when you put it all together, I see the Dow hitting 10,000."
Abby Joseph Cohen, the bullish strategist at Goldman, Sachs, has also issued a new forecast. Yesterday, she said she had raised her 12-month target on the S.& P. 500 to 950 points, the equivalent of the Dow hitting 8,250 by next June.
Of course, an 8,000-point Dow this year was not inconceivable to Laszlo Birinyi. The president of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn., has wavered little from bullish convictions he declared early this year.
Mr. Birinyi said that one force driving prices higher is that the S.& P. 500 -- which is up 21.3 percent this year -- is outperforming some active portfolio managers. So now those managers are frantically trying to buy the blue chips.
"What you've been seeing in the last couple of weeks is an attempt to narrow the gap," Mr. Birnyi said. "And I think as long as you have this tremendous gap between the indexes and the managers, you're going to see continued strength in the market and very minor corrections."
In fact, according to Morningstar Inc., the median gain for United States domestic stock funds is 14.1 percent so far this year -- a gap of about seven percentage points with the S.& P. 500.
Yesterday, though, was dominated by traders, closing out options and futures as part of the triple witching.
As a result, 653.1 million shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, its third-heaviest day ever, with declining issues outpacing advancers, 1,486 to 1,149.
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 17 advanced yesterday, led by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which rose 2 1/4 a share, to 102 1/8.
Shares of Philip Morris, the nation's leading cigarette maker, rose and then fell after reports of a tentative tobacco accord; they closed at 45 1/2, down 2. Shares of RJR Nabisco Holding, whose subsidiary makes Camels, also fell: 7/8, to 35.
But analysts said that this week's soft market was simply a resting period after a broad and powerful run that began in mid-April.
For that reason, Mr. Acampora discounts yesterday's frenzied action and is looking toward even bigger gains. "Today was triple witching," he said. "It was all noise. This is all short term. But my message about the Dow at 10,000 is for investors, not traders."

HEADLINE: Judge Orders Detroit Papers to Rehire Strikers

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
A Federal labor judge issued a sweeping ruling in favor of more than 1,000 former Detroit newspaper workers yesterday, finding that The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press had engaged in unfair labor practices in forcing a 19-month strike, and ordering the two dailies to put the strikers back to work, even if that means laying off replacement workers.
The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Thomas Wilks, of the National Labor Relations Board, was a sweet victory for the unionists, who have not had much to cheer about since 2,500 workers in six unions walked out on July 13, 1995. But the newspapers will not be required to rehire any strikers during the appeal that Detroit Newspapers Inc., the operating agency for the two dailies, immediately said it would file. Appeals could continue for months or years. Knight-Ridder Inc. owns The Detroit Free Press; the Gannett Company owns The Detroit News. 
 In his order, Judge Wilks upheld a complaint from the Detroit regional office of the labor board that Detroit Newspapers Inc. had bargained in bad faith on economic matters, had failed to provide the six striking unions with information they needed to bargain effectively and had imposed unilateral merit pay changes without bargaining with the unions, among other things.
The companies had argued before the labor board that the strike was over purely economic issues, which are not subject to unfair labor practice rulings.
The country's longest active newspaper strike officially ended in February, when the unions made an unconditional offer to return to work. The papers rehired 225 workers but have refused to displace those hired during the strike, including several hundred former strikers who crossed the picket lines. The remainder have still not been given back their old jobs. There is disagreement on the number of strikers affected. The union, evidently counting part-timers, says there are about 1,800; the newspapers say there are 1,019.
Now the focus of the dispute shifts to the company's appeal, first to the labor board, and then to the Federal courts if necessary. In addition, the Detroit office of the labor relations board requested an injunction in February to force the papers to take back all remaining workers immediately. The labor board has not yet ruled on that request.
William Schaub Jr., the Detroit regional director of the labor board, said yesterday's ruling was an important development.
"This is a major step in my mind," he said, "because it obviously means that the companies have in fact bargained in bad faith, and hopefully it means that we will be a little farther down the road toward a final solution."
"We are very glad with today's ruling," Shawn Ellis, a newspaper delivery driver and a spokesman for the Metropolitan Detroit Council of Newspaper Unions, said yesterday.
"We think we have proven that the companies used illegal activities to try to bust six unions representing 2,500 employees," Mr. Ellis said.
The timing of the ruling could hardly have suited the unions better: a major rally has long been planned for the weekend, with several national labor leaders in attendance.
"Obviously this ruling puts a very bright star on this weekend for us," Mr. Ellis said.

HEADLINE: Romania Raps on Door For a NATO Invitation

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
As diplomacy goes, the timing could have been better.
Victor Ciorbea, Prime Minister of Romania, is trudging through Washington this week to make the case for his country to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He has met Vice President Al Gore and conferred with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. He has prayed over breakfast with Senators. 
 Just one problem. The Clinton Administration announced last week that it wanted to invite only three countries to join the alliance -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- despite support among NATO allies for including Romania and Slovenia.
And that has turned Mr. Ciorbea's already difficult foray into something all but quixotic.
Still, barely two weeks before President Clinton and other NATO leaders gather in Madrid on July 8 to extend formal invitations, the matter remains bitterly unresolved.
"We didn't have any reason to be happy," Mr. Ciorbea acknowledged in an interview on Wednesday evening, looking weary after a day full of meetings. "Of course, we remain optimistic. And we have a duty for ourselves and for our people and for the countries who support us to struggle up to the end."
Mr. Ciorbea (pronounced CHORE-bah) was in the middle of planning for his visit here when Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen announced the American preference at a meeting of NATO's defense ministers in Brussels on June 12. He decided to come ahead anyway, if only because NATO admission carries such appeal back home.
In all the formerly Communist nations of Eastern Europe, admission to the military alliance that stood as a bulwark against Soviet domination would offer the prospect of security and stability. But for Romania and Slovenia in particular, it is seen as offering still more: the ultimate validation of their place in Europe.
"We had pretty big hopes," was how Slovenia's Ambassador in Washington, Ernest Petric, put it the other day.
The Administration's insistence on holding NATO's first round of expansion to three members has now all but dashed those hopes. In Romania, where the campaign for membership had become an obsession, a newspaper headline despaired, "Goodbye, NATO."
The decision -- not to mention the blunt, "our position is firm" way it was announced in Washington and Brussels -- has also angered America's NATO allies.
Although the United States has the strongest voice as the most powerful member of the alliance, NATO's decisions are ostensibly consensual. And at the meeting of NATO ambassadors last week, the alliance remained sharply divided, with a majority of the 16 members -- notably France, Canada and Italy -- at least publicly sticking with their support for five new members.
"The way the United States made its position known was seen by all as rather surprising and a bit brutal," a NATO diplomat in Brussels said.
The split has given a sliver of hope to Romania and Slovenia, though Mr. Ciorbea doubted he would succeed in persuading the Administration to change its mind. "We are not as naive as that," he said.
Still, he trudges on, meeting with more Senators, with research groups, and with reporters. Today he met with Secretary Cohen and laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery. The trip was not so much to berate the Americans, he said, as to build "a strategic partnership" with them.
"We don't forget and we can't forget that the Americans have been awaited in Romania for more than 50 years," he said. "And I think the moment has come for this dream and this desire of the Romania people to become a reality."
Mr. Ciorbea, a lanky, reserved 42-year-old lawyer, was appointed last November by President Emil Constantinescu, whose party swept aside the ex-Communists who had ruled Romania since its violent revolution in 1989. Mr. Ciorbea, formerly the Mayor of Bucharest, has led the new Government's efforts to reform its economy, imposing austerity in the name of qualifying for NATO membership, which was, he declared, Romania's first priority.
Romania, like Slovenia, was always a long shot, considered behind the three front-runners in solidifying democracy after decades of Communism. But it made huge strides in the last year and began to win supporters in NATO capitals.
In addition to its economic shock therapy, Romania made peace with its neighbors, Hungary and Ukraine. It also sent 400 troops to Albania earlier this year as part of an Italian-led peacekeeping force, having already dispatched peacekeepers to Bosnia and Angola.
For all the progress, though, the Administration decided it wanted to limit NATO's expansion to three, citing concerns about costs and questioning the extent of Romania's transition to democracy. Officials said choosing three now increased the likelihood of having a second expansion sooner.
From the start, an Administration official said, the United States made its views clear, never giving Romania or Slovenia false expectations. "Our consciences are clear," the official said. At the same time, the Administration took pains to insure that these emerging democracies at the crux of southeastern Europe do not feel alienated.
At the Pentagon today, Secretary Cohen praised Romania for the strides it has made. "I want to be perfectly clear," he said. "The United States did not say no to Romanian membership in NATO last week. It said, 'Not yet.' "
For his part, Mr. Ciorbea said he did not want to cause problems in relations with the United States, but rather to build on the relationship. If NATO passes over Romania now -- "God forbid," he interjected -- Mr. Ciorbea insisted his country would press ahead as it has with efforts to reform itself and forge closer ties to Europe.
"We will go on acting exactly as we did until now, going on with the process of reforms, because these reforms are not done for NATO," he said. "We do these reforms for us. They are, anyhow, absolutely necessary."

Historic Pact Proposed With Tobacco Industry
Tobacco negotiators announced a settlement proposal that could forever change the way cigarettes are marketed in the United States, provide the states $368.5 billion in compensation and permanently alter the nation's legal, regulatory and public health landscape. But despite concessions from the cigarette makers, the proposal would allow the tobacco industry to win reprieve from the gravest legal and financial threats it has ever faced. 
 The complex agreement was negotiated by a group of state attorneys general headed by Michael Moore of Mississippi, above, plaintiffs' lawyers and industry representatives. The nation's four major cigarette makers -- Philip Morris, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard -- described the proposal as "a bitter pill" that required previously unimaginable concessions. [Page 1.]
 
While Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man may be banned under the agreement, experts say there are enough weapons left in the marketing arsenal to enable cigarette makers to continue selling profitably for decades. [10.]
 
'Financial End of the Cold War'
Inclusion was the theme as the newly renamed "summit of the eight" opened in Denver. President Clinton met President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, now nearly a full member of the group of leading industrial nations. "In a sense, this marks the financial end of the cold war," said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers. [6.]
 
The dollar rose against the yen as the prospect of trade tensions between the United States and Japan appeared to ease at the start of the meeting of world leaders in Denver. [34.]
 
Detroit Papers Lose Ruling
A Federal labor judge ruled that The Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press had engaged in unfair labor practices in forcing a 19-month strike, and ordered the two dailies to put the strikers back to work, even if that meant laying off replacement workers. [11.]
 
Knight-Ridder, which owns The Detroit Free Press, plans to sell five of its smaller newspapers that it says are not meeting the company's profit standards, including The Press-Telegram in Long Beach, Calif. [37]
 
Boeing Gets British Order
British Airways exercised options to buy five Boeing 777 jetliners and placed orders for three of the 767 model in a contract valued at $1 billion. [46.]
 
Broker Admits Trading Conspiracy
A former stockbroker, Michael J. Morse, 54, of Atlanta, pleaded guilty to Federal charges of masterminding an illegal trading conspiracy that cost eight of Wall Street's largest brokerage houses more than $13.4 million in losses during the summer of 1994. [36.]
 
Suit to Cost Hancock $350 Million
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance said it would pay at least $350 million to settle a class-action lawsuit with policyholders over reportedly deceptive sales practices. [37.]
 
Banking Overhaul Gains
Congress moved a step closer to tearing down the Depression-era barriers separating banking from other financial services, as the House Banking Committee approved an overhaul of banking laws. [37.]
 
Bonds Await News
In the absence of fresh economic news, Government securities traded higher. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.66 percent; for the week, the yield was down 6 basis points. [36.]
 
Metals Prices Up
Platinum and palladium futures prices jumped after Russia said it would not resume shipping the metals until July or later. Prices for gold and soybeans fell. [34.]
 
Bracing for El Nino
The potent weather disrupter known as El Nino is returning, which could have a major effect on crops in the Midwest. During the 1982-83 El Nino, torrential rains swept California and much of the southern two-thirds of the United States, causing floods, mud slides and coast-to-coast weather havoc. [7.]

HEADLINE: Camry Teaches Economics 101: Features Are Nice but Price Sells

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 20

 BODY:
Auto advertisers love to promote each new model as changing an industry, but only a few actually do so, like the 1986 Ford Taurus, which spawned a fleet of aerodynamic imitators.
Introduced last autumn, the 1997 Toyota Camry lacks the grace or beauty to alter automotive design -- indeed, its bland curves verge on the utilitarian. But the car is reshaping the nation's midsize car market because of its price tag of $16,448 to $24,088, down $550 to $1,745 from the 1996 model, depending on the version. The lower prices have narrowed substantially, without eliminating, the premium that American buyers have come to pay for a Japanese car compared with a similarly equipped American model. 
 The new Camry also has lower manufacturing costs, a result of a variety of changes like simpler headlamps and fewer fuel lines. The combination of lower prices and costs has forced rival auto makers to reduce costs, cut prices and offer larger rebates on their midsize cars.
The clearest sign of the Camry's success has come in the sales statistics. After five years in which the Taurus narrowly beat the Honda Accord to become the best-selling car, the Camry has easily moved ahead of both cars in the first five months of this year.
Toyota has sold 175,691 Camrys so far, compared with Ford's sales of 145,963 Tauruses and Honda's sales of 132,183 Accords. Whether the Camry takes the best-selling car title for the entire year will mainly depend on Toyota's ability to keep up production and a willingness to endure the political criticism in the United States that could accompany any dethroning of the Taurus.
Toyota's factory in Georgetown, Ky., which makes most of the Camrys for the United States market, is scheduled to begin producing the Sienna mini-van as well during the first week of August. That start-up will force Toyota to choose between importing more Camrys from Japan or ratcheting down sales.
The sales success of the Camry followed Toyota's decision, made last year when it redesigned the car, to lower prices on various versions of the sedan by an average of $899. That price cut, while not the first by an auto maker in the last couple of years, has contributed to a ripple of price reductions and generous incentives that is spreading across the nation's car market.
The most recent response came on Thursday, when Nissan announced that the main version of its completely redesigned 1998 Altima sedan, the Altima GXE, would sell for $1,508 less than a comparably equipped 1997 model. The Altima is a little smaller than a Camry or a Taurus and a little bigger than a Toyota Corolla or a Ford Contour.
Nissan may not be alone in lowering midsize car prices or forgoing price increases this year. Chrysler, for instance, has made several improvements in its midsize Cirrus sedan for this autumn, such as installing more luxurious leather and a sunroof, but the company will choose "an aggressive price position," said Steven D. Bruyn, Chrysler's marketing plans manager for midsize and large cars. Honda is redesigning the Accord for this autumn and is hinting that the vehicle will be larger and more comfortable but will stay the same price, without even an adjustment for inflation.
The new Camry was designed for cheaper assembly. The bumper, for example, has just 13 pieces, instead of 20 as on the 1996 model. While auto makers have long tried to simplify designs, Toyota went further than most with the Camry, and other auto makers are moving in the same direction.
Nissan officials have made similar changes to reduce production costs of the new Altima, which goes on sale July 10. The pillars on either side of the front windshield, for instance, are now installed at the factory as a single piece instead of three pieces, said Mark Perry, Nissan's marketing manager for sedans.
Judging by the Camry's sales, the design changes do not seem to have struck buyers as a reduction in quality. Campbell C. Shaw, the sales manager at Melody Toyota in San Francisco, said that the Camry's lower price was not the only reason for its popularity. "It's mainly due to the brand new car and the quality of the workmanship," he said.
Yet recent studies show that the quality advantage held by Japanese auto makers is rapidly disappearing, as American manufacturers adopt many of the same production techniques. According to surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, only 68 problems were reported for every 100 new Tauruses during the first 90 days of ownership this year, compared with 53 problems for every 100 Camrys.
By comparison, the Camry score in 1996 was 82, while J. D. Power did not report the Taurus score because it was worse than the industry average of 110. The quality consulting company does not disclose the actual number when the score is below the average.
The success of the Camry is all the more remarkable because even with the price cut it remains more expensive than comparably equipped American midsize cars, although the gap has narrowed.
A comparable Ford Taurus still sells for roughly $2,500 less and a comparable Chevrolet Lumina still retails for close to $4,000 less, partly because Japanese manufacturers have high vehicle-development and administrative costs.
"They're still pricing pretty high, based on higher perceived quality and resale value," said James Harbour, an automotive productivity analyst in Troy, Mich. Someday, he added, "people are going to look at themselves and say, 'Why am I paying $2,500 more than for a Taurus?' "
That day may have been postponed, however, by the dollar's brisk appreciation against the Japanese yen over the last two years, although the dollar retreated somewhat this spring. The dollar's strength has considerably reduced the cost of the many parts, like automatic transmissions, that Japanese auto makers still import for assembly into cars in the United States.
Chris K. Hostetter, Toyota's manager for product planning, said the Camry had been designed several years ago when the dollar's value was dropping, so Toyota engineered the car to be competitive even if each dollar of sales in the United States only brought it 90 yen. But with the dollar's recovery, a dollar fetched 114.81 yen in late trading today in New York.
Mr. Hostetter said that the dollar's level had not affected the final decision last August on how to price the Camry.
American auto executives have called repeatedly for the Japanese Government to take vigorous action to bring the yen to a range of 100 to 110 to the dollar at a minimum.
"We've said for more than a year that the yen was too weak," Alex Trotman, the chairman and chief executive of Ford, said in a policy statement on June 9. "The currency markets are starting to agree."
Susan Jacobs, an auto market forecaster in Rutherford, N.J., said that the yen must have played some role in the Camry's more competitive price now, but she added that the design changes almost certainly played a larger role.
Toyota's design alterations and the weak yen have clearly affected the midsize car market, amplifying broader trends such as an erosion in used-car prices that is already making it harder to sell many kinds of cars and other vehicles.
"The midsize market is probably shaping up to be the most competitive segment," Ms. Jacobs said.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Basks at Summit; Some Europeans Are Cool to U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: DENVER, June 20

 BODY:
The newly renamed "summit of the eight" opened today with President Clinton, buoyed by an effervescent economy, meeting the revived Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and trying to soothe European anger over what they see as America's arrogance in NATO and the United Nations.
A fit-looking Mr. Yeltsin seemed thrilled just to be here, basking in the attention accorded a nearly full member of this group of the world's most important nations. Russia is taking part in every session except an hour of financial conversation on Saturday, and making Russia feel welcome is the main point, senior American officials said. 
 In many ways, Mr. Yeltsin came here to collect on the promises made to him by Mr. Clinton in March to make NATO expansion easier for the Russians to swallow. With his eye on critics at home, Mr. Yeltsin has refused to attend the NATO expansion summit party in Madrid in July.
It annoyed the Japanese that Mr. Clinton had decided on his own to invite Russia here in such a prominent way. The Japanese argued that in effect expanding the Group of 7 major industrialized countries to include Russia degraded the economic importance of these meetings. But the meetings in fact became more political than economic years ago.
Inclusion was the theme today. As he met Mr. Yeltsin in the Brown Palace Hotel, a beaming Mr. Clinton said: "Russia is fully included. This is the first time we've ever had a meeting where the Russians were here from the beginning to the end."
In his next breath, Mr. Clinton announced that negotiations were completed early today to admit Russia to the Paris Club of creditor nations, which manages the debt of developing countries. Mr. Clinton had promised to arrange membership during his March summit meeting with Mr. Yeltsin in Helsinki, when the Russian President first gave in to the inevitability of NATO expansion and agreed to negotiate a NATO-Russia charter.
Russia will have to write off a large part of Soviet-era debt, much of it for military purchases by poor Soviet allies, but Moscow was not going to be paid back anyway. In return, the new Russia gets the kind of international status that Mr. Yeltsin is using to convince his people of the worthiness of his bargain to join the Western market democracies, even in the face of NATO expansion.
"In a sense, this marks the financial end of the cold war," said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers. "It reflects our aim to bring Russia into the international community, which has been our aim for many years."
But American officials also acknowledge that Russia has a long way to go and will not be brought into the World Trade Organization next year, as they had hoped. Mr. Clinton also pressed Mr. Yeltsin to push the ratification of the Start 2 arms treaty in his Parliament. Russia has also backtracked from ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention.
If there was mostly happy talk with the Russians today, there were clear tensions with the Italians and especially the French, who are still pushing the expansion of NATO to include Slovenia and Romania, in addition to a consensus on admitting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Mr. Clinton also met today with the French President, Jacques Chirac, and the Italian Prime Minister, Romano Prodi, to hear them out and to explain Washington's actions.
There is great resentment of Mr. Clinton's unilateral decision to keep expansion to three countries, said a French official who described the action as "fundamentally imperial." An Italian official echoed unhappiness with "American presumption."
"When exactly did the Americans go from leadership to hegemony?" another French official asked.
Most countries here have expressed annoyance with the American decision to pay only $819 million of its $1.2 billion debt to the United Nations, and then only in return for specific reforms and a reduction of the yearly American contribution.
A senior European diplomat said: "The Americans think they deserve a superpower discount. But why should we be happy about paying part of their bill?"
Mr. Chirac also stressed his concerns about the deterioration in the Middle East to Mr. Clinton, who has put the issue on the back burner. There was also extensive discussion on Bosnia, which was the main topic at a dinner tonight, held at the Phipps House, a historic site at the University of Denver. With Mr. Prodi, there was talk of the Italian-led multilateral force in Albania, which is preparing for elections.
This is the 23d of these summit meetings, which are increasingly pompous spectacles. But they are also more political in nature and have moved far beyond their quiet beginnings in 1975, when the French and Germans wanted real conversation about global economic trends.
The economic pronouncements are increasingly precooked, with the final economic communiques negotiated and written in advance, while much of the important political business, including the real economic debate, gets done bilaterally on the grating issues of the day.
The eight countries represented here are the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Russia. The European Union is represented by the president of its Commission, Jacques Santer.

HEADLINE: Critics Say Airport Plan Risks an Expanse of Land

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: NEW WINDSOR, N.Y., June 20

 BODY:
As part of his plan to turn the state-owned Stewart International Airport into a private, profitable venture, Gov. George E. Pataki has put up for sale a 7,400-acre expanse of woods, fields and wetlands west of the airport that is dear to hunters, bird-watchers and environmental groups.
Sporting and environmental groups have criticized the Governor's move because they want to focus development in existing commercial strips around the airport while preserving the undeveloped land for recreation and as a buffer to airport noise. While the Governor wants to preserve some land for recreational space, his sale proposal does not designate a specific amount of land as protected. 
 In contrast to environmental critics, some local elected officials support Mr. Pataki and say the vacant land should be returned to the tax rolls and put to productive use, to encourage business in this economically ailing region 60 miles north of New York City.
Mr. Pataki first proposed returning the airport to private hands early last year as part of an effort to privatize many state assets, including, most recently, an offer to sell a network of former mental hospitals.
The airport would be leased, but the State Department of Transportation would sell most of the adjacent land. The state bought the vacant tract through condemnation procedures in 1971, when Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller intended to make Stewart, which is west of Newburgh, into a fourth jetport for New York City. But the airport never grew as much as expected, and the rolling land has been used mainly by people eager for a bit of open space in an increasingly crowded part of Orange County.
The state's request for proposals, released by the Empire State Development Corporation on Thursday, emphasizes that any plans should "be environmentally responsible" and have as a priority "the preservation of open space and current permitted public recreational uses."
Instead of specifying how much land should be protected in any proposal, the state invitation says only that "a substantial contiguous portion" of the land should be used for recreation.
John Samatulski, a spokesman for the New York chapter of the Sierra Club, a nonprofit group, said: "We're extremely disappointed with the way the Governor has chosen to handle this. By not taking the land off the table prior to the request for proposals, he's setting up a dynamic for conflict."
Mr. Samatulski said many sporting and environmental groups, including his own, had spent months discussing other courses with the development agency, Mr. Pataki's office and state environmental officials. But the resulting plan invites developers to propose the balance of public land and commercial activity.
Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the development agency, said: "We didn't want to tie the hands of the private sector by setting a number. The whole purpose of this process is to see what kind of creative ideas are out there." She also pointed out that the state request said "proposals that concentrate development in areas adjacent to Stewart Airport will be preferred."
George J. Meyers, the supervisor of New Windsor, which includes 90 percent of the airport property, said that no matter what developers proposed, 3,000 acres would remain open because they are wetlands. "We need the rest back on the tax rolls," he said.
But Frank Hartmann, the executive vice president of the New York State Conservation Council, a group representing hunters and other sports enthusiasts, said the great value of the tract was its unbroken expanse. Turkey, deer and other wildlife need room to roam, he said, adding that few expanses of such size remained in the Hudson Valley.
"If you chop it up, you destroy it," Mr. Hartmann said. "The Governor is trying to please both sides. He wants to be the environmental Governor and the economic development governor. But you can't be both when it comes to this land."
Michael McKuen, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, said that environmental groups had already seen ample evidence of the Governor's commitment to preserving land, and that they should have confidence that recreation and wildlife will remain part of any accepted plan.

HEADLINE: 30-Year Bond's Yield Drops To 6.66 Percent

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
In the absence of fresh economic news, Government securities traded higher yesterday as investors remained confident that the Federal Reserve would maintain a steady policy and refrain from raising interest rates next month.
Yields, which move in the opposite direction of price, fell to their lowest level in four months. They have fallen about a third of a percentage point over the last three weeks as Government reports signaled a slowdown in consumer demand and low inflation. 
 The 30-year bond rose 7/32 , to a price of 99 18/32 to yield 6.66 percent, down from 6.68 percent. For the week, the yield is down 6 basis points.
Analysts say that on days when there is no economic news, traders often follow the most recent trend, which has been up. But, they say, with each passing day traders grow increasingly reticent.
Patricia de Blank Klink, president of Advisers Capital Management, a firm specializing in fixed-income portfolio management, says she thinks the market is in one of those periods where the odds to trade up are better than those for trading down. "We think certainly in the longer term going out, the economy will begin to project strength in the third and fourth quarters this year," she said, "but we will not see any evidence until we're well into them."
Ms. Klink does not expect the Fed to raise interest rates at its meeting on July 1 and 2, but she says its August meeting will probably be more interesting. By then, she says, new economic data will have become "stronger and less market-friendly."
Among statistics awaiting the market next week are two measures of consumer psychology for the month of June: the Conference Board's consumer confidence index on Tuesday and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index on Friday. Both are expected to continue to show that consumers remain ebullient. The report on new orders for durable goods, which economists say is an extremely important economic indicator, is scheduled for release on Wednesday; orders are expected to have risen moderately during May.

HEADLINE: Compromise Included In Senate Panel's Tax Bill

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
When the chief Republican tax writer, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, pushed a tax-cutting bill through the House Ways and Means Committee earlier this month, he did it without a single Democratic vote.
His counterpart in the Senate, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, took a different approach, and late on Thursday night it paid off. All 9 of his committee's Democrats joined 9 of the 11 Republicans in approving his version of the bill. Both bills wouldabout $135 billion in tax cuts over five years, offset in part by more than $50 billion in revenue from new and extended taxes. 
 Like the House version, the Senate bill would create a credit of $500 a child for most families, offer tax breaks for college tuition, reduce the top rate on capital gains for individuals to 20 percent from 28 percent and cut the Federal inheritance tax. Both bills rely heavily on extending and expanding a tax on airline tickets to pay for the other cuts.
But while they are similar in most of their major provisions, the two bills differ in important details. The House bill, for example, would allow investors to take the effects of inflation into account when calculating capital gains, while the Senate bill would not. The Senate bill was rebuilt at the last minute around a 20-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes, a measure not included in the House bill and one likely to produce heated opposition from the tobacco industry.
Scores of other provisions, from incentives for economic development in the nation's capital, to the way the tax code deal with aging cows, will have to be reconciled after the two chambers pass their versions of the bills.
Mr. Roth's success in cultivating bipartisan support should make it more likely that the bill will win approval on the Senate floor, where it will face further amendment, and it should give him leverage with Mr. Archer when they meet to work out the differences between their versions.
"We're going to the Senate floor with Republicans and Democrats as a team," Mr. Roth said.
But White House officials continued to criticize many elements of the Senate bill. They said a proposal inserted in the bill late Thursday to make more moderate- and low-income families eligible for the child credit did not go far enough to insure that the benefits of the tax cuts did not go primarily to the wealthy. And they said the bill should not allow any of the proceeds of the cigarette tax to help corporations and special interests rather than children and families.
Much of the bipartisan support for the bill was cemented early Thursday evening, when the members of the Finance Committee, meeting behind closed doors, made the decision to support the tobacco tax, a step that would raise $15 billion over five years -- money they could use to resolve problems that members of both parties had with the bill as it was originally drafted by Mr. Roth.
Instead of the parties being divided over whether the tax cuts would favor the wealthy at the expense of lower-income families -- the argument that dominated the House debate over the bill -- the Finance Committee members quickly united in dividing up the prospective proceeds of the cigarette tax in a way that would make as many of them happy as possible.
"You will never see representative government more specific than in the Senate Finance Committee," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the panel's ranking Democrat, who fought for provisions as small as a reduction in taxes on draft cider, a request from apple growers in his state. "It's a form of accommodation, and in between you think about the national interest, because there are things we all share."
With an eye toward satisfying the airline lobbyists who were complaining to members of both parties that their industry and its customers were unfairly affected by the bill, the committee reduced a proposed package of new and extended airline ticket taxes by $3.5 billion. To address the arguments by liberal Democrats and the Clinton Administration that the tax bill would benefit the wealthy disproportionately, the committee allocated $3 billion to making more low- and moderate-income families eligible for the $500 a child credit.
Responding to demands from conservatives, the committee agreed to use several hundred million dollars to speed up a proposed reduction in Federal inheritance taxes and to slightly reduce capital gains taxes on commercial real estate. About $300 million went to a series of narrow tax changes of interest to particular senators, like a provision pushed by Senator Richard H. Bryan of Nevada, a Democrat, to allow Individual Retirement Accounts to be invested in gold bullion.
At the insistence of Mr. Hatch, who argued that the proceeds of the tobacco tax should not go to special interests, most of what was left of the $15 billion -- about $8 billion -- went to increasing health care coverage for uninsured children.
The result was to give enough members of both parties a reason to vote for the bill. When the committee emerged from behind closed doors, it quickly voted 18 to 2 to send the bill to the Senate floor, where it will be taken up next week. All nine Democrats voted for the bill. Nine of the 11 Republicans voted in favor, with only two conservatives, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, voting against, saying they were opposed to new spending on social programs like the expanded child health plan.

Pension Deal Is Rated

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A major financial rating service, Moody's Investors Service Inc., assigned an A1 rating yesterday to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's offering of $2.75 billion in bonds to bolster the state pension fund and help balance the budget. The rating is less than Moody's top ratings of Aaa and Aa, and the service warned that the bond deal could leave the state "less well-prepared" and less flexible to deal with a slower economy.
State Treasurer Brian Clymer said that Moody's was off base with its criticism, saying that the bond sale has the blessing of Wall Street and that municipal bond insurers are lining up to cover the sale. 
 Two other investors' services -- Standard & Poors and Fitch -- gave the bond issue ratings that were one notch below their top ratings. Standard & Poor's said the state "will continue to face fiscal challenges in the future, and economic growth will be necessary to maintain fiscal balance."

Unemployment Inches Up

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate rose to 5.3 percent in May, from 5.2 percent, the first increase this year, but State Labor Department officials said the change was statistically insignificant. Because the rate has been below 5.5 percent for the last three months, the economy is still considered very strong, said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The nation's jobless rate for May was 4.8 percent.

Gooden Pitches His Way Into Starting Forefront

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, June 20

 BODY:
Before Dwight Gooden dug his cleats into the mound, before he reached for the resin bag and before he uncorked his first official pitch tonight, he had been given an important comfort zone. The Yankees ripped Charles Nagy for three runs in the top of the first inning, and now to Gooden the Indians looked less daunting and Jacobs Field, which is rarely threatening to New York, looked even less imposing.
To a returning pitcher whose starts are being scrutinized and whose emotional state is still somewhat fragile, those runs meant everything. Gooden could relax, he could make a mistake, he could pitch his game. He did precisely that, never letting the gasping Indians breathe and pitching the Yankees to a 7-1 victory. He just might be a factor after all this season. 
 "That helped me a lot," he said of the early lead. "That lets you be more aggressive. If you fall behind, you can go after them a little more. That was real big."
Tonight's six superb innings were an important statement from Gooden, especially since Hideki Irabu tossed five more scoreless innings tonight, for Class AA Norwich, to continue steamrolling toward the major leagues. The triumph was also an important statement from the Yankees, who did not suffer a letdown following their riveting series against the Mets and continued their unparalleled success at this four-year-old ballpark.
But tonight was more about Gooden than the Yankees or Irabu. In his second start since his hernia surgery April 14, Gooden throttled the Indians on one run -- unearned -- and four hits while striking out two and walking two. If he pitches this way consistently, he will be chosen over Kenny Rogers and Ramiro Mendoza when Irabu cracks the rotation in three weeks.
"When Irabu gets here, we're going to have to make changes," Manager Joe Torre said. "The thing I like about Doc is he got better. He knows how to pitch. That's so important."
Although they pitched on the same night, Gooden treated questions about Irabu the way he now treats queries about his fight with an Arlington, Tex. cab driver.
"I don't think about that," he said. "I would love to pitch with him. But I'm not worried about someone taking my job or pitching out of the bullpen or being traded. I can't worry about things I can't control."
Gooden tossed an economical 88 pitches, making the Indians grimace again with the Yankees visiting. The Yankees were 6-0 at Jacobs Field last year, and they are 13-2 at this ballpark, making them the only opponent with a winning record here.
Gooden benefited from the outburst in the first -- Tino Martinez's 22d homer and run-scoring hits from Pat Kelly and Paul O'Neill.
"You can feel as comfortable as you want," Derek Jeter said. "You still have to go out and pitch. Doc did."
Gooden's dances with danger were infrequent, but he conquered them. With two Indians on and two out in the first, he struck out David Justice on a breaking pitch and plowed through the third after the Indians scored their only run. He held the Indians to one hit in eight at-bats with runners on base to improve his won-lost record to 2-0, chop his earned run average to 3.78 from 5.91 and vault the Yankees (40-30) 10 games over .500 for the first time this year.
Despite Gooden's rosy outing, his fastball was not overpowering.
"He's not there yet," Torre said. "I think he's going to get there."
Even Gooden said: "I'll take that, but I'm not going to kid myself. I need to have a better fastball."
Before some fans in the crowd of 43,019 had bitten into their first hot dog, the Yankees had abused Nagy, an eight-game winner, for three runs on five hits.
Jeter and Kelly stroked back-to-back doubles to make it 1-0, and, after Kelly stole third, O'Neill's single made the score 2-0. Two outs later, Martinez swatted a 1-2 breaking pitch off the right-field foul pole for his first homer in nine games and his second hit in 23 at-bats to shove Nagy in a 3-0 ditch.
Nagy had been the essence of consistency, pitching into the seventh inning in his last 14 starts, but he did not make it beyond the second tonight. Two walks and Jeter's single loaded the bases with two out in the second, and Nagy ended his evening by walking Cecil Fielder to boost the score to 4-0.
 
INSIDE PITCH
Either RAMIRO MENDOZA, who pitched a scoreless ninth, or KENNY ROGERS, who warmed up in the bullpen tonight, will start on Tuesday in Detroit. "They haven't said anything to me," Rogers said. . . . CHARLIE HAYES might rest his sore left groin longer since WADE BOGGS had two hits and a sacrifice fly. . . . DEREK JETER roped three hits and is batting .365 as a leadoff hitter.

HEADLINE: THE TOBACCO AGREEMENT: THE LAWMAKERS;
Lawmakers Vow Close Scrutiny of Tobacco Pact

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 20

 BODY:
News of a settlement between tobacco companies and antismoking forces today stirred cautious reactions from many on Capitol Hill and outright skepticism from others. But members of Congress on both sides of the debate agreed that any deal that eventually wins their approval will require a mountain of legislative and bureaucratic changes.
"We're going to look at it slowly and carefully," Speaker Newt Gingrich said. 
 News of the $360 billion settlement between the tobacco companies and the attorneys general of 40 states hit Capitol Hill when many lawmakers were already headed home.
Significantly, none of those who were still at work and eager to take the microphone to react, rejected the idea of a settlement outright. But within an hour, some lawmakers were making it clear that today's agreement would be taken by Congress as essentially a rough draft that would have to be rewritten.
"I don't expect Congress to rubber-stamp it," said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat and one of the most ardent tobacco foes on Capitol Hill. "There are devils in the agreement that we will have to get out of there."
Mr. Lautenberg said that among the "devils in the details" he foresaw were the need to enact laws to limit the liability of the tobacco industry and to decide who gets what money, including how much lawyers should be paid.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, complained that the proposal was "clearly under-funded" and contained one "glaring omission."
"Any agreement should include a very substantial payment to the Federal Government for the costs incurred by Medicare, veteran's health programs, and other Federal health programs for the treatment of tobacco-related illnesses," Mr. Kennedy said.
Initial reactions like those hinted at the subtle ways that the politics of tobacco have changed as the negotiations over today's agreement proceeded -- and at how the two sides of the fight over cigarettes will have to find new ways to accommodate.
President Clinton, for example, took credit in Denver today for forcing the tobacco companies to the bargaining table by seeking to regulate the industry. But he held the bargain itself at arm's length, as the White House had carefully kept the negotiations at arm's length, saying he needed to give the agreement "strict scrutiny" to see if it "advances the public health and will reduce the number of children who are smoking cigarettes."
As expected, Senator Lauch Faircloth, a North Carolina Republican who is one of tobacco's staunchest defenders, expressed some opposition, but in populist terms. Mr. Faircloth warned that he would fight any plan by big lawyers that he felt hurt the little guy -- tobacco farmers who form the base of his state's agricultural economy.
Some antitobacco lawmakers worried that any deal the cigarette companies signed must be a loaded one. And others began adding conditions.
Three Democratic Senators from non-tobacco-growing states, for instance, urged that any settlement approved by Congress and the White House include provisions to address worldwide tobacco sales by American cigarette manufacturers.
Many of those who reacted to the news of the tobacco deal said they had not had the chance to study it in any detail. But at first glance they said it would require major new legislation, including redefining the role of the Federal Drug Administration to give the agency more authority.
Mr. Kennedy, the senior Democrat on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, said that the deal raised more questions than it answered" and that he was wary of it.
"Given the track record, deceit, manipulation and bad faith by the tobacco industry, there is every reason to be skeptical of any agreement which the tobacco industry is willing to support," he said.
There is a sizable contingent of antitobacco members in both houses of Congress, where 76 members from both sides of the aisle are part of the Congressional Task Force on Tobacco and Health. But as Mr. Lautenberg warned today, "The industry still has friends in Congress."
No one on Capitol Hill is more supportive of tobacco than Mr. Faircloth, which would seem to make it unlikely that he would ultimately oppose a deal struck by the big tobacco companies themselves. But the Senator said today that he had some problems with the agreement.
"The Government, the public interests groups, the tobacco companies and the trial lawyers sitting at the negotiating table can all take care of themselves," Mr. Faircloth said. "My concern is the farmers and factory workers who aren't even allowed in that room."
"We may know the broad outlines of a settlement but I'm interested in the fine print," he continued. "People will continue to use tobacco, so surely an agreement can be reached that both stops under-age smoking and protects the interests of farmers and factory workers."
But the three Democratic Senators threatened an even wider fight over the issue, asking the President to back provisions for worldwide sanctions against tobacco companies.
"The responsibility of the Congress and the Administration in this matter does not end at our water's edge, Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Ron Wyden of Oregon said in a letter to Mr. Clinton. "The efforts to reduce and eliminate smoking by minors in this country should not be bankrolled by the unimpeded and likely accelerated marketing and promotion of U.S. tobacco products to youngsters abroad."
In Denver, before a meeting at the economic summit meeting he is attending, Mr. Clinton commended the attorneys general and others who sued the companies. But he said that before judging the agreement's merits he was appointing Bruce Reed, his domestic policy adviser, and Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to examine it for "a matter of weeks, not months."
In the meantime, he said, the Administration would continue with its own efforts to regulate tobacco. The best political outcome, one senior Administration official said today, was also the most rigorous possible agreement with the industry -- or, failing that, the stiffest possible regulation to protect public health.
Mr. Clinton said today thathe still had many questions, including how much freedom the Food and Drug Administration would have to regulate tobacco.
"The No. 1 thing for us would be the scope and nature of the F.D.A. jurisdiction and then how will the money be spent, will it really advance the public health," he said.
Michael D. McCurry, the President's press secretary, said the negotiators late in the talks sought a signal from the White House about what it would consider acceptable. "The likelihood that this agreement will pass muster was increased by the fact that we refrained from sending that signal," he said, noting that the attorneys general "got concessions even at the 11th hour."
Another official said that, had it participated directly in the talks, the Administration would have faced two risks. The deal might look less palatable to the Republican Congress if it was perceived as a Clinton product; and if public health groups decided to fight the agreement, the tobacco industry might feel emboldened to resist all regulation.

 Novelists mosey in their work, taking great stretches of prose to develop character, setting and plot. Storybook authors have no such luxury, and must convey everything economically. The novelist, like a marathon runner, has time to recover from mistakes. If the author of a storybook stumbles, it usually means the race is over, no matter how hard an artist tries to compensate with illustrations.
Valerie Wesley's "Freedom's Gifts: A Juneteenth Story" is a "nine flat" sprinter of a tale. It takes off running and never slows. The setting is Texas during World War II, and within the story of a multigenerational family gathering is an explanation of how the freeing of African-American slaves in the Lone Star State came a full two and a half years after Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, on a day known as Juneteenth and, since 1979, celebrated as a state holiday on June 19.
The core of the plot is a visit by June's cousin Lillie, from New York City. She is none too impressed by Texas or this celebration of a "slave holiday." Wesley beautifully charts the girls' growing friendship, and Sharon Wilson's illustrations bring the text alive. Anyone who has seen two sassy little girls going at each other with hands on hips and lips stuck out will recognize the dead-on accuracy of the postures. The muted colors of Wilson's illustrations combine perfectly with Wesley's gentle text.
The author of "Where Do I Go From Here?" and "Afro-Bets Book of Black Heroes From A to Z" as well as the Tamara Hayle adult mystery series, Valerie Wesley makes the language in "Freedom's Gifts" sing. For children 8 and older, the ones who read independently but still like lots of illustrations, this is a delightful treat.
Scott Russell Sanders's book, "A Place Called Freedom," stumbles leaving the blocks. From the opening paragraph ("The master of that big house set us free in the spring of 1832") to the time that Papa, in what has to be the all-time record for bountiful harvests, raises enough cash to buy his own land in one season, it glosses over the horrors and difficulties faced by newly freed slaves.
Even coming from a 7-year-old narrator, many of the statements (like "Again and again Papa went back to Tennessee and each time he came home with more of the folks we loved") beg for some explanation. How did Papa accomplish such miraculous feats? The reader is left with the impression that leaving slavery was as simple as packing up and hitting the road.
Sanders is the author of many books for children, but the language here is sometimes awkward. The young narrator describes the land along the Wabash, "where the dirt was as black as my skin" -- hardly the kind of comparison an African-American would make in the 1830's. Until the mid-1960's, being called "black" was considered extremely pejorative by most African-Americans.
Even Thomas B. Allen's sensitive, beautifully drawn pastel illustrations, particularly lovely depicting people at work, are unable to make "A Place Called Freedom" seem an accurate portrayal of the growth of a free African-American town.
"Celebration!," written by Jane Resh Thomas and illustrated by Raul Colon, is a snapshot of an African-American family's annual Fourth of July picnic. Although grins abound (annoyingly so) in Colon's exuberant watercolor, etched paper and colored pencil illustrations, there is a lot of pain crammed into this slender book. What with Grandpa's stroke, Maurice's shoplifting, Uncle Frank's drinking problem, the appearance of buppie Uncle Charlie in his Bermuda shorts and the consumption of uncooked hot dogs, there seems to be scant cause for this group's levity.
Most problematic is the way the story brushes uncomfortably close to stereotypes. We meet the apparently unmarried "broody old hen" Aunt Lou, with her six young children; the basketball-obsessed Maurice, who wants to change his name to Michael to honor Michael Jordan; and Kenny, who constantly practices shuffling cards and (in a line that made me go back several times to make sure I hadn't misread it) aspires to be a tap dancer when he grows up.
"Celebration!" also has some false notes. One of the young girls in the story has a doll described as "her best brown doll," which simply does not ring true. If the story were being told about a white child, a line about "her best pink doll" would be jarring -- the converse is equally unsettling. There is also a passage that describes Uncle Frank bringing boxes of sparklers to the party, yet the illustration shows him carrying what appear to be boxes of videocassette tapes (they even seem to have "VHS" written on the sides).
These flaws keep "Celebration!" from hitting its stride. Since we learn so much negative information about this family so quickly, we come to think that instead of getting together to celebrate, they've come together to dish the dirt on the late arrivals. Which from an adult perspective is, I suppose, probably a little too much like a real family reunion -- but not enough like a story for 4- to 8-year-olds.

DOO-DAH!
 Stephen Foster and the Rise
 of American Popular Culture.
 By Ken Emerson.
 Illustrated. 400 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $30. 
 Popular music exists to make everything we hold pure -- traditions, styles, techniques, ethnic and racial boundaries -- impure. It bastardizes and crossbreeds whatever it finds, and that includes our definitions of good and bad taste. The good, the bad and the shameless are right in there together; they inflect (or infect) one another within an instant or a microtone.
No songwriter illustrates this better than Stephen Foster. You know his songs; you probably sang them at some impressionable stage in your youth, complete with gimcrack Negro dialect or genteel Anglo-Saxon versifying: "Beautiful Dreamer," "Oh! Susanna," "Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair," "Old Folks at Home" and "Camptown Races." Foster's once-celebrated slave elegy "Old Black Joe" is shamefully easy to confuse with his once-celebrated canine elegy "Old Dog Tray," but "My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!" and "Hard Times Come Again No More" are still as easy to love as they are to sing.
Foster was the first professional American songwriter to show that the United States was capable of achieving cultural as well as political independence from Europe. Ken Emerson's "Doo-dah!" (as in "De Camptown ladies sing dis song / Doo-dah! Doo-dah!") is aptly subtitled "Stephen Foster and the Rise of American Popular Culture." It is a vigorous, thoroughly researched, amiably chatty tour through his life and his times.
Foster was born on July 4, 1826, as the nation was marking its 50th year of independence from England. He died in 1864, one year before the end of the country's second struggle for independence, the Civil War. His life as a songwriter drew on every national and cultural conflict. His songs incorporate the tradition of feminized, Euro-American lyricism and that of masculinized, Afro-Americanized minstrelsy (styles in whiteface versus styles in blackface). Proslavery pieties are layered over intimations of abolitionism. Art song aspirations are found alongside folk song imitations. Hymns and chaste parlor ballads cohabit with polkas, jigs, breakdowns and rowdy buck dances.
Foster grew up in Pittsburgh just as his prosperous family began a decline into shabby and resentful gentility. His earliest sense was of bygone pleasures and glories. Adored by his mother and tolerated by his father, he turned out to be good for nothing but music, dropping in and out of schools, rejecting careers in the Army and Navy, and fleeing the business world that his brothers kept working in and his father kept failing in. Small wonder that his musical imagination veered toward the naive, the elegiac and the Edenic. Whether in the highbrow parlor tradition or the lowbrow minstrel vein, his songs evoke a world of bourgeois prettiness he had lost or a world of plantation griefs and joys he had never experienced.
"Not once in his entire career," Emerson tells us, "did Stephen Foster write a song . . . that alluded to Pittsburgh. He was in deep denial, if not outright defiance, of the economic, political, racial and even environmental realities of the city where he passed most of his life."
But in fact if not in fiction, popular culture always thrives on technology and industry. Improvements in transportation, printing and communications made Foster's songwriting career possible, though copyright laws kept it from being very remunerative. "Oh! Susanna," published in 1848, was his first hit; it became an anthem for the gold rush and the temperance movement, and was translated into languages as far-flung as Latin and Hindi. Foster gave it to his publisher for nothing, and the publisher made something like $10,000 from it.
It was the presence of new (or at least fresh) music in the United States that made Foster's songs last. His music responded more readily than his lyrics to what was contemporary and unsanctioned. He responded to the Irish, Scottish and English ballads that were being imported and amended. He responded to all kinds of dance forms. And most important, he responded to the vulgar, heady minstrel show, with its love-hate ties to African-Americans and to music-theater miscegenation. (Minstrelsy swept the country in the 19th century just as ragtime, jazz and rock would in the 20th.)
Inevitably, he got caught in the middle of America's continuing race and culture wars. "Mr. Foster possesses more than ordinary abilities as a composer; and we hope he will soon realize enough from his Ethiopian melodies to enable him to afford to drop them and turn his attention to the production of a higher kind of music," a writer for a journal called The Musical World pontificated in 1853. "We were glad to learn from Mr. F. that he intends to devote himself principally hereafter to the production of 'White men's' music."
Not long before, Foster had written an anguished letter to the leader of the minstrel troupe that performed -- and took credit for composing -- his blackface melodies. He had left his name off them, he said, "owing to the prejudice against them by some, which might injure my reputation as a writer of another style of music, but I find that by my efforts I have done a great deal to build up a taste for the Ethiopian songs among refined people by making the words suitable to their taste, instead of the trashy and really offensive words which belong to some songs of that order. Therefore I have concluded to reinstate my name on my songs and to pursue the Ethiopian business without fear or shame. . . . I find I cannot write at all unless I write for the public approbation and get credit for what I write."
He got credit, he made the best living he could, and in the end he drank most of that living and much of his talent away. Foster died at the age of 37 at Bellevue Hospital in New York City.
Emerson, a former editor at New York Newsday and The New York Times Magazine, wants his book to be a cultural epic, and to that end he has surrounded Foster with a huge cast of well-known characters. Harriet Beecher Stowe makes a brief appearance (Foster's original title for "My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!" was "Poor Uncle Tom, Good Night"). So does Louis Moreau Gottschalk, who incorporated Foster's Ethiopian melodies into a symphony. So does Martin Delany, the black radical, who turned "Old Uncle Ned," Foster's treacly lament for a dead slave, into an abolitionist's revenge anthem. Assorted 19th-century writers are quoted liberally, as are assorted 20th-century cultural historians.
EMERSON continually compares minstrelsy to rock-and-roll, and he's right to, though he names too many names along the way (Elvis, the Beach Boys, Berry Gordy, John Lennon, the Beastie Boys). He is also right (and more precise) when he shows how quickly certain stylistic and commercial pop conventions were codified: the sexual segregation of the marketplace, for instance, into male performers and female consumers; the struggle between the music people loved and the music they respected; the nasty racial and ethnic conflicts side by side with canny racial and ethnic collaborations.
Can a writer help taking on some of his subject's best and worst characteristics? Emerson keeps emphasizing the unsettling divisions in Foster's life and work: the way he veered from melancholy to ebullience, shrewdness to near-hopeless naivete, conservative to progressive impulses. His own book keeps veering from historical minutiae to grand metaphorical assertion. It is not that both don't belong there; it's that for all the book's virtues, they're a little out of control. The intentions are exactly right. The proportions are slightly off.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
London, From the Outskirts In

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
EARLY one morning in May, I saw a red fox in Holland Park in London. It scurried across the lawn in the Kyoto Garden before vanishing into a rhododendron bush. Amazed, I sank down onto a bench, wondering whether the Mad Hatter would turn up next.
Later, I learned that foxes aren't uncommon in the leafy precincts of Holland, Regent's and Hyde Parks. But spotting one seemed an intimate encounter with the city I had known only as a collection of tourist attractions: the Tower of London, the theaters of the West End, Buckingham Palace. 
 Returning just to deepen my acquaintance with the city would have been reason enough for another trip. But since my last visit two years ago, London has become energized and flush, with a rebounding economy, hopeful new Labor Government and tourists arriving in flocks.
The influx has affected prices, particularly in sophisticated new restaurants, where pies and roasts have given way to entrees like medallions of rare tuna in wasabi sauce and the bill for a three-course dinner is generally 50 percent higher than in New York.
Finding reasonably priced lodgings in London has always been a challenge. Recently, a number of small boutique hotels have opened with theatrical rooms for $100 to $140, and a hostel with a futuristic theme called the Generator has come to Bloomsbury. But for those who just want a clean, quiet, inexpensive place to sleep, the choices are the same as ever: B & B's in private homes and budget hotels along confusingly similar 19th-century terraces, providing full English breakfasts and cramped, rather characterless rooms in the $65 to $100 range, with sinks (or en suite baths for $15 to $35 more).
So I decided to seek out three places to stay (for two nights each) in interesting neighborhoods -- in the hope that the areas themselves would lend color to otherwise bland budget accommodations. It wouldn't trouble me if the neighborhoods were some distance from the heart of the city, because I knew I could trust London's mass-transit system to take me into central London whenever I wanted. But mostly, I planned to settle in, eat at restaurants favored by residents, and find out what there was to see close at hand.
I had in mind areas like hip Notting Hill, Camden Town, with its popular weekend market, and the recently revitalized Docklands, a development of condos and office buildings among the old warehouses of the East End. But there are almost no budget hotels in these places, so I chose Kensington, just south of Notting Hill, Marylebone, in easy reach of Regent's Park and Camden Town, and Greenwich, connected to the Docklands by a foot tunnel under the River Thames.
The Abbey House Hotel in Kensington is a budget London classic, on a peaceful Victorian square surrounding a pretty little private garden just west of Kensington Palace. The Abbey and the Vicarage next door are the only hotels in the immediate area. When I arrived, a young American student who'd just finished a course at the nearby Kensington Campus of King's College and her fatigued mother were lugging huge suitcases up the elegantly balustraded stairs. There was no bellboy, or even an elevator, and my small single (about $65) was on the third floor.
I know people who have baths the size of this room. But a comfortable single bed, TV, armoire, desk and chair fit in it (with the toilet and shower rooms just down the hall), and there was a big window overlooking the square.
Bounded by prim Kensington Gardens to the east, shaggier Holland Park to the west, the 250-foot spire of the Gothic Revival St. Mary Abbots Church to the south and a useful Underground stop (Notting Hill Gate) to the north, Kensington has a well-off, settled air. Open curtains revealed handsomely furnished living rooms and in one case, a maid, wearing the sort of white and black uniform you normally only see in Marx Brothers films.
Department stores line Kensington High Street, but its bustle gives way to antique shops on Kensington Church Street. A block east, a graceful private road with a guard booth and foreign embassies leads directly to Kensington Palace, a stately building that became a royal residence in the reign of William and Mary, and was renovated by two great Renaissance architects, Christopher Wren and Nicholas Hawksmoor (admission $8.50). The Princess of Wales, Princess Margaret and the Duke and Duchess of Kent have apartments there (which, of course, you can't see), but the beautiful bed in which Queen Victoria was born in 1819 impressed me most.
The sunken garden, Orangerie tea house, bushes trimmed to look like gumdrops and Round Pond nearby are beautiful, too, providing a striking contrast to the romantic disorder of Holland Park. It spreads across 54 acres surrounding Holland House, built in 1605 but so heavily damaged during the Blitz that it now remains a dreamy sort of ruin. The restored east wing, is occupied by a hostel, where those who don't mind dormitory accommodations can find a bed-and-breakfast for about $30 a night.
I liked to roam in the park, spotting moorhens, sparrow hawks and Londoners taking the sun in shockingly skimpy bathing suits. Then I'd retire to a pub nearby called Windsor Castle, serving light fare like mussels cooked in the Belgian way with leeks and cream ($10), or to Geale's Fish Restaurant just off Notting Hill Gate, where I finally understood why the English are so mad about fish and chips. I've never tasted fried fish as delicious as the haddock I had there ($11).
ON my last afternoon in the neighborhood, I wandered north into Notting Hill, once crowned by a race course called the Hippodrome and later by more Victorian terraces occupied by wave after wave of immigrants from Ireland, eastern Europe and the Caribbean.
The neighborhood hit hard times in the 1950's, but has since rebounded in its own funky way, with a rambunctious August street fair that draws pop music fans from all over Europe, the headquarters of Virgin Records in an old dock by the Grand Union Canal, trendy restaurants and bars like Beach Blanket Babylon, and a market on Portobello Road. There, fruit and vegetable peddlers call out their wares as if in a musical comedy, shops sell or rent glad rags from the 60's, and on a cross street, Blenheim Crescent, I chanced upon the Travel Bookshop, where I spent a blissful hour.
The move to Marylebone was something of a shock, particularly when the first thing I saw upon ascending to the street from the Baker Street station was a tout in a checkered cape, with a pipe, urging me to visit the Sherlock Holmes Museum, near Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum. I didn't bother with either, though the lines at Madame Tussaud's made me wonder what I was missing.
Instead, I got to know Marylebone, once a village named for St. Mary-le-bourne outside the city of London with a twisting main street known as Marylebone Lane, and still more terrace homes facing their own private gardens. On Paddington Street, I dined on swordfish tandoori ($15) and a delicious eggplant dish called bonjon ($8.50) in an Afghan restaurant, Caravan Serai.
And around the corner in a French bakery called Patisserie Valerie on Marylebone High, I learned that Londoners really prefer croissants and cafe au lait to those big, unvarying English hotel breakfasts -- a cereal course, followed by eggs, sausage or bacon, grilled vegetables and cold toast.
That's what they served at the Hart House Hotel on Gloucester Place where I stayed while in Marylebone -- an exceptionally well-kept place on a Georgian terrace favored by refugee aristocrats during the French Revolution. Recently renovated, the hotel has handsome trappings: patterned carpets and matching bedspreads and curtains, spotless shared baths and $83 single rooms slightly larger than those at the Abbey House.
All of the singles overlook Gloucester Place, a noisy bus route. After one night, I told the front desk clerk that I'd have to leave if she couldn't find me a quieter room (Gloucester Place has plenty of lodging alternatives). So she gave me a deal on a spacious, tranquil double in the back, normally $117, but $102 for the aggrieved.
Buses may be noisy, but they do help you get around, as I found when I caught a red double-decker on Gloucester Place (for $1.55) to the Camden Town market on a balmy Saturday afternoon. There, stalls selling clothes, food, tapes, jewelry, used furniture and bric-a-brac spill out from Chalk Farm Road. I had vegetable curry for lunch ($4.25) at one called the Hungry Elephant, followed by a scoop of lemon sorbet at Marine Ices ($1.70).
A long, narrow canal boat called the Jenny Wren still plies a small section of the Regent's Canal, which passes through Regent's Park and Camden Town on its way to the River Thames. The canal was built around 1820 by George IV's favorite architect, John Nash, who was also responsible for Regent's Park and a number of the stately neo-classical terraces that surround it.
I took the Jenny Wren one way ($6) to the pretty canal-side hamlet of Maida Vale, passing the old Gilbey's Gin Factory, London Central Mosque and long-horned sheep grazing in the London Zoo along the way. When I debarked, I found a picturesque spot for a cappuccino, the Cafe Laville, built atop a tunnel that spans the canal at Edgware Road.
From there it was about a 20-minute walk to glorious Regent's Park, which Nash conceived as a residential estate for "the wealthy and the good." A few mansions were built, like St. John's Lodge, with a pretty secret garden, but eventually its sweeping greenswards, serpentine lake and manicured Inner Circle were opened to the public.
The zoo and an open-air theater were added this century, as was Queen Mary's Garden in the gated Inner Circle -- like a page out of a Laura Ashley catalogue, where neat beds of roses tilt their heads to the sun, couples picnic beneath bowers and little girls in Mary Janes chase butterflies. If you cross over Bayswater Road to the north, you can climb to the top of Primrose Hill for a nonpareil view of the city from St. Paul's to Westminster.
Maybe it was this that made me yearn for central London again. So the next day, I took the subway to the Victoria and Albert Museum, primarily to see Raphael's tapestry cartoons and a special exhibit called "The Cutting Edge: 50 Years of British Fashion," showcasing the work of English designers from 1947 to the present (admission $8.50). The fancy dresses there were divine, especially a cream satin strapless gown designed in 1957 by Norman Hartnell for the Queen, a remarkable green silk neo-rococo creation by Vivienne Westwood, "Watteau 1996," and a black crepe mini-dress by Mary Quant I wondered whether I could pull off wearing.
Marylebone has its own splendid museum, the Wallace Collection, which is free. It is in the dignified Hertford House on Manchester Square, which remains largely as it was in 1897 when Lady Wallace gave her late husband's art treasures to the state. Its 18th-century French paintings rival the Louvre's, including frothy works by Fragonard, Boucher and Watteau, and there is Sevres porcelain, arms and armor and other riches.
To reach Greenwich, I took an excursion boat ($9.50 one way) from Westminster Pier five miles down the River Thames around the Isle of Dogs, which is really a peninsula. The garden at its southern tip is a stop on the new Docklands Light Railway, an elevated train that takes East Enders along the north bank of the river to a station near the Tower of London. Island Gardens also looks across the Thames to one of London's most magnificent sights -- the Queen's House, the National Maritime Museum next door, the twin-domed Naval College, the Old Royal Observatory at the summit of Greenwich Park and the filigreed rigging of the Cutty Sark berthed at the dock.
Many visitors to London make Greenwich the subject of a day trip, but you can't begin to see it in so short a time. I'd planned to stay for two nights, though it wasn't easy finding accommodations because the town has just one rather unattractive hotel, the Mitre, which is a pub with nicely renovated rooms upstairs, and a handful of B & B's. I stayed at one of them, lured by the $34 rate.
It was about a 20-minute walk west of the dock, in an area of row houses and housing complexes where the town's charm peters out. But the owners, Chris and Carol Courtney, made all the difference, introducing me to other guests from Hong Kong and France, offering me coffee and dessert in the evenings, and chatting over breakfast about subjects as varied as a single European currency and the peccadillos of the royal family. My first-floor single was a little dark, but comfortable, the shared baths were clean and when I snooped around, I found three other rooms more pleasant than mine.
In two days, I managed to tour the Queen's House; jog around the observatory bisected by the Prime Meridian; meander east along the River Walk to the Trafalgar Tavern, built in 1837, for a sunset gin and tonic; sample a chicken and mushroom pie at Goddard's Pie and Eel Shop on Greenwich Church Street ($3.60); walk through the foot tunnel to the Isle of Dogs to catch a ride into London on the Docklands Light Railway, and take in an exhibit at the Maritime Museum on the exploits of Admiral Nelson, who went to sea at age 12 and became one of England's greatest heroes. (Admission to the Queen's House, Maritime Museum and Old Royal Observatory costs $9.35 total, but I got it for a 20 percent discount by showing my Thames cruise ticket stub).
On my last night, I splurged on dinner at a simple but elegant small restaurant called the Spread Eagle in Greenwich, with a prix fixe menu for $29. I ordered smooth, delicious celery and stilton soup, followed by chicken fricassee. Usually, I pore over a guidebook while at meals. But this time I tucked mine away, and sat there like an habitue.
 
The bottom line: Central London is but a train or boat away
I spent an average of $106 a day while in London, including $60 for accommodations.
To reach London from New York in mid-May, I bought a round-trip ticket from an airline wholesaler, Discount Travel International, 169 West 81st Street, New York, N.Y., 10024; (212) 362-3636. I flew on Virgin Atlantic for $437.

Restoring a Fine Khmer Craft Rent by Revolution

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia

 BODY:
IN 1995, KIKUO MORIMOTO, a Japanese weaver and textile expert, traveled by motorcycle, by boat and on foot through the forests and jungles of Cambodia in search of master weavers. Everywhere he went, he showed pieces of boldly patterned Khmer silks taken from 19th-century costumes and temple hangings to shopkeepers in hopes of finding weavers who were still producing such work.
For centuries, men had raised the silkworms, and women had tie-dyed the yarns and woven them into ikat fabrics, for which Cambodia was renowned. Then in 1970, when civil war broke out, women had to abandon their looms. Five years later under the Khmer Rouge, families were uprooted and forced into slave labor, digging canals and working fields far from their own villages. As a result, traditional silk weaving ceased, natural dyes disappeared, silkworms vanished, and the mulberry trees, grown for the leaves fed to the silkworms, were left untended and died. 
 In his travels, Mr. Morimoto visited 50 villages in 8 provinces, and what he found was that as Cambodian society begins to return to normalcy some looms are humming again. Today, affluent women are seeking the brilliantly colored silks that for centuries have been worn in costumes on national holidays or hung behind the Buddhist statues in their temples and homes.
"We want to restore weaving to Cambodian village life," said Mr. Morimoto, who at 49 divides his time between here and Bangkok, Thailand, where his wife and children live. He has spent the last 15 years teaching traditional dyeing and weaving techniques primarily in the refugee camps in Thailand and Cambodia. The goal of his trip was to conduct a survey of Cambodian weaving, a study that was commissioned by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
After he completed his research and submitted his report, Mr. Morimoto set up the Institute for Khmer Traditional Textiles, of which he is the acting director. The institute is helping to revive traditional weaving in Cambodian villages. The bulk of its financial support, $50,000 a year for the last two years, comes from the Japan Foundation, a Government agency that supports cultural exchanges, and the institute is housed in a two-story studio in Takhmau, a town about 10 miles southwest of here.
Mr. Morimoto's efforts are attracting the attention of textile experts far from here. When H. Leedom Lefferts Jr., an American, visited the studio last December, he was impressed by what he saw.
"In addition to producing fabrics for their own clothes, weaving gives Cambodian women a supplementary income," said Mr. Lefferts, an expert on Southeast Asian textiles who is a professor of anthropology at Drew University in Madison, N.J. "Most important of all, it gives them a role in Khmer culture."
These days, thanks largely to Mr. Morimoto's efforts, traditional weaving is on the upswing in Cambodia. Mr. Morimoto planted 60 mulberry trees of different varieties in the front yard of the institute's studio and expects to raise silkworms there too in the future. The silkworms raised in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, he said, produce distinctive yellow yarns that are finer, stronger and more lustrous than the white ones found elsewhere in Asia.
Under Mr. Morimoto's direction, a pilot program of silkworm cultivation has begun in the village of Takov in Kampot province, some 75 miles south of the capital. There a team of 43 villagers, including 15 who are mostly in their 60's and 70's, are involved, in cultivating silkworms using methods they learned in their childhood.
Most of the 17 skilled weavers he discovered in his research now work for the institute, and in contrast to former times when only women did the weaving, three of them are men. The weavers restore old fabrics and reproduce the kind of 19th-century ikats that Mr. Morimoto carried with him on his travels two years ago. The yarns used in the ikats are tie-dyed to create the geometric, linear and figurative images of flowers, elephants and people that pattern these fabrics. The weavers work on old looms found by Mr. Morimoto in marketplaces throughout the country.
SOON THESE FABRICS WILL BE available for sale and provide an economic boost for a country where 80 percent of the people still live in rural areas. The weavers have formed a cooperative that will produce and market fabrics later this year. Eventually, they hope to export them to the United States and Europe.
Mr. Lefferts, who calls himself a "mainland Southeast Asian chauvinist," views Mr. Morimoto's project and similar work done by UNESCO as proof that Cambodia has much to offer the world today.
"It's very important that this be recognized -- by Cambodians and everyone else," he said. "These projects will help restore the ethnic Khmer identity. Cambodians produced some of the finest weaving in the world prior to 1970. Now Khmer hand weaving, which in my book is absolutely first rate, may become available worldwide."

Street Crime Plagues Papua New Guinea

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea

 BODY:
DON'T go onto the golf course alone. Don't go out to eat on Fridays, when people are getting drunk on their government salaries. Don't walk around too much. For goodness' sake, don't drive alone at night.
There is an epidemic of violent crime in Port Moresby (and to some extent in the rest of the country, too), and this is one of the most fearful cities in Asia. It is possible, if you ask around, to be warned off doing just about anything. 
 That would be a mistake.
Papua New Guinea is one of the most exotic, beautiful and unspoiled countries in Asia, with some of its most charming and friendly people. It would be a pity to miss meeting and chatting with highland villagers wearing grass skirts and feather headdresses. Even in the cities, men and women in Western clothes sometimes place a bright green leaf or a flower in their hair, just for the pleasure of it.
Most visitors come on organized tours, a good way to enjoy the country's pleasures and avoid street crime.
The tourism industry here is still young, and overdevelopment has not yet reached Papua New Guinea. A visitor has a choice of scuba diving amid the coral reefs, visits to tribal ceremonies or tours of wildlife sanctuaries that are home to multitudes of brightly colored birds and the world's largest butterflies, with black and green wings more than a foot long.
But the violence is real and pervasive, and caution is particularly in order at this moment of political turmoil in Papua New Guinea. A brief, peaceful military revolt last March led to two days of rioting and looting in Port Moresby.
Prime Minister Julius Chan, who had angered the military by hiring mercenaries to control rebels on the eastern island of Bougainville, stepped aside temporarily and defused the violence, but the Government crisis is not over and instability could return.
The long-running separatist insurgency on Bougainville has caused the Government to withdraw police, medical and other services, and it is a place of particular lawlessness and instability. Travel there is restricted by the Government.
Quite apart from politics, though, Port Moresby has become increasingly unstable, with a large-scale influx of unemployed young men over the years. As many as 90 percent of young men in the city have no job, by some estimates. And although there are no reliable figures on rising crime, there is broad agreement here that the problem is getting worse.
Most Americans in this nation of 4.4 million people are missionaries or anthropologists. Just 300 Americans live in the capital, which has a population of nearly 300,000, and their homes sometimes resemble small fortresses.
The United States Embassy cautions visitors, stating in a consular information sheet, "Crime and personal security are serious concerns in Papua New Guinea."
Most at risk are women traveling alone. Rapes, sometimes by groups of men, are common.
A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the rapes were part of an attitude of "fundamental disrespect for women" that "this country has to get over."
The consular information sheet also says: "Armed robberies and carjackings are a major problem throughout the country. Criminals occasionally victimize and rob people in large crowds, such as those at sporting events, concerts or political rallies. Hiking in rural areas and visiting isolated public areas such as parks, golf courses, beaches or cemeteries can be dangerous."
The embassy cautions about travel outside Port Moresby at night because bandits sometimes set up roadblocks to rob passengers in cars and buses. And it repeats the common warning to drivers here not to stop in case of an accident but to head directly to the nearest police or Government office.
"Reactions by crowds after road accidents in Papua New Guinea can be emotional and violent," the information sheet says. "Crowds form quickly after an accident and may attack those that they hold responsible or burn their vehicles."
In general, the Western diplomat said: "There is a lack of effective law enforcement. Something could happen at any place, any time, so you are constantly on your guard."
Government officials did not respond to requests for comment.
In April, a National Court judge, Timothy Hinchliffe, lamented the rise in violent crime, particularly among teen-age boys. He pointed to Bougainville as one of the most frightening examples of this.
"It is an example of what happens to a place when the youths grow up to be lawbreakers and have no respect for human life," he said. "The community crumbles until there is almost nothing left. People live in fear and misery, and sadly, that is Bougainville."

Life or Death? Stay Tuned

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES 

 BODY:
"NEWS RADIO" ISN'T THE ONLY
show being kept alive by heroic measures. Here are some other series that are ailing, with a network's hand hovering near the plug, and what the networks are doing this fall to encourage miracle recoveries. ANITA GATES
 
ELLEN On April 30, the coming-out episode for prime time's first lesbian title character was watched by 40 million or so Americans. But the next week, only 12.3 million tuned in to watch her share the news with her parents. Ellen DeGeneres's sitcom, which began as "These Friends of Mine" (with completely different friends) in the spring of 1994, still has a lot to prove to ABC. 
 The network's strategy: Move the show a half-hour later, to Wednesdays at 9:30 P.M., to cash in on the strong "Drew Carey Show" lead-in and to get as far away from the family hour as a 30-minute show can get. ("Ellen" started out last season on Wednesdays at 8.)
 
JUST SHOOT ME NBC's sitcom about an unemployed broadcaster forced to work for her womanizing father's womanizing magazine. This one, starring Laura San Giacomo and George Segal, had its premiere in March, in the Wednesdays at 9:30 time slot, and was not a hit with critics or viewers. But it's back for next season.
 The network's strategy: Put it on Tuesdays at 9:30, right after "Frasier."
 
THE NAKED TRUTH After the show's premiere in fall 1995, Tea Leoni lasted only a season on ABC as a wacky tabloid photographer and divorcee. Earlier this year the series moved to NBC, Ms. Leoni's character became a columnist-reporter, and the tabloid got a new editor: George Wendt, a touch of "Cheers." But even the slot between "Seinfeld" and "E.R." didn't make this show a hit.
The network's strategy: Try a last-ditch time slot, Mondays at 9:30, between "Caroline in the City" and "Date-
line NBC."
 
PROMISED LAND In this spinoff of CBS's "Touched by an Angel," Gerald McRaney is the head of a family that travels America in a camper looking for people to do good deeds for. Critics have called it charmless and "skippable" and the ratings are disappointing, but CBS contends that the network is behind the show all the way.
The network's strategy: Move the show to Thursdays at 8 as an alternative for viewers who consider "Friends" too sexy.
 
SPIN CITY Michael J. Fox was so adorable as a Presidential aide in the film "The American President" that ABC made him a Deputy Mayor of New York in this sitcom. The show held its own in its first season, against "Caroline in the City" (Tuesdays at 9:30), but ABC had promoted it heavily and expected more. The producers have already moved Mr. Fox's character's live-in girlfriend out of town. Between now and fall, they'll decide whether to put the emphasis in future scripts on his sanity-challenging work life (coping with a Mayor who's out to lunch and a press secretary who can't be trusted) or his love life (baby-faced bachelor on the loose in Manhattan).
The network's strategy: Move the show to Wednesdays at 8. That's early for a sophisticated comedy, but the competition consists of "The Nanny" and the new "Tony Danza Show," neither of which is likely to be accused of sophistication any time soon.

HEADLINE: Seeing Upswing For U.S.

BYLINE: By BARBARA HALL 

DATELINE: BRONXVILLE

 BODY:
MICHAEL ELLIOTT and his wife, Emma Oxford, are at home here this morning -- hospitable and at ease. Mr. Elliott, from Liverpool, England, is on a roll these days. Last year, he became editor of Newsweek's three international magazines, and before that, he had been Washington bureau chief for The Economist.
Simon & Schuster published his book "The Day Before Yesterday: Reconsidering America's Past, Rediscovering the Present" last year. It is good natured without being saccharin. Mr. Elliott debunks the notion, held dear by many observers of the American scene, that America is in a state of decline. In short, he suggests that the naysayers wrongfully compare our times to the Golden Age -- the boom Americans basked in just after World War II. This period, he writes, was followed by the traumas of a Presidential assassination, the Vietnam War, Watergate and the end of the Cold War in 1989. 
 The book's premise is that the United States has attained a maturity after years of jarring change, and within the folds of that maturity are the seeds of stability and hope.
Mr. Elliott was asked to expand on his observations in the book. "Yes, the country is on the upswing," he said. "If I was writing a concluding chapter to the book -- which I'll be doing for the paperback -- I'd consider the growing signs of the new, surprising stability after years of fragmentation."
On politics, he said the paltry turnout for the 1996 election did not faze him. "It was about picayune issues rather than grand issues," he said. "It was the stuff of consultants and spin doctors. The low turnout was quite natural at a time when people were generally satisfied."
On the inauguration in January, he said it was a ceremony that in its essentials is 200 years old. "There is no other democracy which has a ceremonial introduction of a new political leader within an unbroken tradition," he said.
Turning to another subject, he said that baby boomers seem to be seeking what he called eternal truths. This may account for an increase in religious observance across the country, and it may also account for the popularity of books like William Bennett's "Book of Virtues," he said.
"The book's popularity reflects a sense at the end of the 60's and 70's that there had to be a better way."
In his book, Mr. Elliott writes that this yearning for meaning may derive from the dearth of folk memory in American society.
"It's all of a piece -- the concern for education, religion, a distrust of big government, an increase of local volunteerism," he said. "There's a sense of trying to find some roots, some fixed point, in times of turmoil and change. In education, we're asking more all the time of our teachers. We're probably asking too much. We're asking the schools to solve all our problems."
Then, in an exercise he called free association, he said: "I'm increasingly interested in friendship. Friendships really undergird people's social lives. It's not a subject that has been written up much."
And, he went on, not just friendships at home. "Civility and respect at work are not insignificant. It's not trivial to say people should treat each other with respect at work."
When asked about the role of women, he referred to the women here in Bronxville: "The women here are the backbones, the bedrock of the community. To me, it's astonishing. It's incredibly tough for them. They hold the community together, and throughout they can't be resentful."
As for women in the workplace, he said, "The next generation of women won't carry quite the weight of being pioneers."
On the issue of race in the United States, he said, "The old polarity between blacks and whites is on its way out now."
Hispanic Americans, he predicted, will be a major force on the American horizon, particularly in the cities.
He paused at this point, then returned to matters closer to home.
Mr. Elliott and his family lived in Washington for 10 years until less than a year ago, when they settled here.
Why Bronxville?
"We looked past Manhattan, at various suburbs. Bronxville appeared to be a genuine community. That is difficult to find.
"I'm impressed at how pleasantly old, indeed old-fashioned and established it is here.
"One of the pleasures of Bronxville is the schools, which are the hub of the community. Our daughters are 8 and 6 years old. They're into everything -- soccer, chess, computer club.
"We found a very warm, welcoming community of families and children."

HEADLINE: Bradley's Real Growth Is in Air Cargo

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
PEOPLE who fly out of Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks were not surprised to hear passenger traffic there increased last year by 5 percent, a faster pace than most airports in the Northeast. But even stronger growth is taking place in an area most people never see as they rush to the ticket counters for passage to Washington, D.C., or West Palm Beach: Cargo shipping was up 13.5 percent in 1996, to more than 261 million pounds. And it is cargo that gives the strength to Bradley's international designation, with regular shipments to Europe, Mexico and Africa. The growth shows no signs of slowing; in January alone, shippers reported moving 27.6 million pounds of cargo through Bradley, up 43 percent from the same month a year earlier.
"It's almost scary to see it increasing that rapidly," said Andre J. Libert, director of marketing and air service development for the State Department of Transportation, which runs Bradley. 
 "We are not trying to promote one over the other; it's just that one has the potential for more growth, namely cargo," said Charles P. Watras, chairman of the Bradley International Airport Commission. "Logan, Newark, J.F.K. -- they're all busting at the seams now. If they can't handle the increased traffic, it's up for grabs."
Daniel J. Carstens, publisher of Airport News and president of a freight operation in Windsor Locks, said cargo's contributions to the region's economy go largely unrecognized. "We all take for granted the Hamilton Standards and the Pratt & Whitneys in Connecticut, but there are 60 to 75 air freight companies operating out of Bradley alone," he said. "I bet most people who live here probably couldn't name 10 of them."
Last year Mr. Carstens was named operator of Foreign Trade Zone 71 at Bradley. Although the zone was authorized by Congress in 1981 it has never been activated; Mr. Carstens hopes for activation in a matter of months. Foreign trade zones give significant customs and tariff advantages to importers and exporters. Exports from foreign trade zones already exceed $17 billion a year, the Commerce Department reports.
"It will make it a lot more attractive to the cargo community in this region," Mr. Carstens predicted.
Two years ago four towns around the airport -- Windsor Locks, Suffield, East Granby and Windsor -- formed the Bradley Development League to promote economic activity, and members say they are beginning to see the potential of increased cargo shipments. James E. Maitland, chairman of the Windsor Locks Economic and Industrial Commission and a director of the league, said Lego, Kaman, Stanley Works, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft and Colt Firearms are among large companies in the Hartford area that rely heavily on international commerce.
"With the foreign trade zone, hopefully we can lower their costs," he said, "make them more competitive, and bring even more jobs and investment into the state."
Bradley earned a profit of $3.1 million in the fiscal year 1995-96, $900,000 more than the Transportation Department estimated it would, on revenues of $38.3 million. The airport handles nearly 262 flights daily and is served by 19 major, regional and low-fare carriers.
Improvements have seemed non-stop and last fall the state broke ground on an $8 million, 14,500-square-foot control tower and terminal radar approach control building to replace one built in 1951. It will be capable of handling more than 490,000 aircraft takeoffs and landings a year.
The 5 percent increase in Bradley passenger traffic last year was in marked contrast to what is happening at other airports. La Guardia in New York was down 0.5 percent, Kennedy International in New York was up 2 percent and Logan in Boston was up 1 percent.
But developments in cargo operations are far more dramatic. Federal Express last year expanded its service out of Bradley, adding larger planes. In mid-August of last year, three 747 international cargo flights a week to Manchester, England and Luxembourg went into service. In addition, the cargo carrier Arrow Air resumed operations at Bradley last fall. Currently, there is a request for proposals on a third cargo center on the airport grounds, because the two existing operations, one on the airport and the other off the grounds, are nearly at capacity.
Cargo shipping out of Bradley is still only a fraction of larger airports -- Newark International Airport shipped seven times as much, or 955,000 tons, last year. But Newark's total was up 9 percent, compared to Bradley's 13.5 percent gain.
And most officials involved with cargo shipping say a significant development came this year, when United Parcel Services began construction of a $41 million air cargo sorting operation. The state-of-the-art center will be ready for occupancy later this year, and is expected to be at full capacity in 2003, with 850 employees sorting 30,000 packages an hour.
"Those guys do a lot of homework before they choose a site," said Joseph R. Calsetta, general manager of Roncari Associates Inc., which operates 90,000 square feet of cargo space at Bradley and has handled flowers, chickens, oil filters, toys, pharmaceuticals and automobiles, among other products. "The fact that U.P.S. is at Bradley tells you something."
One thing that it tells you is that Bradley's location is getting a second look from many major shippers, officials say.
"You can make one landing at Bradley and serve Boston or New York or anyplace in between, and do it one heck of a lot cheaper than in either of those cities," said Mr. Libert. "Obviously, we're no Kennedy and we're no Logan, but we have some advantages -- no tolls, no tunnels, no labor problems, and things don't fall off the trucks."
Bradley also has a lot of unused space, about 750 acres on the airport itself, and an estimated 4,000 acres more in a five-mile circle around the runways.
"To get access to that much land in an arc around J.F.K., you'd probably be up into the Windsor area anyway," said Harry H. Freeman, economic development coordinator for the Town of Windsor. Mr. Freeman said Windsor is one of the few towns in the state that is a net importer of workers; it has 13,000 people of working age, and 19,000 jobs. There is a vacancy rate of less than 5 percent in the town's 6 million square feet of industrial space and 3 million square feet of class-A office space, and the town has added 200,000 square feet of new business development in just the last four years.
"We like to say we're the only ones growing faster than the Pequots," Mr. Freeman said, "and a lot of it is tied to the airport."
Local officials are trying to tie even more success to the airport. Alexander Oley Carp, executive director of the Suffield Economic Development Commission and a director of the Bradley Development League, said over the last couple of years the towns have been working with a Dutch company that imports cut flowers with the intention of putting in a warehouse that could handle their product.
"It started out specifically for cut flowers, but has since developed into something where we're considering all perishables -- flowers, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, and so on," Mr. Carp said. Several state agencies, banks and other groups have joined in the discussions, and the league is in the process of putting together a project development team to obtain financing and begin construction.
Newark, J.F.K. and Logan all have the capability of handling perishable goods. "At Bradley, what we're trying to do is consolidate all those efforts into a single access point, to make it easier for the distributors," Mr. Carp said.
Mr. Maitland said the biggest change locally has been that towns no longer see Bradley as an intruder, but as an integral part of the community. "In the past," he said, "Bradley was moving along quicker than the towns. The towns wanted to maintain their own identity. Now, everyone's putting those differences aside and saying, 'We have to make the airport work for us all.' "

HEADLINE: After Graduation, Heading for the State Line

BYLINE: By DIANE SIERPINA 

 BODY:
WHEN Connecticut's recent high school graduates pack their bags for college this summer and fall, more than 40 percent will be heading for schools -- and probably future jobs -- across the state's borders.
This major exportation of the state's best talent (the third biggest exodus in the nation behind New Jersey and Illinois) is not a new phenomenon. It's been going on since record-keeping began 40 years ago. But it's a growing concern among state educators, legislators and business leaders who fear that the continuing loss of high-skilled labor -- and a growing number of undereducated young people -- could jeopardize Connecticut's future economy. 
 Despite the seriousness of the problem, say state education officials, there is no systemic effort in Connecticut to promote the rich mix of collegiate institutions here among in-state high schoolers and their families or those from neighboring states.
"Is this problem of interest to the policymakers of Connecticut?" asked Joseph Zikmund, chief information officer for the Connecticut Department of Higher Education, who documents the statistics. "It certainly hasn't been thoroughly discussed since I've been here, which is the last seven years."
State Representative Robert Farr, a West Hartford Republican and ranking member of the Higher Education Subcommittee of the General Assembly's Appropriations Committee concurred. "The state is willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to promote sports and to promote tourism," he said, "but the economic impact of those industries pales in comparison to the economic impact of higher education and yet we've never made that connection, or appear not to. That's a great mystery to me."
Most of the state's 44 colleges (18 public, 25 independent and the Coast Guard Academy) could accommodate more students, said Mr. Zikmund. Although there's no way to define capacity, he maintained Connecticut consistently has been losing enrollment since a high of 170,000 students in 1989. There were 155,083 undergraduate and graduate students in the fall of 1996.
Mr. Zikmund estimates that if a Connecticut student spends a minimum $10,000 a year to attend college elsewhere, at least $100 million in Connecticut money flows to other states annually.
According to Mr. Zikmund's latest figures, 10,962 of the 25,661 new college students in 1994 (43 percent) left the state for college elsewhere while Connecticut imported 6,826 out-of-staters, for a net loss of 4,136 in new college students. That was, however, better than 1992, when the exportation rate was 48 percent, or 10,218 students. "It's a sign in the right direction," Mr. Zikmund said, "but we're still losing 10,000 students." All the change is based on the larger pool of students and the ability of more families to pay for college because of an improving economy, he surmised. Mr. Zikmund said he suspects the pattern continues today.
Educators have their theories why so many of the state's high schoolers go elsewhere to attend college. Tops are the higher costs of tuition and board here compared to other regions of the nation, the financial ability of many families to be selective, the recruitment efforts of colleges in neighboring states, the small geographic size of Connecticut and the simple desire to leave home and explore new places.
"Nationally, most students choose a college within 500 miles of home," explained Valerie Lewis, deputy commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Higher Education. "But 500 miles of home in Connecticut takes in a seven- or eight-state region. "There also is a perception, especially among higher income families, that there is prestige in attending an out-of-state school."
How to do a better job of marketing the state's higher education institutions? One problem, as always, is money. Departments are fighting just to retain their current budget lines, she said. More aggressive marketing and recruiting is being conducted by individual colleges and in pocket areas around the state, but not systemically, she said, adding that still more might be done with guidance counselors, parent associations, teachers and business groups.
Connecticut high schoolers are being drawn primarily to other New England schools, especially in Massachusetts -- the University of Rhode Island, Boston College, Boston University and Northeastern University in Boston, according to Mr. Zikmund's statistics.
Those students who leave New England altogether prefer schools in upstate New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., said John C. Hoy, president of the New England Board of Higher Education. The top four are Syracuse University, Ithaca University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Cornell University, he said.
"I have a feeling there is an interesting connection between upstate New York and New England," said Mr. Hoy. "The students are somehow comfortable there and these schools do a very good job of recruiting."
Carol Brophy of Fairfield said her two college-aged children did not even consider Connecticut schools, primarily because of lower tuition costs and larger financial aid packages from out-of-state schools. Son Christopher chose Arizona State University and daughter Corinne, Lafayette College in Easton, Pa.
Mr. Hoy, a former dean of admissions for Wesleyan University in Middletown, said Connecticut is doing far less than neighboring states to promote its collegiate institutions around the region.
"I don't think they have worked hard at it," he said. "For a decade, Connecticut has been very concerned with Connecticut's problems. It is less welcoming and less willing to tell the world about its rich economic resources. Connecticut has every single program a student could wish for that Massachusetts has."
Michael Gerber, president of the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, says the state's exportation rate would be a bigger problem if its independent colleges and universities, which attract 24,000 out-of-state undergraduate and post-graduate students annually, did not enjoy such good name recognition and reputations.
Federal and independent research indicates that where a student goes to college directly correlates to family income, parental education level and the desire to get away from home, he said. Nationally, just over 20 percent of college freshmen leave their state for college.
The state's exportation rate "concerns me," he said, "but I don't think there is a great deal from a policy point of view that can be done to change the behavior patterns of this group of young people."
Mr. Gerber said he is more concerned about the state's overall high school dropout rate of 16 percent (10 to 11 percent among Caucasians and Asian-Americans, 30 percent among African-Americans and 40 percent among Hispanics) and the fact that nearly 30 percent of all high school seniors in the state don't go to college at all.
"The jobs of the future are going to require more education," he emphasized. "Income and quality of life directly depend on education."
Ms. Lewis agreed. "We need everybody to be educated today," she said. "We can't afford to have folks who don't go to school. Even with a high school diploma, studies indicate that's not going to be enough to sustain the quality of life here in Connecticut."
Merit scholarships have been suggested by state legislators as a means of keeping Connecticut's brightest students at home, said Ms. Lewis, but the proposed programs have been limited in number and kind. Debates rage over using the state's limited resources for merit- or need-based financial aid.
"Three-quarters of the population of Connecticut feel that to go to the school of their choice, they need financial aid," said Ms. Lewis. "Need-based aid is a critical element in keeping a door open for those folks, whatever the door is. Very few families, even affluent families, have saved well for college."
In the last two days of its session this month, the General Assembly unanimously passed and sent to Gov. John G. Rowland a bill that would create the Connecticut Higher Education Trust, a broad college savings program administered by the state treasurer as a means of helping families afford higher education. Interest earned would not be taxable by the state until dispersed and then at the student's lower tax rate. But the bill does not require a student to attend a Connecticut college.
The state does not track whether students who leave Connecticut to attend college return home. But, said Mr. Zikmund, "Our presumption is most don't come back."
That presents Connecticut with a dilemma. "In periods of economic growth, Connecticut has imported skilled labor rather than grow its own," he said. And that, he explained, costs more money in recruitment.
Lauren Kaufman, vice president and director of the Education Foundation of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said the state's economy is doing well now and college graduates, especially with engineering, science-related and computer skills, are in high demand. "It's important we get the word out that there are lots and lots of job opportunities in the state," she added.
On the other hand, she said, "One of our problems is that we're pricing ourselves right out of the market. We're a very high cost state and it's hard for young people to establish themselves, buy a house and start a family."
The Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges has suggested, among other things, the development of a mentoring program to connect Connecticut college students with urban youngsters in an attempt to reduce the high school dropout rate, establishment of an economic development partnership between the academic and corporate communities and getting state officials together to create a plan to link higher education and economic development.
"The governor has been receptive to this," said Mr. Gerber.
State Senator Tom Gaffey, a Meriden Democrat, said, "The first step is to recognize where we haven't done the job and to try to focus on how we can do it much better. We've got to place a much higher priority on recruiting students to stay within the state of Connecticut."
Connecticut's high school graduates and work force generally are admired nationwide, state education and business leaders agree. It doesn't surprise them that the brightest students would be courted away. "Our students are in high demand," said Tom Murphy, spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Education.
Added Mr. Gerber, "where a person lives after graduation depends more on where he can get a job." If the jobs are here, he said, "I think they will come home."

HEADLINE: A Festival Is Focus Of Urban Effort

BYLINE: By PEGGY McCARTHY 

 BODY:
IT took about 20 years, but in downtown Charleston, S.C., where once there was only blight, now there is a vital tourist destination.
Dilapidated, boarded-up, 18th- and 19th-century mansions have been freshened up and 50 restaurants operate when two decades earlier there were only two. Saks Fifth Avenue anchors a high-rent shopping district. 
 Hotels offer about 10,000 rooms. People from around the country have chosen the city for their second homes or retirement.
In New Haven, two community activists are convinced a similar rebirth can happen and they have borrowed a Charleston concept to attract people: a performing arts festival. In Charleston, it's Spoleto U.S.A., started in 1979 and, according to South Carolina Gov. David Beasley, the spark for a a $1 billion economic impact.
In downtown New Haven, it's the International Festival of Arts and Ideas. Last year, 60,000 people attended the inaugural event, which featured hundreds of performers and artists, including South African singing group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Panamanian salsa musician Ruben Blades, the Shanghai Quartet, the Beijing Opera and Cirque Baroque, a French circus-theater troupe.
The second festival, which organizers hope will attract 80,000 people, opens Wednesday with a parade and runs through next Sunday. Among the 200 events are jazz and film festivals as well as classical, salsa, klezmer, blues, gospel and folk/rock music, street performers, a rough and tumble "Antony and Cleopatra," and children's entertainment ranging from storytelling to hands-on activities.
Festivals and other events aimed at promoting tourism are the latest trend among cities seeking economic development, said Dr. Norman J. Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. "Some have been successful at it, others haven't," he added.
The New Haven festival started with Anne Tyler Calabresi, 62, a Woodbridge resident and a founder of programs for city children. As the wife of Guido Calabresi, who was dean of the Yale University School of Law for 39 years, she has been an integral member of the Yale establishment.
Ms. Calabresi acknowledged New Haven's serious poverty and resultant urban problems, but stresses its pluses: theaters, museums, symphony, Greek architecture, historic green and tree-covered streets. To her, it's a shame that surbanites are so fearful of the city and there is "a deeply segregated society, more segregated in many ways than Louisville or Nashville."
She thought that a festival could attract a diverse audience that would see the positive attributes of the city. However, she had no idea how to implement her idea. She went to Jean M. Handley, 70, who is retired from the Southern New England Telephone Company where she was the first female vice president, and has long been active in arts, education, health and business boards in New Haven.
Ms. Handley, a Guilford resident, commissioned a market study, went to arts festivals in Charleston and Edinburgh, Scotland, arranged what she called "a crash course" with festival organizers from around the country, and checked weather patterns for the last decade.
The women succeeded in creating the event last June, after only beginning to book acts the previous October. Ms. Handley is proud of the festival's ideas component -- includes readings, lectures and discussions led by the poet laureate Robert Pinksky, performers at the festival and experts on the arts.
Matthew Nemerson, president of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce, said that there had been previous discussions about putting on such an arts festival. But obstacles included a resistance from leaders of existing arts organizations concerned about losing their audience and financial support, and a depressed business climate.
Ms. Handley and Mrs. Calabresi argued that a festival would enhance attendance at existing institutions, enticing people to return to the city. They also promised not to accept contributions that otherwise would have gone to local institutions.
That cost them some potential contributions, Ms. Handley said, so she widened the search for sponsors to include, for example, the Mashantucket Pequots.
Mr. Nemerson said that the combination of Ms. Handley and Mrs. Calabresi "brought the clout and Rolodex of a corporate C.E.O. to the table."
Barbara Pearce, president of H. Pearce Company and Long Wharf Theater, said, "A lot of people told them it couldn't be done. If they had listened, there would be no festival."
Some warn that a festival can't revitalize a city by itself. In Charleston, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. has been in office as long as Spoleto has been in existence, and he has aggressively pursued hotels and other businesses to the city, says Nigel Redden, general director of Spoleto U.S.A.
Dr. Glickman of Rutgers said that in Austin, Tex., a musical festival called South by Southwest has brought the city a "huge number" of visitors. But, he added, "it's part of a larger strategy that has worked very well."
In New Haven, Mayor John DeStefano Jr. said, "I'm not going to say it's going to make 300 restaurants open." But, he added, "it's one of the things a healthy community ought to be doing."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Housing to Rise on Site of Abandoned Aloca Factory

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
THE cavernous structure overlooking the Hudson River in Edgewater that once housed an Alcoa plant is an industrial wreck, idled by time, neglect and environmental problems.
In the 33 years that the 1.1-million-square-foot landmark has sat mostly vacant, several attempts were made to redevelop it. All were foiled, leaving its fate uncertain and its cleanup incomplete. 
 Now there is a plan to clean the 10-acre site on River Road by razing the contaminated structure and redeveloping it to housing. Brokered by Bergen County, the agreement involves the owner, the Aluminum Company of America and North River Mews Associates, a local developer that plans a residential rental complex a block from the river.
On Wednesday, the Bergen County Freeholders approved the agreement, which was signed at a news conference the next day at the Alcoa site in Edgewater.The state's Department of Environmental Protection, which has agreed to the remediation plan, will oversee the cleanup.
County Executive William Schuber said the plan was intended to achieve several goals -- to eliminate an eyesore, clean up the site and create a tax-producing project. It will remove an obstacle to the continued resurgence of the county's Hudson River shoreline, he said, adding: "All at no cost to county taxpayers."
At one point the building sits precariously close to River Road, which parallels the river and is being widened from two to four lanes -- a county project Mr. Schuber said was essential to accommodate present and future riverfront development. "It's a win-win for everyone involved," he said.
The plan, which now will undergo further public review, also reflects a trend in the region and the nation: The formation of public-private partnerships to recycle so-called brownfields.
Its proponents say the public benefits of razing the building, which is listed on the State and National Registers of Historic Places, outweigh preserving it. Historic designation does not save landmark buildings from the wrecking ball if they are in private hands, as is the case with the Alcoa plant.
"Our hope in the beginning was to preserve the building, but that is not possible," said Mayor Bryan Christiansen of Edgewater, adding that "all residents want to see the building go." Finally, he said, the market and technology caught up with this project, making it feasible to move ahead.
Under the plan, parts of the block-long concrete building where high levels of PCB's and other pollutants have settled will be removed and will be taken to a designated landfill.
The rest of the building will be torn down and its jumbled remains crushed into tiny pieces and then tested. Those particles containing high levels of pollutants will be carted off site; those with acceptable or low levels will be recycled -- perhaps even as fill for the road project.
T HE key to the plan is that the contaminates are in the building material, not the ground," said James H. Cobb Jr, special assistant to Robert C. Shinn, Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection. "There is no longer a concern about contamination once the building is removed."
Nevertheless, because of the site's industrial past it will be cleaned to residential standards required by state environmental laws before housing is built, Mr. Cobb said. It then will be sold for $8 million to North River Mews, which plans to reshape it into a rental enclave, subject to approvals from the Edgewater Planning Board.
Under present zoning, the developer said, some 400 attached residences could be built at the site, on which there is also a 1.3-acre historic cemetery where an Indian princess is said to be buried.
Alcoa will pay for the demolition and cleanup, estimated to cost $9.5 million to $12 million and take up to 18 months to complete. To guarantee that the work is carried out, the county is requiring Daibes Brothers, the local contracting company doing the demolition, to put up a bond and to pay for any work that exceeds projected costs. Fred A. and Joseph A. Daibes, the company's principals and Edgewater residents, are also partners in North River Mews Associates.
The Alcoa plant was built in stages from 1919 to 1940 and used to fabricate aluminum, rolling out such products as aluminum foil and aluminum sheets used for soda cans. Alcoa closed the plant in 1964 and sold it four years later.
SINCE then the building was sold several more times with two previous owners unsuccessfully trying to convert it to housing. That was what the last owner -- the Amland Properties Corporation, whose principals were Oskar Brecher, a Manhattan developer, and Olympia & York, the Canadian real estate company -- wanted to do during the mid-80's building boom. But the cleanup proved too costly. Amland sued Alcoa, contending, among other things, that it had caused the pollution and was responsible for the cleanup. In a 1991 out-of-court settlement, the giant aluminum maker took back the site.
Kevin McKnight, remediation manager at Alcoa, said his company had been in the process of evaluating its options for the property, including demolishing the building and marketing the site for development, before being approached by the county.
"Alcoa is not in the real estate business," Mr. McKnight said. "We sold our real estate interests back in the 1980's. This way we are also insuring that the property does not cause long-term risk to Edgewater, or to Alcoa."
Proponents of the plan to raze the old Alcoa building consider it a further step in the revival of the waterfront in Bergen County in general and in Edgewater in particular. The borough's 3.5 mile riverfront -- deserted by major manufacturers, like Alcoa, more than three decades ago -- began its revival in the 1980's, but was stalled by the recession and is now getting a second wind. Indeed, some 1,000 housing units are under construction.
"It has been a hindrance to our redevelopment efforts," said Robert Corcoran, an Edgewater Councilman, referring to the old plant. "That is the last area where no real action has happened." For several years the borough has unsuccessfully tried to prod Alcoa "to do something with the building," he said, adding that the idea it will be torn down "is the best thing that could happen."
Razing the building also provides a more efficient way for the county to accomplish the second phase of the widening of River Road and ultimately get a safer road, said Farouk M. Ahmad, assistant director of the Bergen County Department of Planning and Economic Development. River Road is the main access to the county's waterfront and the major artery in this pencil-shaped borough at the foot of the Palisades.
Mr. Ahmad said the second phase of the road project was more difficult than the first two-mile long phase, which was completed a few months ago, because it goes through the more heavily developed portion of the borough.
This phase starts just south of the Alcoa building and extends north for a mile to Route 5. As part of the agreement, Mr. Ahmad said, less than an acre of land from the Alcoa site will be donated for the road project, which is to be completed in 1998.
Fred Daibes of North River Mews said he got involved with redevelopment of the Alcoa site because of the three-way agreement, which he called key to the participation of his group. Today's improving economy and strengthening housing market also supported the project, he added. Mr. Daibes said he would purchase the site contingent upon local approvals for the $50 million project he and his partners envision.
Preliminary plans call for replacing the Alcoa plant with 400 rental apartments in three mid-rise structures. Demolition of the existing plant is expected to begin in July with construction of the new housing to start the summer of 1998, he said.
With the Alcoa and River Road projects in place, Mayor Christiansen said, the borough is well on the way to a long-sought revival.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Mortgage Recording Taxes

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
IT'S frustrating paying income tax on money you earn. It's even worse paying sales tax on money you spend. But what could be worse than paying a mortgage tax on money you borrow?
How about paying it twice? 
 Many property owners in New York who have refinanced their mortgages in recent years have been doing just that. And at least one New York lawmaker is doing something about it by compiling a list of "consumer friendly" lenders who have agreed to help borrowers avoid paying a second tax when they refinance.
Assemblyman Daniel L. Feldman, Democrat of Brooklyn, explained that until 1989 or so, homeowners who refinanced their mortgages could legally avoid paying mortgage taxes -- which can amount to hundreds and even thousands of dollars -- by having their old mortgage assigned to their new lender.
In 1990, however, a change in the law made it optional for lenders to agree to an assignment. And that, Mr. Feldman said, has hurt homeowners because it forces them to choose between refinancing with a new lender -- which typically results in the payment of a second tax -- or renegotiating their current loan on terms dictated by their lender. "Either way, you lose," Mr. Feldman said.
He said he had become aware of the problem when he decided to refinance the mortgage on his home in Sheepshead Bay several years ago. Being a smart borrower, Mr. Feldman figured he would shop around for the best deal and then ask his original lender to match it.
When he presented his lender with a competitor's advertised interest rate and closing costs, the lender offered a similar interest rate but higher closing costs. Mr. Feldman decided to go with the competitor.
Mr. Feldman knew that by going to the new lender he would be required to pay the mortgage recording tax. But if he could have his existing mortgage assigned to the new lender -- a common practice in commercial loan transactions -- he would not have to pay the tax.
So Mr. Feldman asked his original lender to assign his mortgage to the new lender. But the original lender declined to do so, forcing Mr. Feldman to make a choice: Either take out a new loan with the new lender and pay a new mortgage recording tax, or refinance his existing loan with his original lender and pay higher closing costs.
Then Mr. Feldman noticed something that bothered him: The closing costs were just slightly less than the taxes he would have to pay if he went to a new lender.
"They set their rate just high enough to squeeze every penny out of me and just low enough to make it more expensive for me to go to another lender," he said.
In fact, Mr. Feldman pointed out, what the lenders are doing is quite legal as the result of the change in the law in 1990.
Prior to that, he said, state law prohibited lenders from unreasonably withholding assignments of mortgages because the mortgage recording tax was only intended to be a tax on new money being borrowed.
When a homeowner refinances an existing loan, he said, the old loan is merely being replaced by a different one. Since the borrower already paid the tax on the original mortgage, no tax should be due on the refinancing.
So, ever since Mr. Feldman's run-in with his mortgage company he has been trying to restore the prohibition against the unreasonable withholding of an assignment. Twice he has successfully shepherded bills through the Legislature only to see them vetoed -- first by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1994 and again by Gov. George E. Pataki in 1996. In both cases, Mr. Feldman said, the reason offered for the veto was the potential loss of tax revenues.
Indeed, mortgage recording taxes do amount to a significant amount of money -- particularly for the person who has to pay them and particularly when the mortgage is on property in New York City.
Douglas F. Wasser, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that for mortgages under $500,000 on one-, two- and three-family homes outside New York City, the recording tax is 1 percent of the mortgage amount. Of that 1 percent tax, the lender pays 25 percent and the buyer the rest, less $25. For similarly sized mortgages on city property, however, the recording tax is 2 percent, but the lender pays only 12.5 percent of that amount, and the buyer the rest, also less $25.
That means that on a $200,000 mortgage refinancing of property outside the city, Mr. Wasser said, the mortgage tax due from the borrower would be $1,475 and the amount due from the lender would be $500. For the same size mortgage on a house or condominium in New York City, the tax due from the lender remains the same while the tax due from the borrower increases to $3,475. (Co-op shareholders are unaffected by these fees since there is no mortgage recording tax on the share loans used to purchase co-ops.)
Mr. Feldman has introduced yet another bill to prohibit the unreasonable withholding of an assignment. Since his prospects for success haven't changed appreciably, however, Mr. Feldman recently adopted a new strategy. Earlier this year, he mailed out "pledge forms" to more than 1,000 lending institutions, asking them to return the form if they were willing to promise not to unreasonably withhold assignments of mortgages. Nineteen lenders responded affirmatively.
Don Romano, president of the New York Association of Mortgage Brokers, pointed out that it should not be assumed that the lenders who responded are the only lenders who will agree to assignments of mortgages.
"This is not an all-inclusive list by any means," Mr. Romano said, adding that while most lenders will readily agree to accept an assignment, many are hesitant to make an assignment because of the difficulty involved in tracking down the original paperwork. In some cases, Mr. Romano said, it may not even be possible to make an assignment because the loan has been sold to another lender who will not permit it.
"It's usually a judgment call," Mr. Romano said.
The lenders who agreed to Mr. Feldman's pledge are the Sound Federal Savings and Loan Association, Mamaroneck, N.Y.; the Greater New York Savings Bank, Mineola, L.I.; the Reliance Federal Savings Bank, Garden City, L.I.; the Columbia Federal Savings Bank, Woodhaven, Queens, and the Dime Savings Bank of New York, Uniondale, L.I.
Also, the Long Island Savings Bank, Melville, L.I.; the Flushing Savings Bank and the China Trust Bank of New York, both of Flushing, Queens; Interbank of New York, Astoria, Queens; the Ridgewood Savings Bank, Ridgewood, Queens; the Atlantic Liberty Savings Bank, Brooklyn, and the Ponce de Leon Federal Savings Bank, the Bronx.
Also, the Arab American Bank, the BPD International Bank, and the Habib American Bank, all of Manhattan; and upstate, the Cayuga Savings Bank, Auburn; the Cohoes Savings Bank, Cohoes; the Rome Savings Bank, Rome; the Cortland Savings Bank, Cortland, and the Savings Bank of the Finger Lakes, Geneva.

HEADLINE: A Dream Grows in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
WHEN the Regional Plan Association published a study in 1983 arguing that the way to reverse the deterioration of downtown Brooklyn was to turn it into the city's third central business district, after downtown and midtown Manhattan, the outcome was anything but certain. The uncertainties continued over the years even as the cluster of buildings known as Metrotech Center rose and filled with offices; one developer, after years of frustration, pulled down a billboard promising a hotel's imminent arrival.
Now the steelwork for that hotel, the first new one in Broolyn in 50 years, is rising next to Metrotech, which has become a $1-billion, five-million-square-foot development of new and renovated buildings around a landscaped commons. The latest building, known as Renaissance Plaza, will house a Marriott hotel with 384 guest rooms and large meeting spaces, as well as a 32-story office tower with a total of 1.4 million square feet of office space. 
 The hotel will make the business district self-contained, since the companies located there will be able to house visitors and hold conferences without having to go to Manhattan, as has been the case in the past.
And Polytechnic University, one of five colleges in the area, is in the midst of a $150 million fund-raising campaign to complete its campus, including the renovation of its main building, which was once a razor-blade factory.
The redevelopment of downtown Brooklyn is the result of something that is often proposed but seldom successfully executed -- a partnership between academia and industry with a significant dollop of government assistance.
The idea that became Metrotech was first advanced by the then-president of Polytechnic, who feared the engineering school would be unable to attract students or faculty because of the shabby, apparently dangerous nature of its neighborhood.
"The original concept was developed by George Bugliarello, who wanted to build a research and development facility modeled on Silicon Valley," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "The developer had a better feel for the for the market, but the idea was George's."
Mr. Moss said that Metrotech, which includes the Polytechnic campus, and Renaissance Plaza were particularly important to the economic health of the borough because they are clustered together in a compact area with high employment that helps to sustain retail and services businesses in the area. "If you look at Citicorp's tower in Long Island City, you see that it is an island that provides no benefit to the community," he said. "You have to have a critical mass."
Indeed, there are those who think the business district in Brooklyn will continue to grow, as office space in Manhattan becomes more expensive. "This is a wonderful time for new development in Brooklyn because of the prohibitive cost of deals in Manhattan and the incentives being offered in Brooklyn," said James Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a tenant's broker.
The downtown Brooklyn revival, which has brought 25,000 new jobs to the area, represents a triumph over "incredible obstacles," said Howard Golden, the borough president. What kind of obstacles? "The whole issue of Manhattan versus the boroughs and the fact that we live as second class citizens," he said. Most city development money has been spent in Manhattan over the years, to the neglect of the other boroughs, he said, although that has changed in recent years. Particularly galling, he said, was the inability to attract a hotel project.
I'VE had people from organizations call me and say they don't want to go to Manhattan to hold their meetings -- it's too expensive and there is not enough parking," said Mr. Golden. Nevertheless, he said , hotel development continued to be concentrated in Manhattan, often with city assistance.
As with any discussion of relations between Brooklyn and Manhattan, there is an undercurrent of tension from the knowledge that if the borough were a separate city, as it once was, it would be the nation's fourth most populous.
"We are talking 2.5 million people and 60,000 businesses with some of the best transportation links in the city," said Joshua L. Muss, whose Muss Development Company struggled with the hotel project's ups and downs starting in 1983.
"There were six professionals working on this every day for 13 years," he said. "It became an odyssey; we went through 7 or 8 formal financing interludes. Each time we thought it was set, something unraveled. And through it all, there was a constant refrain: A hotel in Brooklyn is a piece of pork in a kosher butcher shop. you cannot finance it."
In fact, at one point Mr. Muss took down a billboard saying the development was "coming soon" after the sign had been up for six years with no visible progress.
Finally it all came together last year and the hotel-retail-office complex is expected to open next summer. It will occupy about a third of a long block bounded by Jay and Adams and Willoughby and Johnson Streets. The $230 million project will include, in addition to the hotel rooms and office tower, a fitness center, on-site day care, 20 conference and meeting rooms including a ballroom that will be among the largest in the city and an 1,100-space underground garage.
City and state economic development authorities have provided a package of incentives that will make space in the office tower $12 a square foot cheaper than midtown Manhattan and $6 less than downtown. Rents in Metrotech run to the low to mid $20s per square foot, brokers say.
The incentives include abatement of real estate taxes completely for 15 years and a gradual increase to a normal level over the next 10 years, $1,000 a year subsidy for each employee relocated from Manhattan below 96th Street or from outside the city, energy rate savings from Consolidated Edison and an exemption from the state tax on the purchase of business equipment.
Mr. Muss is dwelling on incentives and the cheaper cost of living in Brooklyn because, although he has as anchor tenants the Kings County District Attorney's office and the Empire Insurance Company, he still must lease 233,000 square feet of space on seven upper floors.
The chief landlord's broker for Renaissance Plaza, Jerry L. Cohen of Cushman & Wakefield, said any negative image associated with Brooklyn had been erased when financial firms such as Chase Bank and Bear Stearns & Company began moving their back office operations into Metrotech in the late 1980's. Metrotech is virtually completely leased, according to brokers.
"The way downtown Brooklyn is today is like the central business district of many cities," he said. "There is housing nearby, shops and retail is picking up. There are lots of bright young people at the colleges in the neighborhood and the rest of the labor pool is excellent."
Certainly the gleaming new buildings, the tree-shaded commons at Metrotech and the bustle on the street are a far cry from when Dr. Bugliarello, who was being recruited as president of Polytechnic from his post as dean of engineering at the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois, took a look at the neighborhood in 1973.
"I had been interviewed at a fancy club in Manhattan," he said. "So I took a cab out here and turned the job down."
He described the university's surroundings as "a disaster." "There were less than 200 people living in the area and most of the buildings were rundown or torn down for parking lots," he recalled. In addition to the depressed surroundings, Polytechnic was in a difficult position financially.
A PRIVATE college built in the years leading up to the Civil War to educate the sons of well-off families in Brooklyn, the college never built up an endowment and in more recent years relied on a dwindling supply of research projects from government agencies to try to close the financial gap.
"By 1973, there had been 13 years of deficit and Poly had spent five years trying to become a state or city institution," said Dr. Bugliarello, who was eventually persuaded to take the presidency.
The state stepped in and provided financial assistance for Polytechnic to merge with New York University's School of Engineering and Science. That school had been housed at N.Y.U.'s uptown campus in the Bronx, which was scheduled to be sold. Combining two very similar schools at a time when there was great pressure to balance Polytechnic's budget produced a harsh environment.
"We had to let go all the nontenured faculty," Dr. Bugliarello said.
As he surveyed the school and its neighborhood, he recalled, he became convinced that improving the location was the key to attracting more students and that the way to do it for an institution devoted to technology was in partnership with industry with the assistance of government.
Dr. Bugliarello, who was president of Polytechnic from 1973 to 1994 and now holds the title of chancellor, sold the idea to borough and city officials who designated the university as the developer of Metrotech. But it was expected all along that the partners in the undertaking would recruit a commercial developer to do the actual clearing and building.
None of the city's established developers was interested in Brooklyn, but Bruce Ratner, a Columbia Law School graduate who had been the city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs from 1978 to 1982, was. "I had traveled all the boroughs as Commissioner," he said, "and I knew downtown Brooklyn had excellent transportation."
While the Regional Plan Association had designated the area to be a third node of commerce in the city, Mr. Ratner said, it had not described how it was to be done. Polytechnic had advanced a plan to develop 1 million square feet of space, with an emphasis on high technology.
"We looked at it and determined the area was not appropriate for another Silicon Valley," said Mr. Ratner, who was backed by Forest City, his family's development company, which is based in Cleveland. "We did find that what tenants really wanted was lots of high-tech space for back-office operations. And we also found that 30 to 35 percent of the people who work in downtown Manhattan are from Brooklyn."
So the plan was rezoned to 4 million square feet, and the search for prospective tenants was begun. A critical point was passed, Mr. Ratner said, when Morgan Stanley, the securities corporation, agreed to move into a building at 1 Pierrepont Plaza.
Although not part of Metrotech, the triangular property bounded by Pierrepont and Clinton Streets and Cadman Plaza West is nearby and helped gain credibility for the area as a location for major offices.
"Morgan Stanley was the beginning of Brooklyn's revival because it gave the appearance of reality," Mr. Ratner said.
Putting together the first deal in Metrotech proper was tricky because no company wanted to be the first to commit to the project without the assurance that someone else would take the risk as well.
"Brooklyn Union Gas was willing to move if we could find another tenant" for the buldings that eventually became 1 and 2 Metrotech Center, Mr. Ratner said. That requirement was met when the Securities Industries Automation Corporation, which develops specialized software for Wall Street, agreed to move in, taking about 80 percent of the space in the 535,000-square-foot 2 Metrotech Center..
Since then Chase Bank, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, the city's 911 emergency service and Fidelity Contingency Trading have moved offices to Metrotech, to be joined by the Fire Department once its headquarters is completed later this year.
To make the development more attractive, the buildings are arrayed around a four-acre, vehicle-free landscaped mall. This gives workers a pleasant place to eat lunch and socialize without having to cope with traffic on Flatbush Avenue and Jay Streets. Indeed, if Polytechnic completes the project it is planning for its buildings, the main entrance will be from the mall, rather than from Jay Street, as it is today.
Although it was rundown, the area was not abandoned, and so all the problems of urban renewal arose. "There were 160 people and businesses on the site that had to be moved," Mr. Ratner said. There were lawsuits, of course, but Mr. Ratner said in the end the developers settled with individuals, rather than groups. "We sat in a room on Saturdays and Sundays and met with people making offers," he said. "In the end, it cost $19 million to $20 million to get it done."
There were other complications: Cherished local institutions like Sid's Hardware store had to be reconstructed near its old location, but as part of the Brooklyn Union Gas building. An old school building was converted to lofts for a group of artists that was being displaced. An old Fire Department building was converted into housing for the elderly so that many long-time residents could continue living near their old neighborhood.
Attracting back-office operations from Wall Street meant offering the latest in electrical and telecommunications infrastructure and plenty of redundancy. "You could unplug the building that has 911 and it could keep operating for seven days," Mr. Ratner said. The buildings were built with unusually large spaces between floors so that two-foot raised floors could be installed to accommodate wiring systems without making workers feel closed in.
There is one site left at Metrotech whose future has not been decided, but which could support a structure with between 300,000 and 400,000 square feet, Mr. Ratner said. He said he expected companies to keep moving labor-intensive operations out of Manhattan, adding that Forest City was looking for other likely sites in Brooklyn.
Of course, he is likely to have his hands full over the next few years as a major participant in the renewal of Times Square. Forest City Ratner is signed up to develop part of the south side of 42d Street with a 25-screen cinema, Madame Tussaud's wax museum, a music store and other retailers. "Based on Madame Tussaud's in London, we are expecting two to two and a half million people a year," he said.
As the commercial part of Metrotech nears completion, the intellectual parent of the development, Polytechnic University, is seeking to complete its own building program, to make the school attractive to a broader range of students than the local commuters take make up the bulk of its current attendance.
THE first phase is the construction of a new building to house a dormitory, athletic facilities and a cafeteria. The dormitory will allow the university to attract students without local housing and give it a more campus-like feel.
"We are building the dorm for commuter students as well, because we think it will become a center of student life," said Dr. David C. Chang, Dr. Bugliarello's successor as president. He said having a social center was important for a school like Polytechnic because of the impersonal nature of commuting and because many of the current students are immigrants or the first generation children of immigrants.
A new wing will be added the main academic building, Rogers Hall, that will provide up-to-date space and supply both the dormitory and Rogers Hall with modern heating and air-conditioning.
The second phase would be a gut renovation of older parts of Rogers Hall and the addition of an atrium linking the university with Metrotech. The entire project should take about four years, Dr. Chang said.
Dr. Bugliarello said that although Metrotech did not develop as he originally thought, it remains a good example of how a university can team up with industry and government to promote change. He said that because of the interest of banks, securities firms and city agencies in computing and telecommunications, Polytechnic had secured grants to establish its Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications to perform basic research in the field.
HAVING the center helped convince people on Wall Street that Polytechnic was the last word in telecommunications," he said. And since the Securities Industry Automation Corporation has been in Metrotech it has commissioned some research at the university into issues of interest to it and its stock exchange owners. He said the companies are also a source of students, many of them working professionals seeking advanced degrees.
Although most successful university-industry undertakings, like Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, have been located in spread-out, suburban settings, Dr. Bugliarello said Metrotech demonstates that similar projects can be successful in cities as long as they are tailored to an urban environment. "An urban park like Metrotech compresses in a few acres industrial and academic activities that in different environments are spread over thousands of acres," he has written.
Having a clear concept and sticking to it is more important than financial muscle, he argues. Polytechnic has invested about $40 million in Metrotech while the private sector and the City of New York have together invested over $1 billion.
Bringing in all those new jobs has helped reinvigorate the area, but the economic effects have been uneven. Retailing has benefited little, other than a pick-up in lunch time business, because most office workers leave the area after work, brokers specializing in retail leasing say.
"Metrotech is pretty self-contained, although some people probably wander over to Livingston street for a burger," said Albert Firstman, a broker with New Spectrum Realty Services who specializes in Brooklyn. "But at night they do not like to hang around. They rush home."
That is not surprising, said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director of Insignia/ESG. "Retail lags behind other development because most retailers cannot survive on lunch trade alone," he noted. He said it took the much larger World Trade Center almost 20 years before there was enough night-time and weekend traffic to attract a Borders bookstore.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Making Do in a Year When Money Abounds

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
As they put the finishing touches on a new election-year budget, state lawmakers and Governor Whitman found themselves in a political quandary: there was too much money to spend.
Gone are the dire warnings made only a few months ago that hundreds of state workers would lose their jobs. The bull market on Wall Street and the state's strong economy have poured at least $590 million in unanticipated tax revenues into the state's coffers. And the Legislature's approval earlier this month of Governor Whitman's $2.75 billion pension borrowing plan clears the way for the state to skip $590 million in scheduled pension payments this year. 
 Even though the New Jersey State Supreme Court handed an unexpected $246 million bill to the state last month to help end the spending disparity between rich and poor schools, the state is still flush with cash.
State officials said it appears that there will be no layoffs at all in the coming fiscal year, with the exception of the elimination of up to 1,200 jobs as a result of the closing next year of the North Princeton Developmental Center and Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital. Administration officials said that they will try to move as many of those workers as possible into jobs at group homes that will be created.
After three years of cutting taxes and reining in government spending, Governor Whitman took a different approach in January when she first unveiled her proposed $16.4 billion budget. Instead of the deep spending cuts in almost every state agency that she proposed last year, she recommended that spending either remain at current levels or increase for most programs in the coming year.
She proposed spending increases for public schools, prisons and the environment, and more than a dozen modest initiatives aimed at Democratic and swing voters. She also promised to expand low-tax zones in cities, offer health insurance to uninsured children, expand drug treatment programs for women with children, open a second boot camp for juvenile offenders and eliminate the waiting list for disabled people seeking access to group homes and day care centers.
But once unanticipated tax revenues began pouring in, and the bond plan was approved, and the state budget picture began to look even rosier, Mrs. Whitman and Republican leaders were reluctant to be viewed as spending too much money.
Extra money to spend during an election year is not usually considered such a terrible ordeal for politicians. On the campaign trail, incumbent legislators always find it helpful to point out that various local organizations and programs recently received an infusion of state funds.
But since 1991, the Republican-controlled state Legislature has prided itself in keeping spending down. In 1993, as the gubernatorial race began, they trimmed $200 million from former Gov. Jim Florio's $15.7 billion budget.
And in January, Governor Whitman boasted that her $16.4 billion budget proposal was only 1.3 percent above last year's appropriations, well below the rate of inflation. "This gives us the lowest four-year growth rate in government spending in a quarter century," she said in her annual budget message to the state Legislature.
Governor Whitman cannot make the same claim now. However, she was determined that spending would not rise to $17 billion, as some lawmakers had predicted earlier in the week. Under the agreement that was finally worked out among Legislative leaders and Whitman aides last week, the new state budget will be approximately $16.8 billion. Spending would increase by at least $260 million above what she proposed in January, and $583 million above last year's budget.
The major changes that the Legislature made to the Governor's budget include extra money for caseworkers, colleges and municipalities wrestling with high debt service payments on school construction.
To end the threat of college tuition increases made by several state colleges this spring, lawmakers restored $20 million to state colleges and universities that Mrs. Whitman cut in her proposed budget. The Legislature also budgeted $8 million more than Mrs. Whitman requested for community colleges.
The new budget will also include $18 million more than the Governor initially recommended to hire more caseworkers at the state Division of Youth and Family Services. And $20 million more to help municipalities pay off debt on school construction. There is also about $20 million for small programs and projects that legislators have requested for their individual districts.
Overall, unlike last year, it is not a budget that is going to make too many people unhappy.
That presents some political problems for Democrats. The 30 percent income tax cut has been fully enacted, and it is difficult to explain to voters that a pension bond plan is how Mrs. Whitman has been able to avoid deep spending cuts.
However, they believe that they have found a new niche.
"The Governor does the easy part," said State Senator James E. McGreevey, the Democrat from Woodbridge who is challenging Mrs. Whitman this fall. "But she did not take on the difficult job of reinventing government. Ironically, the Governor has redefined the Democratic Party as fiscally responsible."

HEADLINE: Imagining The Future Of Downtown

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: CRANFORD

 BODY:
IN the early 1980's, the people of this Union County township became concerned about a rising vacancy rate in stores and other signs of deterioration and began plans to make their downtown more attractive, and robust.
They replaced broken sidewalks with brick paving stones, installed elevated planters brimming with flowers, placed benches every so often to invite shoppers to sit and highlighted the turn-of-the-century architecture of shops and businesses with Victorian-style lamps. They also took an unsightly corner near the train station and built a brick plaza with a majestic ornamental clock that has become the town center. 
 The project took almost 10 years. About three weeks ago, 28 people from various walks of life here -- residents, shop owners, government leaders -- met in the Cortina Restaurant to review what they had accomplished. They spent the next four hours basically confronting one question: Now what?
It is a question with no clear answer. Although the question implies a need to strengthen old businesses and attract the new, the answer lies essentially in identifying what kind of town they want Cranford to be, or continue to be.
Cranford is not alone in asking the question. More and more towns across the state are asking themselves how they can best revitalize their downtown business districts in the face of competition not only from old adversaries like the shopping malls and highway outlets but also newer ones like mail order houses and the Internet.
Cranford was the first municipality in New Jersey to take advantage of legislation allowing it to create a business improvement district (it's officially called a special improvement district, or Sid) which empowers downtown merchants and property owners to form a partnership with town government to assess themselves for improvements and create a management system to carry them out.
In Cranford, the district was established in November 1985, with actual streetscape improvements beginning in 1987. Since then, the number of improvement districts has grown to 35, in 29 municipalities. The greatest growth has come within the last three or four years as more towns have become aware of the program. Nine more are expected to be established by next year.
But those involved with downtown revitalization, like the people of Cranford, are coming to realize that no matter how many improvements they make, no matter how they shore up their existing stores and attract new ones, no matter how healthy their downtowns become, their work will never be finished. They are also coming to realize that no matter how successful that process, the towns can never be the way they were, that they will evolve into something new and different.
Beth Peterson, executive director of Downtown New Jersey Inc., a statewide, non-profit organization that is an advocate for central business districts, believes that downtowns represent the old home town in our consciousness and therefore exert "an emotional pull."
"It comes back to the fact that downtowns are an important part of community life," Ms. Peterson says. "You're not going to hear anybody say, 'I come from the Bridgewater Commons Mall.' They say, 'I'm from Somerville.' "
"No matter what the state our downtown is in, there is a move afoot to say this is a valuable part of our community life, and we don't want it to deteriorate any further."
There are some 1,200 business improvement districts across the country, says Lawrence O. Houstoun, Jr., who played a major role in drafting the legislation in New Jersey. Such districts, along with other programs for downtown revitalization, stand as a symbol of a new feeling toward downtown America.
"The revitalization has begun to change American attitudes about downtown," said Mr. Houstoun, a principal in the Atlantic Group, an urban-development consulting business in Cranbury and Philadelphia.
"A decade ago, smart writers were saying downtowns were dead," he said. "Now they're saying how they're coming alive again. It's meant changes in our perception. One of the changes is the sense that one can change the human environment, that places we call downtown can be revived."
 
A Mile-Square District In a Century-Old Town
 Cranford's special improvement district occupies about a square mile of the town's 4.79 square miles, and Meryl Layton's shop, the Cranford Book Store, sits in the middle of it on North Avenue West.
It is located across from the railroad trestle in the turn-of-the-century Cranford Trust Company building, a three-story edifice of red brick and stately columns that takes up most of the block to another main thoroughfare, North Union Avenue.
Next to her bookstore is the Cortina Restaurant, one of the best of the small number of restaurants in town, and next to that is the Village Shoe Store, Sovereign Bank of New Jersey, the Cranford Barber Shop, Martin Jewelers, whose name appears with Rolex on the face of the $20,000 Victorian clock in Eastman Plaza across the street. Next to Martin Jewelers is First Union bank. Writing on second-floor windows shows there are two dental offices there.
There are new signs on some of the shops, impatiens and holly bushes in the planters and the American and Cranford flags jutting from the Victorian-style lamps. There are signs on the railroad trestle saying "Walk/Talk/Shop Cranford" and advertisements for "a duck derby" sponsored by the firefighters association, an "Olde Tyme Circus" at a local school and the soccer club in "Cranford, N.J. U.S.A." The overall effect is one of quaintness and neatness, of being modern with roots in the past, an American town.
Under the local ordinance that created the district in 1985, Meryl Layton, like some 180 other downtown property owners, pays 40 cents for each $100 of assessed valuation to support the annual budget of the district, on top of what she pays on her regular tax bill. The 1997 budget is $309,770.
John F. Laezza, the township administrator, says that assessment covers the following:
Annual payment of $100,000 toward the $3.2 million debt the property owners incurred to spruce up the district; $80,000 for administrative expenses of the Downtown Management Corporation, which manages the district, mainly the salary of the manager and an assistant; $60,000 in salaries for two workers to maintain the planters, sidewalks and other amenities, and the rest in reserve for future capital needs, materials for repairs and marketing.
Downtown property owners are allowed to pass their assessment onto their renters. The township contributes $140,000 annually to pay for government-owned and tax-exempt properties in the district.
"That costs the average homeowner no more than $17 a year," Mr. Laezza says.
Ms. Layton, for her property, assessed at $303,000, paid an assessment of $1,213.20 in addition to her regular tax bill of $8,000 last year.
Some property owners in other towns have objected to the assessments for services they say should be provided by government anyway. And in some towns, like Morristown, they have fought the assessments in court.
But Meryl Layton sees the assessment as a "worthwhile investment."
"In the beginning, property owners really hated it," she said of the investment. "They were afraid that the tax and the passing on of the tax would make it difficult to rent their properties. But that hasn't been the case."
Ms. Layton, who until last December served on the board of the Downtown Management Corporation. for 10 years, said there was "a lot of dissent" when the district was first formed.
"The retailers weren't thrilled with it," she said, "because, who needs change, No. 1. No. 2, the tax would make their rents prohibitive. And that they'd be forced out of business. But I don't know of any, any, any business that's gone out because of the additional tax."
Norman J. Glickman, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, says that funding mechanisms like special improvement districts are necessary if many downtowns, especially in the state's older cities, are to survive."
"Cities have gone to these public and private partnerships because they haven't had the money to provide the services they used as a matter of course," Professor Glickman said.
Cranford, like other municipalities, began noticing things were not right in town back around 1982, town officials say.
More stores along South and North Union Avenues and along North Avenue East and West were becoming vacant and the general look of the stores and the streets and sidewalks in a downtown that was more than 100 years old appeared to be suffering slow decay. Mr. Laezza says.
"You had a downtown that was stagnant," said Mayor J. Robert Hoeffler. "You had a downtown that didn't have any pizazz."
In 1984, a group of concerned residents and business people created a private downtown improvement group and solicited funds for beautification, said Ms. Layton, but the program failed.
As Cranford officials were grappling with the problem, New Jersey passed the special improvement district legislation in 1984 that provided statutory authority for municipalities to create tax supported business improvement districts and non-profit organizations to manage them.
Cranford created its district on Nov. 12, 1985, and hired a consulting firm from Baltimore for $50,000 to determine what direction the township should take over the next 10 years.
It created a Downtown Management Corporation, a board of directors that now numbers 10 and that consists of three downtown property owners, three downtown business owners and three township residents, plus a township committee person.
The township also eventually hired a manager for the corporation to oversee the work of the district.
Beginning in 1987, the Downtown Management Corporation proceeded with what is known as "streetscape," a program of digging up sidewalks, putting in new electric lines, laying sidewalk stones called pavers and erecting street lamps, planters and generally helping merchants improve the look of their stores with new signs
The work was done in phases, says Paul LaCorte, the chairman of the Downtown Management Corporation who was Mayor in 1987, because the members wanted to pay as they went along.
By 1991, besides Cranford, other towns that had created districts were Englewood, Trenton, Somerville, New Brunswick and Elizabeth, said Seth A. Grossman, manager of New Jersey's Business Improvement District Program.
 
An Idea Catches On: 35 Districts Statewide
 By 1993, there were more than 15 and today there are 35 in Atlantic City, Bayonne, Bound Brook, Elizabeth, Englewood, Fair Lawn, Fort Lee, Freehold, Iselin, Jersey City, Linden, Maplewood, Millburn, Morristown, New Brunswick, Ocean City, Paterson, Perth Amboy, Rahway, Red Bank, Rutherford, Somerville, Summit, Teaneck, Trenton, Union Township and Vineland.
Mr. Grossman says the increase in downtown-improvement programs came about through efforts by his office, local governments and Downtown New Jersey Inc. to publicize the program as well as the increased number of project consulting groups.
Newark, the largest city, is looking at creating two districts, one of which would take in the entire Ironbound section, Mr. Grossman said, while Galloway Township near Atlantic City is actually looking to build a town center, or downtown, to enhance a sense of community.
Every town looks at similar areas to improve, like security, cleanliness, re design, accessibility, shopper friendliness, streetscaping and so on, but all go about it in different ways, he says.
Red Bank, one of the more successful districts, began its district in 1991 but is just starting on infrastructure improvements, having chosen instead to create a marketing strategy to promote Red Bank inside and outside the community and to put businesses into stores in a downtown that had a 35 percent vacancy rate.
"We wanted to create a lot of internal excitement and also to create visible change on the street to stimulate investor confidence," said Tracy Challenger, executive director of the management group Red Bank River Center.
The vacancy rate is now near zero, and people have decided it's time for more of a capital improvement program.
Cranford was unusual in starting with its streetscaping program first, urban specialists said, but many think now think the town is at a crossroads.
"Cranford was looked on as a model for the first generation of Sids," said Marta Person, who managed both the Cranford and Red Bank business districts and now has a private consulting concern called Square Foot in Red Bank. "Now there are others doing more innovative things like Red Bank that Cranford can learn from."
Cranford, which has been without a downtown manager for at least six months, hired one earlier this month: Michele Picou, who was manager of the successful Main Street program in neighboring Westfield.
On her first week on the job, she joined 27 others from Cranford at a meeting, including town officials, heads of major departments in town whose cooperation is needed if downtown revitalization is to move forward, and retailers and property owners.
"It was called a retreat," said Ruth Yablonsky, a longstanding member of the board and a naturalist who often is seen working alone or with the maintenance crews pruning the planters or trimming the trees. "But I would rather call it an advance."
"The feeling was, now that we finished with the streetscape and capital improvements program, there are a number of directions we can go in," Mrs. Yablonsky said. "Some felt we should be working on a marketing scheme. Others felt we should be doing recruiting and retention of businesses. And others felt we should be looking further into the future than that."
Ms. Picou, who will be instrumental in helping Cranford create its vision of how it wants to be, said the most important thing that came from the meeting was an awareness that the Downtown Management Corporation had to be the prime mover.
"The major outcome was that the people who serve on the board, people who are in key departments, everyone in the group felt that the D.M.C. is the lead organization for determining appropriate development for the downtown," Ms. Picou said. "And the township committee made it clear they are looking to the D.M.C. to provide the leadership for that role."
Speaking in general about the future of downtowns, she said: "Some people think you start a downtown program to fix a downtown, and at some point you stop because the downtown is fixed. But a downtown, just like a school system or library, is never finished. It needs continuing maintenance and nurturing."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: TRIBECA;
SoHo-Style 'BID' Moves South

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
When he moved the Knitting Factory from the East Village to TriBeCa in late 1994, the owner, Michael Dorf, wanted to make sure that his performance space would become a welcome member of its new community. Having left Houston Street in part because of his inability to make a dent in the disorder there -- "No matter what I did, the dirt always came back," he said -- Mr. Dorf was determined to keep things clean in his new neighborhood, where he now also lives.
About six months ago, he found a way. Mr. Dorf met Henry Buhl, a downtown art patron and philanthropist. They talked about the SoHo Partnership, which Mr. Buhl helped found five years earlier to put homeless adults to work cleaning the community until they can get permanent jobs. Thus the TriBeCa Partnership was born. 
 Unlike business improvement districts elsewhere in the city that tax neighborhood merchants and hire workers to perform various services, the partnership operates on a voluntary basis and will solicit donations to finance its programs. It does not put salaried workers on the streets or provide security guards, as do many other BID's. For now, it is funded by seed money from Mr. Buhl's group, the Association for Community Homeless Programs, which also operates the SoHo venture, said Jonathan Spence, the TriBeCa Partnership's director.
Although the program is based on the SoHo model, the two communities are very different, Mr. Spence said, with far more families living in TriBeCa and little of the tourism that overwhelms its northern neighbor on weekends. Once the community is more familiar with the partnership, he said, demands for other services besides street cleaning are certain to be made.
Although the TriBeCa Partnership's six green-uniformed street cleaners first appeared in early May, taking many in the neighborhood by surprise, it did not make its first pitch for money until two weeks ago, when officials of local businesses like the TriBeCa Film Center and the Odeon restaurant met with Mr. Buhl and Mr. Dorf. The response was favorable, they said.
"It's a great idea to help the community and to help homeless people too," said Seth Price, a co-owner of Bubby's, the restaurant where the meeting was held, and where a Partnership fund-raising event is planned.
Partnership workers receive a weekly stipend of $120 for sweeping streets and bagging trash. Kenneth Green, 31, of the Bronx, says the job helps him meet the requirements of an outpatient vocational group run by St. Vincent's Hospital. And, he says, he enjoys it. "The residents down here are very friendly and courteous," he said. "They come up to us and say hello and tell us how much they appreciate what we are doing." BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Tending Your Money Where You Make It

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
UNTIL two months ago, Eliza L. Moore was tired of the financial paper chase. She got statements from both her bank and her mutual fund company, and investing in any of her four funds required shifting money out of her checking account.
So in April, Ms. Moore, a 24-year-old financial services consultant, opened an all-in-one account. With it, she can move her money quickly and conveniently, whether to pay bills, buy stocks or invest in any of 65 no-load mutual funds. She can obtain loans, insurance and financial planning advice, too, and any idle cash is automatically swept into a money market fund. Ms. Moore can even get a Visa Gold card with no annual fee, a 5.9 percent interest rate for the first five months and a 15.9 percent rate after that. 
 Happy as Ms. Moore is, her solution may seem unremarkable. After all, her new arrangement describes nothing more than a central asset account, a service simplifying finances that has been around for 20 years and is offered by brokerage firms, banks, mutual fund companies and others.
But what is notable is that Ms. Moore has opened her one-stop account at her workplace, the New York office of Andersen Consulting.
While retirement financing has made deep inroads into the workplace -- some 24 million Americans participate in 401(k) plans, for instance -- nonretirement finances receive much less attention on the job. True, many companies offer nonretirement investment plans, perhaps involving savings bonds or company stock. But other nonretirement products for employees, particularly for the consolidation or simplification of finances, are still relatively uncommon.
THINGS may be changing, however. "Financial planning is high on the list of issues with employers today," said Robert A. Liberto, director for benefits technology at the Segal Company, an employment consultant. "With so many services and products available, employees are asking for help."
Employers, too. Smith Barney has received inquiries from corporations that want to offer their employees a financial management account like the one Smith Barney offers outside the workplace. And the brokerage firm is working with client companies to provide such a service, said Jay Mandelbaum, executive vice president for retail marketing.
Also, credit unions, while far from offering one-stop financial services, have expanded their services so much -- to mortgages, auto loans and even automated teller machines -- that commercial banks have felt threatened and have sued to rein in the credit unions' activities.
And then there is Ms. Moore's cash management account, which is offered by Merrill Lynch under a new product called the Employee Access Account. This program -- which also offers direct deposit of paychecks and free check writing -- was formally introduced in late May but began earlier at some companies. Dan Roccato, a Merrill Lynch product manager, said 15 companies are already using it -- including Andersen, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Varco International, an oil-equipment maker in Orange, Calif., with about 2,000 employees. Another 15 companies have signed up.
As with similar all-in-one accounts, the hallmark of Merrill Lynch's is simplicity. And that extends even to the fees: although there are some special charges, the basic cost is $5 a month.
"Our research told us people didn't want to be nickeled and dimed to death," Mr. Roccato said. "The $5 that we're charging is pretty inclusive."
But while most nonworkplace cash management accounts -- including Merrill Lynch's -- carry hefty minimum initial deposits, usually $10,000 but sometimes up to $50,000, and require investors to keep sizable balances, the Employee Access Account has no such restrictions. Merrill Lynch no doubt hopes that because the product is offered to large groups, it will generate enough business to be profitable without such minimums. Banks, similarly, have waived fees or offered other breaks to customers whom they solicit as part of a company.
Merrill Lynch says the Employee Access Account is not just a tool for simplifying finances but also offers a convenient way to save. While Ms. Moore already considers herself a good saver, for example, she hopes her enrollment in the plan will turn her into a better one. And in a survey last year, Merrill Lynch found that many employers felt they should offer their employees savings help, although they have not done so because they thought it would be too difficult or too expensive to administer.
Employers don't have to worry about fees in Merrill Lynch's plan, which costs them nothing. And some of these companies say employees are embracing the idea.
"It's great value," said Theresa Hope, a benefits manager at Varco International. Four employees a week are signing up for the plan, she said.
Ross Pollack, a benefits manager at Sony Pictures Entertainment in Los Angeles, said, "We think it's a pretty good service, and the word of mouth on this has been pretty strong." Ten to 30 percent of the company's more than 2,000 employees already participate in the service, which began four months ago, he said.
That participation rate is typical for the 15 companies already using the program, Mr. Roccato said.
But Merrill Lynch's new workplace account may not be every investor's dream.
There are those occasional extra charges, like $20 for a bounced check. And while the commissions on stock trades are sometimes lower than Merrill Lynch's regular rates -- trades of less than $20,000 get a 30 percent discount, for instance -- Mr. Roccato acknowledges that, depending on the trade, investors with such accounts may find cheaper commissions at a discount broker.
What about the plan's 65 mutual funds? True, holders of these workplace accounts -- unlike participants in Merrill Lynch's regular cash-management account -- can buy the funds without paying sales fees. But, as with any cash management account, an investor pays in other ways for the convenience of one-stop shopping.
Fewer choices is one disadvantage. Merrill Lynch offers only about one-tenth of the number of funds available through Schwab's One Source, for example.
MOREOVER, said Kyra H. Morris, a financial planner in Charleston, S.C., "As is typical with the spectrum of funds offered by any brokerage house, you can find some very good funds and some that you'd want to stay away from" at Merrill Lynch. She added, however, that Merrill Lynch has placed a high priority on improving its fund offerings.
So far, another possible downside of such programs -- stock peddling -- has not surfaced. "One of the positive aspects of this is that Merrill Lynch isn't soliciting," Mr. Pollack said. "They're not using it as a tool to make cold calls to our employees."
And in any case, many experts say one-stop nonretirement accounts seem to fill a large need. "There's an information overload among consumers when it comes to financial products," said Mark Maselli, a benefits consultant at Kwasha Lipton Group in Fort Lee, N.J. "To that extent, this could be a positive product for people."
Ms. Moore certainly thinks so. "This account gives me a little more control over my investments," she said.

What Can He Do If Banks Never Say No?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
For millions of Americans, the kind and encouraging face and voice of Joseph P. Goryeb represent the lure of easy credit.
"When your bank says no, Champion says yes," Mr. Goryeb intones in commercials that fill the airwaves in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. 
 That pitch has helped make the Champion Mortgage Company, founded by Mr. Goryeb 16 years ago and owned by his family, into a fast-growing provider of mortgage loans to people with blemished credit. Now Mr. Goryeb is also one of the prime beneficiaries of the rise of easy credit. Keycorp, a regional bank, has agreed to buy Champion for $200 million in stock.
The trend to easier credit is broad and shows few signs of easing. Some banks do tell the Federal Reserve that they are strengthening loan standards, but there is little other evidence that is going on. With lots of money available, poor corporate credits pay little more than good ones in the bond market.
For individuals, however, there still are substantial premiums available for those willing to lend to people with lousy credit history. In part, that is because those people, as Champion put it so delicately in a prospectus earlier this year, "are more payment sensitive than interest-rate sensitive." In other words, they'll pay a high interest rate if the monthly bill seems low enough.
Champion did not make much money for most of its life, but lately it has reported very impressive numbers. In the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30, in which it lent $502 million, it reported profits of $27.5 million. Unfortunately, those profits are more a result of accounting alchemy than of cash flow, which was negative.
The accounting profits -- which are completely proper under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles -- come when Champion securitizes its loans by selling stakes in them to investors. The way the securities work, Champion keeps a substantial part of the risk of default by its borrowers. But it books an immediate profit based on an estimate of what it will make over the life of the mortgages from keeping a part of the interest payments.
That calculation is dependent on a bunch of assumptions, and leaves Champion in the unlikely position of being a lender that would have to report a huge loss if its borrowers all paid off their loans early, thus depriving Champion of interest payments it has already reported as profit. If this industry does eventually blow up, you can bet that the accountants will decide it would have been better to delay booking profits until borrowers had made the payments.
In recent years, Champion has shown a greater willingness to lend to borrowers with very bad credit. For fiscal 1996, 15 percent of its loans went to people with such blemishes as bankruptcies within the last year or who had fallen two months behind in payments.
It is too early to see whether that will lead to increased write-offs, but Champion's loss record so far has been admirable. Daniel L. Rich, the chief financial officer, says Champion is less aggressive than many competitors, who lend up to 125 percent of a home's value; Champion's normal top is 85 percent.
It was only seven years ago that banks were vowing to never again make risky loans. Now Wall Street cheers as Keycorp buys into a business of lending to poor credit risks. Then, bank stocks were cheap and hated. Now they are expensive and loved.
Mr. Goryeb did well by lending to those whom others would not trust. But he did not become truly wealthy until Keycorp came along with an offer that persuaded Champion to drop the idea of selling stock to the public. He will continue to run Champion, and no doubt will keep making ads. But his financial future will no longer be solely dependent on people with bad credit meeting their obligations. His timing may prove to be brilliant.

Managed Care Is Manageable for This Drugstore Chain

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
MANAGED care is old hat to Arbor Drugs, a Midwest drugstore chain, and that fact may be one of its attractions.
Based in greater Detroit, Arbor has dealt with managed care in its prescription business for more than 25 years. The reason is that unions, with a big presence in that area, have long had managed-care policies for their members. Today, in fact, up to 75 to 80 percent of the pharmaceutical business in the area involves managed care, compared with a 50 percent maximum nationwide. 
 As a result, Arbor has learned how to remain profitable despite lower revenues from managed care. Customers, for example, can call in and, using a voice response system, arrange prescription refills. Arbor has also shifted some of its focus to the front-end, or nonpharmaceutical, area of its approximately 200 stores. As managed care marches forward, the company's experience with these strategies will be valuable.
"The other drug chains around the country are still moving this way, so Arbor has an edge," said Philip Muldoon, a stock analyst at McDonald & Company in Cleveland.
With $826 million in sales last year, Arbor is the nation's ninth-largest drugstore chain. It has more stores in Detroit and its suburbs than any other company, giving it a 45.2 percent share of the country's sixth-largest drug retailing market, as well as a a growing presence in other parts of Michigan.
Founded in 1962 by Eugene Applebaum, a Detroit businessman, Arbor has been posting good numbers for many years. This year, its third-quarter earnings were up 24.5 percent, to $7.45 million, over the corresponding period in 1996, and analysts estimate that 1997 earnings will be $32.8 million, up 21 percent from last year.
The chain's stores, which are virtually identical in layout and design, are often found in the best retail areas of Detroit, making them big cash machines. The average Arbor store has annual sales of $4.7 million, about one-third higher than the industry average, according to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores in Alexandria, Va. Add in that Arbor's ratio of debt to market capitalization, about 7 percent, is low according to some analysts, and its stock's 61 percent rise in the last 12 months, compared with 33 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500, makes sense. The stock closed on Friday at $19.9375.
"Arbor has great market share in a large market and it's run as a solid, sensible Midwestern business," said Daniel Poole, an analyst at First of Michigan in Detroit.
What's more, drugstore stocks in general look promising. "It's a very good bet that the economy is going to slow down," explained Douglas Cliggott, domestic-equities strategist at J. P. Morgan. "In that context, we think there is going to be a clear bias over the next 9 to 12 months toward groups that sell or produce things that we need, such as drugstores, rather than those that sell or produce things we'd like to have but don't really need."
Moreover, as drugstores streamline and computerize, their sales relative to employment are rising rapidly. "Many drug chains are doing very positive things, such as inventory control," Mr. Cliggott said.
Another sweetener for the potential Arbor investor is the possibility, in this merger-minded industry, of a buyout. "It's hard for Arbor not to be considered prime for a takeover," Mr. Poole said. "It's a market-share leader in an important market."
While that may attract a takeover-minded giant like CVS, which is buying Revco, some analysts say Arbor's very efficiency makes a takeover unlikely. "They are already such an efficiently run organization," said Steven Geist, an analyst in Los Angeles for First Pacific Advisors, an Arbor shareholder. "How much can you really squeeze out of the acquisition?"
Indeed, potential investors may ask the same question. Mr. Applebaum has given the company advanced technology and a highly efficient distribution center that can handle 400 stores -- double the company's current number. Over all, "Arbor is one of the best run of America's regional drugstore chains," said Marc Speert, pharmacy editor of Drug Store News, an industry newsletter.
Besides making further economizing difficult, Arbor's efficiency and its reputation for the same mean that its stock is not particularly cheap. A solid long-term performer -- it has risen about 500 percent in the last decade -- the stock sells at 24.2 times its earnings per share, compared with 22.7 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Moreover, Arbor's efficiency has given it profit margins of 3.3 percent, compared with 1.7 percent for the industry.
Although Arbor is growing at a manageable pace -- it opened 10 stores last year, and will add 20 both this year and in 1998 -- it will have to expand beyond greater Detroit within the next several years, Mr. Geist said. Some possibilities, he added, are Cleveland, Minneapolis and Chicago, but wherever Arbor goes it may have to confront some of its huge rivals, including Walgreen's, with nearly 2,250 stores, and Rite Aid, with 3,600.
INDEED, Walgreen will face Arbor on its home turf at the end of the year. Walgreen plans to open about a dozen stores in the Detroit area within 12 months, so it will not pose an immediate threat to Arbor, analysts say, but Walgreen's size -- it is the largest chain in revenues -- gives it powers that Arbor lacks. For example, Walgreen "has gotten tough in negotiations with managed-care providers," said Thomas Rowland, manager of the Wayne Hummer Growth fund, an Arbor shareholder.
And for long-term worriers, there is the chance the Internet will supplant the drugstore. "People may be able to sit at home and get prescriptions filled," Mr. Geist said. "All I know is that trees don't grow to the sky, and at some point the drugstore business will most likely fall back."
Mr. Applebaum, however, has a founder's confidence that Arbor can deflect all these dangers. "There are always competitive concerns," he said. "You have to remain sharp and stay on top of it."

HEADLINE: The Heir Is Clearly Apparent at Comcast

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
RALPH ROBERTS, the dapper 77-year-old founder of the Comcast Corporation, loves to follow the ups and downs of other family businesses and try to figure out what makes some thrive and others implode. "There are the families that destroy each other as soon as the father or mother dies," Mr. Roberts said. "They come in and tear each other apart. The Gettys or that family in Texas," he continued, referring to Harold Simmons, the Texas investor who is at war with his daughters. "They are all billionaires, and they're fighting like crazy over another billion."
Mr. Roberts has reason to track the way family-run companies pass the baton from one generation to next. He has five children, aged 36 to 47. Only his fourth child, Brian, is at Comcast, the nation's fourth-largest cable television operator with $4 billion in revenue last year. And by the end of this year, the elder Mr. Roberts will increase Brian's control over the company's special class of 8.8 million shares that represent nearly 82 percent of Comcast's vote. It is only natural for the world to wonder: How will Brian's siblings react to all this? 
 The potential for conflict is obvious. The Roberts clan's equity stake in Comcast, based in Philadelphia, is worth at least $470 million without a premium, and once the patriarch and his wife pass from the scene, there is no guarantee the heirs won't hurl themselves into a fierce battle for the spoils.
But the elder Mr. Roberts has probably come as close as any company founder can to setting the stage for an orderly succession. His plan is to turn over the votes to Brian but make sure to divide the financial pie fairly among all the offspring. Though many aging entrepreneurs resist relinquishing power despite all their promises to do so, Comcast has begun notifying local cable commissions of the pending change of control, which Ralph Roberts said would be no later than early next year.
And experts say the odds of a successful transition are greater at Comcast than at most family businesses. Mr. Roberts has by all accounts done a skillful job of grooming Brian to fill his shoes so that he is both respected by his peers and supported by his siblings. While no one doubts that the father still calls a lot of the shots, he has eased his son into high-profile positions both at the bargaining table and in the public eye. In a family business, even the strongest allegiances can crack under the strain of a mismanaged transition at the top, but people familiar with Comcast say the younger Mr. Roberts is proving his mettle.
That was evident earlier this month when Brian Roberts and the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, struck a deal in which Microsoft agreed to pay $1 billion for an 11.5 percent stake in Comcast. The deal put the cable company on a far larger corporate map. "We had 650 analysts on the conference call to discuss the deal," recalled Brian Roberts, who handled the call for Comcast. "Usually we have about 200."
Even as he is promoting his son, the elder Mr. Roberts is looking after the financial interests of his other children. He never pressured any of them to join the family company -- and none besides Brian showed any interest in doing so. Today, Ralph Jr. is a professor of psychology at the University of Denver, and the other three all live near their parents in Philadelphia, where Lisa has a design business, Cathy is involved in philanthropy and Douglas is an assistant District Attorney.
And all of them are rich. The elder Mr. Roberts has made sure that each of Brian's siblings will retain an economic stake in Comcast equal their brother's. The five children and their parents jointly own the holding company that owns Comcast's supervoting shares. And to prevent his other heirs from putting pressure on Brian to sell Comcast -- an issue that has torn many families apart -- Mr. Roberts is struggling with a way to give them nonvoting stock that they could cash in without disturbing their brother's grip on the company.
"The children -- the family -- have continual discussions," he said during an interview in which he was joined by Brian, dressed like his father in a gray suit, black loafers, a white button-down shirt and red print tie. "It's a pretty close family. Our activities are so public. If you have a small private business, and the old man has stashed away something under the floor, then it's very different."
A few weeks ago, the five Roberts children -- leaving behind both mates and children -- spent a day with their parents for freewheeling talks on everything from personal concerns to financial matters.
Family-business experts say the family is something of an anomaly in devising a smooth transfer between generations. "This is a relatively unusual situation," said Leon Danco, president of the Center for Family Studies. "The father is open. Many entrepreneurs are very secretive. It is a sign of a man who has given considerable thought to the future and has spoken to his other children. What is more common is that this kind of agreement does not happen. To make it work, you have to have motivated, competent successors as well as accommodating heirs. If a family has to go to law court to determine what is fair, the issue is what's the law, not what is fair."
IT helps, of course, that only one of the children desperately wanted to follow in Dad's footsteps. "I think we have known that Brian would take over the company since he was about 8 years old," said Julian Brodsky, Comcast's vice chairman and Mr. Roberts's alter ego for the last 34 years.
When Brian was 8, Comcast was a fledgling cable operator that Ralph Roberts had founded after jumping in and out of a handful of other businesses. His main goal at the time was to make a lot of money. He had been born into an affluent home, the son of the owner of a small drugstore chain in Westchester County, N.Y. For a time, the family even had a chauffeur. But during the Depression, Mr. Roberts recalled, "my father died, and we lost all our money. People who never had a financial problem in their lives can never understand what terror there is in that."
He credits his mother for pulling the family through hard times. "She had a lot of friends, and she decided to go into the insurance business, and everybody she knew bought a policy from her the first year to keep us going," he said. "We moved into an apartment with my aunt in Philadelphia. I went to the University of Pennsylvania. I lived at home." To support himself at college, he took on a variety of odd jobs, including selling milk.
Once Mr. Roberts began building Comcast, Brian, alone of his brood, frequented the company premises. Luckily, the youngster had business smarts as well as enthusiasm. If he hadn't, his father confesses, "I probably would have sold the company."
That would have been a wrenching decision, as it almost invariably is for the founder of a company. "There is something about wanting to pass things on," he said. "It is the same thing as giving birth -- or having another generation. But if Brian were not up to it, he would not have stood a chance because you can't sacrifice all the people in the place for a poor manager."
Or an arrogant one. "The most dangerous thing is a son or daughter coming into a business where they think they get special treatment," Mr. Roberts said. "They drag the business down because it kills the morale of everybody in the company."
After Brian received an undergraduate business degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1981, Ralph Roberts tried to steer him to another company, where he would have to fight his own battles. But the son wanted to stay in the family business, so Mr. Roberts started him off in the trenches, stringing cable in New Kensington, Pa. "We were lucky because the cable business was growing and growing, " Mr. Roberts recalled. There was plenty of room to give the son a shot.
But as Brian Roberts worked his way up the ladder, the halcyon 1980's came to an end. The 1990's have been far tougher, as regulation and skepticism about the industry's future in the face of rival technologies hurt cable stocks. Like many other cable companies, Comcast peaked in late 1993, at $28.17 a share. It bottomed out at $16.375 last March and has recovered slightly, closing at $21.375 on Friday on Nasdaq.
ALL along, however, Mr. Roberts has drawn his son closer to the center of action inside Comcast and pushed him into the spotlight outside the company. "I thought if he was so young, you really have to be helped to be promoted to make it appear that you really are your own person," the elder Mr. Roberts recalled. "Every chance I get I step back and say, 'Here is Brian.' I didn't want it to appear that he was just his father's son."
For example, it was Brian Roberts who was on the board of Turner Broadcasting before Time Warner bought it in 1996, and it was Brian who was president of the National Cable Television Association's board in 1995.
Promoting an heir apparent may have been easier for the elder Mr. Roberts than for other entrepreneurs. Investors who know him say he always prefers to remain in the background and let others like Mr.Brodsky, the vice chairman, take the limelight. "I used to talk to Julian all the time," recalled Gordon Crawford, a senior vice president at the Capital Group, whose funds hold 8.1 percent of Comcast's class A stock. "I would see Ralph about once a year."
Brian Roberts, on the other hand, seems to relish his public role. "He gives more speeches than anyone who is asked," said one media executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But if it were not for self-promotion, how would a guy like Bill Gates take him seriously?"
Brian Roberts came to know Mr. Gates when a contingent of Comcast executives visited Microsoft on a fact-finding tour several years ago. They have met at the investment bank Allen & Company's annual Sun Valley Conference for media heavyweights, and they got together last summer when Mr. Gates came to speak at a United Way fund-raising event in Philadelphia.
The recent deal was begun when the executive committee of Cablelabs, the cable industry's research and development arm that included Brian Roberts and John Malone, chairman of Tele-Communications Inc., the country's largest cable operator, visited Microsoft in late April.
Mr. Gates told the group he believed the cable industry had been slow to upgrade its systems. Brian Roberts countered that other companies, including Comcast, were aggressively upgrading. Later, the two men found themselves in the same restaurant, and Mr. Roberts suggested that Microsoft consider investing in cable. Mr. Gates was warm to the idea. A result was Microsoft's $1 billion investment in Comcast.
As Gregory B. Maffei, Microsoft's treasurer, sees it, the younger Mr. Roberts is no pawn of his father. On the contrary, he says, "Brian takes the lead and is the one forging ahead and trying to figure out where they are going," Mr. Maffei said. "Brian is the more active participant."
And Peter Barton, the former president of Liberty Media, recalled that Brian Roberts played the key role in a complicated deal with Liberty involving the purchase of Time Warner's stake in E Entertainment, a cable-service company, for $321 million. Brian brought in the Walt Disney Company to put up most of the funds for the acquisition, even though Comcast management gained effective control of E Entertainment.
"Deals like Microsoft and QVC would not have happened without Brian," said Steven Rattner, deputy chief executive of Lazard Freres & Company, who has worked with the family for about a decade. "Ralph and Julian have been intimately involved, but Ralph doesn't sit there until 4 A.M. in the lawyers' offices anymore. Now Brian typically takes the lead."
To be sure, he adds, "At an important fork in the road, Brian will go off to his father" to get the older man's stamp of approval.
The company is clearly planning for the day that Ralph Roberts will no longer be running the show. Over the last five years, it has brought in a younger team of senior executives to work with Brian, including the executive vice president, Larry Smith, 49; the senior treasurer, John Alchin, 49, andthe president of the cable division, Tom Baxter, 50.
The son, meanwhile, remains an understudy of the father -- and the father is impressing upon the son the need to play hardball when the occasion demands it.
In 1994, for example, Ralph Roberts scuttled a bid by Barry Diller, then the chairman of QVC, the home-shopping cable channel, to acquire CBS. The deal would have relegated Comcast, the biggest QVC shareholder, to be a minor, and passive, investor in CBS, and the elder Mr. Roberts wanted no part of that. So he made his own bid for QVC, with TCI as a partner, effectively killing the CBS deal.
The memory of the fiasco still rankles Mr. Diller. "Ralph is tough," he says ruefully. "Under that bow tie and courtly manner beats the heart of one tough man. He is steel."
Ralph Roberts acknowledges that he was the heavy. "I was probably the one to pull the curtain," he said. "Barry is very charismatic and hypnotic, but we were not going to lose our business and become a nonvoting stockholder of CBS to provide Barry with an entree to CBS." Then, chuckling, he added, "It was probably a very good lesson for Brian -- no question about it."
The son got the point. His father's greatest skill, he said, "is the ability to make the hard decision at the crucial moment."
Once the elder Mr. Roberts is out of the picture at Comcast, Wall Street will be watching closely to see whether the son can be as tough and decisive as his father. It is a skill that Brian Roberts knows he has yet to prove and that is rare among the sons of powerful men, who are often overwhelmed by their fathers.
"It has been wonderful to share those tense moments with your father," Brian Roberts said, "and hopefully, it has prepared me for the future."
Brian Roberts acknowledges that decision making, what he calls "pulling the trigger," is something you learn. "Hopefully, I have had more experience than most people," he said, "but you never know."
At least Comcast has the financial flexibility to make the transition work. Like many media entrepreneurs, Ralph Roberts created several classes of stock, enabling him to issue equity without losing control. In 1963, the year he founded the company, he created Comcast class B shares, of which there are 8.8 million, each with 15 votes. The company also has 33 million shares of common stock with one vote each and 284 million K shares with no votes. The family holding company owns all the supervoting shares, as well as 1.8 million of the class A shares and 5.3 million of the nonvoting shares. In addition, Ralph Roberts personally owns another 5.2 million nonvoting shares, as well as 319,00 class A shares.
JUST as important, family-business experts say the apparent harmony within the Roberts family bodes well for the chances of a smooth transition. Mr. Roberts has been married to his wife, Suzanne, for 54 years. And the other children, who declined to be interviewed, are said to be knowledgeable about the plan and favorable to it.
"All this would never have happened in the arms of a second wife," according to Mr. Danco. "When some guy decides that he is so important that he dismisses Mama for some 35-year-old trophy, then I don't know what is fair. There are too many other combatants, and it becomes another deal. This has a pretty good chance of working. It is the mother who will make it work."
Both parents said that in bringing up their brood, they worked hard to see that the children connected with one another. "We never emphasized that they should make a lot of money, or have the biggest car," Mrs. Roberts recalled. And her husband reminisced about family trips. "We used to take the children away with us every year to climb the Pyramids or something memorable to keep their attention," he said. "We would have discussions about our lives. They were like mass therapy sessions with the children."
That was hardly a coincidence. When she was 60 years old, Mrs. Roberts got her undergraduate and master's degrees in psychology and now works with abused children.
Without being asked, Mrs. Roberts volunteered her opinion that Ralph and Brian clicked as few business partners do. "I have never seen a relationship that could surpass the two of them," she said. "I don't think Ralph knows any more about Brian's personal life than he knows about the others. But they talk all the time. It is always business. And if there is any disagreement, they can always talk it out. It is amazing."

How to Succeed in Politics Without Really Working

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
IMAGINE. The French Socialists want to shrink the work week by four hours, but without shrinking anyone's pay, which is wonderful politics, no doubt, but iffy economics. French industrialists must be itching to relocate to southeast Asia -- or the United States, for that matter -- where the natives will work more hours, not fewer, for no extra money.
That resignation is becoming entrenched in America. Neither President Clinton nor the Republicans dream of matching the campaign promise of Lionel Jospin, the newly elected French Prime Minister. The best they do is the Family Leave Act, which allows time off without pay. Even Mr. Jospin, in a speech to Parliament last week, hedged on his promise to reduce the standard French work week to 35 hours from 39 with no loss of pay. He suggested that workers might have to wait up to five years for this to happen. 
 And yet Mr. Jospin has tapped into a yearning that goes back to the early days of the industrial revolution, when people realized that their new ways of production were generating far more wealth than they had known in the past. So the industrial nations sought to translate some of their rising wealth into leisure time for workers, and eventually that happened. In 1870, Americans, Germans, French, Japanese and British averaged nearly 3,000 hours a year on the job. Now it is less than 2,000 hours, with much of the decline having come since World War II.
Each reduction in hours came at a cost, of course. A 6 percent raise -- not unusual in more robust times -- might be divided between 3 percent in cash and 3 percent in time off. Or workers might get their raises all in cash, and earn the leisure time through greater productivity -- producing in, say, seven hours all the goods and services they had needed eight hours to turn out a year or two earlier. The hour saved became time off.
Americans led in this process, and by the 1960's the average worker had fewer hours on the job than those in any of the other major industrial nations. Leisure had become a national goal, a badge of one's wealth. Today, all that is lost. Weekly schedules might be similar, but when vacations and holidays are factored in, no one in Western Europe works more hours in a year, on average, than Americans, according to data compiled by the Labor Department.
"There is no right way, but there is a balance," said Thomas Kochan, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. "We have probably overextended on the work side, and we are likely to see a backlash, perhaps from younger people."
The global economy changed things. Over the last couple of decades, less wealth has accumulated in the big industrial nations, and more in the developing countries. Faced with this competition, the United States has reversed course, adding hours.
The American reversal coincided with a change in the distribution of wealth. A disproportionate share of the more slowly rising national income went to the top third of American households, while the rest of the population did not earn enough to keep up with inflation. That inequality ended up encouraging both rich and poor to spend more time on the job -- that and the growing job insecurity that came with downsizing.
 
The Affluent, Too
 "The average American worker once got healthy raises, and of course he said he wanted some of it in more vacation time," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist. Now, Mr. Freeman and others argue, the less fortunate have to work more hours to earn enough to sustain their living standards.
The wealthy also have embraced longer hours, but for a different reason. For many professional people -- lawyers, engineers, consultants, managers -- "working longer hours has become the way to impress the boss and get promoted," Mr. Freeman said, "and shorter hours is thought of as giving up on the job. If we felt more secure we would probably work fewer hours."
Western Europe, distributing income more evenly, has continued the struggle for more leisure time, although the wealth to pay for it has diminished. And that is why Mr. Jospin's proposal is greeted with such skepticism -- more like a campaign promise that draws cheers, and votes, for its good intentions, although few really expect it to happen.
"The French, being more ideological, have trouble admitting they have to pay for working less," said Gerhard Bosch, a German sociologist who is vice president of the Institute of Work and Technology near Dusseldorf. "But they do; everyone knows that."
The differing approaches -- America's and Western Europe's -- naturally lead to finger-pointing. Mr. Bosch is a finger-pointer. The Americans, he says, should reduce their enormous overtime, and that would chip away at inequality by pulling more people into higher-paying jobs. The overtime is particularly noticeable among skilled, higher-paid factory workers -- the American corporate preference being to work existing staff longer hours rather than hire more people for these costly jobs.
"If the companies hired more people in lieu of overtime," Mr. Bosch said, "many low-paid people would give up bad jobs and make the switch. The problem is the United States has no national mechanism -- like laws that limit the number of hours people can work -- for redistributing work in a fair way. And unions are too weak to do this."
Some American experts are similarly critical of the Western Europeans. Unemployment rates are generally much higher there than in the United States, a result in part of national austerity programs that dampen economic activity, although the intention is to prepare each nation for a single European currency. But Alan Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton University, points to a different explanation of unemployment that has emerged from his research -- different even from the usual American criticism.
The usual American criticism is that European companies would step up their hiring, and reduce their unemployment, if wages were lower. In this view, pay, hours and unemployment are intertwined. In Mr. Krueger's view, though, there is not much correlation between wages and employment. The Europeans' main problem, he says, is regulations that prevent entrepreneurs from setting up companies quickly and easily and operating freely.
"There would be more hiring if there were more employers," Mr. Krueger said.
Whatever the back and forth, Americans, the well-off and the low-wage, seem locked into longer hours. With so many women in the work force putting in long hours, that puts tremendous pressure on family life. But rather than a rebellion, an adjustment of sorts is apparently being made, at least for higher-income people.
"We are seeing a lot more hidden flexibility on the part of companies in response to family needs," Mr. Kochan said. "People are finding informal ways to take time off, or to work from home, or at odd hours. There is a lot more individual bargaining going on in the professional and white-collar ranks."

HEADLINE: No Victors, Only Spoils;
How the War Goes On (And On) in Cambodia

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

 BODY:
AS Cambodia wobbles yet again on the edge of a violent implosion, barely five years (and billions of dollars) after the United Nations mounted the largest national recovery mission in its history, the rest of the world might justifiably wonder, as an anonymous diplomat asked last week, whether Cambodians are simply bent on killing each other. "Let them be," seems to be the common sentiment. "We have done all we can for them."
That's the problem. 
 There has always been foreign meddling in the affairs of this extraordinary country of Buddhist piety, royalist loyalty, artistic brilliance, exquisite natural beauty and inexplicably deep strains of human cruelty and venality.
Thailand, France, Japan, Vietnam, China, the United States have had a hand in writing and rewriting Cambodia's history and, more broadly, the history of Indochina. A short but not small part of the story is known to Americans as the Vietnam War.
The effects of that war are still being felt throughout Southeast Asia. Perhaps it was fateful coincidence last week that while rumors were flying in Cambodia that Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader responsible for at least a million deaths from 1975 to 1979, had been captured, Robert McNamara, the American Defense Secretary who played a major role in raising United States stakes in the war, was in Vietnam discussing how that war could have been avoided.
Perhaps, too, he had learned enough to know that history did not begin with the Americans.
The Indochinese conflicts of this century have roots in old animosities that were easily exploited by new players. The ancient Siamese were such a perennial threat to the Khmer people of what is now Cambodia that the home of the stupendous temples and palaces at Angkor was joyously and proudly named Siem Reap, for victory over Siam. Modern Thailand, which inherited that Siamese legacy, has never given up the game. The Thai military until very recently enjoyed a lucrative business partnership with the Khmer Rouge that allowed generals to exploit impoverished Cambodia's timber and gemstones.
Vietnam was Cambodia's other traditional foe. Some scholars on how Pol Pot came to power believe that the Khmer Rouge's vicious hate propaganda against Vietnam earned it genuine support -- and still does, because Cambodians believe their two larger neighbors will always fight over them.
But Siam and Vietnam were outdone by France, which consolidated its hold over Indochina -- Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos -- by the late 19th century. Decades of relative peace followed, until World War II when Japan occupied much of Southeast Asia. When the Japanese were driven out in 1945, it was only a matter of time before French Indochina became independent countries in 1953-54 -- and again vulnerable.
It is fitting that Mr. McNamara and veterans of the leftist-nationalist movement in Vietnam should be talking about how the war got out of control, because the critical decisions made in Hanoi and Washington in the 1950's and 1960's still send out ripples.
After the defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and the division of Vietnam, the communist leadership under Ho Chi Minh decided that the conquest of South Vietnam, not national development, was the top priority. America's entry did not deter Hanoi, only raised the real and human costs of its policy.
"Vietnam was prepared to make extreme sacrifices, but the Americans didn't understand this," Deputy Foreign Minister Dao Huy Ngoc told the gathering on Friday.
The war set Vietnam back at least a generation, but Hanoi thought the price worth the prize. While other Southeast Asian nations were spawning tiger-cub economies, the country was re-educating its people. The economic damage was compounded when an embittered United States, which had dropped bombs all over Indochina, denied Hanoi recognition and investment dollars for nearly 20 years after the fall of Saigon.
American capital and development -- including roads that the Vietnamese can only dream of -- rained on Thailand during the war. United States troops and planes found a home and a lot of good times. Thais, until they belatedly concluded that an American military presence would not serve their regional interests, prospered by the arrangement.
 
Missed Opportunity
 The Thai economy, however troubled, now dominates Laos, which America bombed to box in the Vietnamese, and where it armed anti-communist hill people. Many Hmong were abandoned by their American paymasters and left in refugee camps in Thailand. Laos, always fragile, has yet to recover from its role as ideological battleground.
But it is in Cambodia that the Vietnam War itself seems never to have ended. Cambodia was everybody's opportunity. The Vietnamese used it as a sanctuary for North Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong while talking of a federation of Indochinese states (dragging in the hapless Lao) that sounded very similar to what the French had planned half a century earlier. The communists in Beijing and Hanoi courted Cambodia's radical leftist movement, which Prince Norodom Sihanouk had first called, disdainfully, the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge had, paradoxically, picked up their communist education in France. The Prince, who found himself in opposition in the 1970's, flirted with them enough to give Pol Pot credence with many Cambodians and served briefly and disastrously as their figurehead when they took power in 1975.
By then the United States had waded clumsily into Cambodia to support the anti-communist Lon Nol Government that had overthrown Prince Sihanouk's original regime in March 1970. Secret American bombing raids into Cambodian territory in violation of Congressional restrictions, compounded by an American-South Vietnamese invasion, helped the Khmer Rouge recruit new followers, although many Cambodians say now that the raids were probably not the most critical factor in Pol Pot's rise to power, given the support he got from the Vietnamese and China -- and from Norodom Sihanouk.
The fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge in 1975, days ahead of the fall of Saigon, did not end American, Chinese or Vietnamese involvement in Cambodia. The war soon went on by proxy, with a part of the Khmer Rouge movement drawing closer to Vietnam as another faction threatened Hanoi's interests. In December 1978, Vietnam invaded, setting up a cooperative government the next month under Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge -- who is today the country's Second Prime Minister. China was furious and marched over the border into Vietnam to teach the Vietnamese a lesson. The Vietnamese taught them instead.
When the defeated Khmer Rouge fled toward the Thai frontier, they were drawn into an unholy alliance with the Cambodian royalists and a small, more democratic and moderate faction under Son Sann. China and the United States were among those who gave the alliance diplomatic and material support. Eager to rid Cambodia of the Vietnamese, Beijing and Washington, strongly supported by other Southeast Asian nations ready to seize economic opportunities in Indochina, forced Hanoi's withdrawal and engineered a peace treaty that put all factions back in play in Phnom Penh in 1992.
Until recently, it appeared that the Vietnam War had finally ended in Cambodia. Last week, the Cambodians struck up the music, and a new game of musical chairs began.

HEADLINE: Too Little? Too Late?;
The Foreign Aid Gamble in Africa

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Congo

 BODY:
IT was a high-powered team that President Clinton sent to meet with the new Government here: the United States representative to the United Nations, Bill Richardson; an assistant secretary of State; an admiral; a senior member of the National Security Council; a senior spy, a member of Congress.
But "the center of attraction," as Mr. Richardson said in introducing the delegation to Congolese officials, was the man from the Agency for International Development, Richard McCall. "He has the money," Mr. Richardson said of Mr. McCall, third in command at the agency that doles out American largesse. 
 All the new Congolese President, Laurent Kabila, has to do to get the money is become a democrat and free-market capitalist. Reinforcing that message, Commerce and Treasury officials were along, dangling financial lures. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were close behind.
"Bribery," some critics sneer, but diplomats prefer to call offers of aid "carrots" -- as opposed to "sticks," the economic sanctions and public condemnations of human rights abuses that have been applied in Iran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba and Burma. Whatever the label, why are American taxpayers being asked to dump millions of dollars into Congo, the giant Central African country that was so recently Zaire?
During the cold war, Washington opened the vault to the good, the bad and the ugly, just to keep them on America's side. Zaire's former President for life, Mobutu Sese Seko, was one dictator who qualified. But these days it is hard to find a geopolitical interest at stake in Congo.
 
Diplomats, Not Missionaries
 It could be argued that Washington and the West have a moral obligation, after catering to Mr. Mobutu while he looted Zaire and drove its populace into poverty. There are humanitarian impulses, to save children from malnutrition, to put books in schools and medicines in hospitals. But as Henry Kissinger said, the conduct of foreign policy is not missionary work.
There is, however, another reason for extending a hand to the leaders of Africa's third largest country: the self-interest of avoiding another international disaster. "If they fail, this country will explode," said Frederick Racke, the Dutch ambassador here. "We will have another Yugoslavia, on a continental scale."
Such an apocalyptic view cannot be dismissed out of hand -- Congo has some 200 ethnic groups, and it borders nine other countries. But will financial help from the West save Congo from becoming another Rwanda, where the horrors ultimately impelled Washington to act?
Not in the view of the Cato Institute. "Foreign aid has not delivered self-sustaining economic growth or prevented the collapse of numerous poor societies into chaos over the past five decades," said Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the research organization in Washington and author of a report, "Help or Hindrance: Can Foreign Aid Prevent International Crises?"
He cited $1.8 billion in aid to Sierra Leone, $3.1 billion to Haiti, $6.2 billion to Somalia -- all of which descended into civil disorder.
Aid advocates say it would be just as illogical to look at the far longer list of aid recipients that have not imploded and to conclude that aid was the reason. Policymakers also argue that without aid, Washington loses influence and leverage. The argument has merit, but history suggests both carrots and sticks are needed, and Washington has been reluctant to wield the latter.
A few years ago an outspoken American Ambassador, Smith Hempstone, publicly criticized Kenya every time it shut down a newspaper or jailed a dissident. It was rare conduct for an ambassador, not appreciated in Nairobi (or, for that matter, in the State Department), but it nudged Kenya's president, Daniel Arap Moi, closer to democracy than he wanted to go.
Diplomats say Mr. Kabila will also have to be prodded. There is nothing in his background to suggest that he will be a democrat, though some men around him have democratic desires.
Responding to the lure of aid, Mr. Kabila assured Mr. Richardson that he would allow a U.N. team to investigate whether his forces murdered Hutu refugees, and that he would let relief workers reach the surviving refugees.
 
Assurances, of a Kind
 But he conditioned the investigation on replacing the U.N. team's head, refused to say whether anyone would be punished if massacres were proven and refused ask his troops to respect relief workers. This brought criticism from those workers and human rights groups, who wished that the United States had been tougher.
The Clinton Administration says that any aid will depend on Mr. Kabila achieving political and economic reforms. But Congo needs immediate help, to revive the country and to enable the Government to pay civil servants and soldiers before they resort to old habits of demanding bribes and stealing. If the West acts too soon, Mr. Kabila may find it easy to ignore the calls for reform. If the West waits to see what he will do, it may be too late to help him.

HEADLINE: The World;
In Principle, a Case For More 'Sweatshops'

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
FOR more than a century, accounts of sweatshops have provoked outrage. From the works of Charles Dickens and Lincoln Steffens to today's television reports, the image of workers hunched over their machines for meager rewards has been a banner of reform.
Last year, companies like Nike and Wal-Mart and celebrities like Kathie Lee Gifford struggled to defend themselves after reports of the torturous hours and low pay of the workers who produce their upscale footwear or downmarket fashions. Anxious corporate spokesmen sought to explain the plants as a step up for workers in poor countries. A weeping Mrs. Gifford denied knowing about the conditions. 
 Now some of the nation's leading economists, with solid liberal and academic credentials, are offering a much broader, more principled rationale. Economists like Jeffrey D. Sachs of Harvard and Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say that low-wage plants making clothing and shoes for foreign markets are an essential first step toward modern prosperity in developing countries.
Mr. Sachs, a leading adviser and shock therapist to nations like Bolivia, Russia and Poland, is now working on the toughest cases of all, the economies of sub-Saharan Africa. He is just back from Malawi, where malaria afflicts almost all its 13 million people and AIDS affects 1 in 10; the lake that provided much of the country's nourishment is fished out.
When asked during a recent Harvard panel discussion whether there were too many sweatshops in such places, Mr. Sachs answered facetiously. "My concern is not that there are too many sweatshops but that there are too few," he said.
Mr. Sachs, who has visited low-wage factories around the world, is opposed to child or prisoner labor and other outright abuses. But many nations, he says, have no better hope than plants paying mere subsistence wages. "Those are precisely the jobs that were the steppingstone for Singapore and Hong Kong," he said, "and those are the jobs that have to come to Africa to get them out of their backbreaking rural poverty."
 
Rising Stakes
 The stakes in the battle over sweatshops are high and rising. Clinton Administration officials say commerce with the major developing nations like China, Indonesia and Mexico is crucial for America's own continued prosperity. Corporate America's manufacturing investments in developing nations more than tripled in 15 years to $56 billion in 1995 -- not including the vast numbers of plants there that contract with American companies.
In matters of trade and commerce, economists like Mr. Sachs, who has also worked with several Government agencies, are influential. A consensus among economists helped persuade President Clinton, who had campaigned against President Bush's plan of lowered restrictions, to ram global and North American trade pacts through Congress.
Paradoxically, economists' support of sweatshops represents a sort of optimism. Until the mid-1980's, few thought that third world nations could graduate to first world status in a lifetime, if ever. "When I went to graduate school in the early to mid-1970's," Mr. Krugman said, "it looked like being a developed country was really a closed club." Only Japan had made a convincing jump within the past century.
Those economists who believed that developing nations could advance often prescribed self-reliance and socialism, warning against foreign investment as a form of imperialism. Advanced nations invested in the developing world largely to extract oil, coffee, bananas and other resources but created few new jobs or industries. Developing nations, trying to lessen their reliance on manufactured imports, tried to bolster domestic industries for the home market. But these protected businesses were often inefficient and the local markets too small to sustain them.
 
From Wigs to Cars
 Then the Four Tigers -- Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan -- began to roar. They made apparel, toys, shoes and, at least in South Korea's case, wigs and false teeth, mostly for export. Within a generation, their national incomes climbed from about 10 percent to 40 percent of American incomes. Singapore welcomed foreign plant owners while South Korea shunned them, building industrial conglomerates of its own. But the first stage of development had one constant. "It's always sweatshops," Mr. Krugman said.
These same nations now export cars and computers, and the economists have revised their views of sweatshops. "The overwhelming mainstream view among economists is that the growth of this kind of employment is tremendous good news for the world's poor," Mr. Krugman said.
Unlike the corporate apologists, economists make no attempt to prettify the sweatshop picture. Mr. Krugman, who writes a column for Slate magazine called "The Dismal Scientist," describes sweatshop owners as "soulless multinationals and rapacious local entrepreneurs, whose only concern was to take advantage of the profit opportunities offered by cheap labor." But even in a nation as corrupt as Indonesia, he says, industrialization has reduced the portion of malnourished children from more than half in 1975 to a third today.
In judging the issue of child labor also, Mr. Krugman is a pragmatist, asking what else is available. It often isn't education. In India, for example, destitute parents sometimes sell their children to Persian Gulf begging syndicates whose bosses mutilate them for a higher take, he says. "If that is the alternative, it is not so easy to say that children should not be working in factories," Mr. Krugman said.
Not that most economists argue for sweatshops at home. The United States, they say, can afford to set much higher labor standards than poor countries -- though Europe's are so high, some say, that high unemployment results.
Labor leaders and politicians who challenge sweatshops abroad say that they harm American workers as well, stealing jobs and lowering wages -- a point that some economists dispute. "It is especially galling when American workers lose jobs to places where workers are really being exploited," said Mark Levinson, chief economist at the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, who argues for trade sanctions to enforce global labor rules.
Yet when corporations voluntarily cut their ties to sweatshops, the victims can be the very same people sweatshop opponents say they want to help. In Honduras, where the legal working age is 14, girls toiled 75 hours a week for the 31-cent hourly minimum to make the Kathie Lee Gifford clothing line for Wal-Mart. When Wal-Mart canceled its contract, the girls lost their jobs and blamed Mrs. Gifford.
 
No Jobs in Practice
 Mr. Krugman blames American self-righteousness, or guilt over Indonesian women and children sewing sneakers at 60 cents an hour. "A policy of good jobs in principle, but no jobs in practice, might assuage our consciences," he said, "but it is no favor to its alleged beneficiaries."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong and False Alarms

BYLINE: By Chas. W. Freeman Jr.; Chas. W. Freeman Jr. was Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs in 1993 and 1994.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Back in 1984, when Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to China in 1997 and China agreed to keep it as it was for "50 years at least," Deng Xiaoping remarked that Hong Kong would not change much over that period but China would. Eventually, China would become so much like Hong Kong, he implied, that there would be no significant difference between the two.
The Hong Kong Deng had in mind was economically libertarian but politically authoritarian. By 1984, Britons had governed their little part of China for more than 140 years. To that point, they had shown no inclination to temper their benevolent autocracy by letting Hong Kong Chinese have a role in the politics of the place. The colony's governor appointed the members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council, insisted on his right to approve public gatherings, scrutinized the local press for evidence of lese-majeste, and sometimes threw editors in jail for objecting to British rule. 
 As 1997 approached, however, Britain had a change of heart about the merits of democracy in Hong Kong. British negotiators convinced Beijing that, although Britain had not done so, China should institute a significant degree of democracy there. In 1989, Beijing and London solemnly agreed that, within a year of the July 1 transfer, Hong Kong's people would for the first time elect their Legislative Council.
But Chris Patten, the last British Governor, decided to jump the gun by staging elections in Hong Kong in 1995, two years before the July 1, 1997, handover. However poorly the elections squared with Britain's agreement with China, the action was understandable, given the apprehensions raised by China's ruthless suppression of the peaceful uprising in Tiananmen in 1989.
The Chinese insist that, notwithstanding what they regard as British perfidy, they will honor their word and sponsor new elections next year. Most people in Hong Kong clearly believe them. The stock and real estate markets there are booming. Still, Britain's decision to alter the rules unilaterally could be used by Beijing to justify its own deviations from the Sino-British accords after it reasserts its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
Had Governor Patten stuck to the letter and spirit of the accords, legislators appointed by him would have worked with his Hong Kong Chinese successor, Tung Chee-hwa, to set the rules for elections in Hong Kong. Instead, on July 1 China will carry through on its threat to dismiss the "illegally elected" legislature. A provisional legislature put together by China will replace it. Legislators appointed by China rather than Britain will determine how their successors are elected in 1998.
 The shape of democratic institutions in Hong Kong matters in no small measure because, so far, Deng has proved right. Since 1984, China has become a great deal more like Hong Kong. (Hong Kong, too, has changed, but not to resemble other parts of China.) There is no inherent reason that Hong Kong's powerful influence on China should not continue after July 1, or that its influence should be limited forever to economic rather than political liberalization.
Despite the unpromising beginning wrought by British actions and Chinese reactions, there are grounds for optimism. Chinese missteps in Hong Kong would be self-sanctioning, and China knows it.
If press freedoms are significantly curtailed, Hong Kong's role as a regional media center will wither; The Asian Wall Street Journal, International Herald Tribune, CNN and others will find a more congenial base for their operations. (There is a reason they are in Hong Kong rather than Singapore.) If Chinese interference or corruption saps the Hong Kong economy of its legendary vigor, its business elite will leave for Australia, Canada, the United States or other countries, where most have already established a right of residence. If the 1998 elections are a sham, the reaction in Hong Kong and abroad will severely damage the investment climate. The security of the Hong Kong dollar will be in doubt. Capital will go elsewhere.
Beijing understands all this. That's why it is a good bet that China will live up to its pledge that "Hong Kong people will run Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy." The greatest threats to Hong Kong, in fact, probably don't come from China at all.
On July 1, thousands of foreign reporters and dozens of camera crews will be in Hong Kong to watch the change of sovereignty. In politics, as in particle physics, observation of an event can change and define it. The reporters will be in Hong Kong looking for trouble. (Their editors are not sending them there to report good news.) That level of demand for trouble is likely to induce someone to supply it. Hong Kong could suffer irreparable damage from reporting that makes a photogenic but minor incident a misleading symbol of its future under Chinese rule.
Then there are the actions of the United States. The relationship between Hong Kong and China is symbiotic. Hong Kong's business elite is now much more worried about a fatal ricochet from the current fusillade of American potshots at China than it is about what China might do to it after July 1. Hong Kong would be the main victim of a decision by the United States to deny China normal trading status. American politicians, suffering from apparent "enemy deprivation" and calling for a new cold war with China, unnerve Hong Kong more than they do Beijing.
To continue to prosper, to evolve toward a more democratic society and to be a catalyst for accelerated change in China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China will need three things from the United States.
It will need policies that reflect sustained American concern for its well-being and seek to hold Beijing to its word. It will need sympathetic support as its politicians bargain with Beijing over the electoral system to take effect in 1998. But, most of all, it will need the security and confidence that only a stable and improving American relationship with China can provide.

HEADLINE: No Hot Air on Global Warming

 BODY:
Five years ago, more than 100 world leaders came together for the first international Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaving a diaphanous trail of promises to clean the earth's atmosphere, save its rain forests and otherwise collaborate on common environmental challenges. Many of these leaders or their successors will convene at the United Nations this week to review their work. There is little to celebrate. The oceans are as polluted as ever, and deforestation proceeds at a ruinous pace. Perhaps the most conspicuous failure, however, involves the hugely contentious subject of global warming.
President Clinton cannot avoid addressing that issue when he speaks on Thursday. With only 4 percent of the world's population, the United States produces more than a fifth of the "greenhouse gases" like carbon dioxide that are contributing to a gradual and potentially disruptive warming of the earth's surface. Moreover, the United States has fallen well short of its Rio pledge to stabilize greenhouse emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Only two of the industrialized nations that joined in that pledge, Germany and Britain, are expected to meet their targets. The United States will exceed it by 13 percent or more. 
 The Administration has already conceded that the voluntary approach endorsed in Rio is not working and that it will accept "binding," enforceable targets on greenhouse emissions if other industrialized nations go along. Mr. Clinton does not have to go much beyond that in his speech. A global treaty will not be signed until a final meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December. But he has to sketch the outlines of a credible and economically feasible plan aimed at the earliest possible reductions. He must also send a strong signal that if there is a final agreement in Kyoto, he and his Vice President, Al Gore, will work hard to get it through Congress. Any serious plan to reduce greenhouse gases will carry political risks because it will not be cost-free. Mr. Clinton's audience will want to know whether he and Mr. Gore are up to the challenge.
The President has one important thing going for him. There is a far broader scientific consensus on global warming than there was in Rio five years ago and there are many more creative ideas about how to address it. Here is where the issue stands.
The Science. One reason why the industrialized nations opted for voluntary targets in Rio was that mainstream scientists simply could not agree whether man-made emissions had contributed to the small rise in global temperatures that began late in the 19th century. In 1995, however, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, consisting of about 2,500 scientists, concluded that they had. Their language was cautious, their forecasts were gloomy.
Unless the current rates of combustion of carbon-based fuels -- coal, gas, oil -- could be reduced, they warned, temperatures would rise between 1.8 and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. Temperature changes in the middle level of that scale could cause a 20-inch rise in sea levels that would flood coastal lowlands and tropical islands, an increase in weather extremes, and global damage to forests and croplands. Despite challenges from businesses, which have been attacking the science in tobacco-industry fashion, the U.N. panel has not retreated from its basic findings.
Remedies and Costs. About one-third of the atmosphere's greenhouse gases is produced by electric power plants, one-third by cars and trucks and one-third by other commercial enterprises and ordinary households. Reducing these gases not only means using less energy. It will also require expensive investments in cleaner fuels, cleaner cars and new technologies.
Some industrial spokesmen have said that this is a recipe for national bankruptcy. Earlier this year, however, about 2,000 economists signed a statement asserting that the benefits of action on climate change outweighed the costs and that a well-tailored plan relying totally on market mechanisms could actually improve productivity. A study by the World Resources Institute reached the same conclusion. Both the economists and the study suggested that one mechanism could be a carbon tax that would make coal and petroleum fuels more costly and discourage consumption. The revenue from the tax would then be recycled into the economy in the form of lower payroll and corporate taxes, thus encouraging new investment.
Since a carbon tax is unlikely to fly in Congress, both the economists and the study suggested a more politically palatable option that the Administration has generally embraced -- an international emissions-trading scheme that would set a global ceiling on emissions and give each country a national ceiling. The idea behind this scheme is that rich nations who cannot keep within their limits without crippling financial investments will be able to "buy" pollution permits from poorer countries whose economies are so inefficient that even the tiniest adjustments can achieve big reductions in greenhouse emissions.
This mechanism is not without flaws, and it remains to be seen whether everyone can agree on such a complicated scheme before Kyoto. But in the long run Mr. Clinton's greatest problem may to be to convince Congress, which must ratify whatever emerges from Kyoto, to take the issue of global warming as seriously as the scientists do. That means taking it seriously himself and getting his Vice President, who has been silent on the issue of late, to speak out. It was Mr. Gore, after all, who asserted in "Earth in the Balance" that global warming "threatens to destroy the climate equilibrium we have known for the entire history of the human race. . . . The longer we wait, the more unpleasant our choices become."

HEADLINE: In One Somali Town, Clan Rule Has Brought Peace

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: BOSSASO, Somalia, June 17

 BODY:
Like many people in this town on the northeastern Somali coast, Halima Farah Jibril knows what it means to lose everything and start all over in a barren place with no friends.
Her husband, a successful veterinarian in Mogadishu, the nation's capital, was killed by a stray bullet in 1991 as he tried to protect their five-bedroom villa from looters. 
 Mrs. Farah Jibril fled the city with her five children in the back of a truck, bumping several hundred miles through deserts and mountains. She headed north to Bossaso, her clan's homeland, where she had heard there was relative peace.
Now she sleeps on the ground in a tattered tent of plastic and rags behind a rough-hewn wooden kiosk, where she serves passers-by tea to eke out a living. Her children cannot go to school because she is too poor to pay their tuition. She must pay $20 a month for the patch of parched earth where she and her family live.
"We were living a very luxurious life," she said, pulling her little boys closer in the dappled shadows under her tent, "but now we are barely staying alive. Somalia has fallen into the hands of wolves, who believe only in tribalism. It will be hard to repair the damage."
Mrs. Farah Jibril, who is 40, is one of tens of thousands of people from all over Somalia who have flocked to the Red Sea port of Bossaso since 1991 to begin rebuilding their lives after civil war and famine shattered them. Once a sleepy town of fewer than 10,000, it now has more than 80,000 residents, a stable government and a growing economy.
If Somalia has a future after the anarchy and clan warfare of the last seven years, it may be glimpsed in the dusty, oven-hot streets here.
This nation has been without a government since 1991, when President Mohammed Siad Barre was overthrown and a civil war erupted over who would succeed him. A famine caused by the fighting killed about 300,000 people in 1992.
Since then, the faction leaders have carved up the country, endlessly skirmishing over its carcass. The fighting has closed down the ports in Mogadishu, Merca and Kismayu. Again and again the faction leaders have failed to reach agreement on forming a national government.
But in Bossaso, the local military and political leaders have established a regional government controlled by clan elders, bringing stability to three northeastern provinces in the Horn of Africa, an area about the size of California.
Though the six million people of Somalia share language and culture, their society is sharply divided along clan lines. For Somalis, until recently a completely nomadic people, the clan is the most important organizing principle.
It provides each person not only with an identity but also with a system for resolving disputes and, if necessary, a small army of warriors willing to fight to avenge an attack.
The five principal clans are the Dir, the Isaaq, the Hawiye, the Darod and the Rahanweyn, but there are dozens of subclans as well. Not surprisingly, the political factions break down along these lines.
The northeastern region, known as Puntland or Majerteinia, is controlled by Gen. Mohammed Abshir Musa, 72, leader of the Majertein clan's political wing, the Somalia Salvation Democratic Front.
Partly because the region is dominated by the Majertein clan, in contrast to areas like Mogadishu, where no single clan dominates, the elders here have managed to keep the peace. Political fights are settled in smoky back-room debates at a Bossaso hotel rather than with guns in the streets.
In reality, General Abshir's administration is an experiment in clan-based government. The 13-member council of Majertein elders appoints parliaments to administer each region, drawing the members from the leadership of various subclans and minorities. If there are unresolved disputes in the parliaments, the ultimate power rests with the elders' council.
"We have an elders' council here and it's respected," said Abdullahi Dahir, a hotel manager who moved from Mogadishu in 1995. "It's like a court. Whatever they decide, even if it's very sour, you accept."
It is a measure of the elders' power that there has been no violence in Bossaso since the regional governor resigned last month in a disagreement over the use of port taxes and a dispute broke out over succession. The governor's seat has yet to be filled, but local politicians say it is unlikely that blood will be shed in the process.
"In the northeast, God forbid, we disagree but we don't shoot each other," General Abshir said.
The relative security of Bossaso has attracted thousands of southern people trained in business and other skills. As a result the economy is growing steadily, despite some setbacks. Electricity and running water are plentiful. Telephone companies have set up satellite links with the rest of the world.
Police officers in new uniforms patrol the rubble-strewn streets. The Bossaso market is full of goods. Buildings are going up everywhere, testament to local business people's faith in the region's stability. There are also plans to institute a civil court to supplement the traditional Islamic court, which has been the only form of justice for a year.
More important, trade is thriving again along its ancient routes. Every day the port is crowded with dhows coming in from Kenya, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Dubai and India. They bring in flour, cloth, rice and manufactured goods. The Somalis ship out their camels, goats, sheep, frankincense, shark meat and other seafood.
A few traders are making fortunes, aid workers say. About 50 mercantile families are now operating in Bossaso, many originating from strife-torn areas.
Yet the vast majority of the new arrivals in Bossaso are like Mrs. Farah Jibril, impoverished refugees who face enormous hardships. There are no public services to speak of, no sewers, no public schools, few hospitals, fewer paved roads. The town also needs investment to build canning factories, slaughterhouses, milk processing plants and cement factories, politicians say.
"There is a lot of unemployment in the area and the town lacks services," said Hadje Hussein Gaite, chairman of the local parliament. "We know our deficiencies and weaknesses but we hope God will help us. If someone gets sick and tries to cure himself, the recovery doesn't come immediately."
Despite these problems, most people who have migrated to Bossaso say they prefer it to anywhere else in Somalia, because at least one can walk the streets without fearing the sudden, deadly rattle of gunfire. Even if a national government is resurrected, many recent arrivals say they intend to stay put.
"I'm not willing to go back to the south," said Ali Farah Ali, a fishery expert who moved from the capital three years ago. "I had invested in Mogadishu. I had a house and I had to leave everything -- everything. I'm not going repeat that mistake."

HEADLINE: Limits on Lawsuits and Damage Claims Could Bring Years of Legal Fights

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
A day after cigarette makers and the attorneys general of seven states proposed a historic agreement to settle claims against the tobacco industry, legal experts predicted that even if the proposal overcame hurdles in Congress, it was certain to be tied up in years of litigation.
"It is a highly innovative proposal, but it is very uncertain whether it will survive," said George L. Priest, the John M. Olin Professor of Law and Economics at Yale Law School and an authority on product liability. "No one believes people will stop dying of lung cancer. My suspicion is that litigation surrounding cigarettes will never end." 
 The proposed settlement, which needs the approval of Congress and the White House to take effect, received only a lukewarm reception on Capitol Hill and a noncommittal response from President Clinton on Friday. Experts said that even if it was ultimately adopted, court fights could delay many, if not all, of the provisions -- particularly disputes on lawsuits from victims of cigarette-related health problems, whose lawsuits and damage claims would be sharply limited under the proposal.
And while it is uncertain how the proposal will be changed by Congress and the White House, it is also not clear whether all the states will sign the accord. One Attorney General, Hubert H. Humphrey 3d of Minnesota, has criticized the settlement proposals as, in effect, a sellout to the industry, and officials from other states have said they will have to study the plan carefully before they decide what to do.
Even though the tobacco companies described the agreement as a "bitter pill," in truth it was a potentially lifesaving palliative. By putting a cap on the amount that companies would be liable for in lawsuits, the settlement removes a dark cloud that has shadowed the industry.
But the same provisions that are attractive to the industry -- the cap on damages and limits on class-action lawsuits -- threaten to undo the agreement. The legality of efforts to bind or restrict future claimants is largely unsettled, but the Supreme Court could speak to the issue in the next few days in Amchem Products v. Windsor, an asbestos class-action suit that seeks to limit the rights of future claimants.
"The concern is that the settlement inevitably will affect plaintiffs in a rather negative way," said James A. Henderson Jr., the Frank B. Ingersoll Professor at Cornell Law School and the author of numerous books and articles on product liability. "The deal, let me put it bluntly, leaves almost everyone well off. The attorneys general look good and will become governors and senators. The plaintiffs' lawyers will get their stuff.
"But there may be some people affected by cigarettes who are left with no relief."
Although tobacco companies have the strongest winning record of any industry in the courts, it has long been the fear of cigarette executives that the tide might soon turn, particularly as more internal documents have begun to surface suggesting that the companies have known the dangers of cigarettes for many years.
So experts said that it was not surprising that a centerpiece of the proposed settlement was important new restrictions against future court claims, along with other safeguards that would make it significantly harder for smokers and other victims of cigarette-related health problems to prevail in the courts.
"This proposal looks like a large payment to avoid punitive liability," Professor Priest said. "The companies have been winning on the liability issues. They have not faced punitive damages. Why are they doing this? The reason has to be the fear of punitives, and the fear of class-action lawsuits running out of control."
Companies in the asbestos and pharmaceutical industries have already been forced into bankruptcy by the wave of lawsuits from their products, and tobacco executives, despite ultimately winning every lawsuit ever filed, had begun to grow concerned that the rising hostility in the United States to smoking could start to affect juries.
The proposed settlement would dramatically alter the legal landscape by barring the most threatening kinds of lawsuits and sharply limiting damages. Future class-action suits, in which large groups of people in similar situations file claims in one suit, would be barred, and current class-action suits would be settled under terms that have not been fully outlined.
Plaintiffs like class-actions suits and companies hate them because they can result in far larger awards than can individual suits.
The agreement would also ban punitive damages for any of the past behavior of companies. Such damages are typically awarded when a judge or jury finds egregious examples of misconduct, like deceit or concealment of research -- the kinds of conduct that tobacco critics say is documented in the company papers made public in recent years by industry whistle-blowers.
Though cigarette smokers, their survivors and victims of second-hand smoke would still be able to sue individually, the proposal would limit the total amount that the industry would have to pay in court settlements to $5 billion a year.
The companies would be required to reserve $4 billion a year for a fund for those court payments, and if it was depleted payments to plaintiffs would be made the next year. Any money left in the fund at the end of each year would be transferred to new anti-tobacco programs rather than be returned to the industry.
The attorneys general and the companies said on Friday that they were confident that these amounts would be more than sufficient to satisfy any claims.
Paradoxically, the proposal would require new warnings on cigarette packages and educational programs sponsored by the cigarette companies that would make it easier for the companies to claim that they had given ample notice to smokers, making lawsuits against the companies harder to pursue.
The warnings that cigarette companies were required to put on packages in the 1960's were ultimately used by them as parts of successful defenses in later lawsuits.

HEADLINE: New York May Use Money to Aid Children

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 21

 BODY:
Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco of New York said on Friday night that he would urge legislative leaders to dedicate half the money the state would receive under the legal settlement with the tobacco industry to establish a program providing medical coverage to hundreds of thousands of uninsured children each year.
Mr. Vacco estimated that the state would receive $400 million this year as a result of the settlement of its lawsuit against tobacco companies. That figure will grow in subsequent years as it is adjusted for inflation, increasing to as much as $700 million four years from now, he said. 
 Mr. Vacco said he was confident that the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki would use half the proceeds from the settlement to provide medical coverage to the state's 620,000 uninsured children because they would otherwise have to return the money to the Federal Government.
The other half of the money would be evenly divided between the state and local governments, which could use it for such varied purposes as closing gaps in their budgets and making up for tax cuts, Mr. Vacco said.
"This agreement is far more than I could ever have anticipated back in January when I filed this lawsuit," Mr. Vacco said at a news conference on Friday night after returning from the tobacco negotiations in Washington.
The effects of the proposed settlement were less clear among officials in New Jersey, where the administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was uncertain about how much the state could expect to receive. Still, officials said about $100 million of the settlement money would be used to repay hospitals for what they spent providing treatment to uninsured patients.
In Connecticut, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the state stood to gain as much as $100 million a year from the settlement. He said at least half of that money would be spent on providing medical care to uninsured children. Mr. Blumenthal also said much of the remaining money would be used to cover the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses and legal fees.
Mr. Vacco sued the tobacco industry on Jan. 27 to recover money that New York had spent on illnesses caused by smoking, making the state the 19th among 40 so far to file such a lawsuit. Democrats and health care experts had criticized Mr. Vacco, a Republican, for not suing the companies earlier.
But Mr. Vacco said he had tried for six months to avoid a lawsuit, seeking $656 million in damages -- a settlement that his critics said was far too small.
Connecticut and New Jersey filed their lawsuits months earlier.

HEADLINE: Russia Sits with 'Big 8,' Party Crasher No More

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: DENVER, June 21

 BODY:
In 1991 in London, Mikhail S. Gorbachev was invited to join the leaders of the Group of Seven only for lunch, after their working sessions.
In 1992, Boris N. Yeltsin came to the meeting in Munich as a penitent, getting some aid and two meals, though by most accounts he crashed dinner. 
 Mr. Yeltsin had to skip last year's meeting in Lyons, France, because he was in a difficult re-election campaign, which was followed by a heart attack, open-heart surgery and a serious case of pneumonia.
But here in Denver, with the strong support of "my friend Bill," as Mr. Yeltsin calls President Clinton, Russia is being treated as a full-fledged member of what is now being called the Summit of the Eight.
It is an extraordinary change for Russia, which used to be the troubling focus of Group of Seven meetings, where Western leaders worried about Moscow's political chaos, nuclear weapons and inflationary economy. Today, Russia sits with the rest, worrying about China.
Mr. Yeltsin -- expansive and self-confident, by all accounts drinking less, and telling everyone he meets that he's lost nearly 60 pounds since his surgery -- is relishing his new status.
No matter that the Japanese, and more quietly the French, believe Russia's economy, chaotic and comparatively small, does not warrant full membership in this group of the most important industrialized democracies.
The Japanese in particular are angry with Mr. Clinton's decision to give the Russians such a prominent role here, and are asking why China is not invited, if Russia is. The American answer is, shrugging, that Russia is a democracy and China is not, as if NATO expansion and the success of Russian reform were afterthoughts.
Except for a single hourlong meeting today on financial targets, Russian officials are taking part in every session, and Mr. Yeltsin will sign Sunday's final communique along with the other leaders.
"What you see here is a sweeping integration of Russia into the major decision-making institutions in the world in a way that is very positive for the rest of us," Mr. Clinton said on Friday.
"It's quite a hopeful moment for the world," he continued. "This is the first time we've ever had a meeting where the Russians were here from the beginning to the end. It's a great tribute I think to President Yeltsin's leadership and to the commitment of the Russian people to democracy and reform."
Russia's inclusion also reflects Mr. Clinton's new willingness, as a relatively senior member now of the group, to take the lead.
Mr. Clinton's foreign policy has been marked by uncompromising support for Mr. Yeltsin throughout his wild and eventful stewardship of a new Russia -- through all the difficulties of coup attempts, erratic behavior and brutal wars against secessionists in Chechnya and part of Georgia.
In return, Mr. Yeltsin has swallowed the expansion of NATO, but has insisted nonetheless that Russia, however reduced in power and reach, take its place as one of the world's great nations.
"Russia sees the importance of prestige," said a senior diplomat from a formerly Communist nation. "It demands to be treated as a great country seated at the table with other great countries."
Russia is best able to accept its strategic defeat -- which was also a self-liberation from Communism -- if it can don the trappings of the superpower it used to be, suggested Andrei Piontkovsky, director of Moscow's Center for Strategic Studies.
"It is part of the West's psychotherapy for Russia, and for Yeltsin personally," he said.
So it was no surprise that the Russians told the interior designer who remodeled Mr. Yeltsin's rooms at the Embassy Suites here to give them "an Oval Office feeling," The Rocky Mountain News reported.
Or that Mr. Yeltsin and his spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, gloat that they are in Denver, and not the Chinese.
"As soon as you leave the airport here, you see signs saying 'G-8,' " said Mr. Yastrzhembsky. "Denver has clarified this formal position."
He noted that Mr. Clinton had given Mr. Yeltsin the honor of speaking first at Friday's night's opening dinner for the meeting, and said proudly: "This time there will be no special meetings dedicated to Russia, as in the past. That means that Russia is a full-fledged member of the eight," which the Russians insist on calling "the Big Eight."
During the hourlong meeting that Mr. Yeltsin will miss, he will meet representatives of leading American companies, most particularly the Lockheed Martin Corporation, which has worked very hard to make the Russians feel at home here.
The company -- which has lobbied hard in Washington for NATO expansion, hoping to sell new members its F-16 fighter planes -- helped throw a lavish cocktail party for Mr. Yeltsin on Thursday night at the Denver Museum of Natural History.
Mr. Yeltsin, after a change of plans, arrived too late to attend, but the Russian Ambassador, Yuli M. Vorontsov, gave a warm toast, and Russian officials like the consul general in San Francisco, Vladimir Kuznetsov, spoke proudly of how "Russia in space still has great achievements to its name."
Lockheed is buying a largely Russian-designed rocket engine, produced as a joint venture between NPO Energomash and Pratt & Whitney, for its Atlas IIAR commercial rockets -- originally created in the 1950's to hurl nuclear warheads at Russia but now designed to put telecommunications satellites into space. This is not just a gesture, Lockheed insists. Just before Mr. Yeltsin's arrival, Lockheed announced that it would buy up to 101 engines for about $1 billion.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright also did her diplomatic bit here, taking Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov to dinner at a Denver restaurant featuring rattlesnake and "Rocky Mountain oysters" -- buffalo testicles.
Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, said that for 50 years, "we defined our relationship in the world in distinction to the Soviet Union."
"We spent hundreds of billions of dollars fighting the cold war," he said. "We now have an opportunity to integrate a democratic Russia into the global economy and into the institutions of the international community, and that has enormous payoff for the American people if it succeeds and enormous downside if it fails."
If massaging Russia requires a degree of fakery and disingenuousness, a senior American official implied, it is a small price to pay.
"I don't really care what Yeltsin does here," the official said. "What's important is that he is here."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC UNEASE LOOMS OVER TALKS AT DENVER SUMMIT

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: DENVER, June 21

 BODY:
President Clinton and the leaders of Russia, Japan and Western Europe plunged into the messy business of defining their new roles in the global economy today, with Russia pressing for quick entry into the World Trade Organization and Europe struggling to save its effort to unify under a single currency.
Buoyed by the strongest economic performance in the world, Mr. Clinton exuded optimism at the opening of the summit meeting, which until this year was called the Group of Seven, but now, with the inclusion of Russia, is formally called the Summit of the Eight. Nevertheless the President's aides were clearly skeptical that Russia and Europe were prepared to adopt the major economic reforms that American officials believe are necessary in the next year or two. 
 In return for its grudging agreement to the expansion of NATO, Russia was all but promised entry by next year into the World Trade Organization, the club of trading nations. The move would greatly help its exports by lowering tariffs on Russian-made goods.
But Administration officials say they are highly skeptical that President Boris N. Yeltsin can move that quickly to push through the wrenching market openings and legal changes that are the price of entry. Similar problems have bogged down negotiations over China's effort to enter the trading group.
As the weekend meeting of the eight leaders opened here on Friday, Administration officials were also dancing around the question of whether Europe's effort to create a single currency, the euro, by 1999 could threaten the financial stability of America's oldest trading partners. European officials had pressed for a blanket endorsement of the single currency in an economic statement released today.
But the United States, with the backing of Japan and Britain, insisted on a far more conditional endorsement. The final statement says the leaders would welcome monetary union if it was accompanied by major economic reforms, and "would contribute to the stability of the international monetary system." Those are code words for an end to the inflexible rules that have prevented companies from paring down, moving workers, and becoming far more competitive on world markets.
"France, Germany and Italy share the challenging task of restoring strong employment growth," the economic statement said. "While pursuing efforts toward restoring sound fiscal positions they will need to deepen structural reforms to reduce barriers to job creation and to increase efficiency of government actions and, where necessary, reshape its role in their economies."
In today's discussion among the leaders, there was a vigorous debate between France and other participants over whether it is possible to shorten the French work week, which the new Socialist Government has promised, without slowing economic growth. American officials have argued that Europe's work week needs to be lengthened, but it is unclear whether the United States pressed that argument today.
A senior Administration official said here on Friday that beneath the bland wording of the statement, "there is a lot more nervousness than there was just a month or two ago that the Europeans haven't grappled with the real implications of what they are attempting."
"We haven't gone as far as saying that they are on the verge of messing up the Continent -- that would only fuel their resentment -- but you'll probably hear some more explicit description of the risks," the official said.
Today's sessions, largely devoted to questions of economic integration, marked the middle day of the annual summit meeting. Mr. Clinton was an ebullient host, alternately drawing his guests' attention to the soaring American economy and the soaring view of the Rockies from downtown Denver, where the formal meetings are taking place at the public library.
Tonight, the leaders are dining at The Fort, a popular tourist attraction made to look like an old adobe fort. Buffalo meat is the house speciality.
At Friday's meetings, the boasting about America's economic performance among Administration officials was growing so pronounced that Mr. Clinton cautioned his aides to tone down unflattering comparisons to Europe and Japan.
But it was too late: his aides had already distributed an 11 page packet comparing America's economic performance since 1990 with that of the other nations present.
The statistics showed the United States exceeding those nations in economic growth, job creation and investment in factories and new technologies.
"I think the President decided we were laying it on a little thick," one of his aides said on Friday.
During his meeting with President Jacques Chirac of France, for example, President Clinton hailed France's comprehensive medical care system, particularly for children, and declared that the United States had much to learn from the French approach.
Those comments clearly seemed intended to balance the Administration's many suggestions recently weeks that France's election of a Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, threatened to send the country into an era of overspending instead of austerity.
The political communique scheduled for release on Sunday -- but posted on the Internet today by a Canadian university that had obtained an early copy -- cautions China to respect Hong Kong's "fundamental freedoms." A breach of China's commitments to do so, it warned, using language that American officials had been repeating for some months, could undermine "the essential undepinning for Hong Kong's future economic success."
The communique called for relatively quick democratic elections for a new legislature to govern Hong Kong.
The draft also included an indirect warning to Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, and to Franjo Tudjman, recently re-elected Croatia's President, insisting that refugees have the right to return to their homes or the government will risk a cutoff in economic assistance.
That reinforces a position that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has taken in recent months but adds the voices of the other major powers.
The leaders had spent some time this morning discussing a new movement among the industrialized nations, propelled by the United States, to make the bribery of foreign officials a crime.
Until recently such bribery of foreign officials was tax deductible in Germany, while in the United States it has been a felony since the passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act two decades ago. American companies have complained for years that they are at a disadvantage in the cutthroat international competition for multibillion-dollar contracts for building everything from satellite networks to new airports.
The countries represented here committed today to submit legislation to their parliaments by April 1998 to criminalize such bribery.

HEADLINE: Environmental Groups Say Gore Has Not Measured Up to the Job

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 21

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore, one of the environmental movement's steadiest allies, is under attack from major conservation groups in an unlikely turn that carries important implications for environmental policy as well as Presidential politics.
The groups say they are frustrated, even angry, that, in their view, Mr. Gore has failed to exert strong influence on two of the environmental movement's top priorities this year: toughening air pollution standards and negotiating deep cuts in worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases. In the next few days, President Clinton, who defers to Mr. Gore on most environmental matters, is expected to spell out his positions on both questions. 
 Although environmentalists form the core of Mr. Gore's political base, organizations that have sided with the Vice President throughout his public career are now using extraordinarily blunt language to warn that "green" voters might abandon him in the Democratic primaries in 2000 unless he delivers now on these crucial issues.
Top environmental lobbyists have even met with Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader who is a leading rival for the Democratic nomination, urging him to demand that the White House display more leadership on their issues.
The environment is but one issue in which Mr. Gore's positions and influence in the White House will draw intensified attention as he gears up to run for President.
Mr. Gore has for years also scored politically on other issues that are very much in the news now, like telecommunications policy, anti-tobacco measures, television ratings, biomedical ethics and censorship on the Internet. Now that many of these issues have become particularly contentious, Mr. Gore may well be forced to play a more public role in the debates over them.
In an interview late Friday, Mr. Gore defended his environmental record and said that his job demanded that he work behind the scenes. "Everybody knows my views," he said. "But I am not going to publicly try to back the President into a corner. I never have done that, and I never will."
Mr. Gore acknowledged that the pressure from environmental groups had been intense in recent weeks. The Sierra Club has begun television advertising campaigns in early primary states, urging Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore to "stand up to the special interests."
Environmental groups have distributed a polemic to editorial writers that derides remarks by the President and the Vice President on global warming as "hot air."
And in a letter last week on the air standards, 84 environmental and health groups wrote, "We are deeply disturbed and perplexed by the apparent lack of visible and vocal support from the White House for the proposed new standards."
"What we need and what we expect is leadership," said Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters, a political action committee that stands out from other environmental groups because it openly endorses candidates. "Not to speak out and not to influence the President is not leadership. It is a bit perplexing that he would step back from providing this leadership." Ms. Callahan worked for Mr. Gore's Presidential campaign in 1988.
Philip E. Clapp, president of the Environmental Information Center, a relatively new but increasingly influential advocacy group, put it this way: "The failure of the White House to provide any leadership on the clean air standards and on climate change raises real questions about what real environmental progress Vice President Gore can point to in claiming the mantle of the environmental candidate in the year 2000."
In the interview, Mr. Gore did not seem distressed by the barrage of criticism. "I quite understand why some group that feels passionately would decide to pull out all the stops to try to gain leverage in any way they can," he said. "And that is their job. My job is not to publicly argue for a specific policy that has not yet been formally recommended to the President and take options away from him."
But as the complaints about what one environmentalist called "Al Gore's silent spring" have intensified, the Vice President has scrambled in the last two days to reassure environmental leaders privately. And his aides have begun to signal that Mr. Gore was weighing in behind the scenes for a decision on clean air standards that would satisfy the environmentalists.
Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. Administrator, said in an interview: "There is no doubt in my mind that the Vice President is in there doing what he has done on many difficult issues.
"He is moving the ball," she said, "providing the leadership, making the case for strong public health protection." For months, Ms. Browner advocated tougher air quality rules without a word in her defense from the White House.
Mr. Gore's advisers accused his newfound critics of an orchestrated drive to prod him even further on their issues. "I guess the problem is, you always hurt the one you love," said Kathleen McGinty, the senior environmental aide at the White House. "The environmentalists have a strategy here to send a message to us because they know the Vice President does care about what they say."
The Administration's proposals on air quality and global warming have come under intense criticism in Congress and from major industries, especially oil, coal and car companies, and White House economic advisers are battling with environmental officials over how aggressive a stance to take.
Some environmental leaders accused Mr. Gore of taking his environmental support for granted so he can make overtures to business and labor interests that could help him raise millions of dollars to compete in the Democratic primaries.
This is not the first time that environmentalists have criticized Mr. Gore for wavering on their issues. But never before has the message been delivered so bluntly. Administration officials are bracing for demonstrators next week when the President and Vice President are in New York to meet with world leaders for a conference on climate change.
And no longer is it only Republicans who are tearing apart copies of Mr. Gore's book on the environment, "Earth in the Balance." Now, environmental groups are distributing passages from the book as evidence of the Vice President's failure to make progress on the environment.
While environmentalists also criticize the Administration's positions on endangered species issues, the regulation of toxic water pollution from paper mills and a forest service plan for continued logging in the Tongass National Forest, the debate has become feverish as two of the environmentalists' top priorities -- clean air standards and global warming -- have come before the White House. The Administration is under a court order to decide within a month how tightly to control emissions of smog and soot, and the White House's economic advisers, heeding pleas from industry, have been urging the Environmental Protection Agency to ease its earlier proposals.
The other pending environmental issue, strengthening the treaty on climate change, will be at the forefront at a United Nations conference in New York beginning on Monday. Signatories to the treaty, written five years ago in Rio de Janeiro, are trying to negotiate by year-end a tougher version setting mandatory limits on the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which are implicated in global warming and are continuing to rise. But the United States has refused so far to commit to a timetable for reducing greenhouse gases and has signaled that some other countries' targets may be too ambitious.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, one group joining in the chorus for stronger actions on climate change, has bought newspaper advertisements to that effect on the eve of the United Nations meeting.
But John Adams, the head of the group, spoke sympathetically of Mr. Gore in an interview. "I know people are angry and are upset and they want to win here, but I want to have a relationship based on the total record," he said. "This is a good man who cares about the environment -- and he is a good man to have on our side."
Some environmentalists suggested that part of Mr. Gore's calculation was to win favor from Mayors Richard M. Daley of Chicago and Dennis W. Archer of Detroit and other influential Democrats who strongly oppose tightening air standards and could be important allies in the Presidential primaries. Potential Republican rivals -- Govs. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, George E. Pataki of New York and William F. Weld of Massachusetts -- are already speaking out for stronger clean air standards.
And Mr. Gore, party strategists say, cannot appear too willing to support environmental policies with no concern about the economic consequences. Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, said the Democrats could not afford to be "too hard on business at the risk of reducing job growth -- that's the conundrum they're in."
Ronald Klain, Mr. Gore's chief of staff, rejected those criticisms. "They should have a little faith," he said of the environmental groups. "His views on the environment have never been about votes or having things in his pocket, but about an agenda he deeply and personally believes in."
Even a senior aide to Mr. Gephardt, speaking on the condition that he not be identified, said the Vice President might well survive the onslaught from environmentalists. "They may be downplaying their expectations," the adviser said of calculations in the White House, "so Gore can claim he saved the day" for the environmental movement.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said Mr. Gore could use these looming environmental decisions to repair his relationship with businesses. "He's got a poor relationship with the business community on all of these regulatory issues," he said. The environmental groups are worried, he said, because "if they lose Gore, they don't have anyone left."

HEADLINE: VOLLEYBALL;
Sand Game Hampered By a Lack Of Unity

BYLINE: By TARIK EL-BASHIR

 BODY:
Sun and sand are not all that professional beach volleyball is in search of these days. A year after the sport made a successful debut at the Olympics, it continues to search for an identity.
This weekend, Central Park is the host of the Bud Light Pro Beach Volleyball League tour, which features many of the sport's top athletes. The Association of Volleyball Professionals, pro beach volleyball's premier tour, is in Chicago. At the same time, the Women's Professional Volleyball Association, a pro tour featuring Deb Richardson and Linda Chisolm, two of the most accomplished players in the world, is in Atlantic City. 
 The fractured state of the sport is one reason beach volleyball has not been able to take full advantage of the attention it received at the Olympics last year, when the American men took gold and silver medals, said Craig Elledge, the president of C.E. Sports, the company responsible for operating the Bud Light tour.
Beach volleyball does, however, seem to be gaining in attendance and in television exposure. This weekend's event at Central Park's band shell had a few hundred spectators yesterday for round-robin play, in which Gabrielle Reece led the women's two-time defending champion Team Nike to a 3-0 record; it is expected to draw a bigger crowd for today's semifinals and finals and will be shown on ESPN next month. The event in Chicago was broadcast on NBC yesterday.
"I think beach volleyball truly has a huge appeal -- just look at how much attention it got at the Olympics last year," Elledge said. "But the fans here in the U.S. are so sophisticated. For us to capture their attention, I think there will have to be some changes. It needs to be one sport, not the A.V.P., the W.P.V.A., the A.B.V.L. and F.I.V.P. It's alphabet soup."
In addition to the different tours, each with its own rules, there are different formats -- doubles, which allows for two players on each side, and fours, which has four players per team. The Olympics include only doubles, while this weekend's event in Central Park is fours. The A.V.P., which visited Central Park last year, plays doubles.
"I don't think that beach volleyball has gotten as big as people thought it would have, not after the Olympics," said Reece, the most recognizable face in pro beach volleyball and captain of Team Nike. "It's so divided. It's hard because it has stars in doubles and in fours and stars on different tours right now. Right now, I think the attitude of the fans is, if I catch it, then I catch it. If I don't, then I don't."
But the division within the sport seems to be only one of many problems afflicting beach volleyball. Lack of sponsors and a relative lack of televised events, though more events have been shown in recent years, affect the economic stability of the sport. For example, Bob Ctvrtlik, the captain of the 1996 Olympic volleyball team, is also the captain of the Team American Beach Volleyball League, the best men's team on the Bud Light tour. But the team, which was 2-0 in the round robin yesterday, has no sponsor.
The first change may be to begin charging for seats at events. The event in Central Park is free, as are many other beach volleyball events.
One change that has already been announced is a world championship of beach volleyball, to be played in Los Angeles in September. The best players from around the world, regardless of the tour they play on, will compete.
"The Olympics were good for beach volleyball, but I don't kid anyone that we're pushing back basketball, football or baseball," Ctvrtlik said. "If you want to grow a sport, you have to be on TV and people have to like it."
Besides the free entertainment that beach volleyball tours provide, they also help Olympic hopefuls hone their skills, Ctvrtlik said.
"The Olympics are a showcase," Ctvrtlik said. "A lot of the guys here are going to be trying to play in the Olympics in 2000. You have got to give guys that ultimate goal."

HEADLINE: Newfangled 'Grouping' in Schools Looks Like Oldfangled 'Tracking'

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y., June 20

 BODY:
Since the 1970's, grouping students by intellectual ability, or tracking, has been taboo in the schools of the New York City region, the victim of concerns about racial pigeonholing and fears that the pride of students would be wounded by labeling.
Ask school administrators whether they sort children into bright, average and slow classes, and they will flatly say no. 
 But in Trinity Elementary School here, as in many schools in the region, classes in the same grade are working on distinctly different levels. Ruth Katz's fifth-grade "Kaleidoscope" mathematics class, for example, is trying to figure out 95 percent of 10, a problem students do not usually encounter until sixth grade.
"Think, think, think, folks!" Mrs. Katz prodded them. "If you get a 95 percent score on a test, is that getting most of the answers correct or incorrect?"
By contrast, just across the hall, Penny Constantine's mainstream class is working with the less elusive concepts of subtracting fractions.
Tracking, in short, endures, though in more variable forms than a generation ago, when critics began questioning the racially discriminatory effect of the I.Q. tests used to assign children to tracks. Most school districts do some sorting of children by ability as early as elementary school, then start more traditional tracking by junior high school with full-time honors classes. By high school, students can pick their own tracks by choosing honors or advanced placement classes instead of standard courses.
"The word tracking has become such an evil, nasty thing that the typical response is we don't do that," said Jeannie Oakes, a professor of education at the University of California at Los Angeles, who wrote an influential 1985 book, "Keeping Track." "But when you probe how students are grouped for instruction and what kinds of programs some students have available to them and others do not, you find the phenomenon of dividing students according to judgments about their academic potential alive and well."
A variety of grouping methods supplement the regular curriculum -- pullout enrichment programs, half-day programs, two-day-a-week programs and ability groups within a class.
In establishing such programs, most school districts seem to have learned to avoid the political pitfalls of rigid tracking, which has often been attacked for consigning black and Hispanic students more often than whites to the bottom tiers. They use criteria beyond I.Q. tests and reading scores, like recommendations from teachers, to achieve racial diversity, a success confirmed by visits to half a dozen suburban schools.
And yet, supplementary enrichment programs have their critics. Too often, they say, the programs deal with marginal studies outside the standard curriculum. In Tarrytown, one gifted sixth grader worked for a year on a history of the Brooklyn Bridge and another year on a history of hats. In the once-a-week gifted program in Oceanside, N.Y., students pretended they were town planners and drafted budgets geared to what they saw as the town's priorities. Critics ask, how do such programs improve basic math and reading skills?
"People are starting to ask embarrassing questions, like 'Do they work?' " said Dr. James H. Borland, associate professor of education at Teachers College at Columbia University. "There's no evidence that they do or don't work. People know these kids need more, but nobody's sure what."
 
Practice of Grouping Started Long Ago
The issue of tracking has been unsettling public schools since the turn of the century. America's industrial economy needed trained accountants, engineers and secretaries and, in New York, the swarms of immigrants from other countries and migrants from the South needed to be educated. The school system responded by adapting the curriculum into academic, commercial and vocational streams, and the I.Q. tests developed for assigning World War I recruits was a handy sorting tool.
Tracking softened during periods of national well-being, but the orbiting of Sputnik in 1957 started a debate on how well schools were preparing American youngsters to compete with the Soviets. Tracking again was in fashion.
By the 1970's, as the nation awoke to its shabby treatment of minorities, it began questioning the use of I.Q. tests and tracks. "Tracking tends to divide by race and economic class, and that in itself is a potentially significant problem for us as a society," said Dr. Francis Murphy, the Superintendent of Schools in Scarsdale.
To a degree, tracking has been replaced by special programs for children identified as gifted.
Most educators now say they avoid tracking because it labels students as "dummies" at an early age, diminishes their aspirations and strips classes of the bright children that might inspire or help them.
At the same time, educators recognize that there are students who are unusually thirsty for information and exotic ideas or may have a passion for scientific experimentation or mathematical enigmas. Such students will feel stymied in classrooms aimed at a bland middle.
"If we going to compete in the world, we have to develop our best and brightest," said Dr. Elliot Garfinkel, the Superintendent of Schools in Oceanside.
A common response has been pullout enrichment programs. In Baldwin, N.Y., 100 students identified as gifted are pulled out of regular classes for two days every week and bused to a school building where they study subjects like architecture and archeology. Such programs keep bright and average children together for much of the day, but the drawback, some critics say, is that they must make up the work they missed while being enriched.
Some school systems use more traditional forms of grouping. The South Orange-Maplewood district in New Jersey, a district of 5,800 students with roughy equal numbers of white, black and Hispanic children, starts separating students in the sixth grade. A student can be in a top mathematics class, a medium English class and a standard social studies class. But some residents say a large number of the students who have recently moved from neighboring districts like Newark and East Orange end up in the lower tiers.
"We do get complaints that the top track is heavy with white kids," Jim Memoli, the district's curriculum coordinator, said.
 
Teaching Groups One at a Time
People who grew up in the 1960's, when a grade would be strictly stratified from, say, Class 6-1 to 6-6 but the teacher taught the whole class at once, would not recognize Alice Galanka's fifth-grade class.
In Tarrytown's Washington Irving School, Ms. Galanka, a tall, broad-shouldered, masterful teacher in just her second year of teaching, divides her class into four different groups for some subjects.
For math the other day, her most advanced math students were poised in front of a computer monitor clicking their mouse on a new game that teaches them how to graph coordinates in three dimensions.
While they worked on their own, Ms. Galanka reviewed a more basic skill with her bottom group -- adding fractions that have different denominators.
Meanwhile, the second-strongest math contingent was working with a student teacher on solving math problems by using sketches to plot their computations. A sample went like this: "A sleepy koala bear wants to climb to the top of a tree that is 10 meters tall. Each day he climbs up five meters, but at night while asleep, he slides back four meters. At this rate, how many days will it take the bear to reach the top?"
And the fourth group toiled by itself over a worksheet that coached them for a coming statewide test.
What distinguishes this class from tracking is its fluidity, Ms. Galanka said. Students can move up by mastering a given concept. And because students are together for much of the day, Ms. Galanka argued, bottom-rung students may improve because of exposure to the top achievers.
"A boy like that who is bright finds out in class that it's cool to be smart," she said of one bottom-rung student. "That wouldn't happen in a homogenous class."
On the other hand, she said, some of the children in the lower groups have talents, like a flair for dramatics, that can "inspire kids getting 100s in math to loosen up and explore their talents."
Critics would argue that such grouping requires Ms. Galanka to prepare four lesson plans nightly. They also point out that she must leave some groups untended while she focuses on one.
Often the brightest students get the least of Ms. Galanka's attention. Yet, Tarrytown officials, like her principal, Sal Tricamo, argue that research shows that gifted students do not suffer in mixed classes. "The truth is those more able kids don't need as much," Mr. Tricamo said.
In Tarrytown, such in-class grouping serves to maintain diverse classes in a district that includes the children of Tarrytown's wealthy and professional families as well as the children of Latin American immigrants moving into the apartments once occupied by General Motors plant workers. In fact, 47 percent of the district's students are Hispanic, 40 percent are white and 10 percent are black.
"If you're constantly told you're no good in baseball, what would you do?" Dr. Donald R. Kusel, Tarrytown's Superintendent, said. "You'd drop out. You can't do that with learning. So you become a behavior problem. We have consigned kids to failure, especially immigrant kids and kids of color."
Yet, for its 75 very brightest students, Tarrytown has what it calls a Challenge program, in which gifted students in the fourth, fifth and sixth grades are pulled out for 45 minutes every other day to work on offbeat projects. Nina Fixell, a sixth grader, used the Internet to find a way to cut glass with a pair of household scissors. She cut it under water, which weakened the glass's molecular bonds.
Nina said she would prefer being among the Challenge students for the entire day, but does not mind the present system because she gets to help other children.
Ultimately, educators admit they are still struggling to find the right balance.
"I don't think anybody can say when you're dealing with human beings what absolutely works," Mr. Kusel said.

HEADLINE: Unlikely Allies in Fight for Hemp

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: MODENA, N.Y., June 20

 BODY:
Fred A. Maslack made the long drive down from southern Vermont in the oldest car with Vermont legislative plates, his rusting 1982 Dodge Diplomat.
Mr. Maslack, 38, a conservative Republican State Representative, had come to this village, 70 miles north of New York City, to give the keynote address at a three-day event that was expected to attract 4,000 people. 
 "It's about a classic Republican issue," said Mr. Maslack, who is also a slate quarrier from East Poultney, Vt. "It's all about getting government out of the way so people can go out and make money."
But nothing around him at the Lembo Lake campground appeared remotely Republican. A rainbow-haired band called the Cheezbutts thrashed through a pounding rock tune. Hemp burgers sizzled on a griddle. A vendor in a tie-dyed T-shirt hawked skull-shaped hashish pipes. And the breeze held the distinct, pungent tang of marijuana smoke.
The issue that the Vermont legislator shared with the crowd around him was legalization of the cultivation of hemp, a low-potency variety of Cannabis sativa, the ancient multipurpose weed that during World War II supplied Allied troops with cord and rope and during the 1960's supplied hippies with altered states of mind.
Mr. Maslack's goal was to pass laws in Vermont that permit the licensing of farmers who seek to grow industrial varieties of hemp that contain no significant concentration of THC, the chemical that causes a high among marijuana smokers. "Our farmers need all the help they can get," he said.
The goal of Robert Robinson, the manager of the annual three-day festival billed as "Hemp Splash," was to promote the legal use of marijuana to get high.
"The last census said that 60 million Americans smoke," Mr. Robinson said. "For proof positive, just look around."
Mr. Maslack is part of an informal network of legislators from nearly a dozen states where farming of industrial hemp has been promoted as a way to improve agriculture and create textile and other jobs. "It fits Vermont's niche," Mr. Maslack said, explaining that hemp is easily cultivated even on rugged slopes. He held up a tuft of fibers next to a bale of raw hemp stalks and told how the material could be turned into linenlike cloth. The plant's high-protein seeds, he added, could be made into everything from soap to the burgers being served nearby.
At the festival, Mr. Maslack set up camp near the booth of the Vermont Hemporium, a company selling hemp necklaces, backpacks, and other gear -- all made from imported fibers instead of home-grown material.
Joseph Shimek, the company's owner, said he smokes marijuana, but was mainly concerned with getting a cheap, local source of the raw material for his goods. "This is about trying to make a stable business," he said. "Fred's an angel to us."
He helped Mr. Maslack promote legislation last year that allowed Vermont to study the crop's economic potential. The state's Democratic Governor, Howard Dean, had opposed an earlier version of the law that would have licensed hemp growers.
Mr. Maslack said he had taken on the hemp issue not only because the crop could spur Vermont's agricultural economy, but also because he resented how the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration had increasingly lobbied states to prevent any shift toward legalizing cannabis in any form.
Nancy J. Sheltra, a Republican colleague of Mr. Maslack's from Derby, Vt., said in a phone telephone interview that it surprised her to think of Mr. Maslack speaking to several thousand people at a rock concert. "Except for this one issue, he has been very conservative in the Republican Party here," said Ms. Sheltra, who opposed the hemp licensing legislation.
But Mr. Maslack said he had no qualms about speaking at such a gathering. He said what people do in private is their concern, adding that he was determined to exploit the economic value of hemp as a source of fiber and food.
As Mr. Maslack explained his dream of waving fields of fibrous hemp, those around him in the in the sprawling apple orchard that doubled as a campground remained more focused on marijuana's other uses. Behind a drape of hemp cloth, a man offered passers-by a chance to "vaporize."
"It's the safest way to inhale," he said, explaining that the marijuana releases its potent vapors when it is heated to just below the temperature at which it burns.
As dusk settled over the orchard, the crickets and cicadas were joined by a chorus of clicking lighters.

TOBACCO SETTLEMENT
A $360 Billion Answer
Tobacco companies agreed to a $360 billion product liability settlement with state attorneys general and public health representatives. The agreement is subject to approval in Congress, where a tough fight is expected. President Clinton, whose backing is regarded as crucial, said he would review the pact. Under the deal, smokers would see dire new warnings on cigarette packs, get free medical help to kick the habit and be inundated with nationwide anti-smoking advertising. Tobacco ads would be strictly curbed. In return, tobacco companies and investors would get relief from the uncertainty posed by hundreds of pending lawsuits. The $360 billion would be paid out over 25 years. Tobacco stock prices, up during the week, fell after the deal was announced.
 
THE GLOWING ECONOMY
Washington and Wall St. Cheer
Economic statistics were so favorable last week that stocks continued their winning ways -- and Washington cheered. In Denver, President Clinton, preparing to open the annual summit meeting of the major industrial nations, boasted, "We host our partners at a time when America's economy is the healthiest in a generation and the strongest in the world." Indeed, if inflation has not been vanquished, it at least appears comatose. The Consumer Price Index rose a barely noticeable one-tenth of 1 percent in May; so far this year it is running at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent. Industrial production rose a strong four-tenths of a percentage point in May, and capacity utilization rose to 83.7 percent. The nation's foreign trade deficit increased 7.8 percent in April, to $8.4 billion, from a revised $7.8 billion in March -- but even that was not as bad as expected, thanks to surging export growth. 

SURGING STOCKS
The Records Keep Falling
Stocks, having set records the previous week, toppled them last week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.47 to 7,796.51. In the last 10 weeks, the Dow has surged more than 22 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.43 to 898.70, and the Nasdaq composite index, laden with computer companies, rose 27.04 to 1,447.10. Airline stocks, including AMR, parent of American, and UAL, parent of United, rose after members of the Senate Finance Committee agreed to drop a proposed tax on international airline tickets. Among other strong issues were I.B.M. and Boeing, which won a $1 billion order for jetliners from British Airways. Stocks of financial companies, like Travelers and J. P. Morgan, benefited from a drop in interest rates. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell to 6.66 percent from 6.72 percent a week earlier.
 
STORE CLOSINGS
Farewell to a Barneys
Barney's Inc., the stylish specialty chain now in bankruptcy, said it would close its original, 74-year-old store at Seventh Avenue and 17th Street, as well as stores in Houston, Dallas and Troy, Mich. The Texas Pacific Group, an investment group led by David Bonderman, expressed interest in bidding for Barney's in bankruptcy court, as have Saks Holdings and Dickson Concepts (International), which is based in Hong Kong and owns the Harvey Nichols store in London. In another blow to New York retailing, the Doubleday Book Shop on Fifth Avenue said it would shut by the end of the month, a victim of high rents. It will be the seventh bookstore to close on the avenue since the early 1980's, leaving the avenue's more cerebral shoppers with only Barnes & Noble at 49th Street.
 
POSSIBLE MERGERS
Early Opposition to AT&T
Seeking to scuttle the largest corporate merger in history even before it is formally proposed, Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, declared that merging AT&T with a regional Bell telephone company would be "unthinkable." AT&T responded tartly that the F.C.C. should judge a merger "when and if it is made." Although there has been no official confirmation of the talks, executives have said that AT&T, the largest long-distance company, has been discussing a $50 billion merger with SBC Communications, the largest of the regional Bell telephone companies, for several months. The F.C.C. has traditionally deferred to the Justice Department on antitrust matters, but now Mr. Hundt is seizing the initiative.
 
THE MIGHTY MARK
Germans Invest in Times Square
What could be more American than Times Square? Never mind. One Times Square, the skinny tower that has been home to the New Year's Eve ball drop for nearly a century, is being sold to German investors for nearly four times the $27.5 million paid for it by Lehman Brothers a little more than two years ago. Lehman has signed a contract to sell the property to the Jamestown group, a German investment firm, for about $110 million, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The building is vacant and is likely to remain mostly empty, serving basically as a gigantic billboard, although a theme restaurant may be added in its base. So, guten Appetit!
 
EUROPEAN UNION
Is the Euro Back on Track?
Turning back a French challenge, leaders of the European Union agreed to a stability pact that preserves tight government spending as the alliance's top priority and renewed its determination to create a common currency, the euro. Britain and Germany made clear that government spending was not an acceptable way to create new jobs for Europe's 18 million jobless people.

STEAMED
Federal Express vs. Federal Espresso
If a corporation is legally a person, what sort of person is it? In the case of Federal Express, let's say street fighter. Bully would sound rude. The Associated Press reported that the global company has sued Federal Espresso, a grocery store coffee cart in Beaverton, Ore., operated by 23-year-old Greg Judish, accusing him of violating its trademark. Mr. Judish said he saw nothing wrong with his name or winged coffee-cup logo, but would ask a lawyer friend to help him write a reply. On a good day he serves 100 cups of coffee, along with tea, biscotti and other snacks.
 
THE CAT'S MEOW
And the Backers Purr
"Cats" overtook "A Chorus Line" as the longest-running show in Broadway history, playing its 6,138th performance on Thursday. The musical, which opened at the Winter Garden theater on Oct. 7, 1982, has been seen by more than 50 million people worldwide. A financial juggernaut, with ticket sales totaling $329 million in New York alone, it was the first in a wave of megamusicals that reshaped Broadway in the 1980's, redirecting the Broadway market toward blockbuster hits and foreign tourism. It also made Andrew Lloyd Webber, the musical's composer, a global brand name. But not all has gone well lately for Sir Andrew. His production company has laid off two-thirds of its employees since losing $20 million on "Sunset Boulevard."

HEADLINE: More Research, More Profits, More Conflict

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

 BODY:
NEVER before have women meant so much to so many. Recognized as the health care system's biggest customers, they are being treated as such: researched and marketed to, tracked and talked about.
Consider: Premarin, an estrogen replacement, is the most widely used prescription drug in the United States. From 1991 to 1992, the number of hospitals with a women's health center rose 19 percent, according to a survey by the American Hospital Association. In many cities, Atlanta and Dallas among them, hospitals are competing for pregnant Medicaid patients; among the lures are free Disney movies for the older children, infant car seats, baby showers, insulated beverage flasks and monogrammed blankets. 
 Even the women who coalesced 30 years ago into something loosely called the women's health movement are struck by the mix of responsive medicine and commercial grasping that the 1990's have delivered. It is both more and less than these mothers of intervention bargained for.
"As a lasting legacy of the women's movement, health care is one of our shining moments," said Dr. Susan Reverby, a professor of women's studies at Wellesley College, who recently served on an obstetrics and gynecology advisory panel for the Federal Food and Drug Administration.
While acknowledging that "the health care system is relentless in its ability to figure out where the next buck is coming from," Ms. Reverby said the medical profession had become more aware of women's concerns, especially those beyond the gynecologic. "There's much more consciousness about what women's issues are," she said. "We can now talk about heart disease and about AIDS."
But not all women applaud the results of that new consciousness.
Rachel Fruchter, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn, said she was appalled that women were pursued so avidly as consumers, particularly by pharmaceutical companies whose advertisements picture radiant middle-aged women and counsel, "Ask your doctor."
"The pretense that that's what the women's health movement wanted is a bad joke," Ms. Fruchter said.
In the beginning, the women's health movement talked mostly about abortion and contraceptives. But as its baby boomer leaders have reached the age of influence -- and the age of menopause -- the health concerns of older generations have taken on new urgency. That urgency is also fueled by the fact that women are living longer -- on average, more than seven years longer than men -- and are thus suffering from the crippling diseases of old age, like arthritis and osteoporosis.
At the same time, women have not just been complaining about doctors but have been becoming doctors. The influx has made female patients happier and helped bring new emphasis to the doctor's role as interviewer, said Dr. Charlea Massion, a family doctor at the Santa Cruz Medical Center in California and a clinical faculty member at Stanford University.
"Women physicians do have, and linguistic studies show this, a different way of communicating," Dr. Massion said, adding: "I don't think women physicians are necessarily interested in women's health just by being women, and I don't think women physicians are more open-minded or have a more comprehensive approach just because they are women. But most of the innovative thinking that's being done in health care is being done by women."
That does not mean that women believe they are being well served.
Like many of the other early participants in the women's health movement. Ms. Fruchter views the issue as a matter of social justice. She noted that many women cannot afford the health care that is being urged upon them.
She said that she addressed Brooklyn community groups and churches on cancer screening but that many of the women she saw could not pay for it: they are the working poor, not insured by employers and not old enough to qualify for Medicare. And they have an array of health problems.
"They say breast cancer is important," Ms. Fruchter said, "but there are other things. What about their blood pressure, their diabetes, their disabled child?"
Much of the attention to women is undeniably genuine, even if it feeds advertising campaigns. Federal funds for breast cancer exceeded $600 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $90 billion in 1990. The National Institutes of Health, the source and overseer of money for most of the nation's biomedical research, established an Office of Research on Women's Health in 1990 and has undertaken two huge studies of heart disease and cancer among women.
A half-dozen new medical journals on women's health have sprung up in the same period. But even these cannot contain the academic attention: while a survey of Medline, a data base of medical journal articles, turned up 159 entries under the heading "women's health" from 1986 through 1991, it found 1,426 entries from 1992 through 1996.
Still, women's health remains a fractious business. Even some of the most commonplace decisions women make -- yearly mammograms for 40-somethings? hormones for 50-somethings? -- are subject to wild disagreement.
Many women say that focusing on disease and treatment misses the point. "It's easier to prescribe a pill than to address the precarious economic status of women," said Dr. Judith G. Gonyea, a professor of social work at Boston University who specializes in women and aging. "People's health is about their housing, their nutrition, about feeling socially connected, which all may have a much greater bearing on their physical health status than their level of estrogen does."
In research, especially, the line between science and politics has been tested in the debate over whether women have been shortchanged.
"There's a perception that women and their diseases have been studied less than men," said Dr. Curtis L. Meinert, an epidemiology professor at the Johns Hopkins University who specializes in clinical trials. "That's so totally dead wrong it's painful."
When they surveyed research published from 1980 to 1993, Dr. Meinert and two colleagues, both of them women, found that the number of projects studying just men and the number studying just women were virtually equal.
In public research dollars spent, it does not seem that women have been slighted. In 1996, the last year for which figures are available, 16 percent of National Institutes of Health funds went to study diseases exclusive to women, 5.7 percent to diseases exclusive to men and 78.3 percent to diseases afflicting both. A decade ago, when the first breakdown by sex was calculated, the figures were 13.5 percent, 6.5 percent and 80 percent. And on a per-fatality basis, the National Cancer Institute spends much more on cancers that afflict only women than it does on prostate cancer.
Some researchers say age is more important than sex in determining where the money goes. Compare, for example, the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on breast cancer, which strikes many women in the prime of life, with the much smaller sum spent on prostate cancer, a disease of elderly men.
But Dr. Vivian Pinn, the director of the N.I.H. Office of Research on Women's Health, said: "Budget figures can fool you. You have to figure out where you have gaps in knowledge, and we know there are great gaps of knowledge in women's health."
The sharpest contention centers on introducing a form of affirmative action in clinical trials of new drugs and treatments for both men and women. Though the N.I.H. prodded researchers to include women in more clinical trials in the 1980's, the General Accounting Office reported in 1990 that the policy was often ignored. Then in 1993, Congress mandated the inclusion of women in most trials in numbers sufficient to analyze sex differences in the way a disease and its treatment play themselves out.
Many researchers resented the intrusion -- the phrases "research by quota" and "politically correct trials" were invoked -- and argued that in many trials, including enough women to yield reliable comparisons would be prohibitively expensive.
Cardiovascular disease raises especially perplexing questions. Because its incidence during middle age is so much higher in men, any clinical trial requires many more female than male subjects to assess risk factors and treatments for women -- and more still to analyze the differences between men and women.
That is why, researchers say, they have focused on men. But when women reach their 70's, their risk of cardiovascular disease rises sharply. Yet a lack of data makes it unclear whether they respond to preventive measures and treatments in the same way that men do.
Some epidemiologists, like Dr. Meinert, maintain that in terms of most diseases and treatments, women do not differ significantly from men, so including women in most clinical trials is unlikely to produce useful information. Others respond that this issue is, at the least, woefully underinvestigated.
Some women contend that sex differences are important and complicated enough to warrant a new specialty -- women's medicine -- analogous to pediatrics or geriatrics. "We're not talking about lady doctors delivering medical care to lady patients," said Dr. Eileen Hoffman, a co-director of the women's health program at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. "We're talking about an art and science that's focused on the female."
"Female," in Dr. Hoffman's view, is a distinction that applies at every physiological level, down to the cellular, and should not be the province of obstetrics and gynecology alone. Besides, she added, "medicine only takes something seriously when it occupies an official space in the academic hierarchy."
Dr. Hoffman and other doctors and researchers have formed the American College of Women's Health Physicians, which is working toward recognition as a new specialty. But not without opposition. Many women argue that anything labeled "women's medicine" is unnecessary and, worse, bound to be marginalized.
"My response," Dr. Hoffman said, "is that women's health has already been marginalized by ob-gyn. Many women in this country only see a gynecologist for care. But lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women, and heart disease kills 10 times more women than breast cancer."
To some, the notion that women have been underserved by American medicine is amazing. In a 1995 article in The Atlantic Monthly, Dr. Andrew G. Kadar, an anesthesiologist on the clinical faculty of the University of California at Los Angeles, wrote that if either sex needs better health care, it is the men.
"There is no question that women seek out medical attention more," Dr. Kadar said in an interview. "Whether they are less healthy is another issue and much more difficult to sort out, especially since there are diseases that keep you from feeling your best but don't shorten your life expectancy."
A better measure of health, he said, is mortality rates, reflected in the 7.5-year gap between men's and women's life spans. "You can't get any sicker than dead," he said.
But the trends in women's health care are likely to be determined more by market imperatives than by medicine or politics. "We made people aware of how health care works," Ms. Reverby said. "We couldn't control the economics of it." Neither, to their dismay, could doctors.
The march of managed care, most public health experts say, is good news and bad news for women.
"Women want respect; they want choices; they want preventive care," said Sally Rynne, a health care consultant in Evanston, Ill. "That's what women have clamored for." And the intent today, Ms. Rynne said, is to get people to take care of themselves because it is cost-effective.
"The other side of that," she said, "is, Are women going to be denied certain procedures or treatments that they feel they really need? That's the dance we're in right now."
Managed care also means that patients spend less time with doctors, though surveys consistently show that women prize such time. Health care providers have tried to address the problem by offering women's centers, which join specialists under one roof and use nurses and physicians' assistants to help coordinate medical care.
"Right now, it's a big marketing attempt," Dr. Hoffman said. "Let's be clear about that."
But the centers are hugely popular. "Women love them," said Dr. Carol Weisman, a professor and health services researcher in the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health who has surveyed women's health centers nationwide.
Whether the clinics provide better care, Dr. Weisman said, is a separate question, and an all-but-unexamined one. It is not clear that any attempts to make medicine more responsive to women have brought measurable results. Regarding of whether the big push in research will lead to big advances in treatment, no answers are expected in this century.
Plenty of people are working on it, though. So far this year, Medline lists more than 80 articles under "women's health." There is no heading for "men's health."

HEADLINE: Patients View H.M.O.'s With Hope and Suspicion

BYLINE: By WENDY MARSTON; Wendy Marston is a contributing editor at Health magazine.

 BODY:
WHICH is your picture of managed care for women: free annual mammograms or "drive through" mastectomies?
Managed care is inevitable, a juggernaut that is quickly becoming the norm for how Americans get their health care -- 70 percent of people employed by companies with more than 200 workers use managed care. 
 How are women faring in this confusing new world? In interviews, doctors and experts in health economics discussed managed care with a mixture of optimism and suspicion.
The good news is that managed care in theory lends itself to preventive measures that are especially important to women, who on average visit a doctor 25 percent more often than men. The bad news is that the cost-cutting pressures behind the system's expansion have also led to the types of limits on hospital stays that produced Federal legislation on drive-through deliveries (enacted) and mastectomies (pending).
For the most part, they agree that the situation will improve to keep customers satisfied.
Recent studies have found that screening measures like Pap smears and mammograms and other tests are offered more consistently by health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, than by doctors seeing women in traditional fee-for-service settings.
But some observers are skeptical about how deep the managed care commitment to preventive care, especially in its more costly forms, really runs. "Yes, managed care does a little better on preventive health and contraception, but it needs to be more than just unlimited access to an ob-gyn," said Dr. Eileen Hoffman, the associate director for education at the Mount Sinai Women's Health Program in New York.
Dr. Hoffman is more excited about the prospect of what an H.M.O. can offer, and learn from, customers, a group that a plan can treat as an instant medical data base, showing what works and what does not.
She explained: "If we can use managed care to look at women as a defined population, like we look at people with diabetes, for example, then we can work backwards figuring out the best way to deliver appropriate care that's cost-effective."
Her optimism is echoed by Ewe Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton University. "Women are probably better off in managed care since the positives of having protocols outweigh the negatives they encounter," he said.
Professor Reinhardt added that the horror stories about H.M.O.'s, like tests or treatments being refused because an H.M.O. executive -- not the doctor -- thought they were too expensive, are problems that will be ironed out eventually. "At the moment, it's kind of the O.K. Corral, a real shoot-out," he said. "It's very fresh and raw and new to patients, and there are some H.M.O.'s that just shouldn't be there at all."
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, the director of the Public Citizens Health Research Group in Washington, has a bleaker perspective. "The current dominant model, of for-profit H.M.O.'s, is destroying the doctor-patient relationship," Dr. Wolfe said. He added, "Doctors in H.M.O.'s earn more money by not doing a test and not sending a patient to the hospital."
On the flip side, Margaret O'Kane, the president of the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which accredits H.M.O.'s, points out that managed care providers are better able to rein in overtreatments like high rates of hysterectomies and Caesarean sections, which women's health advocates have long complained about.
But Dr. Wolfe's criticisms are all the more pointed since surveys show that women, more than men, tend to have difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship.
The worries about managed care are leading to proposals for broad new regulations, including a bipartisan Senate bill to require coverage of contraceptives. The General Assembly in Connecticut recently passed a bill creating a state appeals process for decisions to deny care, and many other states, including New York, are pushing for similar legislation.
Meanwhile, patients might have to redefine the role they play in their care, said Sue Berkman, the author of "Surviving Your H.M.O.," to be published by Villard in the fall.
Ms. Berkman said she doesn't believe that today's doctor-patient relationship works as a partnership. "I'll tell you, when the plumber comes to fix the sink, I may hand him a wrench, but he isn't my partner," she said. "It's the same with my doctor. I want the best care, and that means I need to know what the system is so that I know how to operate within it."
And that new system may call for a more aggressive attitude, especially among women, she said.
In this new world of H.M.O.'s, she suggested that everything be written down. "So you may be sitting there practically naked on the examining table," she said, "but no one says you can't have a pad of paper and a pen."

HEADLINE: Is There a Doctor in the House? Whatever Kind You Need

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
SURE, there are magazines in the waiting room of the Columbia-Presbyterian Center for Women's Health: Metropolitan Home, Vanity Fair and the like. But the patients would rather yak -- strangers turned friends as they exchange remedies for hot flashes, brittle bones, depression or obesity in what is fast becoming the medical version of the kaffeeklatsch, Tupperware party or consciousness-raising group of old.
It is a typical day at the three-year-old center in an Upper East Side high-rise, a stone's throw from Bloomingdale's. A woman in her late 40's is here to see the obesity specialist and nutritionist to find out whether she is a candidate for the hot new appetite suppressants, although she has a heart condition. A woman in her 50's is here to see the cardiologist, osteoporosis expert and endocrinologist as she considers the pros and cons of hormone-replacement therapy. And a woman near 70, who has broken more bones than Humpty Dumpty, is here for the results of her latest bone-density test and to celebrate the startling regeneration she has experienced with a new drug. 
 "If you go to one doctor uptown and one doctor downtown, nobody knows what anybody else is prescribing," said Jacqueline Simenauer, an author and literary agent from Upper Montclair, N.J., and a patient in the waiting room. "They're too busy to call each other. Or they don't know each other. Here, they all confer. It's a medical mall."
One-stop shopping is the catch phrase for centers like Columbia-Presbyterian's, which are popping up throughout the metropolitan region and in other major urban markets, inspired by the demographics of the baby boomers, the surging interest in women's health and the fierce competition among hospitals for new customers in a restructured health-care economy.
Women's health centers, in one form or another, have existed for nearly 200 years. In the 1800's, there were maternity hospitals; in the early 1900's, family planning clinics. The legalization of abortion in 1973 was the catalyst for the modern women's health movement, which spawned birth control, abortion and birthing centers.
Then, in the 1980's, came breast centers, inspired by an increase in diagnosed cases of breast cancer -- including those of prominent women who went public with their disease -- and the political forcefulness of patients who imitated those active in the fight against AIDS. The restructuring of the health-care industry in the 1990's led to off-site clinical and educational programs aimed at lucrative markets.
All these trends intersect in the gracious quarters of Columbia-Presbyterian's women's health center, on 60th Street near Madison Avenue in New York, where fresh orchids and peonies grace the waiting room and botanical prints and Impressionist reproductions adorn the walls.
The clients here, about 4,000 in all, fit a narrow, privileged profile similar to that of the doctors: predominantly middle-aged and upper-middle-class women, employed and insured, white and well educated. As they meet and mingle in the waiting room, this could be a Radcliffe reunion or a week at Canyon Ranch.
The center's director, Dr. Elsa Giardina, a professor and cardiologist, hopes to open a center at the hospital's campus in Washington Heights for poor women, most of them black and Hispanic. But she knows why the concept will catch on more easily here.
"You have to have a motivated population," Dr. Giardina said. "It's hard to talk about estrogen to somebody who's never heard of estrogen and is struggling to put rice and beans on the table."
The patients on East 60th Street, in a building that is also the headquarters for the Ralph Lauren empire, came of age reading the feminist health-care bible "Our Bodies, Ourselves" and demanding information, not a pat on the head by a condescending male doctor. When these women were in their 20's and 30's, their primary-care doctor was generally a gynecologist, but their needs have changed as they have moved into middle age and beyond.
There is the hormonal turbulence that precedes actual menopause. There is the conflicting advice about estrogen replacement and the terror of breast cancer that dissuades women from treatment for afflictions more likely to kill them, like heart disease and bone loss. There are the diseases that come with menopause or disproportionately afflict women, among them osteoporosis, Alzheimer's, depression, lupus and irritable bowel syndrome.
There are new findings about how women differ from men in their manifestations of heart disease and responses to treatments. There is the knowledge that women live longer than men and need to work toward a healthier dotage. And there are the stresses that collapse upon midlife women: careers, children, aging parents, empty nests.
The Columbia center and others like it put under one roof specialists who coordinate their expertise in these interconnected physical, social and emotional problems. The centers also create an environment more like a spa than a hospital. Proponents of the concept say the team approach and focus on prevention and behavioral changes is a model that will also benefit men. Critics say this is bald marketing to a prosperous population, the gatekeepers of their family's health care, who will not only enrich the hospital with their business but will refer their husbands and children as well.
The doctors and patients on East 60th Street see nothing wrong with doing well by doing good. "This is driven both by good medicine and consumer demand," said Eva Anderson, the center's administrative director and a former investment banker with a specialty in nonprofit health systems.
Dr. Ellen Silverstein, a Columbia radiologist, agreed, noting: "That's what medicine has become -- marketing. But it has to be good medical practice, or it won't work."
An example, Dr. Silverstein said, is the one-stop shopping. Here, a woman can have a checkup and a mammogram in the same visit. If the mammogram is irregular, she can have a sonogram on the spot. "Busy professional women don't have a week," she said. "They want to fit everything in today."
That Filofax mentality is what the center's "A Day in Your Life" program is all about. For $725, women under 40 can have a full battery of tests and procedures in one day. A package for women over 40 is $1,400. Both are advertised in a brochure not unlike the one at the Georgette Klinger salon, which does not embarrass Ms. Anderson in the least. "The Columbia-Presbyterian Day Spa!" she said. "Boutique health care amid the boutiques of Madison Avenue!"
But the bells and whistles -- support groups for midlife women, smoking cessation classes, a quarterly newsletter and tony luncheons with guest speakers -- are add-ons. The mission here is coordinated, comprehensive care delivered mostly by female providers, all of them researchers and clinicians in the growing subspecialty of women's health. They also train residents and sit on a university task force that will revise the medical school curriculum.
So a woman with irritable bowel syndrome has a gastroenterologist as her primary doctor, but will also see a psychologist and a nutritionist. If she has a family history of heart disease, a cardiologist will be part of the team. If she is slightly built and postmenopausal, a bone-density expert will assist. If she is considering hormone replacement, an endocrinologist weighs in.
Missing from the lineup, but to be added, Ms. Anderson said, are a psychopharmacologist, who can monitor the alchemy of antidepressants and hormones, and a neurologist who is an expert in Alzheimer's disease.
No matter which doctor a patient sees, the notes are recorded on a single chart so there is a free flow of information. But that approach is, at times, superfluous because the doctors gather at lunchtime in the conference room for sandwiches and informal consultations. They pop into each other's offices throughout the day to discuss patients. And they pass someone along on the spot if a different expertise is in order.
The patients generally applaud the coordinated approach. But what many say they seek are doctors who will collaborate, not dictate, an attitude they think is more common in women. Lenore Schmidt, a lecturer for Weight Watchers and a regular patient, told a typical tale of being turned off by a male doctor. A sharp chest pain sent her to the same cardiologist who had performed her husband's open-heart surgery. With her husband, he had been respectful and eager to explain. With her, he was barking orders and deflecting questions.
"He was this big and had a Napoleon complex," Ms. Schmidt said, her hand held at shoulder height. Now, she sees a female cardiologist at the center.
Patients also report a difference in the diagnostic tests that female doctors order. For example, among postmenopausal women, bone-density screening is routine. Sonograms are performed in tandem with mammograms for women with particularly dense breast tissue, where early evidence of cancer is often missed. Abdominal ultrasound is recommended for women whose mothers had ovarian cancer, a silent killer. And everyone is urged to undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy, which tests for colon cancer and is commonly ordered for middle-aged men but not women, although they are just as likely to contract the disease.
Dr. Steven Heymsfield, the lone man on the staff and the obesity expert, once had doubts about the concept of serving all of a woman's medical needs under one roof. "When I started working here, I wondered why you needed a women's center," Dr. Heymsfield said. "Why not go to a regular doctor? But the synergy created here is greater than the sum of its parts."

HEADLINE: The Sunny Side Of the Cascades

BYLINE: By JOHN ROSENTHAL; JOHN ROSENTHAL is a travel writer based in New York.

 BODY:
IT never rains in Bend. Any Oregonian will tell you that. The clouds and drizzle that envelop Portland, Salem and Eugene leave a snowy topping on the Cascades, some of the best skiing mountains in the West, then magically evaporate, leaving nothing but glorious blue skies over the eastern two-thirds of the state.
In the many trips my family and I have made to Oregon, I can remember it raining just long enough to remind us that we were in the Pacific Northwest. And once we crossed the Cascade range, which separates the three biggest cities from the rest of the state, we usually found an embarrassment of sunshine. 
 Bend is about a three-hour drive from Portland; the fastest route is over Mount Hood on Route 26, through towns with names like Zigzag and Rhododendron. I had been to Bend more than a half-dozen times as a child on family vacations. When I returned in May last year to show my wife, Lisa, the area where I had spent so many happy summers, the weather was just as I had promised: sunny and 65 degrees, with clouds as scarce as tourists.
Mount Bachelor, which overlooks the area from more than 9,000 feet, had several lifts and runs still open a week before Memorial Day, with temperatures about 32 degrees at the base lodge and fresh snow. I was reminded of the year I skied there in early July. On this trip, though, we chose hiking and fishing along the Deschutes River.
The Deschutes runs north to south along the eastern edge of the Cascades, surrounded on both sides by the towering ponderosa pine trees of the Deschutes National Forest. The river is as placid as bath water in some stretches, but churns like a whirlpool in others, making it a prime route for white-water rafting.
The hiking trail we chose ran right along the river, like an escape route for white-water rafters who stumble into a class of rapids they're not sure they can handle. But as we walked among the volcanic rocks upstream from Lava Island Falls to Benham Falls, just south of Bend, none of the rafters we saw seemed daunted. One group navigated a particularly fearsome stretch of white water, picked up the raft, carried it back up the trail and went through it again, as though it were some kind of giant water slide. Another group -- a guide and several neophyte paddlers -- stopped after each set of rapids to discuss things they did right and wrong and to prepare for the next, more challenging cascades.
Chipmunks and chocolate labrador retrievers shared the trail with us, the former darting in front of us from one side of the narrow dirt path to the other, the latter barreling straight ahead in front of their owners and announcing the presence of an imminent mountain biker or two. Across the river, huge cinnamon-colored wastelands of solidified lava surrounded the area leading to Lava Butte, the 6,000-year-old cinder cone and crater that was the source of much of the volcanic rock in the area.
Steelhead and trout populate the Deschutes and many of the surrounding lakes and rivers, and fly-fishing is the angling method of choice here. We stopped to fish for a few hours at a quiet spot on the trail below Dillon Falls. We didn't catch anything, nor did we see any other anglers, allowing us to conclude that it was our timing, not our technique, that was to blame.
But the serenity was reward enough. In the middle of the river, the reflections of the 50-foot-high auburn lava piles that line one bank met and mingled with those of the rich brown and green 250-foot pine trees that border the other shore.
We returned to the house we had borrowed from a friend in Sunriver, a resort community 15 miles south of Bend where my family used to stay. Part hotel, part weekend-home destination and part planned community, Sunriver was originally a training camp for the Army during World War II, but was developed as a vacation resort in the 1960's. Its uncrowded golf courses, abundant tennis courts, snug stables and manicured lawns surrounding the well-maintained pool initially attracted people for vacations, and many decided to buy weekend homes there. About 1,500 live there year-round.
The accommodations at Sunriver range from hotel rooms in the main lodge to two-bedroom condominiums to five-bedroom houses. The wood-shingled houses and condominiums, gently curving roads and cul-de-sacs and the trim outdoor village mall are neat and hospitable. But what I remembered best about Sunriver from my youth were the 35 miles of paved bike paths that meandered from the houses to the meadows, the stables and the river.
Most parts of Sunriver are easier to reach by bike than by car, so we borrowed our friend's bikes (bike rentals are available in Sunriver and Bend) and headed for the river. The flat, well-maintained macadam path wandered through pine forest and lava fields, over bridges that crossed tiny creeks and through tunnels under roads to a meadow and the river.
As we sat in the meadow, the fish that had ignored our lines earlier in the day came out to feed on the hovering flies, while Canada geese honked furiously as they passed on their way north. When the crescent of sun hanging over Mount Bachelor finally dipped behind the mountain, the temperature plummeted, sending us back to our bikes.
On the third day, it snowed. Like most summer snowfalls, which are not unusual in Bend, this one melted by the time it touched the ground, since it was about 50 degrees. But we decided against the horseback riding we had planned.
INSTEAD, we stopped at the eight-acre Sunriver Nature Center, with its modern wood and glass building, on River Road, out toward the stables. The center is filled with displays and information about the local flora and fauna, including a thick book of blank pages entitled "Rattlesnakes of Sunriver" (one of the naturalists explains that Sunriver's compact rocks and soil make a poor habitat for snakes). While we were there, a volunteer brought in a 3-week-old great horned owl that had been separated from its mother. Jay Bowerman, the center's director emeritus, tried to introduce the orphan to one of the resident female owls, hoping that she would literally take it under her wing. He succeeded in getting the baby owl to eat from his own hand, but could not persuade the adult owl to take over the feeding chores.
Jay did persuade us to visit the High Desert Museum, on Highway 97 between Sunriver and Bend. Built in 1982, the museum is one of the best of its kind in the country. Its indoor exhibits of the region's geological and political history include well-executed dioramas of the Native Americans who lived here and the Europeans who joined and displaced them: fur traders, miners, cowboys and, finally, permanent settlers.
When the sun finally came out, so did the museum's resident river otters, Bert and Ernie, to watch the tourists who streamed down the path to the museum's exceptional outdoor exhibits. In addition to the otter pond, the 20 acres of outdoor attractions include a porcupine habitat, a marsh-bird viewing deck, an exhibit on the changing forest and log cabins, covered wagons and a transplanted saw mill.
We continued into Bend and explored its small but diverse downtown scene. Like many areas of rapid population growth (it now has 30,000 inhabitants, compared with 20,000 in 1990), Bend is plagued by a strip of chain restaurants, hotels and mini-malls along 10 miles of Route 97 (also known as Third Street), the main artery. But it shows vestiges of its small-town roots along Bond and Wall Streets. Big bank buildings anchor several corners, and though many of them are no longer occupied by banks, they have been preserved or restored and contain stores, law offices and other businesses.
Stores are a mix of the old Bend and the new. J. T. Miller's Gentlemen's Traditional Clothing, which now sells more golf wear than Stetsons and dusters, looks across the street to Birkenstock of Bend and several art galleries. Masterson St. Clair Hardware, a frontier-era general store, proclaims itself as the place to buy sporting goods, hardware and guns, while Tri Mountain Sports attracts those in need of rock climbing shoes and carabiners.
The Pine Tavern has been a Bend institution since 1919, famous for the ponderosa pine growing through the main dining room, while Toomie's, a Thai restaurant, and several brew pubs are more recent additions.
It was dark when we headed back to Sunriver, and once we had passed the lights of the strip, thick stands of pines on either side turned the highway into a country-dark corridor. We passed few cars in either direction, and even the deer we had come to expect near the roads seemed to be resting for the sunny day presaged by the stars above us.
 
To play along the river
 
Getting There
Bend is 160 miles from Portland, where there is an international airport. The Redmond-Bend airport, 16 miles north of Bend, is served by United Express and Alaska/Horizon Airlines, with several flights daily from Portland and San Francisco.
March and April are mud season in most resorts, but skiing in this high desert area often lasts through June. Mount Bachelor is one of the latest-closing ski areas in the country. Summer days are often hot, but usually free of humidity, and almost always followed by an evening cool enough to prompt the sparking up of the fireplace.
 
Things to Do
The Sunriver Nature Center, 17620 River Road, Sunriver, (541) 593-4394, is open daily 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. Admission is $2, $1 for those 12 and younger.
The High Desert Museum is three and a half miles south of Bend on Highway 97, (541) 382-4754 It is open 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily; admission, $6.25, $5.75 for those 65 and older and 13 to 18, and $3 for 5 to 12.
Every summer, the Bend area is home to two festivals of mostly classical music. Except for a pops concert in Bend, the Sunriver Music Festival will be in Great Hall in Sunriver, Aug. 15 to 23; tickets are $7 to $35 from (541) 593-9310. The Cascade Festival of Music, which will include a blues night, is in Drake Park in downtown Bend, Aug. 23 to 30; tickets are $12 to $20 from (541) 382-8381.
 
Dining and Lodging
Though we mostly ate in our condo, Bend has a surprisingly large number of restaurants, from fancy French to brew pubs. One we ate in is Toomie's, 119 Northwest Minnesota Avenue, downtown, (541) 388-5590, a casual contemporary Thai restaurant, offering good food, especially of the spicy variety. Dinner entrees average about $10.
Sunriver Resort, a nearly 4,000-acre planned community 15 miles south of Bend, has a variety of accommodations from a standard lodge room with fireplace for less than $100 a night to houses or condominiums for $300 or more.
The resort has more than a dozen restaurants in all price categories, from sandwich and chowder shops to formal establishments. There are 2 supermarkets, 27 tennis courts, 3 18-hole golf courses, 2 pools, stables, 35 miles of paved bike paths and convention facilities. Many services, including canoe, bike and ski rentals, are available whether you stay at the resort or not. For reservations, call (800) 547-3922.
The Riverhouse, in the heart of Bend, and the Inn of the Seventh Mountain, seven miles from Bend on Century Drive, the access road to Mount Bachelor, are smaller resorts. The Riverhouse, with 220 beds, has rooms from $65 to $86 a night, double occupancy, and suites, most with kitchens, $81 to $110. It has two swimming pools and an 18-hole golf course. Phone: (800) 547-3928.
The Inn of the Seventh Mountain, (800) 452-6810, has 238 beds, and charges $59 and up for hotel rooms, $99 to $115 for a studio with kitchenette, and $129 to $299 for one-to-three-bedroom condos. The inn has two restaurants, and offers bike rentals, tennis and swimming.
Bend's central artery, Route 97, is also home to at least one outpost of most chain motels, including Econo Lodge, Hampton Inn, Shilo Inn and Red Lion Inn, as well as the Bend Riverside Motel II (800) 228-4019, an attractive locally run operation with 82 units from $49 to $106. J. R.

HEADLINE: For Elegant Watch Hill, New Faces on the Scene

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ABBOTT

DATELINE: WESTERLY, R.I.

 BODY:
FOR more than a century, the elegant seaside community of Watch Hill beckoned a select group of wealthy families, who traveled by steamer and train to their Victorian-style cottages from New York, Philadelphia, Cincinnati and other bases of industry.
Life in Watch Hill revolved around golf and tennis at the Misquamicut Club, bathing and yachting at the Watch Hill Yacht Club and tea and cocktails at Ocean House and Watch Hill's other grand hotels. 
 "It was a closed community," said Nancy Richmond, whose family has summered in Watch Hill for five generations.
Watch Hill was a place where everyone knew everyone, a somewhat staid and family-oriented community compared to glittering Newport, Rhode Island's other, more famous summer colony.
But times are changing. Even in Watch Hill.
After hanging onto their homes for decades, several Watch Hill families have decided in recent years to sell their "cottages" -- spacious homes that range in price from $250,000 to $3.5 million and often have 10 bedrooms or more. At the same time, a buoyant stock market has financed a new class of buyers, who find Watch Hill affordable compared with the Hamptons.
The result has been a vibrant Watch Hill real estate market in the last two years. Last summer, more than 20 of the 300 or so spacious houses sold. This year, the market is just as strong, said Claus Rossin of Buffum & Rossin Realty, an affiliate of Sotheby's that specializes in Watch Hill listings.
These new buyers are changing the fabric of life in Watch Hill.
"It has opened up Watch Hill to a whole new crowd of people," observed Ms. Richmond, who has been selling real estate in the area for more than a decade. This new crowd is more cosmopolitan than the families of old and less dependent on the private clubs for their social scene, she said.
Perched on Rhode Island's southernmost tip, Watch Hill is one of a string of summer colonies that line the state's South County shore. Others include Weekapaug, a community similar in style and price to Watch Hill; Shelter Harbor, Misquamicut and Quonochontaug. (Fans of the "X Files" television series know Quonochontaug as the summer home of Agent Mulder's mother.)
About 50 miles south of Providence, 13 miles across Block Island Sound from Block Island and about 140 miles from New York City, Watch Hill is one of several distinct neighborhoods in the larger town of Westerly, an old mill village on the banks of the Pawcatuck River. But it is unquestionably Westerly's most famous neighborhood, a picturesque enclave of winding, hilly streets with notable landmarks like the 1916 Olympia Tea Room, famous for its lobster salad rolls, and the 1880's Flying Horse outdoor carousel.
Then there's the Ocean House, one of the last of several Victorian-style hotels built in Watch Hill after the Civil War. A massive yellow building with a sweeping oceanfront veranda, the Ocean House conjures up another age, when women wore white gloves to tea and golf was a newfangled pastime.
Mr. Rossin called Watch Hill "a yachtsman's paradise, a quaint village with a beautiful harbor and beautiful beaches."
IN many respects, the Ocean House illustrates the changes wafting over Watch Hill. After owning the seven-story hotel for 60 years, earlier this year the April family decided to put it on the market. The asking price is $7.5 million.
Asked to explain her family's decision, Carol April said merely, "It is time."
But, in fact, the April family found themselves in the same position many Watch Hill residents did in the 1980's. After summering in Watch Hill for decades, and sometimes paying little attention to the maintenance of their cottages, these families woke up one day to find themselves in houses that were too big for them and which, while charming, required a lot of work.
This is what happened to Ms. Richmond. She inherited her grandmother's home on the bluffs in the 80's. At that time, it was just her and her son and the 10 or so bedrooms were "a bit much for the two of us," she said. So in 1987, Ms. Richmond sold the house for $1.8 million, becoming not only one of the first of the old guard to sell, but also one of the first sellers in Watch Hill to see a startling appreciation in property value.
"I was thinking maybe I could get $500,000 for it," Ms. Richmond.
When she got more than three times that, "My teeth nearly fell out," she said.
And so it began, the gradual change of ownership of an historic seaside colony.
Since 1960, Wayne Cottage has been in the family of Toby Beavers, a Manhattan nightclub owner. Built in 1898 by J. Stark Wayne, a tobacco plantation owner, it was the perfect place to spend summers as a boy, said Mr. Beavers.
"It was fabulous," said Mr. Beavers, who owned the now defunct Surf Club on the Upper East Side. But the Beaverses, like several other Watch Hill families, have decided it's time to sell the summer cottage.
MR. BEAVERS and his family share the house with a brother and his family. Since they rent it out in the summer to help pay the bills, they are not getting enough use of the house to make ownership worthwhile.
The nine-bedroom Wayne Cottage is now on the market with an asking price $995,000.
Mr. Rossin said that, because of its uniqueness, the Watch Hill market is "never really dead." But he and other agents conceded that after the boom of the 80's went bust at the end of the decade, there were a few very flat years in Watch Hill. Then the economy improved and the market came back.
"It's really hot," said Paul Klotz, a developer who is building a cluster subdivision, New Bottom Pond, on 120 acres in Avondale, a neighborhood bordering Watch Hill. Two years ago, he said, there were more than 30 properties for sale in Watch Hill. Now they are almost all sold, he added.
The new buyers are different from the old owners in that many of them are winterizing their homes with plans to use them not only in the summertime, but also on weekends throughout the year, Mr. Rossin and other agents said. Although some people find Watch Hill isolated in the wintertime, others find the quiet peaceful.
"It's a big beautiful world that's all yours," said Mr. Klotz, who has lived year-round in Avondale for 29 years.
The broader community of Westerly is, itself, beginning to see some change. Insulated and moribund since the late 1940's, when the town's historic downtown lost much of its life to the suburbs, Westerly has recently shown more signs of life.
In the last year, a group of developers transformed the landmark old McCormick's department store into a mixed use residential/retail complex. Westerly's historic Spanish-style Amtrak station on the edge of the downtown is to get a $1.5 million restoration. And thanks to downtown Westerly's proximity to Foxwoods Resort Casino, which is only 10 miles away, the town's apartment market has rebounded.
"Before Foxwoods opened [in 1992], the rental market was about 50 percent vacant and now it's full," Mr. Klotz said.
The Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe owns Foxwoods, one of the world's largest and most profitable casinos. Although some people in Westerly and southeastern Connecticut are wary, if not critical, of the tribe's growing economic clout in the region, Mr. Klotz is not among them.
"They got money circulating in the region again and we had no money circulating," he said, referring to the fact that the area was hit both by the recession and cutbacks in the nation's military budget.
But here the noise and glitz of the casino seem a million miles away. Which is, of course, one of the reasons a new set of buyers are flocking to this seaside community.
"A lot of new blood is coming into Watch Hill," said Ms. Richmond. "I think it's healthy."

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
Sure, America's G-7 allies were grumbling a bit in Denver over what they considered excessive bragging by President Clinton about how "America's economy is the healthiest in a generation and the strongest in the world." But I say let him brag a little. The fact is he deserves credit for a five-year program of deficit reduction and trade expansion that has lowered inflation and interest rates -- without a recession -- and left enough steam in the economy to finance America's transformation into a much more efficient global competitor.
America's economic strength today is real. The U.S. now excels in making everything that is light. That is critical because the more knowledge and information technology designed into a product, the less it tends to weigh, and the more it tends to sell for. As Alan Greenspan recently noted, there is less weight today in each dollar of U.S. G.D.P. than ever before: vacuum tubes are replaced by tiny transistors, heavy fabrics by feather-light ones and your 150-pound receptionist by a voice mail device. And whether it is software design, Internet marketing, banking, insurance, consulting, fast-food catering, higher education, package delivery, entertainment, media, computer chips or potato chips, the U.S. today is good at all the light stuff. 
 The only bad news is that at precisely such a moment of unprecedented prosperity, we should be addressing the very real problems still holding our economy back -- and we're not.
For instance, I'd feel better about America's economy if I knew we were prospering as one country, not as two. One way I'll know that is when my 11-year-old daughter, who goes to public school in Maryland, stops coming home sad because another one of her friends just quit the public school to go to private school. If I've learned anything traveling the world it's this: Never trust a country where the rich live behind high walls and tinted windows. That is a place that is not prospering as one country. That is a place where the rich not only say, "I don't want you to see how I live," but "I don't want to see how you live."
Without the cold war, the space program, the civil rights movement or army service to unite us, it's easy for this widening rich-poor gap to become institutionalized. This is particularly true when so many of the wealthy are dropping out of the last great homogenizing institution in America -- the public schools, even the best public schools. In the Cabinet of the recently defeated British Conservative Prime Minister, John Major, not a single minister had his children in the British public school system. The Clinton Administration can't be far behind that. President Clinton did propose $5 billion in seed money to repair and upgrade decrepit public schools, but Republicans cut it to zero. That is a travesty.
I'd feel better about America's economy if there were less tax cutting at this moment of prosperity and some serious reform of Medicare and Social Security. Without it, the deficit is sure to explode again when all the baby boomers start to retire. The longer you wait to do entitlement reform, the greater the pain.
I'd feel better about America's economy if this latest budget did a little more for young people and a little less for older ones. If we're going to take that lower slice of the population that is not ready for the information economy and give them skills to become tax payers instead of tax drainers, we need to invest more in the ages of birth to 5. If we can cut $85 billion in taxes over five years, we can spend a little more making sure every child has a minimum of Head Start, health care, nutrition and educational opportunities.
I'd feel better about America's economy if we weren't doing so many of our improvements with other people's money. We are still borrowing tens of billions each year from the rest of the world to finance our deficit. China alone holds $52 billion in U.S. T-bills, and Japan holds $291 billion. I'd feel a lot better if I didn't know that Japan had a savings rate of 31 percent of G.D.P. and an investment rate of 28 percent, while we have savings rate of 17 percent and an investment rate of 16 percent. Surely, it can't be good if they are planting the seeds for the future at double the rate we are.
In short, I'd feel a lot better about America's economy if there were just a little less "Today, for Me" in the new budget and a little more "Tomorrow, for Us."

HEADLINE: Mexican Leaders Honor a Union Giant, and an Era

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 22

 BODY:
Government officials and labor leaders turned out today to pay their last respects to Fidel Velazquez Sanchez, the 97-year-old labor patriarch whose death on Saturday marked the end of six decades of unbending top-down control of the Mexican union movement.
But notably absent from the ceremonies was any outpouring of grief from rank-and-file workers. Local unions from around the country sent huge wreaths of white marigolds and scarlet roses. But the streets outside the Mexican Workers' Confederation, the scene of many labor demonstrations over the years, were empty except for the parked luxury cars of Government and labor officials. 
 President Ernesto Zedillo rendered his homage standing beside Mr. Velazquez's mahogany coffin during a wake in the atrium of the headquarters of the labor confederation. Mr. Velazquez ran the confederation for most of the last 60 years.
"He always encouraged negotiation, not confrontation," Mr. Zedillo said. "He always worked for stability, not uncertainty."
Inside, after President Zedillo's speech a few workers started to shout "Fidel! Fidel!" But their voices sounded thin as they echoed up toward the skylight, and the shouting quickly subsided.
Government officials were ready to show their gratitude to Don Fidel, as he was known in Mexico, after he used his grip on the mainstream labor movement to help them impose a harsh belt-tightening program on Mexican workers that has begun to pull the country out of a steep recession that began in 1994.
But dissident labor leaders and opposition politicians immediately criticized the legacy of low wages that Mr. Velazquez has left and predicted that his death would unleash a power struggle to produce a more decentralized and aggressive labor movement, and to break the decades-old bonds between the unions and the Government.
"The old labor system is passing away," said Kevin Middlebrook, an expert on Mexican labor at the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies in San Diego. "It is quite likely that no one can maintain the unity and discipline Fidel Velazquez achieved. That was his historic contribution."
Leaders of the labor confederation were shaken by the death of their leader, even though it was long expected, and moved to postpone the succession battle within their ranks.
Based on a pecking order established in the confederation's statutes, 78-year-old Leonardo Rodriguez Alcaine, the head of the electrician's union, will act as secretary general until a national assembly meets next February. Mr. Rodriguez got the interim job because he is the only one of the highest leaders of the confederation who is in good health.
But already there are murmurings among mid-level officials that the mainstream labor movement needs a younger leader who will be less identified with years of unquestioned support for Government policies.
As a sign of the confederation's lack of credibility with the public, the announcement of Mr. Velazquez's death Saturday morning prompted a storm of rumors that he had in fact died a day earlier, but that the Government delayed the announcement to allow for secret succession negotiations.
Mr. Velazquez's personal physician, Dr. Salomon Jasqui, later made another announcement confirming the date and time of death.
After Mr. Velazquez was first elected to head the labor group in 1941, he pioneered a system in which workers collaborated with the Government in exchange for privileged treatment from public institutions like the national petroleum company and the social security system.
But this pact was practically destroyed by the grinding economic crisis of the last two years. The buying power of the average Mexican worker today is less than it was in 1980.
In the last two months President Zedillo has been booed and taunted twice at labor gatherings, shows of disrespect that would have been unthinkable before the crisis.
"What Fidel Velazquez left workers was constantly declining living standards," said Agustin Rodriguez Fuentes, the head of a dissident labor coalition. "His death means that we can begin to rehabilitate the labor movement."
Mr. Velazquez's death is expected to cost Mr. Zedillo's political party, which has ruled Mexico for nearly 70 years, votes among workers in national legislative and local elections on July 6.
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leftist candidate for Mayor of Mexico City, who polls indicate will be elected, said he lamented Mr. Velazquez's death as he would "that of any person," but he called him "the leader of a labor movement based on corruption and patronage."
Mr. Rodriguez, the interim head of the confederation, reacted by banning Mr. Cardenas from the wake. Analysts said that Mr. Cardenas, who has been fiercely critical of President Zedillo's economic policies, could attract many unions to his side if he gains control of the huge capital city.
Workers will almost certainly become more combative in their demands for wage increases now. But Government officials were quick to stress that a more vociferous labor movement is not likely to destabilize the country.
"Mexico is a country of institutions," said Manuel Bartlett, the influential Governor of the state of Puebla. "The passing of a great man does not mean the passing of stability."
A second wake for Mr. Velazquez was held today in the Mexican Senate, where he served two terms. His body was cremated and was to be buried tonight in a private ceremony at a cemetery in a prosperous neighborhood of Mexico City.

HEADLINE: Subsidies Hurt Environment, Critics Say Before Talks

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 20

 BODY:
As world leaders converge here starting on Monday to take stock of the global environment five years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, a growing number of experts say that government subsidies to industries not only squander money that could be spent cleaning up the Earth, but but also actually damage it.
Subsidies for energy suppliers, water services, road building, agriculture and fisheries and other activities often have side effects that cost from $500 billion to $900 billion in environmental damage, according to a surprisingly varied group of experts -- from the left and right, industrial countries and the third world. 
 Such payments can make some commodities too cheap, leading to profligacy, experts say. Other goods and services become artificially more expensive, in effect taxing consumers while bolstering inefficient industries that squander natural resources.
Thus, farmers in Asia, enjoying inexpensive water, electricity and fertilizer, are tempted to overirrigate and chemically pollute fields and streams. In the United States, automobile manufacturers build bigger, more gas-guzzling cars, and harmful emissions rise and public transportation atrophies. In Germany, according to one estimate, it costs the Government more than $70,000 a year to keep each coal miner at work extracting an uneconomical fuel that dirties the atmosphere.
"There's something unbelievable about the world spending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to subsidize its own destruction," says a new report from the independent Earth Council, based in Costa Rica, and the Institute for Research on Public Expenditure in the Netherlands. The report, "Subsidizing Unsustainable Development: Undermining the Earth with Public Funds," recommends re-examining all subsidies to sift out those that are damaging from those that still serve a social or economic purpose.
Subsidies do not appear to be on any nation's priority list for the summit meeting, known as Rio Plus 5. President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are expected to attend, among leaders from more than 60 countries. The President is scheduled to speak on Thursday. American officials list as top issues the debates over global warming and how best to protect the world's forests. Many poor nations want to confront the richer nations with demands for more money and technology transfers, which they say they need to bring environmental protection up to date.
The issue of subsidies is a difficult one for any leader to tackle, even though it knows no ideological or national boundaries and is not related to levels of development. Governments of the left and right, in rich industrial nations and the poorer third world, use subsidies to win votes or mute dissent and they have become difficult to abolish.
"Many of these subsidies are kept in place through political pressure, campaign donations or even bribery," said Worldwatch Institute in Washington in a report, "Paying the Piper: Subsidies, Politics and the Environment."
The author of that report, David Malin Roodman, concluded that "more than $500 billion a year of consumers' and taxpayers' money is spent by governments to subsidize deforestation, overfishing and other environmentally destructive activities." Subsidies for fishing fleets have produced enough fishery boats and equipment to catch twice the available fish in the world's seas, Mr. Roodman said.
In India, a recent study for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram found that the national and state governments together were spending about $40 billion, or 14.4 percent of the country's gross domestic product, on subsidies. More than $5 billion of that goes to support prices for petroleum products, with agriculture subsidies close behind. Less than 4 percent of India's economy goes toward education.
The assault on subsidies is particularly noteworthy in the third world, where grass-roots groups are resisting years of demands by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that such supports be eliminated or reduced. The local groups say that cutting subsidies hurts the poor, especially women and children.
The Indian Government and others in the third world now question those assumptions. Mr. Chidambaram's study, based on research by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi, found that the rich, not the poor, more often benefited from subsidies, because the rich were in a position to buy and use subsidized commodities and services. Inexpensive electricity does not help the poorest, unelectrified villages, or the farmer unable to afford a subsidized bag of high-yield fertilizer.
"The poor generally don't benefit from subsidies as much as the middle class," said Anders Wijkman, director of the bureau for policy and program support at the United Nations Development Program, which recently published a report, "Energy After Rio." That report says that subsidies to conventional energy sources like coal, oil and nuclear power are "a significant impediment to sustainable energy futures."
"They make it more difficult for new, sustainable energy technologies to enter the market, while simultaneously reducing the economic efficiency and creating fiscal burdens for the government," the report said. "Energy price subsidies are often an ineffective and inefficient way of helping those living in poverty."
In Tanzania, the report noted, kerosene subsidies were found to be helping mostly the wealthier households that buy the bulk of the fuel.
At the Cato Institute in Washington, Jerry Taylor, director of natural resources studies, characterized many subsidies as "socialist" measures, and argued that the environment would be better left in the hands of an "unfettered" private sector, not dependent on Federal aid.
In an interview, Mr. Taylor said that subsidies to agriculture in rich and poor countries had contributed to excessive use of pesticides, fungicides and herbicides. Import quotas and price supports protecting the American sugar industry have raised sugar prices and led to destruction of parts of the Everglades, an example cited by American environmentalists.
In a speech earlier this year to the Environmental Grantmakers Association in Washington, Mr. Taylor said: "It makes no sense for the Federal Government to subsidize environmental destruction on one hand, while establishing laws, regulations and vast bureaucracies to mitigate it on the other."

HEADLINE: Jacor a Rising Star Among Radio Networks

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
In just over 18 months, Jacor Communications Inc. has gone from being a bit player in the radio business to one of its rising stars.
Thanks to deregulation and a Wall Street-financed buying binge, the company is now the nation's third-largest radio station group, as well as the third-largest radio network, featuring programs like Rush Limbaugh's conservative talk show. 
 Jacor is not the household name that Mr. Limbaugh is. But in more and more small and midsize cities, as well as in Los Angeles, the company's presence is growing. Starting with 26 stations in 1995, Jacor now owns 149 stations in 32 markets.
It trails the CBS Radio Network and the ABC Radio Network in advertising revenue. Moreover, in terms of overall radio revenue and station ownership, it has already eclipsed ABC and is closing in on CBS and the Chancellor Media Corporation, a big broadcasting group that produces little programming.
The company can take a decidedly hands-on approach. For example, during a Sunday drive near Jacor's suburban Cincinnati headquarters in Covington, Ky., Randy Michaels, the president and chief executive, was annoyed at the broadcast fidelity when tuning in WLAP-AM in Lexington. "I thought it sounded lousy," he said. So Mr. Michaels showed up at the station. "I'm the new engineer," Mr. Michaels assured the host of the station's horse-racing show while tuning the 5,000-watt transmitter. Now, Mr. Michaels said with satisfaction, "it sounds a lot better."
Since the industry's deregulation by the Federal Communications Commission in January 1996, more than 2,100 stations have changed hands in deals worth $15 billion. Jacor alone spent $1.6 billion on stations financed by a combination of debt and equity, more than any other company, according to Broadcasting and Cable magazine.
While the company entered a top market in acquiring KIIS AM and FM in Los Angeles, Jacor is an industry contrarian: its strengths are in secondary markets and AM formats.
But Mr. Michaels, 45, did not stop with stations. In an effort to control even more commercial broadcast time, this spring Jacor spent a combined $246 million to make itself into a network power by acquiring Mr. Limbaugh's syndicator, EFM Media Management Inc.; Premiere Radio Networks Inc. and NSN Network Services, which builds two-way data and audio transmission pipelines.
"Our business is so trivially simple," Mr. Michaels said. "It's all a matter of product. We believe in original programming that's mass appeal but difficult to duplicate."
Loosely adapting the airline industry's hub-and-spoke system, Jacor's post-deregulation strategy is to develop radio programs with regional appeal that can be syndicated and sold to stations in contiguous markets near a metropolitan area. Such a strategy allows it to spread programming costs across several stations and to sell advertising that is comparable in total audience size to a local newspaper or television station but typically at lower cost. Rules that limited station ownership had previously precluded such an approach, so it remains legally untested.
"It's a brilliant strategy that takes advantage of what the telecom bill allowed us to do," said Bill Clark, former chief executive of Shamrock Broadcasting. "It's a farm system for talent and a delivery system for syndicated programs."
Such a strategy also has its risks. In Cincinnati, the company's dominance led to the industry's most visible antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. Jacor was forced to sell WKRQ-FM and to abandon financing support for WGRR-FM.
The regional emphasis aims to amass the bigger audiences that advertisers prefer to a single station's listeners. It may allow Mr. Michaels to achieve what has become the holy grail of radio executives: pushing radio's share of total advertising dollars beyond 7 percent. That percentage amounted to $11.3 billion in revenue last year.
Since doubling its Cincinnati presence by acquiring its broadcast rival Citicasters Inc. in September, Jacor's seven Cincinnati-area radio stations and its No. 1-rated television station, the ABC affiliate WKRC, are heard or seen by 1.2 million people. By comparison, the leading newspaper, The Cincinnati Enquirer, has a daily circulation of about 202,000. Mr. Michaels contends that Jacor's heft has helped its radio stations snag $1 million in job-recruitment advertising, which had been the exclusive province of The Enquirer, a Gannett Company newspaper.
David J. Hunke, executive vice president of The Enquirer and The Cincinnati Post, a Scripps Howard paper -- the two have a joint operating agreement -- questioned such assertions, suggesting that a rising tide was lifting all boats. "Everybody has shown very strong growth," he said.
In addition to Cincinnati, Jacor plans to develop regional programming around Tampa, Fla.; Denver; Cleveland; Columbus, Ohio, and Los Angeles. Mr. Michaels recently told analysts that he expected this strategy to produce annual investment returns of 20 percent or more.
In Southern California, Jacor's foundation is an all-sports station modeled on the nation's No. 1 revenue producer, WFAN-AM in New York, which is owned by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the parent of CBS Radio. Jacor won radio broadcast rights for the Los Angeles Dodgers for KIIS-AM, beginning in 1998. Sports talk shows could be syndicated to stations in Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and Ventura, Calif.
Jacor's programming push means that both its cash flow margin and price-earnings multiple are typically lower than its competitors. "It's expensive bidding for sports rights," said Frank Bodenchak, a Morgan Stanley analyst. He thinks Jacor's strategy has merit, anyway, adding, "You can increase revenue over a longer leg of growth than the cost cutters."
Others on Wall Street have shown enthusiasm for Jacor. Its stock closed on Nasdaq Friday at $37 a share, compared with a 52-week low in December of $23.75.
Mr. Michaels' affinity for technology and content comes out of his experience as a chief engineer and programmer. He started his own station group in 1983, which later merged with Jacor. Debt and recession in the early 1990's forced Jacor to revamp with capital from the Zell/ Chilmark Fund of Chicago, which specializes in bailing out troubled businesses. Samuel Zell, Jacor's chairman, and his fund are Jacor's largest shareholders at 33 percent.
Jacor had $223 million in revenue and $5.1 million in profit last year. For the first quarter of this year, however, the company registered a loss of $8.1 million on revenue of $100 million, mainly because of higher interest expenses.
Much of Jacor's profit comes from AM stations, which over the last two decades have lost considerable ground to their FM rivals. "Competitors have abandoned programming attempts on the AM dial," Mr. Michaels said, because cash-flow margins for FM stations have been so rich, averaging 40 percent.
Most AM stations and small-market stations broadcast, simulcast or network programs in exchange for giving up commercial time. The high ratings generated by a syndicated personality -- and higher advertising revenue that go with it -- demonstrate to group owners that radio can be successful without local content, according to Ted Bolton, a radio research consultant in Philadelphia. "The national talent in a small market comes in and makes the local guys look ridiculous," he said.
Listeners now hear satellite-delivered programs with play lists and slogans as formulaic as a Big Mac. "Radio is so generic; local doesn't mean anything anymore," said Lee Abrams, a Dallas programming consultant. As a result, he thinks Jacor's plan to syndicate local programming with network polish has a good chance of success.
And Nicholas J. Verbitsky, president of United Stations Radio Networks Inc., a programming syndicator, adds: 'I think their strategy is flawless. They are breaking some new ground."

HEADLINE: To Growers, Deal Brings Uncertainty And Anger

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: LUCAMA, N.C., June 21

 BODY:
The tobacco farmer lunged forward, his face red with anger at the latest provocation from Washington.
"Don't get me wrong," said Billy Bass, a gold tobacco leaf swinging from its chain around his neck. "Tobacco is bad. I wouldn't tell it any other way. But as long as it's legal, I'll grow it." 
 The tobacco farmers here have long felt scorned by outsiders. Each development in the anti-smoking wars is another blow, and in the wake of the wide-ranging settlement announced in Washington on Friday, the haze of freshly hurt pride was as palpable here in eastern North Carolina as the new summer's heat.
The deal left tobacco farmers here in Wilson County, the heart of eastern North Carolina's tobacco country, feeling like agriculture's pariahs. They do not know if the deal will mean fewer cigarette buyers, less money for their crop or even eventual ruin for themselves, but none of the half-dozen farmers interviewed today suggested quitting.
"It hurts my feelings, if you want to know the truth," said Donnie Boyette, who farms 113 acres near here.
The farmers' houses are surrounded by the plants, already robust and dark green. Their ancestors grew tobacco -- Mr. Bass said his family had grown tobacco on the same land since 1741. But they are ambivalent about this lucrative crop.
Most of the farmers volunteered that they did not smoke, did not want their children to smoke and did not want any teen-agers to smoke.
But they also insisted, vehemently, that they are good, hard-working citizens. In America's tobacco wars, they said, they are at least blameless. In their view, the crop is legal, so if there are ill effects from it, they are not responsible.
"Tobacco farmers are good people," said Thad P. Sharp Jr., 10 miles up Highway 581 in the hamlet of Sims. "They'd give you the shirt off their back if you had chill bumps."
"We don't need the abuse that Mike Moore imposes on us," Mr. Sharp said, referring to the Attorney General of Mississippi, Michael Moore, who has led the anti-tobacco fight.
"We're the people that's the salt of the earth, that's paying the taxes," said Mr. Sharp, whose 200 acres of tobacco provides 70 percent of his net profit, though he also grows soybeans, corn and tomatoes.
He was sitting in an air-conditioned office, saying he was grateful that tobacco had brought him all the way there from a Depression-era boyhood.
"I'm just as good a citizen as I was yesterday," Mr. Sharp said. "I have no problem with my conscience."
The officials' televised jubilation on Friday angered him. "It looked like a community soccer team, kids' stuff, running around slapping each other's hands," he said.
 The $368.5 billion deal notwithstanding, the short-term outlook for these farmers is not all gloomy, said Blake Brown, an agricultural economist.
They are producing more tobacco than 10 years ago, and the huge export market is helping to make up for drastic declines in domestic consumption, said Mr. Brown, who works at North Carolina State University. About 40 percent of flue-cured tobacco, the kind produced here, is exported. Still, Mr. Brown said, the farmers are earning less than in the 1970's, as is North Carolina as a whole. Tobacco was 46 percent of the state's farm income in 1964, but only 15 percent 30 years later.
The settlement evidently would not affect the Federal Government's subsidies for tobacco farming, which are relatively small anyway. Direct subsidies ended in the 1980's. Now the subsidies amount to a quota system in which the Government licenses the right to grow tobacco and has a Federal program to insure farmers against crop losses. The Department of Agriculture has budgeted $145 million for the insurance in the coming fiscal year; in years with no significant losses, it contributes little or nothing to the insurance pool.
Andrew J. Fisher, a spokesman for Senator Richard G. Lugar, chairman of the Senate's Committee on Agriculture, said today that the negotiators had not focused on Federal assistance for growers.
"Federal involvement is so minuscule that it wasn't seen as a major issue," Mr. Fisher said.
To the tobacco farmers, there is something unpatriotic about the tobacco deal.
Why, they ask, should the tobacco companies, and perhaps they, too, have to pay for something so fundamentally American as the exercise of free choice -- the decision to buy a pack of cigarettes?
"I think it's legalized extortion, but that's neither here nor there," Mr. Boyette said. "You've got a U.S. company marketing a legal product to a public that can buy or not buy it. You, as a free American, choose the pack of cigarettes -- that was your choice. Now, we've got to pay for your sickness?"
Mr. Bass said: "If I was growing marijuana out here, I could understand this. Tobacco put this country on its feet, used to have a lot of support. Now everybody's sold it out."
Mr. Boyette said: "It's become a whipping boy. You just get tired of it. Every day there's something. My grandfather worried about it, my father worried about it, and now I am. Will there ever be any end?"

HEADLINE: Effects of Pact's Costs on Industry and Smokers Are Unclear

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
For years, the tobacco industry and its critics have disagreed, in public at least, about why people smoke. Are they heavily swayed by marketing promotions and advertising? By where smoking is allowed? By the relatively low cost of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in the United States, compared with other wealthy countries?
These and other questions of consumer behavior would be put to their most sweeping test ever, with smokers as guinea pigs, if Congress approves the settlement creating a new legal and regulatory framework for the $45 billion industry. 
 Many smokers feel trapped. "I'm hoping it would make me quit, but I doubt if it will," said Penny Calabrese, a school secretary and two-pack-a-day smoker from Carol Stream, Ill.
The settlement assumes that the tobacco companies will pass on most of the costs of the settlement to customers, but the 68-page agreement has little to say about how and when that will happen.
Analysts speculate that the industry would try to quickly raise prices by 50 cents to $1 a pack. The cost to someone who smokes a carton a week could be $400 to $500 a year.
There is nothing in the agreement, though, to insure that the pricing field stays level within the industry. Philip Morris gets two-thirds of its profits from overseas sales and enjoys the largest profit margins because of its size. Its financial strength would also allow it to borrow money to pay the initial costs of the settlement at lower interest rates.
Such advantages give Philip Morris more leeway than its rivals to delay price increases in the hope of keeping customers and attracting new ones. At one point in the negotiations, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco and other worried Philip Morris competitors discussed seeking a provision in the settlement that would, in effect, guarantee that all price increases would be simultaneous and across-the-board, but that approach raised serious antitrust issues and was dropped.
One way the companies may try to cope with the settlement is to encourage the trend toward stores selling only tobacco products, where high volume allows bargain prices. The companies may also quickly begin to phase out marginal brands.
It is possible though that some brands would be stripped of their premium image and sold at lower prices. And analysts say the limited black market in cigarettes could expand if prices rise enough.
In short, the financial impact of the settlement on individual smokers could vary widely depending on the brands they smoke and how they buy them.
"My husband travels out of state each week and I'll be more likely to have him buy cartons for me where it's cheaper," said Deborah Herdon of Belleville, Mich., a state where high taxes have pushed the cost of premium cigarettes to $2.50 a pack.
Regardless of what happens with prices, the settlement guarantees that smokers and nonsmokers alike would no longer be bombarded with familiar images that appeal to young people, like Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. Tobacco sponsorship would disappear completely from some popular family venues, like sporting events.
Analysts assume that much of the $6 billion a year spent on marketing would be diverted to help pay for the settlement, at least initially. But substantial sums are sure to be redeployed to expand marketing programs that would still be legal and to invent new ones.
On the other hand, consumers would also be confronted with the impact of several billion dollars more being funneled into anti-smoking advertising and smoking-cessation programs.
Health advocates hope the broader bans on smoking in workplaces called for in the settlement would make smoking so inconvenient that more adults would be encouraged to quit. Under the settlement, most restaurants could continue to offer smoking sections, but fast-food restaurants would have to follow the example of industry leaders like McDonald's that have banned smoking.
Historically, the most effective way to reduce youth smoking has been to increase prices. Based on experience with price increases, analysts have projected that the number of legal smokers would fall anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent and that the heaviest smokers would at least reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke or be more inclined to switch to cheaper brands.
But the greatest declines would be expected among teen-age smokers, who have less disposable income to pay for price increases. Researchers say teen-agers' smoking rates have dropped more than adult rates in response to past price increases in part because some teen-agers have been discouraged from beginning to smoke. Another factor is that teen-agers are image conscious -- they are much more likely than adults to smoke heavily advertised brands like Marlboro and Camel -- and, as a result, more likely than adults to quit or cut back rather than switch to budget brands when prices jump.
The catch is that much of that experience with both teen-age and adult behavior is based on more modest price jumps in the wake of new taxes, a situation in which the blame could be placed entirely on politicians and the industry's adversaries. And smokers have never been asked to swallow such a large price increase while such a sweeping effort is being made to undermine tobacco's appeal.

HEADLINE: Rocky Mountain Cram Session

 BODY:
President Clinton and the leaders of Russia, Japan and Western Europe emerged from their marathon meetings in Denver over the weekend like tired college students who had endured a grueling round of final exams. Their joint declarations covered such a bewildering array of subjects, from Bosnia to global warming to trade barriers, that it was hard to imagine that they did justice to any of them. The blurred focus obscured a couple of significant accomplishments, however. One was the further integration of Russia's President, Boris Yeltsin, into the West's concerns, and the other was a new economic agenda for the world's richest countries.
As host of the Denver summit, Mr. Clinton rankled feelings among some colleagues, especially Japan, by insisting that Mr. Yeltsin become a nearly full-fledged member of the exclusive club of nations known as the Group of Seven. In financial terms, Russia is clearly not in the same league as the other G-7 countries that have met annually since 1975 to discuss economic problems. But since the collapse of Communism, Russia has crept its way in. For the United States, inviting Russia this past weekend was a crucial payback for Russia's reluctant acceptance of NATO expansion, to be formalized in Madrid next month. 
 In return, Mr. Yeltsin gave welcome new promises to speed economic reform at home. Russia agreed just before the summit to write off most of its Soviet-era debt, and in Denver Mr. Yeltsin promised to push hard for improved tax collection, a step that economists consider crucial to restoring Russian solvency. American officials were impressed that Russia had floated its first 10-year bond issue since 1913. But it was far from clear that Russia will make sufficient progress toward a legal system and open markets to meet the criteria for joining the World Trade Organization next year.
A year ago Mr. Yeltsin was a physically ravaged man, struggling to survive politically and unable to attend the economic summit meeting in Lyons, France. This past weekend he seemed more fit than in years. He joined with his summit colleagues to call for the reconstruction of Bosnia and went along with a renewed threat of sanctions against Iraq. But there were disquieting signs that Mr. Yeltsin remains on the defensive at home because of the United States' ill-considered drive for NATO expansion. Russian officials offered little assurance, for example, that they would win parliamentary approval of the Start 2 nuclear arms treaty in the Russian Parliament any time soon.
Although Mr. Yeltsin's presence overshadowed the other work of the summit, the conferees nudged a few economic issues forward and papered over their differences in several areas. Europe continues to complain about lagging American aid for Africa, but there was at least an agreement to accelerate trade and investment for countries with open markets. The summit gave a welcome if vague push toward closer collaboration on global warming and the spread of infectious diseases. A pledge to make bribery by multinational companies a crime might eventually reduce corruption in the world economy.
Conspicuous by its absence in the final communique was much reference to Europe's painful struggle to meet the austere requirements of a new monetary union without deepening unemployment, especially in France and Germany. While bragging about America's recent economic success, Mr. Clinton wisely avoided lecturing his European colleagues about how to solve their problems. He seemed more intent on creating a diversion from their crises at home in the warm Rocky Mountain sunshine.

HEADLINE: FAULTY OVERSIGHT PROFITED OWNERS OF PUBLIC HOUSING

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: NASHVILLE

 BODY:
James H. Johnson has lived in the same small apartment here at Edgehill Village for 19 years. The ceilings are cracked. Water from the leaky roof has warped the walls. Heaters barely function, and the unit has not been painted since he moved in.
"Stuff falls off into my food," Mr. Johnson said recently, pointing to peeling paint and wallboard in his kitchen. "I've complained, but I get no response." 
 Like millions of other low-income Americans, Mr. Johnson lives in a subsidized housing unit built nearly 30 years ago as part of an effort to solve one of the nation's most intractable problems: how to provide decent and secure housing for people who can least afford it.
But now Federal housing officials are making a remarkable admission: the landlords of some of these properties, including Edgehill Village, grew wealthy at the expense of the people they had promised to serve. The officials say the landlords collected subsidies and profited from the tax deductions by syndicating them but let the properties languish.
They also admit that, through mismanagement and neglect, the Government let the landlords get away with it.
The housing program is the outgrowth of a grand experiment by the Federal Government that started in the 1960's. Edgehill Village and hundreds of other properties sprang up under new Federal programs that offered low-interest mortgage rates and, later, tax deductions to spur private investment in dwellings for low-income residents. In some cases, the Government held or guaranteed mortgages through the Federal Housing Administration.
By 1972, many properties became part of a program known as project-based Section 8 housing, in which low-income residents pay a fraction of the fair-market rent, and the Government pays the rest.
Now, 25 years after the Section 8 program began, the Clinton Administration says it intends to reverse decades of lax oversight by driving out landlords of the troubled properties, a group that includes Allan S. Bird, the owner of Edgehill Village, who runs a $500 million real estate company, the Real Property Services Corporation in Carlsbad, Calif.
Mr. Bird and other landlords say they are not to blame for the deterioration, and they dispute the extent of the problems. They say their properties have eroded because the Department of Housing and Urban Development has refused to approve periodic increases in the rent subsidies, increases they say would enable them to make the needed repairs. Some owners also complain that they have trouble finding contractors to repair their properties, which are often in high-crime areas.
No matter who is at fault, thousands of substandard housing units around the country have locked people like Mr. Johnson into an unrelenting cycle of hopelessness.
Nationwide, nearly one million people -- almost half the number of residents in project-based Section 8 units -- live in apartments like the ones here that have fallen into disrepair. For those people, peeling paint, broken windows, cracked walls and insect infestations are constant reminders that the program's stewards -- HUD and the landlords -- have not maintained "decent, safe and sanitary" conditions, as required by Government contracts.
Richard J. Wagner, litigation director for Brooklyn Legal Services in New York City, represents the Gates Avenue Housing Tenants' Association in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Gates Avenue is another of Mr. Bird's properties, and the association is suing HUD and Mr. Bird over the same type of problems that Mr. Johnson faces in Nashville. The lawsuit, which is pending, says Mr. Bird and the department failed to maintain the apartments properly, which HUD and Mr. Bird strongly deny.
Mr. Wagner estimated that neglect and ineffective oversight of Section 8 had cost taxpayers as much as $60 billion in 20 years.
Many housing experts say his estimate is overstated. Nonetheless, a report for HUD last year by the accounting firm Ernst & Young found that the stock of 851,035 project-based Section 8 units needed almost $4 billion in immediate repairs.
"That's not $60 billion worth, but it's a huge taxpayer liability," said Helen Dunlap, president of the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group.
President Clinton's new Housing Secretary, Andrew M. Cuomo, apparently agrees that something needs to be done. Mr. Cuomo has made it a goal to weed out problem landlords, and so far this year, his department has begun proceedings against 38 landlords, including Mr. Bird, to remove them from the program. In all of last year, the department took the same action against 30.
Landlords have the right to appeal a disbarment to the agency and, later, to a Federal court. But if the department prevails, the landlord cannot hold any Government contracts for a specified period.
Mr. Bird, 61, said in an interview that he had been "dismayed, shocked and hurt" to receive the notification of HUD's disbarment proceeding against him. He has had more than 20 years of fruitful relations with the Government as a Section 8 housing owner, he said.
"We feel we have been responsible," Mr. Bird said, "and we are responsible. This is very alarming."
Asked why he thought Mr. Cuomo was taking aim at him, Mr. Bird said the Secretary was reacting to pressure generated by the suit in Brooklyn and wanted to fashion himself as a reformer in the eyes of Congress.
In addition to the disbarment actions, Mr. Cuomo said in an interview that he was also setting up an assessment and enforcement division to reverse years of lax management. The division will monitor all properties and their finances, making sure that landlords comply with their contracts, he said.
The division will also bring the oversight of all programs into one office; now, each program monitors itself. Officials say they will share information with the Internal Revenue Service as a way to track the financial status of all landlords.
"The way it works now is haphazard," said Gary Eisenman, a deputy counsel at HUD. "Problems could go on for years, and landlords would assure us they would take care of the problem. Then nothing would happen, and we wouldn't take any action."
A walking tour of Edgehill Village, a 290-unit project in the shadows of downtown Nashville, makes it clear that there are many problems. The apartments were built in the late 1960's, and Mr. Bird bought them in 1981 for $1.9 million.
For more than 12 years, they passed Federal inspections, but by last September, the conditions had eroded so much that housing officials in Nashville recommended that the Government withhold the monthly $85,000 Section 8 payments until repairs had been made.
Mr. Bird recently put $1.5 million into an escrow account for renovations and agreed to a plan to have them completed by June 30. But residents have been caught in a vise of inactivity.
In the interview, Mr. Bird said it was the responsibility of the company that oversees the daily operation of the project, the Hardaway Management Company, which he does not own, to hire contractors for the work and supervise the repairs.
Mr. Bird employs a consultant to assist Hardaway in Nashville, Elizabeth Brewer Lay, who said efforts to repair the property had been hampered by Hardaway's inability to secure competitive bids. Contractors are reluctant to work in the area because of crime, Ms. Lay said.
Not until late last month, she said, did the company finally get a second bid for interior renovations, which means that work could start in a few weeks. Meanwhile, only one of about a dozen leaky roofs has been fixed, and 41 percent of the units remain boarded up and vacant.
A neighbor of Mr. Johnson, Shirley Hines, 58, said she had been waiting 13 years for a paint job.
Lorraine Simpson, 30, a mother of two, lives in a row of seven attached units, five of them boarded up. Windows in her bedroom and kitchen are broken. Not one of the windows has a screen. The smoke alarm does not work. Water trickles into the apartment from the unit above.
Residents, including Mr. Johnson, also cite the frequency with which gang members break outside lights to hide what the residents say is nightly criminal behavior that includes selling drugs.
Mr. Cuomo declined to criticize his predecessors, but he conceded that a succession of Presidential Administrations had found that for the Section 8 program, "the cheapest and easiest thing to do was nothing" because any Federal takeover would come at huge expense to taxpayers. The Government has to make the necessary repairs, take over mortgage payments or assume mortgages that it has been guaranteeing, and find new owners.
"When you don't enforce regulations," Mr. Cuomo said, "at some point they become meaningless.
"Once we signal that we're serious," he said, "you will start to see more compliance."
Like other major Section 8 owners, Mr. Bird made much of his money on the front end of his investments, in the 1980's, when favorable tax laws provided deductions for people who invested in subsidized housing.
For many of his properties, he syndicated the tax deductions, establishing himself as the general partner of a for-profit partnership and earning large sums through syndication fees. His other major source of revenue was management fees at properties run by his company.
After 1986, when the deductions were replaced with tax credits, construction of low-income housing virtually stopped. Mr. Bird said he had been unable to secure new sources of investment, leaving him to rely on management fees, which he called slim, and his annual Section 8 subsidies from the Government, more than $24 million.
But senior housing officials said that had been more than enough to keep his properties in good condition. Department records indicate that 43 of Mr. Bird's low-income properties, more than 40 percent of his portfolio, have failed physical inspections or have not met Federal financial or management standards. For those 43 properties, Mr. Bird gets $10.5 million a year in rent subsidies.
Mr. Bird strongly disputed the HUD analysis of his low-income portfolio, saying the department had overstated the problems. He provided company documents showing that, according to the most recent reviews of his properties by the department, the physical condition of 28 were "below average" or "unsatisfactory" and that in 7, the agency found that the management was below average or unsatisfactory. He also said problems at the three projects cited in his disbarment notification -- the Gates Avenue apartments and two properties in Michigan -- were being addressed.
Here at Edgehill Village, inertia beats down on residents as hard as the noonday sun. Sitting quietly on an old chair at his front door, Mr. Johnson said that the last time anyone repaired anything in his apartment was 12 years ago, when workers patched a hole in his ceiling.
These days, though, he worries more about what goes on outside the apartment than inside. Gunfire at night and the smashing of floodlights keep him awake and scared.
"I told the management what was going on," he said. "They said they would send someone down. But no one has ever come down here. No one."

HEADLINE: 8 Leaders Issue Long Wish List To End Meeting

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: DENVER, June 22

 BODY:
The leaders of the eight countries that together represent about half of the world's economic activity called today for rapid democratic elections in Hong Kong, renewed energy to break the stalemate in the Middle East, a new commitment to peace in Bosnia, and new aid for Africa.
But in a sharp dispute with France and other European nations that dominated this morning's final session of "The Summit of the Eight," President Clinton refused to commit the United States to a specific reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, agreeing only to "substantial reductions" by 2010. 
 Mr. Clinton also acknowledged, in his closing news conference, that he had failed to resolve differences with France and Italy over how many countries should be invited to join NATO in the first round of expansion, with the Madrid summit meeting of the Atlantic alliance less than six weeks away.
While all 16 NATO countries agree that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic should be invited to join in Madrid, the United States has flatly rejected French and Italian arguments that Romania and Slovenia should also come in now.
Other countries also favor the admission of Slovenia, but Mr. Clinton said an initial NATO expansion is best limited to those countries that are "most qualified" to enter, while leaving the door open to further expansions later.
Referring to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said today that "there is a consensus around the three, but there is not a consensus around the others," and that invitations would go to those countries where there was consensus.
While Mr. Clinton hoped to reach agreement before the Madrid meeting, Mr. Berger noted that the new Prime Minister of Britain, Tony Blair, now supports the American position.
In his news conference, Mr. Clinton also defended his policies toward China and the Middle East. He called for the House of Representatives, in a vote expected this week, to support his extension of a normal trading status with China, arguing that "we shouldn't assume bad faith on the part of the Chinese" in their commitment to provide Hong Kong "a high degree of autonomy."
Still, over Chinese objections, the group of eight countries here -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia -- urged Beijing to guarantee Hong Kong's "fundamental freedoms and the rule of law," its independent economic and monetary system, and to hold "democratic elections" for a new legislature "as soon as possible."
The final communique, in its section on the Middle East, also implicitly criticized Washington. "The peace process faces a crisis, and we are determined to re-inject momentum into it," the document said. But Mr. Clinton rejected calls from President Jacques Chirac of France and other leaders to get more visibly involved in pushing the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.
A senior American official said today that the refusal of Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to go to the Middle East showed courage. "The tough choice she and the President are making is to sit tight and wait for the parties to realize that they must take the steps necessary to get the process back on track."
Mr. Clinton noted that the Middle East is at "a pivotal moment" and added: "You should never believe that just because you don't see high-level air transport between Washington and the Middle East that nothing is going on from our point of view. I spend quite a bit of time on this every week."
And he repeated his position that to restore confidence, the Palestinans must "express clear opposition to terrorism" and commitment to the peace effort, while the Israelis "need to show in specific ways" that they are committed to the existing Oslo peace accords and will not try to undermine them unilaterally.
The summit meeting was notable for its inclusion of Russia as a full member in all sessions except a one-hour monetary meeting on Saturday, and Mr. Clinton again praised Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and the Russian people today for pursuing a path toward democracy, market development and integration with the West.
Mr. Yeltsin, who underwent heart surgery last year, skipped last night's boisterous entertainment because of fatigue. He did meet with Mr. Chirac today and participated in the closing sessions, although he appeared grimmer and more pasty.
Ms. Albright spent some of her time here exploring how the former Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, might be brought to international justice for the genocidal crimes his government committed in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, officials said. Mr. Clinton said that "there probably should be an international war crimes tribunal" that is permanent.
But the main topic of contention was the environment and greenhouse gases, with Mr. Chirac, described by American officials as "prickly and aggressive," pushing hard for a specific American commitment to match Europe's. The European Union agreed last week to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases to 15 percent of its 1990 levels by 2010.
Mr. Clinton refused to commit to a specific figure here, though Washington is supposed to do so in six months at an international conference on the issue in Kyoto, Japan. American officials say the European demands are "unreasonable" and do not reflect American conditions.
Mr. Chirac, in his news conference, shrugged and said: "Americans are major polluters. The average American is responsible for emitting three times the amount of greenhouse gas as the average Frenchman." But Mr. Chirac said that European unity had at least pushed the Americans to agree on 2010 for "substantial reductions," if not yet on a percentage.
On Bosnia, Mr. Clinton said he was pleased that the nations here agreed on pursuing all aspects of the Dayton accords, including the return of refugees, freedom of movement for all ethnic groups and the punishment of war criminals. They also agreed that aid to the parties should be conditional on their fulfillment of those promises.
Mr. Clinton also repeated his position that the current military mission in Bosnia should be over in July 1998. European officials like Mr. Blair have said they believe that Bosnia will still require an international military presence after July 1998, but Clinton officials still say they "fully expect" that American soliders will leave then.
The communique pleased the Americans by calling for a fairer reassessment of United Nations dues and supported Mr. Clinton's initiative to help African countries by opening markets and reducing duties. But the Europeans also insisted that market access and capitalism could not replace direct aid, and the French and Japanese agreed to work together on their own aid and investment initiative in Africa.
Mr. Chirac said he was glad Washington was now thinking about Africa, while Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, speaking sarcastically, said he welcomed "America's discovery of Africa."

Political Wish List Issued at Denver Summit
The leaders of the eight countries that represent half the world's economic activity ended a summit meeting with a call for democratic elections in Hong Kong, new energy to break the Middle East stalemate, a commitment to peace in Bosnia and new aid for Africa. A1
 
Mexican Labor Leader Mourned
Mexican Government officials and labor leaders turned out to pay their last respects to Fidel Velazquez Sanchez, a 97-year-old labor patriarch. Notably absent, however, was any outpouring of grief from rank-and-file workers. Many have criticized the legacy of low wages left by Mr. Velazquez and predicted a new struggle to break the bonds between unions and the Government. A3 

Leaders Meet on Environment
World leaders gather today at the United Nations to take stock of the global environment five years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. A growing number of experts warn that government subsidies to industries not only squander money that could be spent cleaning up the plant but also damage it through waste and the underpricing of resources. A3
 
Italian to Be U.N. Crime Fighter
One of Italy's top experts on the Mafia has been named the United Nations' leading official on international crime. Pino Arlacchi, 46, a member of the Italian Senate, will become director of the United Nations offices in Vienna, where its anti-drug program is based. Mr. Arlacchi said his duties would include investigating financial empires suspected of thriving on illegal profits. A5
 
General Says He Saw Pol Pot
A senior Cambodian general said that he had seen the Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, and that he expected him to be handed over soon to the Government. The sighting of Pol Pot by an outsider would be the first since 1981, although it could not be verified. Pol Pot, who oversaw the deaths of a million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979, is reportedly being held by his own soldiers at his headquarters near the Thai border. A6
 
Pakistan Angered Over Fugitive
Some Pakistanis are expressing rising anger at their Government a week after a Pakistani fugitive wanted in the 1993 killings of two C.I.A. officers was hurriedly flown to the United States without a court hearing. Government silence about the capture and export of the suspect, Mir Amal Kansi, 33, has fueled the criticism, and several leading newspapers have published editorials demanding an explanation. A9
 
Spain's Socialists Pick Leader
Spain's Socialists chose their Parliamentary spokesman, Joaquin Almunia, to replace former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez as head of the party. The vote followed a fierce internal struggle set off by Mr. Gonzalez's announcement on Friday that he was stepping down as party chief. (Reuters)
 
Seeking to Extradite Pol Pot
Visitors to the a museum in Phnom Penh gazed at a bust of Pol Pot, who oversaw a million deaths when he was leader of the Khmer Rouge. He is reportedly being held by his own troops in Cambodia. The United States and its allies are seeking the extradition of Pol Pot using Canada's rare universal law against genocide, officials said. A1
 
NATIONAL A10-13, B6-9
 
Lax Enforcement Charged In Low-Income Housing
The Clinton Administration says it intends to reverse decades of lax housing oversight by driving out landlords who profit as properties languish. Millions of low-income Americans live in subsidized housing units built in an effort to provide decent and secure housing for people who can least afford it. But officials admit that some landlords grew wealthy at the expense of the people they promised to serve. A1
 
Integration Re-Examined
The N.A.A.C.P. is expected to debate its traditional stand in favor of racially mixed schools at its national convention next month in Pittsburgh. The organization began to rethink its advocacy of public school integration following the ouster of some local chapter directors who expressed views that were at odds with the organization's policy. A1
 
Clinton Cautious on Accord
President Clinton encouraged critics of the historic tobacco agreement to regard it as a starting point, rather than as a finished product, and said that he feared that it might hobble the Government's regulation of nicotine. But the President said he was pleased with the reception even the critics of the proposed legal settlement had given it. A1

Groups Press a Drug War
The Rev. Art Cashwell put up a poster marking a house as a drug den as he and others in Hammond, Ind., took anti-drug messages into an area they suspected was a source of the problem. Some experts on constitutional law say the strategy may have violated privacy rights. Marchers sang religious hymns as Police officers and officials escorted the groups on what they called Operation Holy Ground. A10

End-of-Life Guide Issued
The American Medical Association, which opposes doctor-assisted suicide, issued guidelines on dying with dignity including discussing end-of-life care with patients. A12
 
Life Returns After Floods
Grand Forks, N.D., celebrates a "Bouncing Back Bash" today at the University of North Dakota's Memorial Stadium marking the return of life to something like normal after 50,000 residents were forced to leave their homes this spring during the worst flooding in decades. A10

Rural Schools Feel Slighted In Division of State Aid
School officials in a number of small New Jersey towns say they will sue the state, claiming that a school financing formula hurts rural school children. Educators there complain that their students have been shortchanged since Gov. Christine Todd Whitman sent millions to urban schools. They say their buildings are old and battered and they say they can't afford to meet new state curriculum standards. A1

Journey of a Mental Patient
James Velez represents the really hard cases that are part of the exodus of the developmentally disabled from America's institutions. By luck, a small Manhattan social-services agency called Job Path nursed the mighty hope that he could have his own ordinary life in his own home, maybe even college and a real job, something almost unheard of for someone of such profound disability. B1
 
Pilot Dies in Air Show Crash
Two small planes competing in a race collided in midair and crashed in flames at a Long Island air show, killing one pilot and critically injuring the other. The single-engine planes, each with one pilot aboard, were among four circling a midair racecourse when they collided, burst into flames and crashed to the ground around 4:10 P.M. No spectators were in the area. B5
 
Threat to a Subway Deal
Squabbles among New York State lawmakers threaten to postpone or even unravel a $1.4 billion deal to buy the next generation of New York City subway trains, which would be the biggest single capital investment ever made in the transit system. The subway purchase could be the first of many projects delayed. B3

Women Find Athlete Within
Thousands of women across the country did not grow up playing sports but came to discover their athletic selves well into adulthood. As celebrations continue in recognition of the 25th anniversary of legislation requiring fair opportunities for girls to play sports in school, it may be the women who predate Title IX who best illustrate its social impact and provide poignant testimony to the profound role of sports in a woman's life.

Credit Report Bill on Agenda

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Under Federal law, consumers in New Jersey, as in all states, are entitled to a free copy of their credit report if they are unemployed, on welfare or have been refused credit. A bill that the State Assembly is to consider today, however, would entitle consumers to one free credit report a year without any conditions.
The measure's co-sponsor, Senator Wayne R. Bryant, Democrat of Camden, said the bill would allow consumers to review and challenge any errors on a report before applying for a mortgage, credit card or other line of credit. 
 But the New Jersey Retail Merchants Association opposes the bill, asserting that it would force credit reporting companies to give their services away free and pass the cost onto the stores that buy the reports. The State Senate has already approved the bill, and if it is passed by the Assembly, it would head to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's desk.
Another bill before the Assembly today would increase penalties for rapists who give their victims drugs, like sedatives, before assaulting them.

HEADLINE: Anquished Debate: Should Doctors Help Their Patients Die?

 BODY:
By the end of the month, the Supreme Court will rule on a wrenching social issue -- whether terminally ill Americans have the right to a doctor's help in killing themselves. Earlier this year, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Marcia Angell, executive editor, discussed reasons to legalize physician-assisted suicide. This month, in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Herbert Hendin of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and his co-authors described problems they found with physician-assisted suicide in the Netherlands. Following are excerpts.
 I BEGIN with the generally accepted premise that one of the most important ethical principles in medicine is respect for each patient's autonomy, and that when this principle conflicts with others, it should almost always take precedence. This premise is incorporated into our laws governing medical practice and research, including the requirement of informed consent to any treatment. . . . 
 A second starting point is the recognition that death is not fair and is often cruel. Some people die quickly, and others die slowly but peacefully. Some find personal or religious meaning in the process. . . . But others . . . may die by inches and in great anguish, despite every effort of their doctors and nurses. Although nearly all pain can be relieved, some cannot, and other symptoms . . . are even more difficult to control. In addition, dying sometimes holds great indignities and existential suffering. Patients who happen to require some treatment to sustain their lives, such as assisted ventilation or dialysis, can hasten death by having the life-sustaining treatment withdrawn, but those who are not receiving life-sustaining treatment may desperately need help they cannot now get. . . .
Below I list several of the more important arguments against physician-assisted suicide and discuss why I believe they are . . . unpersuasive.
Assisted suicide is a form of killing, which is always wrong. In contrast, withdrawing life-sustaining treatment simply allows the disease to take its course. . . . I believe . . . that these distinctions are too doctor-centered and not sufficiently patient-centered. We should ask ourselves not so much whether the doctor's role is passive or active, but whether the patient's role is passive or active. . . . assisted suicide, by definition, cannot occur without the patient's knowledge and participation. Therefore, it must be active, that is to say, voluntary. If the loaded term "kill" is to be used, it is not the doctor who kills, but the patient. . . .
Assisted suicide is not necessary. All suffering can be relieved if care givers are sufficiently skillful and compassionate. . . . I have no doubt that if expert palliative care were available to everyone who needed it, there would be few requests for assisted suicide. Even under the best of circumstances, however, there will always be a few patients whose suffering simply cannot be adequately alleviated. . . . Good comfort care and the availability of assisted suicide are no more mutually exclusive than good cardiologic care and the availability of heart transplantation.
Permitting assisted suicide would put us on a moral "slippery slope." Although in itself assisted suicide might be acceptable, it would lead inexorably to involuntary euthanasia. It is impossible to avoid slippery slopes in medicine. . . . The issue is how and where to find a purchase. For example, we accept the right of proxies to terminate life-sustaining treatment, despite the obvious potential for abuse, because the reasons for doing so outweigh the risks. We hope our procedures will safeguard patients. In the case of assisted suicide, its voluntary nature is the best protection against sliding down a slippery slope, but we also need to insure that the request is thoughtful and freely made. . . .
Assisted suicide would be a threat to the economically and socially vulnerable. The poor, disabled, and elderly might be coerced to request it. Admittedly, overburdened families or cost-conscious doctors might pressure vulnerable patients to request suicide, but similar wrongdoing is at least as likely in the case of withdrawing life-sustaining treatment. . . . Yet there is no evidence of widespread abuse.
Depressed patients would seek physician-assisted suicide rather than help for their depression. . . . Dying patients who request assisted suicide and seem depressed should certainly be strongly encouraged to accept psychiatric treatment, but I do not believe that competent patients should be required to accept it as a condition of suicide. On the other hand, doctors would not be required to comply with all requests. . . .
Doctors should never participate in taking life. If there is to be assisted suicide, doctors must not be involved. . . . Like others, I find that position too abstract. The highest ethical imperative of doctors should be to provide care in whatever way best serves patients' interests, in accord with each patient's wishes, not with a theoretical commitment to preserve life no matter what the cost in suffering. If a patient requests help with suicide and the doctor believes the request is appropriate, requiring someone else to provide the assistance would be a form of abandonment. . . .
Physician-assisted suicide may occasionally be warranted, but it should remain illegal. If doctors risk prosecution, they will think twice before assisting with suicide. This argument wrongly shifts the focus from the patient to the doctor. Instead of reflecting the condition and wishes of patients, assisted suicide would reflect the courage and compassion of their doctors.
People do not need assistance to commit suicide. With enough determination, they can do it themselves. This is perhaps the cruelest of the arguments against physician-assisted suicide. Many patients at the end of life are, in fact, physically unable to commit suicide on their own. Others lack the resources to do so. It has sometimes been suggested that they can simply stop eating and drinking and kill themselves that way. Although this method has been described as peaceful under certain conditions, no one should count on that. The fact is that this argument leaves most patients to their suffering. MARCIA ANGELL
 FOR two decades, both physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia have been given legal sanction in the Netherlands. In response to domestic and international concern about their policies, the Dutch Government appointed a commission that oversaw a study of the practice of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia in 1990. That study . . . was largely replicated in a 1995 study. . . .
In 1996, the investigators published a report of their new findings in Dutch and summarized their work in two articles in The New England Journal of Medicine. . . . These reports have given a favorable interpretation . . . by declaring that since matters have not grown worse there is no evidence "physicians in the Netherlands are moving down a slippery slope." That conclusion is misleading. . . . Virtually every guideline set up by the Dutch -- a voluntary, well-considered, persistent request; intolerable suffering that cannot be relieved; consultation; and reporting of cases -- has failed to protect patients or has been modified or violated. . . . For example, in the 1990 study, 50 percent of physicians reported that they considered it appropriate to suggest euthanasia to patients. Neither the physicians nor the study's investigators seem to acknowledge how much the voluntariness of the process may be compromised by such a suggestion. . . .
 Underreporting continues to be a serious problem. . . . The 1995 interviews with physicians revealed that in only 11 percent of the unreported cases was there consultation with another physician. Moreover, almost 20 percent of the physicians' most recent unreported cases involved ending of a life without the patient's consent. Such cases . . . were virtually never reported.
The most alarming concern to arise from the Dutch studies has been the documentation of cases in which patients who have not given their consent have their lives ended by physicians. The 1990 study revealed that in 0.8 percent of the deaths (more than 1,000 cases) in the Netherlands each year, physicians admitted they actively caused death without the explicit consent of the patient. The 1995 figure is 0.7 percent (fewer than 1,000 cases). . . . In both studies, however, about a quarter of physicians stated that they had terminated the lives of patients without an explicit request from the patient to do so and a third more of the physicians could conceive of doing so. . . .
The Dutch investigators minimize the significance of the number of deaths without consent by explaining that the patients were incompetent. But in the 1995 study, 21 percent of the individuals classified as "patients whose lives were ended without explicit request" were competent; in the 1990 study, 37 percent were competent. We are not told what percentage of those patients who were given pain medication intended to end their lives without discussing it with them were competent, but analysis of the data for opioid administration indicates that it is likely to be at least 20 percent. . . . An illustration given by the attorney for the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society of why it was often necessary for physicians to end the lives of competent patients without their consent was the case of a nun whose physician ended her life a few days before she would have died because she was in excruciating pain but her religious convictions did not permit her to ask for death. In another case, a Dutch patient with disseminated breast cancer who had said she did not want euthanasia had her life ended because, in the physician's words: "It could have taken another week before she died. I just needed this bed."
Other studies conducted in the Netherlands have indicated how voluntariness is compromised, alternatives are not presented, and the criterion of unrelievable suffering is bypassed. A few examples help to illustrate our concerns.
A wife who no longer wished to care for her sick husband gave him a choice between euthanasia and admission to a home for the chronically ill. The man, afraid of being left to the mercy of strangers in an unfamiliar place, chose to be killed; the doctor, although aware of the coercion, ended the man's life. A healthy 50-year-old woman, who lost her son recently to cancer, became depressed, refused treatment for her depression, and said she would accept help only in dying, was assisted in suicide by her psychiatrist within four months of her son's death. Her refusal of treatment was considered by her physician and the Dutch courts to make her suffering unrelievable. . . .
From our point of view there has been an erosion of medical standards in the care of terminally ill patients in the Netherlands. . . .
Given legal sanction, euthanasia, intended originally for the exceptional case, has become an accepted way of dealing with serious or terminal illness in the Netherlands. In the process, palliative care is one of the casualties, while hospice care lags behind that of other countries. For the Dutch, accepting the option of euthanasia seems to be costing them the opportunity to take advantage of the developments in palliative care of the past decade. For other countries, knowledge of these developments still remains to be disseminated and implemented. We should accept that challenge and avoid making the Dutch mistake.

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK: Michael L. Dertouzos;
Unlikely Warrior Leads the Charge For Simpler PC

BYLINE: By JAMES GORMAN 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
DR. MICHAEL L. DERTOUZOS, head of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computer laboratory, is railing against personal computers. "You want to use them as boat anchors," he says. "People should really revolt. I think we should take up arms."
The question that springs to mind is "What do you mean, 'We'?" Dr. Dertouzos, 60, does not buy his computers on sale at CompUSA, or sit for 20 minutes on hold waiting for tech support to help him figure out how to hook up his new printer. He has been running the M.I.T. laboratory, which now employs about 500 people, for more than 20 years. Many, if not most, of the people who created the Internet and today's computers and software came out of that laboratory, where Dr. Dertouzos and others now run the consortium that sets standards for the World Wide Web. 
 Nonetheless, a computer will not boot any faster, even for an M.I.T. wizard, and in a new book, "What Will Be" (HarperEdge), and in a recent interview in his M.I.T. office, Dr. Dertouzos detailed what is wrong with the mix of machine and software that offers the average consumer checkbook programs, Internet access and headaches. In essence, he says, the personal computer is just too complicated. Among his specific complaints about the PC are these:
*It has too many features, too few of which are the ones the user wants at any given moment.
*There is too much to learn. Dr. Dertouzos says his software manuals for the programs on his desktop computer are equal in length to an entire multi-volume Encyclopedia Britannica.
*The machines often take charge, overruling the desires of the users. Dr. Dertouzos offers the example of being forced to accept a time-consuming upgrade to airline reservation software over the Internet when what he really wanted to do was use the software to make an emergency airline reservation.
*Enormous programming effort and vastly increased sizes of, for instance, word processors are devoted to trivial improvements in appearance or presentation.
Calling today's machine "user friendly" because of its endless choice of fonts and screen patterns, Dr. Dertouzos writes, "is tantamount to dressing a chimpanzee in a green hospital gown and earnestly parading it as a surgeon."
It might seem to the average computer buyer that these are fighting words, that Dr. Dertouzos is some kind of turncoat, saying what other techies (the world of Dr. Dertouzos is divided into techies and humies, or humanists) fear to say. Not so.
"Today's machines are just too complex to be accessible," another M.I.T. guru and sometime rival of Dr. Dertouzos, Dr. Nicholas Negroponte, just complained, acting somewhat shocked, in his column in the July issue of Wired magazine, home of all things cool and computable. Dr. Negroponte, head of the university's media lab and author of the recent "Being Digital," wrote: "Is it time for a strike or a users' cartel? You bet it is."
And other experts are ready to chime in. "Personal computers have always been abysmal devices," said Paul Saffo, a former student of Dr. Dertouzos and head of the Institute for the Future, a nonprofit group in Menlo Park, Calif., that specializes in management consulting. Over time, he said, they have become much more powerful, but not any better.
Dr. Leonard Kleinrock, a member of the computer science department at the University of California at Los Angeles who is a longtime friend of Dr. Dertouzos, coined the term "feature shock" years ago to describe what happens when people get new computers all filled up with things that they never wanted in the first place.
Even Jonathan Roberts, director of product management for Windows at Microsoft, arguably the source of some of the complications Dr. Dertouzos and others deplore, is apologetic. The biggest complaint that Microsoft gets, Mr. Roberts said, is that "you have something that worked and then you install something else and what you had doesn't work."
The sour notes from Dr. Dertouzos are particularly surprising in that he is a thoroughgoing technological optimist. "Toys, toys, more toys!" is the motto of his laboratory, he says, and it is one he embraces at work and play. He drives a 12-cylinder BMW. He designs equipment for his 37-foot power boat.
Dr. Dertouzos traces his optimism partly to growing up in Athens during World War II, while his father, who was an admiral in the Greek Navy, was in Egypt. After the war, other problems seemed small. Besides, he said, "It's easy to be a pessimist." He came to the United States as a Fulbright scholar in 1954. "I ended up in Arkansas," he said. And, in a true display of optimism, he added, "It was a great way to enter America."
He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from M.I.T. in 1964, after spending some time in research and development. He started teaching at the university immediately, and quickly founded a high-tech company making early computer terminals in 1968. He sold that company in 1974 when he became the head of the M.I.T. laboratory. He now frequents the national and international halls of power in industry and government. He is currently co-chairman of the World Economic Forum, a business-financed research organization in Geneva.
Even when he is criticizing computers Dr. Dertouzos likes to point to the new and wonderful things these machines do, like enable users to cruise the World Wide Web. And when he complains of the sad state of computers now, the critique is only a prelude to how good the future will be. In effect, he is saying that the emperor is naked and shivering -- right now. But the court clothiers are aware of the danger of pneumonia, so next year's suit will really be warm and comfy.
Dr. Dertouzos looks forward, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, to a world of intelligent kitchens that plan menus, cook meals and tell people what is in the pantry, to smart cars, smart closets that pick out matching clothes, even to a smart sink that reminds people to use a dental pick because of their risk of periodontal disease. Fortunately, the sink would be difficult to design and very expensive. Underlying all these fantasies is the notion of computers' becoming both smarter and easier to use.
Some of his friends say that his political skills, which have made the M.I.T. laboratory so successful, may have tempered some of the criticisms he levels in the book. And Dr. Dertouzos does not spend his time pointing the finger of blame.
While Dr. Kleinrock is quick to say that "anything Microsoft does makes it worse," Dr. Dertouzos concentrates on the fact that the industry is in its infancy. Dr. Dertouzos compares today's personal computer to the first airplanes, familiar from old films that show them laboring to escape the ground and then crashing in a heap. Computers crash, and are difficult to use, largely because despite rapid technological change, they are still very new.
Another problem he sees is that engineers and programmers love to add a new twist here and a new capability there. Mr. Roberts at Microsoft admits, "It's much more difficult to make the everyday easier than it is to add a new feature." But the new features sell, Dr. Dertouzos points out. The marketplace, in the shape of the consumer, buys bells and whistles. "We're the culprit in that," Dr. Dertouzos says.
Indeed, says Dr. Saffo, "we are unwitting co-conspirators" in a system in which poorly tested products are sent to market for the buyers to test. In a recent study done as part of the Computer Industry Policy Project at Stanford University, Abron Barr and William Miller came up with evidence to show what observers of the industry have said all along. To make money with software, a company must get its product on the market first, and fix it later. Early examples of software, like a new "Word" or "Quicken," are called beta versions.
Dr. Saffo observed, "We ask users to pay for the privilege of being beta testers." And the users do pay. For the moment, the economics of computers are such, Dr. Saffo said, that "I would fire the C.E.O. of any company that held off its product until it was ready."
The answer, Dr. Dertouzos said, is that consumers must demand simple, usable machines that work more like cars than science projects. Turn them on and drive. No one would buy a minivan that had a 600-page manual on how to drive it. Why should people do that with computers?
One way to achieve simplicity is to bury deeper what the computer does, so that, for instance, a user can ask it questions in common speech. At M.I.T., a system called Galaxy, being developed by a team under the lab's associate director, Dr. Victor Zue, can answer questions posed to it about weather, airline reservations and restaurants in particular locations. It has been in the works for 20 years and so far has cost about $30 million.
Another approach suggested by Dr. Dertouzos is to allow users to tailor their computers to themselves, allowing them, in effect, to become programmers. Of course, then the programming has to be simplified, or else things are made worse, not better.
Simplicity is a bit like marital fidelity, in that while everyone is in favor of it in principle, practice varies. Microsoft, for instance, says Mr. Roberts, is on the simplicity train. In the next version of Windows there will be a feature called "on now," which will make a computer come on right away, as they used to 15 years ago, instead of taking minutes, as they do now.
But another so-called improvement that Mr. Roberts mentioned seems to go directly against Dr. Dertouzos' ideas. Users will be able to tell "where a file was installed." Dr. Dertouzos' contention is that users do not even want to know words like "file" and "install."
"I'm really quite pessimistic," Dr. Kleinrock said, about improvements in personal computers. And Dr. Saffo said that in truth the problems were never solved. Technologies change so fast that they become obsolete before they mature. Computers are not likely to get simpler. Something unforeseen is likely to replace them.
For the moment, Dr. Saffo said, he is pleased to see Dr. Dertouzos criticizing his intellectual offspring, while he paints a rosy picture of the future. Dr. Dertouzos trained many of the people who have made the current computers what they are, Dr. Saffo said. "It's the sign of a good teacher to criticize the work of his students," he said. "He's playing exactly the role he should play."

HEADLINE: The Basques Get Modern;
A Gleaming New Guggenheim for Grimy Bilbao

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: BILBAO, Spain

 BODY:
Just months from its inauguration, with one work of art in place, several interior walls unfinished and the entrance plaza slippery with mud, the spectacular new Guggenheim Bilbao Museum designed by Frank O. Gehry is still something of a work-in-progress. Yet already, it seems, the $100 million building has won the hearts of many inhabitants of this industrial port city in Spain's northern Basque region.
It was not always so. At first, many local taxpayers balked at the idea of their money being spent on what was called a "pharaonic" project. Local artists argued that the money should go to, well, local artists; opposition politicians said the money could be better used for schools and hospitals; newspapers warned that local culture would be controlled by an "imperialist" American foundation that was being paid a huge sum for the privilege. 
 Further, this grimy city had no tradition of devotion to the arts. Thanks to nearby iron-ore deposits, it became the center of Spain's steel industry in the late 19th century. A busy port and new shipyards added to its prosperity, which in turn spawned profitable banking and insurance sectors. For Bilbaoans, hard work and moneymaking have always taken precedence over beauty and style.
When the Guggenheim project was brought up for debate, however, the Basque Government had more than culture in mind. It argued that, after a grim 15 years in which the closing of steel plants, shipyards and port facilities had swollen unemployment, the museum would serve as both motor and symbol of economic revival and urban renewal. It also appealed to Basque nationalist pride, promising that a world-class museum showing the best of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation's collection and drawing perhaps 500,000 visitors a year would put the city on the map.
Today, Bilbaoans seem persuaded. Even the unorthodox terms of the 75-year agreement creating the museum are no longer much of an issue. The Basques agreed to cover the $100 million construction cost, to create a $50 million acquisitions fund, to pay a one-time $20 million fee to the Guggenheim and to subsidize the museum's $12 million annual budget. In exchange, the Guggenheim would manage the institution, rotate parts of its own permanent collection through here and organize temporary shows.
Perhaps even more surprising, given the unconventional appearance of Mr. Gehry's multifaceted stone, glass and titanium-covered museum, many residents already appear genuinely fond of what one businesswoman affectionately called the beast now poised on the banks of the Nervion River against a backdrop of traditional 19th-century buildings. Not long ago, Bilbao was trapped in the past; now it is reaching for a designer future.
In that, it is emulating Barcelona and Seville. Using the occasions of the Summer Olympics in Barcelona and the universal exhibition in Seville, both in 1992, these cities spent heavily on new highways, bridges and cultural institutions, many of them designed by top international architects. At the time, Bilbao felt left out; now it is rushing to catch up.
Two new bridges over the Nervion have just opened, one of them an ultramodern suspension bridge for pedestrians designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, who is also building a new city airport. A subway system designed by Sir Norman Foster of Britain opened 18 months ago and has already relieved traffic. A low-lying river bank known as Abandoibarra, long occupied by factories, warehouses and a railroad depot, is being redeveloped by the Argentine-born architect Cesar Pelli.
Even before its official opening in early October, however, it is the museum that has captured the city's imagination. Standing at the eastern end of Abandoibarra, facing the river on one side and the city on the other, it resembles a vast free-form sculpture with a jumble of titanium-clad cubes rising from its center. Two rectangular gallery wings are covered in Spanish limestone, but a third, its titanium exterior giving it a shimmering silver look, stretches no less than 430 feet beside the river.
"The idea of this looking like a boat was my response to the river," Mr. Gehry explained, pointing to the gigantic gallery wing that curves under the Principes de Espana Bridge. "The other side, more fragmented and covered with stone, is more in scale with the city. The whole thing is about fitting the building into Bilbao. So for me it's about the imagery of the river and the imagery of the city."
Obviously a positive local response to the museum is crucial, but Bilbaoans have felt reassured that international experts also like it. On May 31, coinciding with the presentation of the annual Pritzker Architecture Prize in the unfinished museum, a group of artists, architects and wealthy patrons of the arts toured the building and came away impressed.
"This building is fantastic," said Sverre Fenh, the Norwegian architect who was this year's Pritzker laureate. "It's a sketch, an instant sketch that has been realized. I am very moved by the freedom of creation and the freedom of poetry built into the creation." Christian de Portzamparc, a leading French architect who won the Pritzker Prize in 1994, described the building simply as "a masterpiece."
The 257,000-square-foot museum is entered through a lobby that leads to a dramatic 165-foot-high atrium, one and a half times the height of the rotunda of Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York. The atrium, which Mr. Gehry has nicknamed "The Flower" because it culminates in a series of angled geometrical shapes, serves as the organizing center for the entire museum.
Glass-covered elevators and staircases cling to its walls, while balconies on the second and third floors lead to the more traditional spaces. To one side of the atrium, the long barrel-roofed gallery known as "The Boat" opens up like the mouth of a huge whale. And it is there that the museum's first art work, "Snake" by Richard Serra, has been installed. Yet even this 172-ton steel sculpture comprising three serpentine curves 13 feet high and 100 feet long is dwarfed by the gallery.
Whether the architecture will overwhelm the art is a question that Mr. Gehry has been asked before. "The building has to have wonderful art but it also has to be a draw," he said. "This was part of my mandate. This has a sense of place in relation to the city and other buildings. I believe artists want that too. They want a building to have importance in the community."
The museum will open with "The Guggenheim Museums and the Art of This Century," a 300-piece overview of 20th-century art from Cubism to new media art. Most pieces will come from the Guggenheim's own collection, but Bilbao has also acquired paintings by Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still and has commissioned new works by Francesco Clemente, Anselm Kiefer and Jenny Holzer as well as Mr. Serra.
Not on show, though, will be the painting most wanted by the museum. In January, it submitted a 65-page request to the Reina Sofia Art Center in Madrid for the loan of "Guernica," Picasso's landmark painting of the 1937 bombing by Nazi aircraft of the small Basque town of Guernica, a few miles south of here. In May, the request was turned down on the ground that the painting was too fragile to travel, a decision that was promptly seen in the Basque region as politically motivated.
"I was disappointed by the reasons given," said Thomas Krens, the director of the Guggenheim Foundation, showing a visitor a special gallery reserved for "Guernica" in the hope that the decision will be reversed. "The painting has traveled to 35 institutions. It is part of the history and blood of this region."
Still, eager to acquire a local identity, the museum has begun acquiring works by contemporary Spanish artists, although not without stirring controversy. For example, it has bought works by the country's two best known living artists, Antoni Tapies and Eduardo Chillida, but it has so far overlooked Jorge Oteiza, an outspoken critic of the Guggenheim Bilbao who was once the Basque region's most prominent sculptor.
Recently, Mr. Serra took it upon himself to serve as mediator, inviting the 90-year-old sculptor to the museum to view "Snake" and then admiring Mr. Oteiza's works in the local Fine Arts Museum. Later, over dinner, sitting beside Carmen Gimenez, the Guggenheim's curator of 20th-century art, Mr. Serra urged Mr. Krens to buy at least one Oteiza as a way of making peace with the old man.
Mr. Krens said that Oteiza was already on the acquisition list, but Mr. Serra insisted, demanding a written commitment. Finally, with a sigh, Mr. Krens took out a pen and wrote on the tablecloth: "Carmen, Buy 1 Oteiza. T. Krens. 30 May 1997." As dinner broke up, Mr. Serra collected the tablecloth and triumphantly handed it to Ms. Gimenez. The artist as diplomat, he looked pleased with himself.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Pound's Surge and Comment By Japan's Chief Hurt Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday, hurt by a surge in the British pound and a late afternoon stock market plunge that was attributed to remarks by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan.
Speaking at a luncheon in New York, Mr. Hashimoto said that Japan's continued purchases of United States Treasury bonds might depend on exchange-rate stability. 
 Since Japan has accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Treasuries, the remarks were perceived as a threat by Japan to sell Treasuries, which would flood the market and increase the supply of dollars.
An aide said later, however, that Mr. Hashimoto was not threatening to sell bonds, Dow Jones reported. Rather, he intended to point out that Japan had not yielded to the temptation to sell bonds, despite exchange-rate fluctuations.
Indeed, some traders had wondered whether his remarks might have been misinterpreted.
"There's no question if the Bank of Japan liquidated Treasuries and sold dollars, it would have a short-term negative impact," said John McCarthy, senior vice president of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. "He's pointing out the obvious, but the fact he's making it obvious is a bit disconcerting."
The dollar traded as high as 115.30 yen before falling on Mr. Hashimoto's remarks to settle in New York at 114.95 yen, but that was still higher than its 114.81-yen close on Friday. The dollar cost 1.7195 marks, down from 1.7275.
The pound cost $1.6725, up from $1.6559 Friday and its highest level since Jan. 16. The pound also reached its highest level against the mark in five years.
The pound's allure on the prospect of higher interest rates in Britain weakened the dollar as the day progressed. Speculation intensified that the Bank of England was likely to raise rates by a half-percentage point at its next policy-making meeting July 10, because of inflationary pressure in Britain's economy.
"We've had an interest rate play in the pound," said Debra Larsen, assistant vice president of foreign exchange at the New York branch of Commerzbank. "The market is expecting a much more aggressive hike."

HEADLINE: Europe Faults U.S. at Talks On Ecology

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 23

 BODY:
With Tony Blair, the new British Prime Minister, in the rhetorical vanguard, European heads of state came before a gloom-and-doom conference of the world's nations today and demanded ever more forceful actions by the United States to confront environmental trends like global warming.
One after another, as delegates reviewed how the world has fallen short of the ambitious environmental goals set by the United Nations five years ago, the leaders of the European Union repeated the message that they had delivered to the Clinton Administration in private meetings over the weekend: that they do not believe that the United States is being aggressive enough in seeking steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 
 This time their audience was dominated by leaders of the less developed countries. They are at the United Nations this week to assess progress, or the lack of it, since a United Nations conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 put the threat of global warming and other issues of environment and development at the top of the international agenda.
With the poorer countries in mind, Japan, which like the United States is taking a cautious approach on reducing greenhouse gases, and Britain, which unlike the United States is calling for aggressive actions, both pledged substantial new commitments of aid to the developing world to help their economies grow without causing even more pollution from burning fossil fuels. And Germany, Brazil, South Africa and Singapore called for a new worldwide environmental organization to reinvigorate the United Nations' lackluster performance.
Perhaps the warmest applause of the day came for Mr. Blair, who pledged Britain's willingness to do even more to reduce greenhouse gases than the rest of Europe has promised, and who bluntly, if indirectly, criticized the United States.
Saying that "some of the great industrialized nations" have not achieved their past promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Mr. Blair said Britain, which under a Conservative Government changed coal policies and kept its promises on carbon emissions, would do even more now that the Labor Party is at the helm.
"Our targets will not be taken seriously by the poorer countries until the richer countries are meeting them," he said.
"The biggest responsibility falls on those countries with the biggest emissions," he said, in an unmistakable reference to the United States. "We in Europe have put our cards on the table. It is time for the special pleading to stop and for others to follow suit."
President Clinton is to address the gathering on Thursday, amid intense criticism from environmental advocates who say his Administration is not taking a firm enough stance in negotiations, scheduled to be concluded in December in Kyoto, Japan, aimed at setting binding targets for reducing greenhouse gases.
But the Administration is under pressure in Congress to do nothing that would impose costs on powerful industries, or that would curtail the use of fossil fuels by wealthy countries but not poorer ones.
And its negotiators have been making another argument: that it is simply impossible to meet the ambitious timetables proposed by the Europeans, who want to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 15 percent from the levels of 1990, and to do so by the year 2010. At Rio, industrial countries pledged to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, but few countries have succeeded.
Vice President Al Gore, who for years has called global warming one of the most serious threats facing the planet, welcomed the delegates with a brief call to "roll up our sleeves and go to work" on the undone business of Rio, but spoke only two sentences about the negotiations on global warming.
"Kyoto presents a critical opportunity for the world to forge an agreement with binding emissions limits, flexibility in meeting those targets and the participation of all nations," he said. "We must unite in our resolve to meet the challenge of climate change."
President Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and other European leaders echoed the complaint against the Americans for not proposing definite timetables and specific limits for reducing greenhouse gases.
At a news conference, other members of Mr. Blair's Government muted somewhat the implied criticism of the White House.
"I don't think we have a problem with the American Administration," said Robin Cook, Britain's Foreign Secretary. "The American public have not come to terms with their energy consumption."

The Big Boys in Denver

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
All slimmed down after his illness, Boris Yeltsin told President Clinton that his suits were now too big. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's giant van was too big for the driveway at dinner on Friday. Everyone at the summit meeting of the heads of major industrial nations thought the agenda was, well, too big.
But biggest of all was what participants took to be the egotism of Mr. Clinton and his aides, who arrived declaring that the United States had the answer to the world's economic problems. Europeans and Japanese were irritated by this pre-summit propaganda, and Mr. Clinton had to tell aides to "cool it," one said later. 
 Mr. Clinton himself became the soul of accommodation. "You know, the French have a lot of things that we Americans admire," he told reporters at a meeting with President Jacques Chirac. He mentioned not wine or cheese but France's "wonderful network of child care."
Mr. Chirac's revenge for the Americans' economic boasting came on the last day of the meeting. Though chastened by his defeat in the recent elections, he peered imperiously at Mr. Clinton and assailed the American record on curbing the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. The average Frenchman, he declared starchily, produces one-third the emissions of the average American.
Behind the high-toned officialese of summit declarations, the personal chemistry at these sessions is often glimpsed through such exchanges. The summit participants are, after all, merely a collection of politicians with one-upmanship in their blood. Equally powerful is their need to perform for home audiences.
Mr. Yeltsin and his aides, for example, ceaselessly reminded listeners that in Denver, Russia was more integrated into the proceedings than ever. Since the economic crises of the 1970's, when these meetings began, the participants had been confined to the United States, Japan, France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Canada. Mr. Yeltsin, of the big suit, kept referring to this summit as "The Big Eight." He dismissed the one-hour session of the original seven, from which he was excluded, as a minor sideshow, even though that meeting forged new mechanisms to avoid future financial collapses like the one in Mexico a few years ago.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan insisted that the original Big Seven countries meet at least part of the time by themselves. His motive was more than economic, since the Japanese still resent Moscow's refusal to hand over a group of islands off Japan's northern coast seized at the end of World War II.
If the newly elected and boyish-looking British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had an image problem at home, it was symbolized by his being the only summit participant to be given a small chair at the conference table on the first day. You obviously cannot meet with the Big Eight without a big chair, and embarrassed officials rushed one to him forthwith.
In the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, the setting prompted a Zen-like exchange that showed the deftness of Mr. Hashimoto and Chancellor Kohl. The German leader, an advocate of saving the world's forests, was chiding Japan about the dismal record of Japanese timber companies in destroying the rain forests of Brazil and Asia. Like something out of a Beckett play, it went like this:
Mr. Hashimoto: As you know, I like to climb mountains.
Mr. Kohl: Then you must like forests.
Mr. Hashimoto: There are many mountains without forests. There are ice mountains, and there are rock mountains.
In such big and little ways, national honor was defended in Denver. STEVEN R. WEISMAN

Treasury Securities Take Tumble

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dropped yesterday, with most of the late selling attributed to what traders took as a warning from Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan that exchange rate instability could encourage Japan to sell some United States Treasury holdings in order to buy gold.
Speaking at Columbia University, Mr. Hashimoto said, "I hope the U.S. will engage in efforts and cooperation to maintain exchange stability, so that we would not succumb to this temptation to sell off Treasury bills and switch our foreign reserves to gold." 
 But Mr. Hashimoto did not intend to threaten sales and upset markets, a delegate traveling with him said late in the day, according to Dow Jones. Rather, he wanted to point out that the Bank of Japan had so far resisted any temptation to sell.
The 30-year bond declined 16/32, to a price of 99 2/32 to yield 6.70 percent, up from 6.66 percent last week.
Analysts said Mr. Hashimoto's comments were enough in an anemic market to drive down prices for all maturities. For a good part of yesterday's session, which had almost no economic data to affect traders, prices were mixed. Most market participants do not expect the Fed to push up interest rates next week with inflation remaining subdued and the pace of growth moderating.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist, at Paine Webber Inc. said: "Recent output growth is slowing mainly for consumer goods, but not for many capital goods, especially in the high- tech area. This favorable mix should please the Fed, and its continuation probably would permit the Fed to tolerate, if necessary, somewhat higher overall growth than otherwise before contemplating any tightening of short-term interest rates."
Similarly, Dr. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities Inc., said that even though the economy appeared to be snapping out of its springtime lull, the "words weaker and slower were still mentioned no fewer than 18 times in the latest beige book, a telltale sign that the Fed will stay in the dugout" at its policy-making meeting July 1 and 2.
Looking forward into next year, Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said: "A fairly significant slowdown is in progress. Economic growth will be close to Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan's speed limit of 2.25 percent. Labor shortages, the lack of pent-up demand for big-ticket items, the delayed effects from higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, the waning boom in the stock market, the high level of consumer debt are some of the reasons for more moderate growth."
Rates were mixed at yesterday's regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month Treasury bills. Some called it a little weak, as the rate for a three-month maturity rose to 4.98 percent, from 4.88 percent the week before, and the rate for a six-month issue declined to 5.05 percent, from 5.10 percent. Today the Treasury will sell $15.5 billion of new two-year notes and tomorrow, $11.5 billion of new five-year notes.
In when-issued trading, the two-year issue was offered at a price to yield 6.01 percent, up slightly from last week. Dealers sometimes try to make the yield more attractive to investors, insuring that they will not be left with a lot of inventory. The five-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.29 percent, also up.
In addition to the auction, the market will also have to contend with the weekly retail sales data and a consumer confidence report.
The following are the results of yesterday's three-month and six-month Treasury bill auction:

HEADLINE: Fall of 192.25 Is Worst Day Of '97 for Dow

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market plunged yesterday in a late wave of selling that turned what seemed to be a routine session into the worst of the year.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 192.25 points, or 2.47 percent, to 7,604.26. It was biggest loss of the year for the Dow in both point and percentage terms. 
 What was perplexing, though, was that yesterday's rout occurred on a day when there was little economic news and came in spite of a fresh wave of merger announcements, which typically lift share prices.
But a number of traders said the selloff was intensified late in the day after news service reports quoted Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan in a speech at Columbia University as saying that unless the United States Government moved to stabilize the dollar-yen exchange rate, Japan would sell its American Treasuries and switch into gold.
After the markets closed, an aide to Mr. Hashimoto said that the Prime Minister's remarks had been misinterpreted, adding that the leader did not threaten to sell the securities, Dow Jones reported.
Regardless, reports of Mr. Hashimoto's remarks drove down the prices of bonds, lifting their yields and making them more attractive relative to stocks. As a result, stock prices, down about 50 points, began an even bigger descent after 2:30 P.M.
"I think the market was just looking for an excuse to sell," said James Benning, a trader at BT Brokerage. "I think the minister's remarks accelerated a trend that had already started."
Even after bond prices recovered some of their losses, stock prices continued to plummet, pulled down, in part, by a rash of large program trades, according to Birinyi Associates, the largest beginning at 3:45 P.M. and finishing at the closing bell.
While the Dow's drop did not rank in the top 20 in percentage terms, only the 508-point crash in October 1987 was a larger point decline.
Tobacco shares, falling on the first full day of trading after the legal settlement agreement reached on Friday, contributed to the blue-chip rout and helped set the stage for the bigger selloff that took a large bite out of what has been a 10-week rally. Philip Morris, the nation's leading cigarette maker, fell 2 3/4, to 42 3/4.
Since mid-April, when the market bottomed this year after a month-long selloff, stock prices have surged into the record books, with all the major indexes setting records.
As of last Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had gained 21.8 percent, its best 10-week run since 1982. And the Dow seemed to be streaking toward the 8,000-point level midway through a year for which few Wall Street analysts had forecast the Dow at even 7,000.
Both indexes set records on Friday. But those records were unraveled yesterday, as the Dow plunged more than 100 points in the final hour of trading. And the S.& P. 500 fell 20.08, or 2.23 percent, to 878.62.
"We had some big moves up recently," said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., a market analyst at Smith Barney. "Everything was nirvana -- you had a sweet spot, and so the market wasn't prepared for what came out of the woodwork."
The best-performing index early yesterday was the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which gained after news that Compaq Computer had agreed to buy Tandem Computers for $3 billion in stock, though both companies are actually traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Compaq fell 2 7/8, to 103 7/8; Tandem rose 5 3/4, to 20 3/4.
But later, as stocks fell broadly, even indexes with many technology stocks fell, though less sharply than others. The Nasdaq composite lost 12.78 points, or nearly nine-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 1,434.32.
On the New York Stock Exchange, volume was relatively light. But losers outpaced winners by more than 2 to 1.
Within the Dow, all 30 component stocks declined. United Technologies fell 3 3/8, to 83 7/8, and Procter & Gamble lost 3 1/4, to 136 7/8.

HEADLINE: Canadians Surprised by Proposal to Extradite Pol Pot

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland, June 23

 BODY:
Canadian officials said today that they were taken by surprise when the United States suggested that their country seek the extradition of the former Cambodian dictator, Pol Pot, and expressed doubt that their genocide law could be used as Washington requested.
A senior official at Canada's Ministry of Justice, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, noted that Canada has no extradition treaty with Cambodia. Under Section 7 of the Canadian criminal code, charges can be brought for war crimes and crimes against humanity that are committed outside Canada. The suspect, however, must be present in Canada in order for the law to be applied. 
 The United States has indicated it would be willing to take part militarily in bringing Pol Pot to Canada, although it is not clear under what legal basis such an operation would be carried out.
[In Washington, Clinton Administration officials said they were discussing using American aircraft and military forces, as well as those from other nations, in the event that Cambodian officials succeeded in working out a plan for the surrender of Pol Pot, possibly to an international tribunal.
[With conflicting intelligence reports about Pol Pot's whereabouts, United States legal experts began discussions with Denmark and the Netherlands to see if their laws would allow them to seek the extradition of the Khmer Rouge leader.]
Over the weekend, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright raised the possibility that Canada could extradite the 69-year old Khmer Rouge leader in a conversation with her Canadian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, at the international economic summit meeting in Denver.
According to a Canadian official, they had been discussing the breakdown of talks between Canada and the United States over salmon fishing rights when Ms. Albright suggested that Canada play a leading role in an international attempt to bring Pol Pot to trial.
In 1987, Canada passed a law that provides for prosecution of anyone in Canada who has committed crimes against humanity in Canada or elsewhere. The law was part of Canada's attempt to prosecute suspected Nazi war criminals who had immigrated to Canada after World War II.
The law has been applied four times against suspected war criminals in Canada. None of the cases resulted in a successful prosecution, the justice official said. The most recent case was against Imre Finta, a suspected war criminal, in Ontario. In a 1994 appeal of that case, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the war crimes law.
"We presume it's applicable in this case," the official said, referring to the planned proceedings against Pol Pot. "We're actively reviewing it. It's just too early to give a considered opinion at this point."
Presumably, the former Cambodian dictator would have to be brought to Canada in order for Canada to be able to bring charges against him.
The United States has indicated that it would be willing to participate militarily in bringing Pol Pot to Canada, although it is not clear under what legal basis such an operation would be carried out, since there is no extradition agreement.
Then, according to the justice official, Pol Pot would have to be accused under the criminal code in Canada. For that to happen, Canada would have to be in possession of evidence collected by the Cambodian Government against Pol Pot.
"Really what it comes down to," said the justice official, "is that without the active participation of Cambodia, it will be impossible to prosecute. All the evidence and witnesses are on Cambodian soil. That country is best situated to bring these charges forward."
Catherine Lappe, a spokesman for Mr. Axworthy, said that just bringing Pol Pot to Canada would also raise immigration issues, depending on how that was done.
"We are consulting with other allies and working with the U.N. and the United States," Ms. Lappe said. "Canada is interested in assessing what it can do and what course makes the most sense in reaching a conviction."
It is possible, though unlikely, that Canada could put Pol Pot on trial in Canada, as it has done with the suspected Nazi war criminals.
"Our preference is to have a U.N. mandate approach," Ms. Lappe said.
However, there currently is no international tribunal with the jurisdiction to try Pol Pot. The United Nations has agreed to consider taking such actions, but it has not done so yet.
Ms. Lappe said it may be possible to increase the scope of the International War Crimes Tribunal for Bosnia, or to create a new one for Cambodia.
Ms. Lappe said the Canadians were surprised when Ms. Albright approached them with the idea. Because so many details are unknown, the Canadians have not been able to lay out a firm course of action, she said.

HEADLINE: Official Says Pol Pot's Foes, Fearing Trial, May Kill Him

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, June 23

 BODY:
The enemies of Pol Pot are likely to kill him rather than let him testify at a trial where he could implicate them, First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh said today.
"It appears to me that some Cambodians and maybe some countries are not really willing to see Pol Pot alive and to be brought to justice," he said, in an assessment endorsed by a number of political experts today. 
 "You see, maybe Pol Pot would say something not very nice to them. Pol Pot would say, 'Those people were involved,' or, 'Those countries were supporting me for years.' "
He did not name any countries or people, but China was once the patron of the Khmer Rouge Government, and various Thai interests continue to have close economic connections to the guerrillas, whose bases are along the Thai border.
There remains a widespread sense among foreign diplomats and political experts that the reports about Pol Pot are not what they seem.
The entire scenario that has been reported over recent days -- Pol Pot's split with his supporters, his flight into the jungle and his reported capture -- could be a drama orchestrated by the Cambodian Government, the Khmer Rouge or both, they say.
Prince Ranariddh's comments followed the news on Sunday that the United States and other nations had asked Canada to seek the extradition of Pol Pot under its law against genocide, pending the creation of an international tribunal that would conduct a trial.
On Saturday, both of Cambodia's Prime Ministers, Prince Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, signed a request to the United Nations for help in setting up a tribunal.
The Prince's comments today echoed the suspicions of a number of foreign political experts here who said that, even in captivity, the man responsible for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979 remained a threat to the political interests of a variety of people.
A number of leading members of the current Government, as well as King Norodom Sihanouk himself, are former members of the Khmer Rouge or have had close ties to them.
A trial of Pol Pot, with all its emotional impact, might have unsettling effects on this already unstable country, where the two Prime Ministers are locked in an increasingly dangerous political rivalry.
If Pol Pot is now in some form of custody, a number of political experts say they agree with the Prince that the Khmer Rouge leader might not survive to face a tribunal.
"You get a feeling around here that there is still a real fear of this guy," a Western diplomat said. "I'm still skeptical that he is going to show up for trial."
The prospect that Pol Pot, 69, could die soon is one that has been suggested privately and publicly by a number of Government officials for whom his death would be more convenient than his trial.
"I don't think that they will give up Pol Pot to the Government or that they will accept Pol Pot testifying in the face of an international tribunal and explaining the way they all implemented the bureaucracy of death," said Raoul Jennar, an expert on Cambodian politics.
"So they will kill him, if he is not killed already," said Mr. Jennar, who is the director of the European Far Eastern Research Center in Belgium.
On Sunday, a top general in the Cambodian armed forces, Nhiek Bun Chhay, said he had seen Pol Pot alive in the rebel base of Anlong Veng, 300 miles north of here. If his report is true, this would be the first sighting of the Khmer Rouge leader by outsiders in 17 years.
The general is a senior adviser to Prince Ranariddh and he is the apparent source of most of his accounts about the Khmer Rouge split and the fate of Pol Pot.
The only corroboration of those accounts has come in broadcasts from the clandestine Khmer Rouge radio station, which Mr. Jennar and others said could be part of an elaborate charade.
General Nhiek Bun Chhay produced no photographs to prove his report that he had seen Pol Pot, and he said he had not spoken to the Khmer Rouge leader because he was kept away from him, a factor that raised questions about the general's report that he had seen him.
Foreign political analysts said Pol Pot's possible death could itself be the next act in a scenario that has played itself out for nearly two weeks in a series of unconfirmed reports.
"I would like to say that I'm very suspicious because the picture is too beautiful," said Mr. Jennar. "All the bad guys are killed or in the darkness."
He was referring to reports from Prince Ranariddh that Pol Pot had killed his former Defense Minister, Son Sen, and that there was no news about two of the most feared of the Khmer Rouge leaders, Ta Mok and Nuon Chea.
At the same time, the Prince's reports have cast in a positive light Khieu Samphan, the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge, with whom the prince had been negotiating an arrangement that could lead to a political alliance.
The aim of those maneuvers, a number of diplomats and political analysts suggested, could be a grand alliance of Cambodian political interests aimed at squeezing out Mr. Hun Sen, who was the Cambodian leader for a decade after the ouster of the Khmer Rouge.
The Khmer Rouge radio broadcasts, including one this evening, have already plunged into mainstream politics, supporting Prince Ranariddh while attacking Mr. Hun Sen.
"The Khmer Rouge are already making themselves felt in mainstream politics," a Western political analyst said, "and their aim does not seem to be stability."

HEADLINE: Clinton, in Talk to Mayors, Sketches a Vision for Cities

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 23

 BODY:
As he hopscotched among California fund-raising events, President Clinton alighted today at an elementary school to promote his ideas for children's health care and at the annual gathering of the United States Conference of Mayors to unveil some modest initiatives -- and some grand dreams -- for cities.
At the Mar Vista Elementary School here, Mr. Clinton attended a ceremony where the medical services giant Kaiser Permanente announced that it would provide $100 million over five years to help pay for health coverage for as many as 50,000 California children from low-income families. 
 In his remarks, Mr. Clinton recalled his efforts to create a national health care system. "It's well known I failed, but I'm not ashamed that I tried," he said. After that misfire, he said, "we sort of rolled up our sleeves" and approached the problem of uninsured Americans incrementally.
He called on other companies to chip in for health insurance for the 10 million American children who lack it, but also declared that "government has to do its part, too," noting that the new budget agreement would help extend insurance to poor children.
But the President's major address of the day was to the mayors, meeting in San Francisco, where in 45 minutes and under the loose rubric of urban policy he corralled topics as diverse as his dreams for home ownership, his plans for the Federal budget, his desire for an AIDS cure and his hope to "rewrite the rules of human evolution, almost," by teaching people of different races to get along.
Mr. Clinton told the mayors that he among American Presidents was exceptionally equipped to address the needs of cities.
"I imagine I have been in more urban neighborhoods, meeting with more different kinds of people about more different kinds of issues, than any of my predecessors," he said.
The President stopped just short of promising the mayors that he would veto a budget bill that did not restore disability benefits to legal immigrants, money that he said was stipulated in the budget accord with the Republican leaders of Congress. "I will not sign the bill unless Congress keeps its commitment in the budget agreement to do that," he said.
The President announced three Administration initiatives for the cities.
To encourage police officers to live in the neighborhoods they patrol, he said, the Department of Housing and Urban Development will offer them a 50 percent discount to buy homes that it owns. "Just imagine what it will be like when more police make those neighborhoods their homes again," he said.
Mr. Clinton did not mention the number of officers who would be eligible to buy the homes, but the Administration said it hoped to reach about 1,000 with the program, which is to last a year. Andrew M. Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said that "if it works the way we think it's going to work, then we would continue it and the numbers would be larger."
In addition, Mr. Clinton said the Federal Housing Administration would reduce mortgage premiums, or loan points, to 1.50 percent from 1.75 percent for first-time home buyers in central cities. Administration officials said the reduction would cut closing costs by an average of $200 for qualifying buyers, whom they expect to number about 20,000.
Last, Mr. Clinton announced a plan for a demonstration program in which up to 2,000 families would purchase their own homes using rent subsidy money available under a Federal program known as Section 8.
Mr. Cuomo said the three initiatives together would cost $700 million a year.
Mr. Clinton was the star of three fund-raising events in the two cities he visited today.
At one, a lunch in San Francisco to raise money for Senator Barbara Boxer's re-election campaign, Ms. Boxer said critics had charged that "the poor people are left out of this event." But she told her guests that by donating to her campaign, they were helping to make sure that "poor people's concerns are inside the United States Senate."
Mr. Clinton praised Ms. Boxer for her sunny disposition, finding a contrast between her and others in Washington. "You listen to some of these people talk in the nation's capital," he said, "you'd think that they spent the whole morning sucking lemons."
In Los Angeles, Mr. Clinton appeared at an event to raise money not only for Ms. Boxer but also for other Democratic senators. Ms. Boxer's office said it expected Mr. Clinton to raise $1.5 million today.
And planners hoped that an event here tonight for the Democratic National Committee would raise about $80,000 for the President's debt-ridden party.
Mr. Clinton also used the mayors' gathering today to renew his call for national education standards, deriding as "a lot of bull" the notion that some poor children could not meet them.
And he implored the mayors to help encourage people of different races to get along.
"We have a chance here to do something that has never been done in all of human history," Mr. Clinton said, pointing to a time "before there was a written history" when tribes "identified people who looked different from them and lived different from them as their potential enemies."
He said the United States could now overcome the dictates of evolution to create "the world's first truly great multiracial, multiethnic democracy."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: THE OVERVIEW;
Immunity From Suits Is Withheld For Guards in Privately Run Jails

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that employees of companies that run prisons under contract with a state or local government are not entitled to the immunity from prisoner lawsuits that shields prison guards who are on the public payroll.
The 5-to-4 decision, rejecting an immunity claim by two employees of the biggest private manager of correctional centers, could help shape the law and economics of the fast-growing move to the privatization of government services. 
 Writing for the majority, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that "given a continual and conceded need for deterring constitutional violations," the traditional immunity doctrine that enables government employees to do their job without fear of lawsuits should not be extended to employees of private companies.
Competitive pressures of the marketplace, making errant behavior expensive to defend and leading to the loss of contracts for poor work, should be permitted to operate, Justice Breyer said.
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the decision would make privatization more expensive for taxpayers and lead to windfalls for prisoners who bring suits and lawyers who represent them.
Workers who perform a public function should receive a public employee's immunity, Justice Scalia said.
The immunity doctrine in dispute shields state officials from liability for civil rights violations as long as their conduct does not violate "clearly established" rights that a "reasonable person" should have known.
In legal terms, this is called "qualified immunity," as distinguished from the absolute immunity accorded to judges, prosecutors and some other officials.
In practical terms, qualified immunity is a powerful shield that makes it extremely hard to win a suit against a protected official.
In the case today, an inmate of a prison in Tennessee that the Corrections Corporation of America of Nashville operated sued two guards for injuring him by keeping him in unduly tight physical restraints. The Federal District Court in Nashville and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, ruled that the privately employed guards were not entitled to qualified immunity and rejected their motion to dismiss the suit.
In upholding the lower court rulings, Justice Breyer's opinion surveyed the histories of the immunity doctrine and of the private operation of prisons, which he said was common in the 18th- and 19th-century United States and earlier in England. There was no corresponding tradition of immunity for the private jail operators, Justice Breyer said.
Concluding that there was no reason to extend immunity now, Justice Breyer said the most important function of the doctrine was to prevent government employees from being unduly fearful in carrying out their normal duties.
He said that "unwarranted timidity" was less likely to be a problem with a private operator, because "competitive pressures mean not only that a firm whose guards are too aggressive will face damages that raise costs, thereby threatening its replacement, but also that a firm whose guards are too timid will face threats of replacement by other firms with records that demonstrate their ability to do both a safer and a more effective job."
The majority opinion, Richardson v. McKnight, No. 96-318, was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
"Function, not status" should determine the scope of immunity, Justice Scalia said. He said it was "fanciful to speak of the consequences of 'market' pressures in a regime where public officials are the only purchaser and other people's money the medium of payment."
The decision did not necessarily guarantee how the Court would rule on the status of employees of companies carrying out other privatized functions like determining welfare eligibility, for example, as is being discussed in some states, and where the competitive marketplace might operate differently. But the majority's rejection of Justice Scalia's emphasis on "function" as the determining principle means that it will be an uphill battle for any private worker to claim a public employee's immunity.
The case was closely watched, in part because privatization is becoming so popular. Twenty-two states have laws to authorize contracts with companies to run correction programs. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are not among that group. The Corrections Corporation of America operates 49 correctional centers in 11 states and in England.
There were also these other actions today as the Court began what it expects to be the final week of the 1996-97 term.
 
State Inmates
In an opinion by Justice Souter, the Court ruled, 5 to 4, that a 1996 law that placed sharp new restrictions on the ability of state prison inmates to receive hearings in Federal court did not apply retroactively to the petitions for writs of habeas corpus that were already pending in Federal court when the law took effect.
The decision, Lindh v. Murphy, No. 96-6298, overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, and will have the effect of keeping hundreds if not thousands of petitions that would otherwise have run aground on the new requirements.
The law, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, took effect when President Clinton signed it on April 24. The law greatly circumscribes the traditional role of the Federal courts in reviewing prisoners' arguments, through habeas corpus petitions, that their convictions or sentences violate the Constitution.
Constitutional challenges to the substance of the law are pending in lower courts. In the case today, an appeal by a convicted murderer in Wisconsin based on his inability to cross-examine the state's expert psychiatric witness at his trial, the Supreme Court had agreed to decide only the retroactivity question. Congress was silent on whether the general provisions of the law applied to pending cases.
Justice Souter's opinion reasoned from what he called the "negative inference" that Congress did not intend the relevant sections of the law to apply retroactively, because a separate section that applies to death-row inmates, not at issue in the case today, was explicitly made applicable to all pending cases in the text of the statute.
Justice Souter acknowledged that the case was hard. "No answer leaps out at us," he said. "All we can say is that in a world of silk purses and pigs' ears, the act is not a silk purse of the art of statutory drafting."
His opinion was joined by Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer.
In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist called the inference on which the majority relied weak and strained. Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas joined the dissent.
 
State Immunity
In a splintered ruling in the oldest case on its docket, the Court enlarged the dimensions of constitutional immunity for states from suits in Federal court but did not go as far in that direction as Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Rehnquist evidently wanted to go.
The question in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe, No. 94-1474, was whether the state could be sued in Federal court in a dispute over ownership to the bed of a lake, part of which is on an Indian reservation. The 11th Amendment generally bars suits against states in Federal court.
But under a Supreme Court decision in 1980 called Ex Parte Young, state officials may be sued to bar them from enforcing state laws that are said to be unconstitutional. The Ex Parte Young doctrine, in effect a legal fiction based on the theory that the suit is not really against the state, has been under attack from states and from their allies on the Court.
In this case, Idaho appealed a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, that permitted the Indians' suit to proceed against state officials under the Ex Parte Young doctrine. In overturning that decision today, five Justices -- Justice Kennedy, the Chief Justice and Justices O'Connor, Scalia and Thomas -- agreed that the suit bore too directly and intrusively on Idaho's "sovereign interest in its lands and waters" to be permitted to proceed.
Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion. But only Chief Justice Rehnquist joined him in the sections that would have replaced the general outlines of Ex Parte Young with a case-by-case balancing test that would have greatly limited the doctrine's usefulness in suing states in Federal court at all. That result was blocked by Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion.
Justice Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer. Justice Souter expressed "great satisfaction" that Justice O'Connor's more limited view had prevailed over Justice Kennedy's view, but said the suit should have been permitted to proceed.
 
Native Alaskan Rights
The Court agreed to hear an appeal by Alaska from a ruling of the Ninth Circuit that a remote village of 350 Athabaskan Indians is sovereign "Indian country," with broad powers to impose taxes and control land use and resources over an area the size of Delaware.
Alaska told the Court that the Ninth Circuit decision, growing out of a minor tax dispute, called into question the status of 44 million acres of Indian-owned land, or 10 percent of the state, which had not previously been regarded as Indian territory, as that phrase is used to describe the sovereign rights of Indians who live on reservations in the lower 48 states.
A 1971 Federal law, the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act, extinguished historic Indian titles to land in exchange for a cash payment and new political arrangements. The case, Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie, No. 96-1577, will require the Court to examine that law and other facets of Alaskan history.

Budget Clears Committees

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A $16.8 billion state budget for the next fiscal year cleared the budget and appropriations committees of the State Senate and Assembly yesterday and is now expected to be voted on by both houses on Thursday. The spending plan, which Gov. Christine Todd Whitman must sign before July 1, would increase spending by more than half a billion dollars, an increase that is $260 million higher than the Governor proposed in January. Much of the extra money would go to urban schools, state social workers and higher education. 
 Lawmakers are able to spend more money without raising taxes, because revenues are up this year, thanks to the boom on Wall Street, a strong state economy and a pension bond sale that allows the state to skip $590 million in pension payments.

HEADLINE: House Votes to Overturn a Plan By Clinton to Save Military Jobs

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 23

 BODY:
Defying a veto threat from President Clinton, the House voted tonight to overturn the Administration's plan to keep thousands of jobs at two large Air Force maintenance bases in Texas and California that were ordered closed two years ago.
The vote, 278 to 145, defeated an amendment to the $268 billion Pentagon budget bill, for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, which would have kept the Administration plan intact. Mr. Clinton's aides say he will veto any bill that reverses the plan. 
 In 1995, with an eye on the electoral votes of two large states, Mr. Clinton sought to keep thousands of military jobs at Kelly Air Base in San Antonio and McClellan Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif., from being shifted to military bases in other states by directing that private companies be allowed to assume some of the work there.
Many Republicans, led by lawmakers from Oklahoma, Georgia and Utah, whose Air Force maintenance centers would inherit the work from the two bases, led the charge tonight against what they said was Mr. Clinton's political meddling.
"He undercut the integrity of the B.R.A.C. process to achieve political gains," said Representative Tillie Fowler, a Florida Republican on the House National Security Committee, referring to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission.
But proponents of the amendment, including some fiscally conservative Republicans, said that provisions in the Pentagon bill would allow private companies to compete for work only when existing maintenance centers operate at 80 percent of capacity. Military experts say that is an unrealistic standard, given that the current capacity is about 50 percent.
"We should at least give the military the ability to compete at the best price," said Representative Terry Everett, an Alabama Republican who sponsored the amendment.
How much military work should remain at Government-run depots is one of the most contentious post-cold war military issues facing Congress. The depots, with thousands of civilian employees, are economic boons to their regions. But some experts say private companies can perform the jobs more efficiently.
Congress is so angry over the depot issue that the House and Senate military committees refused to include in their Pentagon budget bills the Defense Department's request to authorize new rounds of base closings in 1999 and 2001.
In another contentious vote tonight, the House narrowly approved a plan to buy nine B-2 radar-evading bombers that the military says it does not want and cannot afford.
The vote of 216 to 209 defeated an amendment that would have eliminated $331 million for components to begin expanding the B-2 fleet beyond the 21 planes paid for already.
The Senate, which until two years ago favored the B-2 more than the House did, is not inclined to include additional financing for the planes when it votes on the Pentagon budget next month. As a result, the fate of the B-2's will likely rest with a House-Senate conference committee.
When the House narrowly approved a down payment on 20 more B-2's two years ago, the Senate refused to go along and the plan died. Some military analysts predicted a similar fate for the aircraft this time.
But B-2 proponents resurrected the issue this year. "I'd rather be wrong in favor of too good a defense with too good an airplane saving too many Americans," said Speaker Newt Gingrich in a rare floor speech.
Opponents of the B-2 said the Congressional Budget Office estimated that buying nine more B-2's and operating them for 20 years would cost a total of $27 billion.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Atlanta Finds No Relief From Reed

BYLINE: By BUSTER OLNEY 

 BODY:
As pitchers go, Rick Reed is a sprinter. Runs to the mound, pitches quickly, runs off, does not take time to change his sweaty T-shirt between innings, usually does not last much longer than six innings.
But the Mets needed a marathon from the sprinter last night against first-place Atlanta. Four of their six relievers were sitting in the bullpen strictly as decoys, tired and unavailable, and the Mets needed at least eight innings from Reed. They got nine: Reed pitched a complete-game, 3-2 victory over the Braves, a raucous crowd of 22,193 goading him along at Shea Stadium. What Reed accomplished, pitching coach Bob Apodaca said, was "huge." 
 Carl Everett hit a two-run shot off the Cy Young Award winner John Smoltz in the sixth inning, the second consecutive day Everett mashed the game-winning homer.
The Mets (42-32) are the best fourth-place team in baseball. They have won five straight games since the Yankee series, and closed to within five games of the Braves, with Florida and Montreal sandwiched in between in the crowded National League East.
John Franco, the closer, had pitched four of the five games before last night, and he needed a night off. So did the set-up man Greg McMichael, who pitched in two games. Cory Lidle and Juan Acevedo threw at length Sunday. The Mets' primary reliever last night was the sore-kneed Armando Reynoso, who would have been used only in case of emergency.
Terrible thoughts permeated through the Mets dugout, then, when Reed needed a whopping 22 pitches to get through the first inning.
After the inning, in which Reed allowed one run, Apodaca reiterated the need for economy. Don't overthrow your curve, and relax, he told Reed. Reed threw 10 pitches in the second inning and 12 in the third, allowing another run; Atlanta led, 2-0.
Reed singled in the fifth inning and scored from second on Edgardo Alfonzo's double, breathing hard as he walked back to the dugout. After that, Reed decided to conserve as much energy as possible, coming back onto the field almost dragging his feet, climbing the third base side of the mound, stepping in the same holes each time out of superstition. "I didn't take all my warm-up pitches, either," Reed said after the game. Instead of 10, he threw five or six before each inning.
Todd Hundley singled off a shoelace-high pitch to lead off the sixth after a prolonged at-bat against Smoltz. Everett, next to hit, fought Smoltz to a full count, fouled off a pitch, and then drove an inside fastball over the right field wall, for a two-run homer.
"Nothing seems real hard to me right now," Everett said. "That didn't seem like a John Smoltz fastball."
When Everett returned to the dugout, Reed barely moved, wasting little energy. He held the lead through the seventh and eighth, striking out the .400-hitting Smoltz with a runner on third with what Apodaca said were the best fastballs and the best location he had ever seen from Reed. But there were signs of fatigue; balls hit hard. Reynoso and the left-hander Takashi Kashiwada started throwing in the bullpen, and Reed, his cap darkened by sweat, guessed he would be relieved before the start of the ninth.
"How do you feel?" Apodaca asked Reed, staring him in the eyes, the way a boxing referee reads a tired fighter.
"How would you feel after eight innings?" Reed replied. He assured Apodaca he had enough to continue, and the pitching coach asked Hundley, the catcher, what he thought. "This is the guy we want out there," Hundley said. Reed returned to the mound for the ninth.
Slow and deliberate, he struck out Andruw Jones, the crowd roaring. Javy Lopez flied out, to more cheers. Mark Lemke singled, and Apodaca visited the mound -- more than anything, he wanted to buy time for Reed to rest before he pitched to the pinch-hitter Keith Lockhart.
Reed coaxed Lockhart to hit a high popup toward the third base stands. Alfonzo and Luis Lopez botched the play, but Reed's expression never changed. He later admitted that, as the ball was descending, he was thinking, "C'mon Luis, catch it, c'mon."
Reed received another ball and waited before ascending the mound. Lockhart smacked the next pitch on the ground up the middle, Reed lunged and speared it and threw to first to end the ballgame.
"You could see it in his eyes," Apodaca said. "This young man always had one more hitter left in him. My God, he picked up this whole ballclub."
 
INSIDE PITCH
The Mets have discussed a possible four-player trade with Toronto, according to a member of the Mets' organization, that would send pitcher DAVE MLICKI and outfielder ALEX OCHOA to Toronto for the reliever MIKE TIMLIN and outfielder SHAWN GREEN. The Mets may have a glut of starters in a month, when PETE HARNISCH is ready to pitch again, making another starter -- such as Mlicki -- expendable in a deal.

HEADLINE: Faring Well With Labor, Giuliani Gets Fire Union Nod

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The city's largest firefighters union plans to endorse the re-election of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who so far is faring better in the battle for union support than Republicans typically do in New York City.
Officials in the 8,900-member Uniformed Firefighters Association, which is expected to announce its support for the Mayor today, said that they were backing Mr. Giuliani because he had helped turn around the city's economy and finances and had done some favors for their union. 
 Specifically, the firefighters are pleased that Mr. Giuliani agreed to restore five-person fire trucks in 50 firehouses, after the city had fought for years to reduce the crews to four to save money. The union had long insisted that four-person crews were unsafe, and the change also means more overtime for firefighters.
Some Democratic Party officials are voicing concern that Mr. Giuliani's main challenger, Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, has received little labor support. Most New York unions -- the police and the firefighters are the most notable exceptions -- have traditionally been close to Democratic candidates.
Labor leaders say some unions are hesitant to support Ms. Messinger because her campaign has not caught fire and because they are reluctant to offend the favorite in the mayoral race, Mr. Giuliani.
In one unusual twist, a union that traditionally is close to Republicans, the 29,000-member Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has made some vehement statements against Mr. Giuliani, largely because of its long-standing contract dispute with him. At the same time, the city's largest union, traditionally Democratic District 37, which has 120,000 members, has had kind words for Mr. Giuliani, and some labor leaders say its executive director, Stanley Hill, might even push to endorse the Mayor.
Michael A. Carter, a vice president of the firefighters union and the director of its political activities, said, "There's going to be a respectable number of unions that will endorse the Mayor, and I think you'll probably see a higher number than usual will choose not to make an endorsement because he appears to be a likely winner."
The union representing 20,000 school crossing guards, lunchroom aides and other school paraprofessionals has already endorsed Mr. Giuliani and pledged to provide phone banks that can call thousands of voters an hour.
Some labor leaders and political experts predict that the 90,000-member United Federation of Teachers, which is often considered the city's most politically potent union, might sit out the election rather than endorse the winner of the Democratic primary in September. Besides Ms. Messinger, Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn and the Rev. Al Sharpton are seeking the Democratic nomination.
But several labor and political leaders said there was some good news ahead for Ms. Messinger. Within the next few weeks she is expected to receive endorsements from two of the city's most powerful unions: the Union of Needletrade, Industrial and Textile Employees and 1199, the National Hospital and Human Service Employees Union.
"It's still pretty early in the process," said Leland Jones, a spokesman for the Messinger campaign. "A lot of organizations have still not made a decision one way or the other."
Bill Lynch, who managed the campaign of former Mayor David N. Dinkins and is an unofficial political adviser to several unions, said, "I think some unions are waiting for a few major unions to make some endorsements, and I know that's going to happen."
So far the only two unions to endorse Ms. Messinger are small ones, the musicians and the lithographers.
Some liberal unions that might have been expected to back Ms. Messinger are supporting her Democratic primary opponents. Mr. Albanese has been endorsed by Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, which represents 7,500 middle managers working for the city. And the union representing more than 10,000 workers at city-owned hospitals has endorsed Mr. Sharpton.
"Al Sharpton is a man who is concerned about the workers -- he's out in the street marching with us," said James Butler, president of the hospital workers local, who said his union would endorse Ms. Messinger if she wins the primary.
The leader of the 15,000-member Social Services Workers Union, another usually liberal local, was far harsher in his assessment of Ms. Messinger. "Unfortunately, the presumptive Democratic nominee is no friend of this local at all," said Charles Ensley, the union president. He criticized her for supporting the Dinkins administration's efforts to contract with private agencies to take over work from city employees.
"We will never endorse Ruth Messinger for Mayor, whether in the primary or after," he said.
Mr. Ensley was hardly more generous toward Mr. Giuliani, faulting him for creating a large workfare program and blaming social workers whenever there are highly publicized instances of child abuse.
The United Federation of Teachers rarely makes endorsements in primary campaigns, and Sandra Feldman, the union president, declined to tip her hand about whom the teachers would back after the primary. "The union's delegates will discuss all the issues, as to the winnability of the race and whether or not in terms of the issues, it's worth making an endorsement." she said.
Regarding Mr. Giuliani, she said teachers were pleased that he was spending more money on education this year after having cut school spending previously. "But," she said, "there's a lot of suspicion whether this is something being done for the election."
Gerry Hudson, a senior 1199 official who is on leave to work as political director of the State Democratic Party, said it was important for unions to insure that the Democrat make a strong showing in November.
"If Democrats expect to be victorious in 1998, then they need to prepare the ground in 1997," he said. "The highest concentration of Democratic voters in the state is in the city, and if unions and the Democratic Party don't organize them and pull them out to the polls, we might not lose just this year, but next year as well."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 25, 1997, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about labor union support for New York City mayoral candidates misidentified the unit of the Communications Workers of America that has endorsed Sal F. Albanese in the Democratic primary. While District 1 of the Communications Workers, representing more than 30,000 workers in the city, has endorsed Mr. Albanese, Local 1180, representing 7,500 middle managers working for New York City, has not yet made an endorsement.

HEADLINE: What Ever Happened To the Stars of the 80's?

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
THE heady days of New York in the 1980's, when restaurants were theater and chefs achieved the celebrity status of movie stars, are gone, and with them some of the brightest lights at the stove.
Barry Wine. Len Allison and Karen Hubert Allison. Jonathan Waxman. Brendan Walsh. A decade ago, their names were on the cognoscenti's lips, their unlisted phone numbers eagerly sought by yuppies determined to sample $50 beggar's purses and $30 roast chicken. The excitement created by their restaurants -- the Quilted Giraffe, Huberts, Jams and Arizona 206 -- was even greater than the clamor at today's places to be seen -- Le Cirque 2000, Balthazar and Nobu. 
 Restaurant mania has again gripped New York, but this time it is more restrained: diners are more discriminating: they expect value for their money. And restaurants are now seen more as businesses, not just as opportunities for accomplished cooks to show off their skills or for some wealthy diners to invest their loose change.
Today the money comes from banks and others who expect to make a satisfactory return. But none of that seemed to matter in the 80's. Until Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the day the stock market took a deep dive, sending New York's restaurant industry, along with the country's economy, into a tailspin.
Among the casualties were Mr. Allison and Ms. Hubert Allison, who owned Huberts, and Mr. Waxman, who made his name at Jams. And Mr. Walsh left Arizona 206 because he disagreed with new management policies, which he said changed the emphasis from food quality to making money. On the other hand, Mr. Wine and his wife, Susan, accepted a generous offer for their restaurant, the Quilted Giraffe, one they couldn't refuse.
In the intervening years, these restaurateurs have matured, and today, most of them willingly admit that they wouldn't mind being part of the new scene. But running a restaurant is much harder than it ever was. Only one is still at the stove, cooking in a bucolic Connecticut town. Another is writing; the latest book is an autobiographical novel about the restaurant business. One is a consultant still searching for a restaurant, and another, itching to get back into the business, has just found a niche, working for the restaurant impresario Warner LeRoy. Here's a closer look at where they are now.
 
Barry Wine
At the height of his career as a lawyer-turned-chef, Barry Wine and his wife, Susan, owned the Quilted Giraffe, the most expensive and arguably the best restaurant in New York. Their restaurant, as a temple of gastronomy and as a very profitable business, was what other chefs aspired to. When Mr. Wine introduced beggar's purses -- crepes filled with caviar and creme fraiche and tied with strings of green onion -- they were the talk of the town.
But then, when Sony bought the AT&T Building, where the Quilted Giraffe occupied a corner of the ground floor, it not only offered to buy out the lease for seven figures, but also offered Mr. Wine a job as a consultant. The restaurant, which traced its origins back to New Paltz, N.Y., in 1975, ceased to exist on New Year's Eve, 1992.
Shortly after that, Mr. Wine and his wife divorced. He went to work for Sony, where among other things he created a sushi bar for five with an artificial stream running through it. "When Sony discovered they had lost all that money in Hollywood, they became scared, and I was the symbol of that extravagance," Mr. Wine said. His contract was not renewed at the end of 1995. After Sony, he tried to create a culinary Web site, but it did not work out.
"When I see how busy people are and how exciting things are, I want to be part of the action," Mr. Wine, 54, said over lunch at Lutece recently. "But at the same time, I think it would be very difficult to compete, especially with people who are subsidized. Chefs have staff and support. When we were in it, it was Susan and me.
"I've played with the idea of doing a 30-seat counter and cooking what I want and calling it Barry's Counter, like the Empire Diner. I could get backing in a second, but I don't want to own a restaurant."
Two weeks ago, Mr. LeRoy, who owns Tavern on the Green, came to the rescue. Mr. LeRoy is already backing David Bouley and the culinary empire he is building at West Broadway and Duane Street. Mr. Wine is now director of planning for Mr. LeRoy, and it is no secret in restaurant circles that by hiring him, Mr. LeRoy is adding stature to his bid for the Rainbow Room lease, which is up for renewal in two years.
 
Jonathan Waxman
Jonathan Waxman, who was responsible for bringing the oh-so-trend-setting California cuisine to New York, is still searching. In 1984 he opened Jams on East 79th Street. It became a mecca for savory roast chicken and perfect french fries served from an open kitchen. A year later, there was a second restaurant, Bud's, and a year after that, Hulot's. By 1987, Jams had opened a branch in London. But by 1989, the original Jams had been renamed JW and had reduced its prices.
"People are tired of paying $80 each for dinner," Mr. Waxman said at the time. Less than a year later, JW was shuttered, along with Bud's. Hulot's was sold.
"We made a common business mistake," Mr. Waxman said. "We were undercapitalized. I bit off more than I could chew. I followed my fantasy life."
Sitting over a cup of coffee in a tiny Upper West Side cafe, Mr. Waxman discussed the demise of his restaurants, acknowledging that he did not always pay attention to his work. "If it was anything, it was going out to dinner too many times," he said. "I consulted on five other restaurants. I said yes to every charity. I was being indulgent rather than being a businessman. I walked away with nothing."
In 1990, Mr. Waxman sold his Ferrari for $65,000, went to California and lived on that money for a year. The next stop, in 1991, was Table 29, which he opened with others in Napa, Calif., to mixed reviews. By 1993, he was back in New York as a consultant to the Ark Restaurants Corporation, which owns several well-known places, including Lutece and Bryant Park Grill. Mr. Waxman had wanted, he said, to learn about business from a master, Michael Weinstein, the president of Ark.
He left last year, intending to open his own place, but those plans failed to materialize. He is still a consultant, currently for the owners of Nick & Tony's in East Hampton, N.Y., and Nick & Tony's Cafe on West 67th Street.
Now, Mr. Waxman, 46, has settled down. He married two years ago, and he and his wife, Sally, have an infant daughter. But professionally, he feels conflicted.
One moment he is indifferent to owning a restaurant: "It doesn't kill me not to be part of the restaurant scene." The next he admits to a hankering: "I'd do something if I'd found a space that was real special, but I need a really good business partner. Being a consultant isn't fun, but you can make a living. It's kind of like being a mercenary."
 
Brendan Walsh
What's a kid from the Bronx doing in the staid old Connecticut suburb of Ridgefield, running what was once the town's snootiest restaurant? Actually, Brendan Walsh's family moved to Ridgefield when he was 14.
He made a name for himself cooking Southwestern food at Arizona 206 in New York, but today he is back in Ridgefield, the local boy who made good, married his high school sweetheart and became the proprietor of the restaurant at the town's 200-year-old inn, the Elms.
As a boy in the Bronx, Mr. Walsh said, he was "used to sneaking under turnstiles, jumping between buildings and shimmying up the sides of them." By comparison, Ridgefield was a bore. But he had always been fascinated by the process of making bread, so he bought himself a copy of the "Beard on Bread" cookbook and started baking at 14 and went to work in a restaurant.
That was followed by the Culinary Institute of America, then work and travel in California, France and Italy. In 1985, at age 26, he was the chef at Arizona 206, where he made enticingly spicy Southwestern food, captivating New Yorkers with flavors they had never tasted before. But three and a half years later he had a falling out with some of the people in the corporation that ran Arizona 206.
"The new management was more concerned about percentages and numbers than about food and the quality of the service," Mr. Walsh said one recent afternoon at the inn.
When his plans to open another restaurant in Manhattan fell through, he moved to Long Island for four years, where he ran several restaurants.
"I didn't plan to be on Long Island as long as I was," he said. "The last few years were very difficult for me, but I learned a lot about suburban restaurants. You need quality food and a small, concise, very focused menu so it will work economically."
At the Elms, which he took over a year ago, he has two menus, one inexpensive and "user friendly" in the bar, and another more elaborate in the dining room for people who have made the Elms a destination.
"I'm not ashamed to say I make the best hamburger in town," Mr. Walsh said. "People like the fact that I'm here and tell me, 'It's so nice to have a restaurant of this caliber in this area.' I'm so happy I can do everything I want to do with food here and be appreciated."
The dishes are straightforward contemporary variations on American dishes like lobster shepherd's pie, crab cakes with corn, tender chicken with a morel stuffing. Nothing at all like Arizona 206: not a hint of chili. Mr. Walsh tried it once in a lamb and hominy dish. It didn't play well in Ridgefield.
And what about New York? His wife, Chris, who helps run the restaurant, answered for him. "We brought these three kids into the world, and you'd never see them," she said.
But he acknowledged that the idea is tempting. "When you get star status, you can get caught up," he said. "I know if I got back on that train -- I know my personality. I like to party." Instead, he has set his sights on more grown-up pursuits: an organic farm to supply the current restaurant. And because he can't get the chilies out of his system, a small Southwestern-Mexican place. And perhaps another for barbecue. And then maybe New York?
 
Karen Hubert Allison And Len Allison
Students of New York's restaurant history always cite the rags-to-riches story of Len Allison and Karen Hubert Allison, who started out by serving dinners in their Brooklyn home on weekends and ended up with an eclectic three-star restaurant, Huberts, at Park Avenue and 63d Street. From their home they graduated to an actual restaurant in Brooklyn in 1975, and by 1981 had found some backers and moved to 22d Street in Manhattan. Eight years later, it was time for another change.
"There's a lot of reinvention and freshening in the restaurant business," Ms. Hubert Allison said from her home on the Hawaiian island of Maui, where she has just returned from a tour promoting her new book, "How I Gave My Heart to the Restaurant Business" (Ecco Press). "When we reached three stars, it was time for another reinvention. Our customers wanted us to move uptown." And they did. To the high-rent district, after the stock market crash. By 1991, Huberts was no more.
"It's very hard to say that it was a mistake, that anything in your life is a mistake," Ms. Hubert Allison said.
And her husband had other interests. "I knew I wanted to go into food in a Chinese medical kind of way," he said. "I was interested in Chinese dietary therapy and had begun to study it."
In 1991, the couple moved back downtown, this time to SoHo, and opened Onda, where the menu was Asian and dinner cost $30 instead of $120, but it wasn't well received. By 1992, Onda closed, too. "At the time that's all we could think to do," Ms. Hubert Allsion said. "I think it would have been wiser to sit still and think."
After three years of teaching at the Culinary Institute of America, she and her husband moved to Hawaii to start over and to be closer to an older son who lives in China.
"We had to believe in ourselves as creative people and that we were capable of making another kind of living," said Ms. Hubert Allison, 48. But it wasn't easy making the transition. "Suddenly, we were out of business," she added, "and we had to reinvent ourselves personally."
"I was a writer who became a cook," Ms. Hubert Allison said. "So, very quickly I knew I wanted to go back to writing." And Mr. Allison, who is 63, is about to start practicing Chinese medicine and has become a licensed acupuncturist.
But the lure of New York remains. The couple maintain an apartment in Manhattan, and they travel back and forth frequently. She has not ruled out opening another place, though quite different from Huberts. "Now we are more interested in the health-giving properties of food," she said. "I don't think I would ever serve meat again unless it was organic."
A restaurant, Mr. Allison said, "is not high on my list."

HEADLINE: Nike's Asian Factories Pass Young's Muster

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Andrew Young, the civil rights leader called upon by Nike Inc. to look into its overseas labor practices, said yesterday that a months-long investigation had turned up no evidence of widespread or systematic mistreatment of workers.
Still, the sporting equipment company should do more to insure that its foreign subcontractors comply with its code of conduct, Mr. Young said at a news conference. 
 "We found Nike to be in the forefront of a global economy," Mr. Young, the former mayor of Atlanta and United Nations representative, said. "Factories we visited that produce Nike goods were clean, organized, adequately ventilated and well lit."
In fact, he said he had anticipated finding much worse conditions in factories in Asia where Nike shoes and apparel are produced.
Nike critics said they were disappointed by Mr. Young's report, adding that his remarks contained surprisingly few criticisms of the company and failed to address at all the issue of low wages paid to workers in many of the factories.
The company, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., hired Mr. Young's newly created consulting firm, Goodworks International of Atlanta, to review its recently updated international labor code. Since March, Mr. Young has toured Nike plants in China, Vietnam and Indonesia and has held several meetings with company executives and representatives of human rights organizations that have been critical of the company.
In remarks yesterday summarizing his findings, Mr. Young advised Nike to continue to "play a leadership role" in the White House Apparel Industry Partnership, which has produced a voluntary, global standard for international labor practices. Nike should also take more aggressive steps to explain and enforce its code of conduct, and it needs to promote the development of worker representation in factories, he said.
In addition, he said, Nike should support third-party monitoring of worker conditions and should endorse an independent grievance system for workers. And it should expand talks with human rights and labor groups in the countries where its products are produced, he said.
Mr. Young came closest to criticizing his client when he said that the factories he visited were "controlled by absentee owners, managed by expatriates who, in Vietnam in particular, do not speak the local language fluently and are overseen by a relatively small number of Nike technical supervisors focused largely on quality control."
The findings seemed to produce few surprises for the company but angered some of its critics.
"I think it was an extremely shallow report," said Medea Benjamin, director of Global Exchange, a human rights group in San Francisco. "I was just amazed that he even admitted that he spent three hours in factories using Nike interpreters and then could come out and say he did not find systematic abuse."
Several human rights groups have said that by hiring Mr. Young, Nike was simply trying to deflect accusations that its foreign subcontractors use child labor, pay abysmally low wages and subject workers to sweatshop conditions.
Nike has repeatedly denied that its goods are made in sweatshops or that factory owners subject workers to inadequate conditions or pay them low wages. The company says that Mr. Young's review provided a level of oversight to its commitment to setting the standard for global workplace standards, and it said that it intended to carry out all of Mr. Young's recommendations.
Philip H. Knight, Nike's founder and chief executive, said: "We will take action to improve in areas where he suggests we need to improve. For although his overall assessment is that we are doing a good job, good is not the standard Nike seeks in anything we do."
Throughout the investigation, Mr. Young maintained that he was working independently and was not a spokesman for the company. Yet Nike officials accompanied him on all his factory tours, and he presented his findings to the company's board and senior management a week before making them public.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Up for 4th Month

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Americans' confidence in the economy continued to climb this month, suggesting that consumer spending may rebound.
The Conference Board said yesterday that its index of consumer confidence rose in June for the fourth consecutive month, reaching a 28-year high of 129.6. That was up from May's revised index of 127.9, previously reported as 127.1. 
 Economists had expected the June report to show a decline in the index.
"Consumers continue to be bullish about the economy," said Lynn Franco, associate director of the Conference Board's consumer research center.
Rising incomes, low unemployment and low inflation are contributing to Americans' exuberance about the economy, analysts said. "Consumers are reloading for the third quarter," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio.
Strong consumer confidence has not translated into increased spending during the current quarter. But economists, investors and even policy makers at the Federal Reserve expect consumer purchasing to strengthen in coming months. Such spending accounts for about two-thirds of economic output.
Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Fed, said in a recent interview that the sluggish retail sales that have hindered economic growth in the second quarter were "not likely to persist because all the signs that make consumers feel good are there." She predicted "good, healthy growth" ahead.
With consumers alternating between spending sprees and periods of unexpected austerity, the economy grew at the rapid annual pace of 5.8 percent in the first quarter and then slowed to an estimated 2 percent rate in the current quarter.
Those ups and downs in consumer spending are not unusual and, more important, help stretch the nation's seven-year expansion, said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston in New York. Americans "are positive, but they still wait for a bargain before they buy; they're not speculating like we saw in the 1970's and 1980's," he said.
That, in turn, means that consumers are less likely to send the economy into a growth spiral that would cause the Fed policy makers to tighten credit severely.
In yesterday's report, the Conference Board said the index gauging consumers' expectations for the next six months fell to 110.7 in June from 111.4 in May, while the index tracking their assessment of present conditions advanced to 157.8 from 152.6.

Jobless Rate for City Fell Slightly in May

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York City inched down last month, falling to 9.6 percent, from 9.7 percent in April, the New York State Department of Labor said yesterday. The statewide jobless rate was unchanged, at 6.3 percent, adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
Both numbers remain far above the national average of 4.8 percent in May. Economists have attributed the city's high jobless rate -- up nearly a full percentage point in the last year -- to a surge in the numbers of people looking for work, rather than more people losing their jobs. 
 On the month-to-month snapshot basis, the unemployment rate for the eight-county metropolitan area -- New York City's five boroughs, plus Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties -- fell to 8.4 percent, not seasonally adjusted, from 8.6 percent in April, the state said.

HEADLINE: Attorneys General Defend Landmark Tobacco Pact

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo., June 24

 BODY:
With a landmark tobacco settlement coming under increasing criticism as too lenient on cigarette companies, state attorneys general today offered a spirited defense of the pact they reached after nearly three months of negotiations, describing it as an unprecedented leap forward on a vital public health issue.
"It isn't perfect, but it's the best anyone has put forward," said Christine Gregoire, Attorney General of Washington State. "To those who say 'wait,' I say when? To those who say 'not this,' I say what? To those who say that Congress could do something, I say, what in the history of Congress leads you to believe that?" 
 The attorneys general, attending the annual meeting here of their national association, said that critics had focused on minor imperfections, overlooking the enormous changes that a deal with tobacco companies would bring about. The pact, they noted, would force tobacco companies to give up a wide range of marketing tools, pay a substantial sum in damages and commit themselves to reducing youth smoking in return for protection against a range of litigation.
Although the attorneys general took no formal vote on the tobacco agreement, Ms. Gregoire and other members of the negotiating team received a standing ovation when they briefed their colleagues. Support ranged across party and geographic lines.
"It's a historic alliance of attorneys general that is unprecedented in American history," said Peter Verniero, Attorney General of New Jersey and a Republican.
"For all the critics, it's easy to do what they have done over the last 50 years, which is nothing," said Grant Woods, Arizona's Attorney General and a Republican. "Congress has had the ability to do something for the last 50 years, so go to it."
"You've got to keep this thing in perspective," continued Mr. Woods, a member of the negotiating team. "This is the biggest public health and corporate settlement in the history of this country."
Although the 68-page tobacco pact would impose restraints and penalties on the tobacco industry that would have been unimaginable only a year ago, critics have expressed concern about several provisions that they view as too favorable to the industry. One concern is that companies would be able to evade severe penalties that the agreement sets for failing to reduce youth smoking. Another concern is that the penalties would be tax deductible as a business expense, softening the blow felt by cigarette companies.
Still, attorneys general who negotiated the accord said, public response has been overwhelmingly positive.
"Parents dropping off their kids were hugging me," Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's Attorney General, said of a birthday party for his son Michael at their Greenwich house on Saturday. "It really astonished me. It has been beyond my wildest expectations."
"Only a year ago, completely responsible people were saying: 'This is a complete pie in the sky. Why are you wasting the state's resources on this completely frivolous lawsuit?' " Mr. Blumenthal recalled of reactions last year when Connecticut joined other states in suing tobacco companies to recover the public health costs stemming from cigarette smoking.
Among the strongest critics of the tobacco settlement has been Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former United States Surgeon General and longtime anti-tobacco crusader, who has described the pact as "deeply flawed." Dr. Koop has found particular fault with the system for penalizing companies that did not meet specified targets for cutting youth smoking, calculating that fines could never amount to more than "a nickel a pack."
But Jeffrey A. Modisett, Attorney General of Indiana, said the penalties would have their desired effect. "They say it's only a nickel a pack," he said. "We say we have removed the financial incentive to hook children."
"We have calculated what is the financial profit to a tobacco company to hook a child on smoking -- that is the penalty they will get if they miss the targets," he added.
Some anti-tobacco forces were disappointed that the accord did not place restrictions on the marketing of cigarettes overseas by American tobacco companies.
"Given our druthers we would have brought them to their knees all over the world, but there is a limit to our leverage," Mr. Blumenthal said. Referring to the accord's limits on promotion and sales, he added, "Our hope is that this model will be adopted in other countries."
Several critics of the tobacco pact have noted that the $368.5 billion cost of the settlement would be tax deductible as "ordinary and necessary business expenses."
Mr. Blumenthal said that was a matter that Congress should address in a broader context. "Our entire tax structure is a construct that allows business to do a lot of bad things and receive tax breaks," the Connecticut Attorney General said. "Maybe Congress will want to change that economic fact of our country."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Rise on Fed Governor's Comments

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Overcoming a strong consumer confidence report, Treasury securities rallied yesterday after Robert Parry, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said he foresaw the economy slowing to a moderate pace.
Mr. Parry is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's policy-setting body, which is to meet on July 1 and 2. A robust economy might lead the committee to push up interest rates. A fairly successful Treasury auction yesterday also kept prices higher. 
 The 30-year bond rose 3/32, to a price of 99 5/32 to yield 6.69 percent, down from 6.70 percent on Monday.
James Padinha, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., said he did not see anything telling in Mr. Parry's remarks, which were made at a Fed-sponsored conference in Oregon, "and that is exactly why the market was up."
Mr. Padinha added, "In this feel-good environment, participants will not buck unless they see an imposing piece of spending or inflation data, or until a Fed member tips his or her hand in terms of signaling a desire to fight for a tightening at either of the next two Fed meetings."
The central bank raised its Federal funds target rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- in March to 5.50 percent, and left it unchanged in May.
"Note too," Mr. Padinha said, "that Parry makes no specific mention of any upside future inflation risk like the unemployment rate."
The market opened higher yesterday after Japan's Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said his Government did not plan to sell United States Treasury securities. Stock and bond prices had plunged in New York on Monday after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made remarks that many market participants interpreted as a warning that Japan might be tempted to sell some of its Treasury holdings if the dollar/ yen exchange rate remained volatile.
Following that early rally, the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index for June hit 129.6, another 28-year high, after being revised higher to 127.9 in May. That exceeded the market consensus, which had anticipated a slight retreat, and caused some investors to sell holdings, erasing early gains.
In theory, upbeat consumers are more likely to spend, which could quicken inflation and prompt the Fed to raise short-term lending rates soon. Still, some market analysts are not convinced high consumer confidence will lead to more spending and higher prices; indeed, the market managed to shrug off the report and resume its climb.
"Consumer spending numbers have been weak in the face of record high levels of consumer confidence in the last few months," said Jonathan Basile, an economist with HSBC Markets. "With retail sales declining for three consecutive months from March to May, it would seem that the strong confidence numbers would be inconsistent with a weak spending picture. And although we do expect retail sales to rise in June, consumers' buying plans for automobiles and major appliances over the next six months were at the lowest levels since last December."
At yesterday's Treasury auction of $15.5 billion in two-year notes, the high yield was awarded at 6.027 percent, in line with expectations, with the bid to cover ratio was a good 2.46 to 1.
Today the Treasury will auction $11.5 billion of new five-year notes. By late in the day in when-issued trading, the notes were offered at a price to yield 6.29 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Price . . . 99.950
High Yield . . . 6.027%

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
City Confident of New Plan for Notorious Building

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
For exactly $1, Frank J. Sciame Jr. has bought one of Manhattan's oldest structures, a brick house at 273 Water Street that was built in the 1780's by a seafaring mahogany trader and then became an infamous tavern where bloody rat-and-dog fights were the chief diversion.
One dollar may sound like a bargain for a raffish landmark in the South Street Seaport Historic District. But Mr. Sciame, president of the F. J. Sciame Construction Company, believes he overpaid. 
 That is because 273 Water Street is a wreck. The property, between Peck Slip and Dover Street, was seized 20 years ago by New York City for failure to pay taxes. It has since defied three rescue efforts.
Sciame Development, an arm of Mr. Sciame's real estate business, plans to reconstruct the four-story brick pile as a small luxury apartment house with four units. Mr. Sciame would not disclose the cost of the project, which he hopes to complete by the fall of 1998.
Although no other attempt to salvage the property has succeeded, the latest undertaking has several advantages. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which owned the building, and the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which regulates the historic district, worked cooperatively to devise a feasible plan.
Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the landmarks commission, said it was more important to find an experienced builder with a track record in preservation than to realize a windfall in selling the property.
"The history of this project is that if it's sold to the highest bidder, it often winds up back in the city's hands," Ms. Raab said. "The goal was to make sure that didn't happen again."
And James F. Lima, assistant commissioner for land-use planning in the housing agency, said, "There was an emphasis in finding someone with the capacity for getting it done who had the passion for seeing it get done.
"While Frank Sciame wasn't making a cash offer like other buyers," Mr. Lima said, "we knew he could pull it off."
Mr. Sciame has been working in the South Street district for seven years. His company constructed the Seamen's Church Institute at 241 Water Street and then reconstructed a 150-year-old Greek Revival building at 247 Water Street that had been perilously close to collapse.
He has a personal stake in the area, too, since No. 247 is the headquarters of Sciame Construction, which has 75 to 100 employees and about $100 million in annual sales. Mr. Sciame is chairman of the Seaport North Community Business Association.
But what may finally insure the reconstruction of 273 Water Street are the property tax abatements and exemptions being offered for the residential conversion of commercial properties downtown.
"Enter the Giuliani administration," Mr. Sciame said. "What I thought would be a very long-term investment for my children, motivated by a desire to save the building, may become economically very viable."
While the authors of the tax program had office towers in mind -- not former grog shops -- city officials believe 273 Water Street would be eligible. "It's probably one of the more interesting uses of the tax-incentive provision," Mr. Lima said.
Mr. Sciame's project, designed by Oliver Lundquist of Manhattan, does not attempt to restore the house to its original condition. There is no evidence of what the building looked like when it was home to Capt. Joseph Rose, who kept his brig, Industry, moored at a wharf out the back door.
It is almost a misnomer to speak of 273 Water Street as an 18th-century building since little -- if any -- of its original fabric survives. Because the remaining facade is in such a precarious state, it will be dismantled and partially reassembled in front of a new masonry and steel structure.
The reconstruction is based on an illustration from the 1860's that shows the house with a pitched roof, dormer windows, splayed lintels and stone bands between the floors. At the time, No. 273 was Kit Burns's Sportsman's Hall, a tavern notorious enough to warrant its own chapter in "The Secrets of the Great City," by Edward Winslow Martin (1868).
Martin described the main room as a kind of amphitheater, with rough wooden benches and a fenced-in ring at the center. Rats would be placed in the ring to be dispatched by a dog "of the best ferret stock," as the "sportsmen" wagered on how long the killing would take. Alternately, two dogs would be set loose in combat.
"The scene is disgusting beyond description," Martin huffed, adding that the patrons were no better. "A more brutal, villainous-looking set it would be hard to find. They are more inhuman in appearance than the dogs."
Since Dog House would probably not attract upscale tenants, 273 Water Street will be marketed as the Captains House.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Delay of Loan To Croatia

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Signaling mounting frustration with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, the Clinton Administration said today that the United States would try to block the World Bank from considering a $30 million loan for Croatia.
But the Administration stopped short of opposing the loan outright, despite expressing anger over recent actions by Mr. Tudjman. And it appeared to be having difficulty winning support from other members of the World Bank's governing body to postpone the loan for long. 
 The decision to seek a delay came amid growing sentiment in Congress that President Clinton has not done enough to punish the leaders of Croatia and Serbia and of ethnic factions in Bosnia for not carrying out their promises under the Dayton accords. Officials said that a delay would put pressure on Mr. Tudjman to turn over Croats indicted on war crimes charges and to allow Serbian refugees to return to their homes in Croatian territory.
The World Bank's executive directors had been scheduled to consider the loan today at a meeting at the bank's headquarters here, but the American director, Jan Piercy, used her powers to seek a delay until Thursday.
Even within the Administration there appeared to be divisions, with the State Department pushing for a longer delay and the Treasury Department resisting, said Administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
A spokesman for the State Department, John R. Dinger, said today that the United States would seek to win broader support for an unspecified delay before the bank's directors meet again.
He and other Administration officials said they wanted to express dissatisfaction with Mr. Tudjman's failure to comply with the peace accords negotiated in Dayton, Ohio in 1995 to end the Balkan fighting.
"We're not putting any end date on this delay," Mr. Dinger said. "We would like to continue to monitor Croatia's performance during this delay."
As part of a larger bill on foreign affairs spending, the Senate's Committee on Appropriations today approved legislation that would cut off all aid to countries that did not do more to capture war criminals in territories under their control.
The Administration has strongly opposed the measure, even though Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has repeatedly warned Croatia and Serbia that they would face economic punishment if they did not do more to comply with the peace accords. Officials have said such language would limit the Administration's flexibility.
But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican chairman of the subcommittee that produced the legislation, noted that Ms. Albright had spoken sternly to Mr. Tudjman when she visited Zagreb last month, only to have the United States later support a $13 million loan by a World Bank's affiliate, the International Finance Corporation.
"What I'm trying to do is reflect what I thought the tough-talking Secretary of State meant when she was there," he said.
In a decision that was largely symbolic, the House tonight voted to cut off funds for American ground troops in Bosnia after June 30, 1998. The Senate is unlikely to follow suit.
The House vote, 278 to 148, approved an amendment to the Pentagon's $268 billion budget bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Lawmakers defeated another amendment, 231 to 196, that would have required the American withdrawal from Bosnia by Dec. 31 of this year.
President Clinton has said United States troops would withdraw from Bosnia by June 1998, but his aides say he will veto any bill that binds the Administration to a specific date.
The Administration argues that such a restriction would hamper the flexibility of ground commanders, undermine the Bosnian peace accord and damage American credibility with its European allies.
There are 8,000 American troops among the 31,000 NATO soldiers now enforcing the peace accord in Bosnia. An additional 2,900 American troops are stationed in Italy, Hungary and Croatia to support the operation.
Proponents of the measure sought to pin down Mr. Clinton, who after last November's elections extended the United States mission in Bosnia by 18 months, to June 1998.
"The remaining tasks -- the civilian, humanitarian and political reconstruction of Bosnia -- are beyond the capabilities of our troops, unless we are prepared to remain in Bosnia for decades," said Representative Floyd Spence, a South Carolina Republican who heads the House National Security Committee.

HEADLINE: Packaging Luxury With Wildlife;
Company Draws Rich Eco-Tourists to Africa

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, June 24

 BODY:
The most famous employee of the Conservation Corporation of Africa is not Dave Varty or Alan Bernstein, the founders. Nor is it a member of the Getty family, a major investor. It is Zibane Mazibuko, a poacher caught with a dead antelope on the company's Phinda Game Reserve. He has been featured in environmental magazines as an example of Conscorp's enlightened attitude toward the African communities in which it operates game lodges.
Instead of turning in Mr. Mazibuko to the police, Conscorp handed him over to his village's headman for trial. Normally, he would have been fined a cow or two. But Mr. Mazibuko was too poor to own a cow, so a deal was arranged: he would work free at Phinda for three months, making bricks by hand. 
 After his sentence, Mr. Mazibuko asked to stay on for pay. With a Conscorp loan, he bought brick-making machinery and now has 10 employees making bricks for customers in nearby towns. Recently, Conscorp gave him a contract to make bricks for Phinda's newest lodge.
Conscorp is an unusual company. It is at the forefront of eco-tourism, Africa's hottest growth business. It offers a sort of old colonial experience -- come to Africa, see its wildlife, be waited on hand and foot -- but its attitude is distinctly new South Africa.
It builds schools and clinics near its lodges, and it employs as many local people as possible, not just as cooks and chambermaids, but as builders, ironworkers and trackers. It buys seeds for local farmers and teaches them to plant vegetables, which it then buys for its tables. It buys materials for local artists and sells their work in its curio shops. It hires people to clear trees, then buys the charcoal they produce from the wood they carry home.
It is rooted in Africa, but incorporated on Britain's Isle of Man, and most of its financing and customers are European or American.
"There are people who live beside our reserves who've never seen an elephant," said Natalie Abratt, a company spokeswoman. "We bus kids in, give them lunch, take them on a two-hour game drive with one of our trackers and then talk to them about eco-tourism."
The rationale is partly neighborliness and partly a gamble that the bigger the stake local people have in the lodge, the less likely they will be to poach, take the company to court or even object when the occasional elephant herd runs amok in their cornfields.
Conscorp grew out of one lodge in South Africa -- Londolozi, Place of the Leopard -- that had once been the family game farm and hunting lodge inherited by Mr. Varty and his brother, John. Mr. Bernstein, 38, a real estate developer with a background in finance and civil engineering who had stayed at Londolozi as a teen-ager, sold Mr. Varty on the idea of a chain of luxury lodges.
Seven years later, Conscorp is running 22 lodges scattered over Africa as far as Kenya and Zanzibar. It is negotiating for properties in Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia.
The company is privately held now, but it expects to make an initial public offering within a year, said Mr. Bernstein, its deputy chairman. It is hoped that the market will value the company "somewhere north of $200 million," he said.
Conscorp's secret is to keep its lodges small, beautiful, isolated and expensive. Room prices range from $260 to $650 a person a night, with a $300 average -- far more than most South Africans can afford but not too much for well-heeled Europeans and Americans wanting a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
No lodge accommodates more than 40 people, and bedrooms are usually individual chalets or tents scattered on a hillside. (The hill may be unfenced, and guests must wait for armed escorts after dark. The policy was instituted after a woman who left dinner at Phinda to fetch a sweater was eaten by a lioness.)
For that money, a full day would involve rising at 5 A.M. for a three-hour game drive, breakfast, lazing around a pool, lunch, an afternoon bush walk with a rifle-toting ranger, a four-hour evening-night drive with cocktails at sundown and game-spotting by searchlight, and, finally, dinner. The food is excellent, and no one has to do the full program.
While there is fishing at some lodges, the Conscorp program does not include game hunting.
What Conscorp is famous for is well-trained -- and often dashingly handsome -- rangers. They do not just spot elephants but can explain everything from the life cycle of a dung beetle to the fighting techniques of a male giraffe. Conscorp also pops surprises on its guests, such as tequila sunrise breakfasts on windswept hilltops or wart hog barbecues by torchlight in the bush.
"We're convincing people to travel across several time zones to a remote, semiarid, reasonably hostile clime," Mr. Bernstein said. "Our objective is to produce a twin hospitality-wildlife experience that allows people to enjoy everything about being there."
Travel agents are enthusiastic. "We deal with a lot of private game reserves, and we can sell Conscorp with confidence," said Mairead A. Schaper, managing director of Leading Travel, a big Johannesburg agency. "We know the customer will return with 110 percent satisfaction, despite the prices. They're the market leaders in customer service."
That reputation tempts many owners of African landscape to invite Conscorp to manage it. Kruger National Park, for example, the crown jewel of the country's park system, caters to middle-class South Africans -- people who can afford to own a car, but who bring their own food and want a $50-a-night bungalow for the family.
Park authorities recently turned over Ngala Lodge, a former private reserve inside the park, to Conscorp. "We pay Kruger 10 percent of turnover with a fixed minimum, and Kruger makes about $1 million a year from those 40 beds," Mr. Bernstein said. "It only makes a profit of about $2 million on the other 4,000 beds it has."
And, much as some South Africans dislike the idea of rich foreigners enjoying their national assets, Mr. Bernstein argues that the park is underused. "Kruger is the size of Switzerland," he said. "Those 4,000 beds are the capacity of four or five big Swiss hotels. There's room."
The Conscorp formula has proved lucrative. Sales were $30 million last year and are projected to be $55 million this year. Eighteen of the 22 lodges made a profit last year, but the company was "pretty much break-even," Mr. Bernstein said, because of the costs of the rapid expansion. The largest stakeholders are members of the Getty family; Hambros P.L.C., a British banking unit of Sakura Bank Ltd. of Japan; the pension fund of a South African chemical workers' union; Southern Sun Hotels, and the Wellcome Trust, a British charitable organization.
The pace of expansion will slow. Meanwhile, the company is trying to establish its name and logo, the bateleur -- a uniquely African eagle with a red face and small tail -- as a brand identified with everything from lodges to safari clothing to wildlife books and movies like the company's "The Leopards of Londolozi."
Africa is nearly 20 percent of the world's land mass but gets only 4 percent of its tourist dollars. Americans in particular are both nervous and almost laughably ignorant; Miss Abratt said Conscorp had tens of thousands of dollars in bookings canceled three years ago during the Ebola virus scare in what was then Zaire even though it did not have a lodge within 1,000 miles of the outbreak. As consumers become more sophisticated and realize that war zones like Zaire, now called Congo, and Sierra Leone are farther away than Bosnia is from Paris, tourism is expected to rise.
"With the cost of getting here coming down and the region's societies and economies becoming more open, opportunities to visit in reliable, secure and exciting ways will increase," Mr. Bernstein said. "I think African travel has enormous prospects."

Though Africa is promoting "eco-tourism," which brings travelers in contact with nature in the wild, much of the continent is still struggling to build tourism into a significant economic force. It represents more than a quarter of the economy of the Seychelles, but less than 1 percent of output in most other African countries. By comparison, tourism is 5.8 percent of the American gross domestic product. Map of Africa shows percentage tourism brings to the gross domestic product for the nations shown.

HEADLINE: The Dow Regains 153.80 Points As Stocks Rebound From Selloff

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Remember that big selloff Monday? Forget it. 
 A day after the stock market was shaken by the biggest setback of the year, investors went on a frenzied buying spree.
The Dow Jones industrial average soared 153.80 points, or 2.02 percent, to close at 7,758.06 yesterday, recovering the bulk of the 192 points it plunged on Monday.
The gains were fueled by heavy demand for drug, technology and tobacco shares, many of which had been out of favor a day earlier.
"What you see here is one of the enduring qualities of this bull market -- to buy the dips," said Richard E. Cripps, the chief market strategist at Legg Mason. "Whatever money poured out of the market yesterday was poured back in today."
Indeed, several analysts said that the market had overreacted on Monday to reports that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan had threatened to sell United States Treasury securities if Washington failed to stabilize the yen-dollar exchange rate.
An aide later said that Mr. Hashimoto's remarks had been misinterpreted. And yesterday, Japan's Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said his Government had no such plans.
Meanwhile, a chorus of prominent Wall Street analysts argued that the sharp selloff was unjustified.
"It was a question of shooting first and asking questions later," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "But then when the news cleared, the eternal optimism returned. So we're back to go."
Go is nearly 7,800 points on the Dow -- a 20 percent gain this year -- and nearly 900 on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Yesterday, the S.& P. 500 rose 17.72 points, also a jump of 2.02 percent, to 896.34.
Such returns have Wall Street in a bullish mood this year, and despite occasional jitters, investors are riding a wave of optimism based on strong earnings, low inflation and stable interest rates.
Yesterday, addressing a conference in New York, Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman Sachs strategist, said that the economy had been going in the right direction since 1991 and that she did not see the course altering any time soon.
There has been a "magic" about this economic expansion, she said, partly because the economy has grown at a moderate pace, and the cycle has lasted so long.
She called the apparent elasticity of this economic expansion the "Silly Putty cycle" and said that the biggest threat was not from within, but from without.
"The big surprises will likely not come from the U.S.," she said. "The real big swing factors will come from outside. If you're looking for swing factors, look to Japan and Europe."
In the meantime, Ms. Cohen is forecasting more of the same in this elongated bull cycle: strong profits, a robust economy and low inflation.
Even though valuations are at historically high levels, she said that the low level of inflation justified higher price-to-earnings ratios.
And judging by yesterday's market, many traders agree. Investors returned to perennial favorites: shares of the multinationals, like Merck and Philip Morris.
On Monday, all 30 Dow component stocks lost ground. Yesterday, 29 of them gained, led by Merck, up 4 1/2, to 103 1/8; I.B.M., up 4 1/16, to 91 13/16, and Philip Morris, up 1 7/16, to 44 3/16.
Drug stocks were the day's best performers. The American Stock Exchange's pharmaceutical index rose 4 percent, led by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which soared 8 3/8, to 84 3/4, after an analyst said the company might benefit from several recently patented cancer drugs.
Other drug issues also rose sharply. Pfizer rose 4 3/8 a share, to 115 5/8; Eli Lilly surged 3 15/16, to 109 15/16, and Abbott Labs rose 3 1/8, to 68.
Technology stocks were also strong. Shares of Microsoft rose 4, to 132 1/16; Intel was up 2 13/16, to 148, and Dell Computer was up 3 9/16, to 123.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index also did well, gaining 18.11 points, to 1,452.43. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks rose 2.48 points, to 393.30.
Yesterday was also the first day that most issues on the New York Stock Exchange could trade in sixteenths of a dollar, rather than eighths. "The systems worked well, and the people did well," said William Johnston, the Big Board's president. "It narrowed spreads to a sixteenth in the most liquid stocks."
Advancing issues outpaced decliners by a margin of about 9 to 5 on the Big Board; volume was heavy, at 554.1 million shares, up from 498.3 million on Monday.
With those gains, all the major indexes are back in record territory. And though analysts warn that the market could be facing an extended trading range or another downturn, few expect an end to one of the strongest bull markets in history.
"Stocks will move up unabated until investors get hit with something that really scares them," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief equity strategist at Gruntal & Company. "It'll be a bigger issue, such as the economy rolling over into recession. But absent of that, the tendency of the stock moves will be to go higher."

HEADLINE: In Florida, the Young Are Gaining on the Old

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
When the bell rings to signal a change of class at Parkway Middle School here, the principal, Willie Dudley, turns traffic cop as a mob of boisterous teen-agers pours out onto the 16-acre campus. His task is to get hundreds of students into their next classrooms within five minutes.
Ten minutes later, he is still yelling: "Let's go! Daniel! Don't make the girls late now, you're holding them up. Come on, you all. Come on, young lady. Jacob! Let's go! Come on, ladies, hustle up!" 
 Delays during class changes are one result of severe overcrowding at Parkway, a school built for 1,200 students that now has 1,800. The situation underscores a demographic shift that is giving a face lift to the state: Long identified with old people, Florida is struggling with a surge of young people.
Children 5 to 17 years of age now account for 2.2 million, or 16 percent, of the state's population of 14 million, demographers at the University of Florida say. That figure is up from 2.01 million in 1990 and is expected to go to more than 2.5 million in 2000. The growth rate among children in that age group is sprinting ahead of that for the elderly, with demographers projecting that from 1990 to 2000, the number of school-age children in the state will grow by 25 percent, while that of residents 65 and over will grow by 22 percent.
"Because Florida has this image of a retirement state, you tend to forget it has a bunch of kids," said Stan Smith, director of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida. "Right now, these kids are growing faster than the elderly population, and both groups are growing faster than the population as a whole."
At Parkway, lunch, served in five shifts over three hours, comes smack in the middle of some classes, splitting them into two short sessions. Nearly half the students attend at least some of their classes in trailers set on concrete blocks, some in the softball outfield. There is no home field advantage for Parkway's softball or track teams -- home games and meets are held at schools with enough space.
The overcrowding at Parkway reflects a crisis of such magnitude that Gov. Lawton Chiles has formed a commission to study the problem and plans to summon the State Legislature to a special session in the fall to deal with it.
The state's public school system of 2.2 million students is growing by about 60,000 new students each year, part of a national trend caused by a baby boomlet of the baby boomers, increased immigration and high fertility rates in the Hispanic population, Federal education and Census Bureau officials say. But here in Florida, the growth is among the fastest in the country and twice that of New York City, where the system of 1.1 million students is growing by 20,000 a year.
In Florida, the nation's retirement mecca, the trend has rejuvenated many areas, putting single-family home developments next to retirement villages and forcing baby strollers and canes to vie for the right of way at the mall.
At Century Village, a retirement community here in Broward County, some residents complain that their quality of life has been invaded by loud music, reckless driving and the construction of new homes and town houses that start at $100,000.
"The ladies with the baby carriages, you got to get out of their way or else they'll run you over," said Vincent Gaudiello, an 83-year-old resident of Century Village with his wife, Madeline, 73.
This friction between the old and the young may be inevitable, given the need of state officials to shift spending priorities. The proportion of people 65 and older in Florida peaked in 1995 at 19 percent, and it is not expected to rise again significantly until after 2010. By 2020, that group will make up nearly one-fourth of the state's population as the baby boomers age, according to demographic studies by the University of Florida. The school-age population is expected to be 15 percent by 2020, demographers say.
Youth-related issues like school overcrowding now top the government's agenda, forcing public officials to juggle resources to accommodate new needs, in addition to old needs like nursing-home care and social services for immigrants. State officials say they need to find $3 billion more for school construction in the next five years to keep up, in addition to the $11 billion spent each year to run the schools.
School officials and teachers' groups advocate raising taxes to build schools, but the Republican majority in the Legislature this year refused to break their no-new-tax pledge to voters and rejected proposals to raise a utilities tax or to allow school boards to raise local property taxes.
Some advocates for children say politicians still do not regard investing in younger generations as a priority, particularly when taking into account the cost of caring for older generations that are living longer.
"If you're 66 in America, you're guaranteed health care; if you're 6, you have to beg and borrow it," said Jack Levine, executive director of the Florida Center for Children and Youth. "It's a question of how we balance the generations, and right now, it's not favoring investing in children."
But Florida legislators play down any intergenerational conflict over government spending, with some noting that they are equally mindful of the needs of children and the elderly because the voters they regard as most critical -- those in the middle -- care about both.
"Their concern is their kids -- they've got to get a good education -- and their second concern is who's going to take care of grandma, who's going to pay?" said State Senator Locke Burt, an Ormond Beach Republican who is the majority leader.
For now, school overcrowding is taking center stage with the help of Governor Chiles, a Democrat who has made children a major theme of his last term.
The extent of the problem is still being defined, but in areas like South Florida, "some counties can build schools and still not catch up," said Bob Bedford, the State Department of Education's deputy commissioner for educational programs.
At least 300,000 of the state's public school students, or 14 percent of the student body, attend classes in portable classrooms, the Governor's Commission on Education said. In Broward County, school board officials list 33 of the county's 200 schools as "critically overcrowded," that is, at 125 to 175 percent of capacity. The county has one of the nation's fastest-growing school populations, according to the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents the largest school districts in the United States. In the last six years, enrollment increased 35 percent, the council said, the second-highest rate in the nation, after Las Vegas, Nev.
As state officials look for sources of money, they are considering everything from belt-tightening and cheaper construction methods to reversing some tax exemptions and expanding the lottery.
One problem that some school boards need to surmount is a blemished record on managing school construction -- by misspending the money on operating expenses or by permitting programs to become riddled with corruption. Some polls have shown that working-age voters with children are helping to defeat school bond issues because they doubt that the money will be spent well. The Republican-led Legislature says school systems must be held accountable before it approves more money for school construction.
The Legislature has already taken one step: It passed a law this year declaring that 75 percent of the state's portable classrooms are permanent, rather than temporary -- in effect, lowering the estimate of the need for new schools.
"That's like calling ketchup a vegetable," said Mr. Levine of the Florida Center for Children and Youth.
Some state officials like Mr. Bedford, of the Florida Department of Education, say that failure to address school overcrowding effectively may have a ripple effect on the economy, from the poor academic performance of students entering the job market to reluctance by some businesses to relocate to Florida.
At Parkway Middle School, a magnet school for the performing arts, student concerns dealt more with not having enough time to eat lunch (a half-hour) and the pushing and shoving when school lets out and 46 buses line up to take the students home, giving the school the maddening pace of Grand Central Terminal.
Worse, some students said, individual attention from teachers is scant.
"You have to be one of those people who catch up quick because the teacher is not going to stop to help you," said Laura Denny, 12, a sixth grader.
A new $3.4 million building is being built to replace 24 portable classrooms by next year. But the principal, Mr. Dudley, was anything but hopeful. "We'll still need portables," he said. "We won't catch up."

HEADLINE: John Akii-Bua, 47, Is Dead; Ugandan Won Olympic Gold

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY 

 BODY:
John Akii-Bua, a slender hurdler who surprisingly won an Olympic gold medal in 1972 and almost paid for it with his life, died last Friday in Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. He was 47 years old.
Roger Byamugisha, the third secretary of the Uganda Mission to the United Nations in New York, said the cause of death had not been announced. He did confirm that Akii-Bua had undergone treatment for a week for what had been reported to be abdominal pains. At his death, Akii-Bua was a senior superintendent with the Ugandan police. 
 In 1972, after only one international competition, Akii-Bua arrived at the Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. His opposition in the 400-meter hurdles included Dave Hemery of Britain, the world record-holder and defending Olympic champion, and Ralph Mann, an American. His only pair of running shoes was two years old, and one shoe was missing a spike.
But he was built ideally (6 feet 2 inches and 170 pounds), and he had trained with frightening intensity. In the six months before the Olympics, his training had included wearing a vest weighted with 25 pounds in lead as he ran 1,500 meters over five hurdles that were 42 inches high -- the hurdles for his race were 36 inches. He did four sets of those repetitions, twice a day, every day.
He won the Olympic gold medal in 47.82 seconds, a world record, leaving the silver medalist, Mann (48.51 seconds), and the bronze medalist, Hemery (48.52), six meters behind. Then he ran a victory lap and jumped over the hurdles again.
Akii-Bua's life would never be the same. Akii-Bua returned home as a hero, and to this day he remains the only Ugandan to win an Olympic gold medal in track and field. But his nation, under the dictatorship of Gen. Idi Amin, was torn by tribal factions and financial crises. Amin was purging the Lango tribe, and Akii-Bua was a Lango.
The Government, while celebrating his achievement, soon restricted his movements. It eventually barred him from taking his wife and children with him to international competitions, afraid he would defect. It cut off twice-a-year training trips to Germany. It reached a point, Akii-Bua said, where he had to stay home and do nothing except listen to Diana Ross records.
Friends told him that his life was in danger. He said it was difficult to even know who his friends were.
"You know how people become jealous when someone is getting such attention," his wife, Joyce, said in 1979. "In Uganda, people who are jealous send others to kill for them."
Akii-Bua did not defect. He said in 1978: "If I had not won that gold medal, perhaps I could leave Uganda. But I won the highest honor in track for my country, so I couldn't leave it. Uganda was, in effect, a prison. I guess Amin wanted to put me in jail several times, but I guess he didn't do it because I was too prominent a person."
In 1979, with Tanzanian troops about to capture Kampala, Akii-Bua, his wife and their three children fled to Kenya.
As a police official under Amin, he was jailed there for three weeks. He was almost shipped back to Uganda to almost certain death until the West German Embassy and Puma, the German sports-shoe company whose shoes he wore, helped him get his freedom.
He sent his wife and children to West Germany and soon joined them there.
But first he returned to Kampala to check on his family and home. He learned that five brothers and a sister had been killed (his father, a county chief who died in 1965, had 43 children with eight wives). He found his house destroyed by bombs. It had been looted. His Olympic gold medal was gone.
He could not defend his Olympic title in 1976 because black African nations boycotted the Montreal Olympics.
Because he had little time to sharpen his speed, he did not fare well in the 1980 Moscow Olympics and was eliminated in the semifinals. Under a new democratic government, he returned to Uganda in 1983 and became the national coach.
When he died, he was a widower with 11 children. His body lay in state yesterday in the parliament building in Kampala.
Prime Minister Kintu Musoke will lead the Government delegation at a state funeral today.

HEADLINE: House Defeats Effort to Punish China by Curbing Trade

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
In a 259-to-173 vote, the House today easily rejected the annual attempt to punish China by ending its normal trading status with the United States.
Speakers on all sides accused China of political and religious persecution. But strong lobbying efforts by business and retail interests and the Clinton Administration overcame a coalition of opponents that ranged from unions to the conservative Family Research Council. 
 Even so, the 173 votes registered by critics of China represented the highest total since 1992, when Congress passed limits on Beijing's trade privileges but failed to override a veto by President Bush. Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican and a leading foe of China, predicted victory next year.
President Clinton, hoping today's bipartisan vote would help other trade efforts this year, said the action "makes clear that the right way to encourage further progress in China is not to cut China out but to draw China in."
On the House floor today, there were two central winning arguments. One paralleled Mr. Clinton's. Representative Lee H. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat and former chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, insisted that there could be no political engagement with China without economic cooperation. "Engagement works," he said. "Engagement has a proven record of moving China toward international norms." Revoking normal trade status, he said "will almost certainly make the human rights situation in China worse, not better."
The other key argument was local, from lawmakers whose districts need trade with China. Rural legislators spoke of farm exports. Many members cited business done in China by hometown companies. And lawmakers from Washington state looked out for Boeing. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, said that cutting trade amounted to "taking freedom away from Americans."
Against those arguments the most important voice was Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, who cited the effect of United States sanctions against South Africa and pleaded: "This country is not about just business. This country is about an idea, a moral belief that every human being in the world is created with liberty and freedom. If we don't stand for freedom in China, who will? If we don't lead for freedom in China, who will follow?"
Under the 1974 trade act, normal trade privileges -- confusingly known as most-favored-nation status -- cannot be permanently awarded to a nation that does not allow completely free emigration. But a President can keep this status in force from year to year by issuing waivers. Congress has never come close to the two-thirds majority it would take to override a veto of a resolution to overturn a waiver.
The vote today came just six days before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control. That was no coincidence. Administration officials, backed by House Republican leaders, wanted the vote behind them in case protests during the handover ceremonies, and China's reaction to them, created a hostile backlash that would turn the vote around.
The lobbying effort operated on the retail level, too.
One retailer warned that "Tickle Me Elmo" dolls would soar in price if higher tariffs were imposed in Chinese goods. But one Presidential adviser cringed, saying at last weekend's economic summit in Denver, "It made it sound like we should decide China policy at Toys 'R' Us."
In today's vote, 147 Republicans voted for current status and 79 opposed it. Among Democrats, 112 supported current status, and 93 opposed it, as did the one independent in the House. In both parties, the margins were narrower than a year ago, when the vote was 286 to 141.
The debate gained new heat from charges that China had spent money in last year's election campaign. Mr. Wolf said, "the long arm of the Chinese Government has reached into our Government."
Except for Mr. Hamilton's passion, it was the opponents of maintaining normal status who were most emotional. Mr. Wolf complained of "Buddhist nuns raped with a cattle prod."
Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, quoted Mohandas K. Gandhi as saying "Non-cooperation with evil is as much a duty as cooperating with good."
Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of New York, said "engagement theorists don't have the guts to truly engage China and let them know that their behavior is disgusting."
Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, scoffed at arguments about United States sales to China, saying "Freedom should mean more than selling fertilizer."
In contrast, supporters like Representative Philip M. Crane, Republican of Illinois, contended soberly, "The free exchange of commerce and ideas offers the best hope we have to project the light of freedom into Communist China."
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: "Shutting down trade with China, or making the terms of trade impossibly restrictive, would put in place a policy of unilateral confrontation that would not change China's behavior. Indeed, such a policy would disengage our Government from a leadership role in the region and would remove the positive influence that our business community has in China."
After the vote Sandy Berger, the White House national security adviser, said he hoped a way could be found to avoid these annual votes.
But opponents made it clear they would try again. Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, said "This issue will confront us, time and again, until American foreign policy reflects the will of the American people."
And Patrick J. Buchanan, the unsuccessful Republican Presidential candidate of 1992 and 1996, said: "In yielding to Clinton's demand that it renew trade privileges for the Chinese dictatorship, the Republican House has made itself a full partner and collaborator in his policy of appeasement. It is a day to be ashamed to be a Republican."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Communists Are Coming, And Stocks Are Soaring

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, June 24

 BODY:
Just like its older cousin in New York, the Hong Kong stock market is benefiting from a robust economy and stable interest rates, and last week it hit highs and saw record volume.
The difference is that Hong Kong is about to be absorbed by Communist China. 
 With just days to go before Hong Kong is handed from Britain to China on July 1, the market here is confounding even optimistic forecasters, virtually none of whom foresaw this bullish sentiment on the eve of such a precarious historical moment.
Not long ago, Hong Kong's stock market and property markets were expected to be suffering badly in 1997, on the assumption that mainland Chinese rule would devastate economic and political life here. Instead, both markets are near their highs.
Optimism about China's surging economy and growing openness have been the moving force. In the last 12 months, while Asia as a whole has been a tepid region for investors, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index has climbed more than 30 percent, bursting through the previously unreached barrier of 15,000 last Friday. It has not been an uninterrupted ascent, of course, with gains punctuated by periods of volatility and price weakness.
"The Hong Kong market in recent years has been trading at a discount because of the coming change," said Christopher Wood, Asian and Emerging Markets strategist at Peregrine, a Hong Kong-based investment bank. "What's been happening this year is that the discount has narrowed as people become more confident that the hand-over will go smoothly."
One factor, other analysts said, is a widespread expectation that Chinese authorities will take steps to insure that Hong Kong's market remains buoyant during and after the hand-over, part of an effort to show the world how confident Hong Kong is about its future.
"Everyone figures, 'China will make sure the market stays high, so I may as well get in beforehand,' " said a senior executive at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. "But no one expected it to get this high."
In fact, the market got even hotter than Beijing wanted, partly because of a rush to sell new offerings of shares by companies with mainland interests, locally known as red chips, which have climbed even faster than the rest of the market this year.
Last Friday, partly to cool the feverish interest in these mainland companies, Beijing announced new measures that make it harder for red chips to win approval to raise money in Hong Kong. Until now, red chip companies have enjoyed significantly less regulation than Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.
The new measures came as a surprise -- no one expected Beijing to introduce new market-cooling regulations so close to the hand-over. Yet China's regulators seemed concerned by the near-frenzy of buying in Hong Kong stocks and apparently calculated that their new rules would rein in some exuberance without causing too sharp a drop.
As it turned out, the market indeed fell somewhat in Monday's and today's sessions. The Hang Seng index closed today at 14,890.96, down 130.27.
Even as it cools slightly, the general exuberance in Hong Kong's market still seems dangerously high, some economists say, if not quite irrational.
"Overexcitement can lead to underexcitement," said Miron Mushkat, chief economist at Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong. "If everything collapses six months later, these gains will be viewed as having been an artificial bubble. That will be very disappointing."
Even so, Mr. Mushkat said he saw positive signs that the market would remain strong for the rest of the year, a sentiment that is widely echoed by other economists and analysts and brokers.
Hong Kong's long-term future seems harder to predict. Envisioning possible outcomes has almost become a parlor game in the city's financial community, and everyone seems to have an opinion.
Gary Coull, chief executive of Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, predicted that Hong Kong would grow steadily as a financial center in the coming decades, even if it tended to act more as a place for Chinese companies to raise capital than as an international center.
"The Hong Kong financial community will easily grow to supplant other centers in Asia," Mr. Coull said. "The idea of Hong Kong as an international financial center might suffer, but its role for China will more than compensate."
With 350,000 enterprises in China that need money, Mr. Coull predicted, 300 or so will probably attempt public offerings each year for the next 20 years, and many of those will undoubtedly be in Hong Kong.
In contrast, an economist, Marc Faber, foresees the demise of Hong Kong's singular position over the next decade, primarily because with high real estate and other prices, it could lose its competitive edge.
"It was the only bridge to China for a long time," Mr. Faber said. "But you can have lots of bridges to China now, so you can't keep charging a high toll."
Known in Hong Kong for his contrarian gloominess, which has earned him the name "Dr. Doom," Mr. Faber predicted that within 10 years, Hong Kong would simply be one of 20 large cities in southern China, with few of its privileges left.
Then again, a decade ago, when the transition to Chinese rule was only in the distant future, that is what many people expected Hong Kong to be by now. Since then, moves like the appointment of a shipping magnate, Tung Chee-hwa, as the future leader of Hong Kong, have reassured some investors.
"If you'd said 10 years ago that the stock and property markets would be at an all-time high," Mr. Wood of Peregrine said, "that senior members of the civil service would all be staying on, that a businessman like C. H. Tung would be chief executive, well, no one would have believed you."

U.N. Monitor Says Iraq Is Bluffing on Disarmament
The outgoing leader of the United Nations commission in charge of monitoring Iraq's disarmament, Rolf Ekeus, said Iraq had consistently refused to cooperate with inspectors, using alibis he compared to "Thousand and One Nights." He said scientists there were still under orders to be ready to make lethal chemical weapons at short notice, even if stocks are destroyed. A1
 
China Trade Wins House Vote
Congress renewed China's normal trade privileges, known as "most favored nation" status, with the United States. The vote was 259 to 173 against punishing China for its human rights record, an annual proposal which received more votes this year than any time since 1992. A6 

American Freed in Hong Kong
Hong Kong authorities released a senior United States immigration official from custody. The official was arrested a year ago for trying to sell blank passports to help people illegally enter the United States. He had argued in court that his life might be endangered after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule, but officials said he was released because he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in a pending case against another United States immigration official.

Netanyahu Survives Vote
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel scraped through a no-confidence vote following an angry debate in the Parliament. His plans to re-arrange the Cabinet were blocked, however, by the insistence of a Likud hawk, Ariel Sharon, that he not only take over the powerful Finance Ministry but that he also be included with the Defense and Foreign Ministers in shaping negotiating strategy with the Palestinians.

Croatia Loan Delayed by U.S.
The Clinton Administration, frustrated by the failure of President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia to comply with the accords that ended the war in the former Yugoslavia, succeeded in postponing a vote on a $30 million World Bank loan. But the Administration stopped short of opposing the loan outright, and it appeared to be having difficulty winning support from other members of the World Bank's governing body to postpone the loan for long.

U.F.O. Report Released
The Air Force made public its latest report on the famous 1947 incident in the New Mexico desert near the town of Roswell that is at the heart of claims by flying-saucer fans that extraterrestrials have visited the Earth and which has become a celebrated part of American popular culture. The report, in voluminous detail, debunks the supposed evidence. B7

Impasse in Ratings Talks

Drug Report Tracks Trends
Many people who snort heroin have taken to injecting the drug for a more efficient high, according to a report on national trends in illicit drug use. Other drug users have begun substituting heroin for crack cocaine, dismissing crack as a ghetto drug and believing that heroin is easier to manage, the report found. A14

Abortion Ban Endorsed
The American Medical Association endorsed a Federal ban on a type of late-term abortion, a ban that imposes criminal penalties on doctors who perform the procedure.

In a letter to President Clinton, the New York Republican joined other party leaders from northeastern states, including Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who have spoken out strongly in defense of the E.P.A.'s proposal to tighten health standards for smog and soot. A13

Escalating their attacks on the performance of W. Ann Reynolds, the Chancellor of the City University of New York, the new chairwoman and vice chairman of the university's board said yesterday that they would assess her performance in coming months to see whether she should continue in her job.
But the chairwoman, Anne A. Paolucci, also suggested that Dr. Reynolds could ease the process by simply resigning. 
 Dr. Paolucci and the vice chairman, Herman Badillo, criticized Dr. Reynolds for failing to monitor the performance of students at CUNY's 21 branch campuses sufficiently, for tolerating grade inflation, for failing to inform them about important problems on campuses, and for creating an environment of intimidation that made college presidents unwilling to give information to trustees.
Board members recently stepped up their public criticism of Dr. Reynolds following their decision to require that students at CUNY's six community colleges, including Hostos in the Bronx, pass a university writing test to earn their degrees. When they made their decision, board members say, they thought they were simply reinforcing existing policy, since Dr. Reynolds had assured them that all the colleges already required the test.
They also say that the community college presidents, who were at the board's meeting, failed to tell them that most of their colleges did not require the test.
The board was recently reshaped by Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and while some trustees still strongly support Dr. Reynolds, who was named to the post seven years ago, the new board majority has been increasingly critical. The complaints about Dr. Reynolds, made during a meeting yesterday with editors and reporters at The New York Times, were their strongest yet.
Also attending the meeting was Ronald J. Marino, the chairman of the board's fiscal affairs committee, and a lawyer, Michael D. Hess, of Chadbourne & Parke, whom the board recently hired as its own counsel. Dr. Reynolds did not attend.
Contacted after the meeting, Dr. Reynolds declined to be interviewed but issued a statement reiterating her desire to work with the trustees: "Whenever new trustees are appointed to a higher education governing board, the chief executive officer is obliged to adjust to new expectations. I welcome the opportunity to work with all trustees to assist in the formulation and implementation of new policies to further advance CUNY's mission and well-being."
Despite their criticisms, the trustees yesterday said again that they had no formal plan to dismiss her. But Dr. Paolucci suggested strongly that the Chancellor should resign, citing a recent article in The Chronicle of Higher Education, which she said made the case that when presidents or chancellors do not agree with or implement the policies of their boards, they should leave.
Chancellor Reynolds, however, has given no sign she will do so. Asked whether they had the nine votes on the 16-member board necessary for dismissal, Dr. Paolucci quickly responded, "Oh yes, we have the votes." Mr. Badillo hedged a bit, and said it might be close. Mr. Marino said it is "up in the air."
Dr. Paolucci then added: "There isn't a block of votes. There are new people on the board who vote with us some of the time, but are not always in accord with us."
"I can't say the new trustees will vote as a block," she said, alluding to Alfred Curtis and Kenneth Cook, the newest Pataki and Giuliani appointees, who joined the board last week.
Dismissing the Chancellor, Dr. Paolucci said, is a process that "has to be explored and discussed very carefully. We have to go along with what we have until it can be discussed in clear terms."
Complicating the issue, Mr. Marino added, is that the Chancellor "is not an incompetent person."
"If she was," he said, "it would be easy. This is a very competent, very skillful, very intelligent person. The issue is more one of, can a chief executive work with a new group of trustees who view their fiduciary responsibility very differently from the former board, which appears to have taken a more passive role."
"There might be philosophical differences between our views and the views of the last board," Mr. Marino continued. "So it is only fair to give the chief executive time to deal with these differences, and to provide us with adequate time to evaluate her."
He and his colleagues said that they would be watching the Chancellor's actions on such issues as remedial classes, grade inflation and the budget, as well as English as a second language.
At the board meeting on Monday, the trustees asked the Chancellor to report to them by Aug. 1 on whether the community colleges have been requiring the university writing test for graduation, and if not, what requirements they have imposed.
They also told Dr. Reynolds to direct the colleges to require the exam for all graduates. And finally, they asked for her recommendations on how they should reprimand the community college presidents for not being more forthcoming.
And Mr. Badillo said the Chancellor had let the colleges inflate grades. He said that at Brooklyn College, one of CUNY's strongest four-year colleges, nearly half of the college's 1,450 graduates in 1996 graduated with honors of cum laude, magna cum laude and summa cum laude. He also said that at Hostos Community College, the bilingual college he helped to found, half of the students were getting A's and B's.
"The Chancellor said that Harvard has the same thing," Mr. Badillo said. "I said Harvard is not the same thing."

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo;
Unanimity of Budget Deal Quickly Falls by the Wayside

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
On May 2, the drums rolled, the champagne corks popped and President Clinton and the Republican Congress announced that they had reached a historic agreement to cut taxes, increase spending on several programs and balance the budget in five years.
Now, less than two months later, the President has threatened to veto the tax bill. Senator Trent Lott, the Republican leader, has called Mr. Clinton "a spoiled brat." The Republican majority leader in the House, Representative Dick Armey, has said he does not feel bound by the budget agreement. And the Senate Finance Committee has approved radical changes in the Medicare program that were never even discussed by the budget negotiators. 
 So what is going on? Was there an agreement or not?
The answer is that there was an agreement, in principle, to balance the budget in a way that all politicians could go along with and that would cause none of their constituents any grief. That was the framework. But when they got around to filling in the details, the politicians realized that there was no universally popular way to accomplish their goals.
For instance, Republicans found that too little money had been allocated for tax cuts to accommodate fully the two main elements of their party: the social conservatives who want across-the-board tax reductions for families and the Wall Street faction that wants more favorable tax treatment for investors.
The White House discovered that the kinds of tax cuts the Republicans were talking about would be of little help to one of the main Democratic constituencies -- low-income workers -- and that there was only limited enthusiasm for the education tax cuts the President was promoting.
Democrats in Congress, on the sidelines in the budget negotiations, felt no compunction to help out either the Republicans or the President.
In the meantime, the politicians had a head-rush of the political bad blood that had been momentarily calmed at the end of the budget talks in May. The Republicans, employing the same disastrous tactic they tried the winter before last when they allowed the Government to shut down, tried to force the President to sign measures he opposed by adding ideological riders to an essential bill providing relief to flood victims in the Midwest. Mr. Clinton faced them down, just as he had on the question of the Government shutdowns.
Republicans are now acting as if they are determined to get even in the weeks ahead, and the tool of their revenge may well be the budget.
What happens now is that the House and Senate will debate this week and presumably approve their respective bills involving taxes and the benefits the Government pays to individuals.
Usually, these matters are considered together. But Republicans split taxes and benefits into separate bills this year, mainly to weaken the Democrats' argument that Republicans want to cut Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.
The House and Senate bills are quite different on matters from tobacco and capital gains taxes to long-term Medicare policy. These differences will be addressed by a conference committee after the lawmakers return to Washington. They are taking next week off to celebrate Independence Day.
While the House and Senate were working on their separate bills, the President's role was limited to sniping from afar. But the White House will be deeply involved in the conference negotiations. What to keep an eye on is whether the conferees try to write legislation that Mr. Clinton finds acceptable or whether they will approve bills that amount to veto bait. This may not be resolved until some time in the fall, if then.
Nonetheless, some items in the House and Senate bills for which strong, logical arguments can be made will probably not make it into the final version. One example is the House's measure that would adjust the value of capital gains to account for inflation, a procedure known as indexation.
Many people believe it is unfair to tax the part of a profit from an investment that has been eroded by inflation. But the consensus of experts is that indexing capital gains and not including other financial transactions like interest payments would be economically unsound and would create an administrative nightmare.
Some day, the Government will probably decide to charge affluent elderly people more for their Medicare coverage, but the necessary political spadework has apparently been insufficient for enactment of such a major change in the Medicare rules this year.
And the Senate's plan to raise the Federal cigarette tax by as much as 20 cents a pack will almost certainly be resisted in the House, where almost all Republicans have pledged to oppose any new taxes.
While the main interest this week will be focused on the tax and benefits legislation, lawmakers elsewhere in the Capitol are working on appropriations bills. This is the legislation that provides money to operate the Government -- to pay for salaries, for paper clips and parks, for battleships and border control.
The appropriations bills are where the battles will be fought on such issues as education spending and environmental protection.
When the President and Congressional leaders announced on that Friday in May that they had reached an agreement, they said they had finally set politics aside and joined together to pursue a common goal. "A balanced budget with balanced values," President Clinton called it.
The truce seemed too good to be true.
It was.

HEADLINE: Bonavista Journal;
Canada Honors Its Birthplace, but Where Is It, Eh?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: BONAVISTA, Newfoundland, June 24

 BODY:
Precisely 500 years ago today, a flimsy, 70-foot English caravel called the Matthew plowed through the heavy fog of the icy sea and dropped anchor at this rocky spit of land.
Or maybe not. 
 In history, detail is everything. But when it comes to something as sensitive as the founding myth of a nation, especially a nation as uneasy with its own history as Canada, the truth can seem as clear as North Atlantic fog.
There is no doubt about the date, June 24, 1497. Or the ship, Ye Matthew, which left Bristol, England, 53 days earlier. Or the ship's captain, a footloose Italian navigator named Giovanni Cabotto, a.k.a. John Cabot.
The rest should be history. But for at least a century, the site of Cabot's true landfall has been pinpointed with patriotic fervor, if not historical accuracy, in a succession of places from the foreboding coast of Labrador to lovely Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. Even the state of Maine has made some half-hearted attempts to lay claim to Cabot.
The celebration that brought Queen Elizabeth and the Irish Prime Minister, John Bruton, here today to brave rude winds and threatening skies may not be the most historically accurate claim about the birthplace of England's first overseas colony, but it certainly has been the most successful.
"When I started school I was always taught that John Cabot landed at Bonavista and discovered Newfoundland in 1497," said Patrick Tremblett, 35, a fisherman and mayor of Bonavista, who sat next to the Duke of Edinburgh as a replica of the Matthew reenacted the landing at ceremonies today. "It's not like we were waiting to be the chosen place. We just grew up knowing that was a fact. In my mind there's no argument, no debate. That's just the way it is."
Over the last few years, a succession of Newfoundland officials lobbied for about $7 million in federal funds to throw a grand party for the anniversary of Cabot's landing in Bonavista. The gamble appears to have paid off for this province, one of Canada's poorest, and especially for Bonavista, an old maritime center of 4,600 residents, about 180 miles northeast of St. John's, which is lined with weary wooden houses from the glory days when the cod were running.
The federal government still does not officially endorse the province's claim that Cabot landed here first, although Heritage Minister Sheila Copps today asked Canadians to "remember that our country was founded here."
Peter E. Pope, a historian at Memorial University in St. John's, Newfoundland, said much of the confusion over Cabot's landfall stems from the fact that there was no written journal of the voyage. Generations of politicians found it convenient to fill in the gaps themselves.
At the 400th anniversary in 1897, Canadian historians interpreted the few extant details about Cabot's trip to make it appear that he had first set foot on a piece of Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. They saw fit to change the landing to Bonavista only after Newfoundland joined the Canadian confederation in 1949.
When it comes to celebrating their own history, Canadians are often at a loss. A recent survey found that high school graduates cannot even name the century in which important events in Canadian history took place and they are so overwhelmed by patriotic preening across the border that they routinely identify heroes of the United States -- Neil Armstrong and Norman Rockwell, for example -- as their own.
"For many years, we thought we could have the railroad stitching us together as a nation instead of history," said Palmacchio Di Iulio, executive director of the Columbus Center, an ethnic organization in Toronto, who has tried to get more recognition in Canada for the achievements of Cabot or Cabotto. "It is sad that we Canadians do not know our own history."
Queen Elizabeth seemed not to harbor any doubts. She called Cabot's arrival in Bonavista "the geographical and intellectual beginning of North America." His voyage was also the beginning of Egnland's overseas empire, an empire that will all but sputter out when Hong Kong is handed back to China.
"The world has, of course, been transformed since Cabot landed here," said the Queen.
The competition has extended beyond a tussle over the site of the landing. On March 6, Canada's Labatt Brewing Company -- the official brewery of the celebration -- launched Cabot Beer to commemorate the landing. Molson, another Canadian brewer, then started calling its Black Horse Beer, "the unofficial brew of Cabot's crew." Labatt, not amused, demanded the ads be withdrawn.
Nobody in Canada seems to want to spoil Newfoundland's party, especially since the province has been so down on its luck lately. The cod fishery that began in Cabot's day has all but collapsed, and the local economy is so depressed that Newfoundland's population has dropped by 17,000 in the last five years.
Cape Breton and Nova Scotia are also observing the anniversary. Native Indian groups marked the landing as the beginning of the genocide against their people. And some scholars have been cheeky enough to raise the issue of whether Cabot actually was the first Old World visitor, or had been preceded by the Vikings, St. Brendan or Basque fishermen.
No one expects this "argument unfinished" to be resolved anytime soon. After examining the replica of the Matthew and talking with the crew today, a chilled Queen Elizabeth rushed from the Bonavista waterfront. In a few days, the Matthew itself will be gone. The crowds will stop coming and Bonavista will go back to being its windy, wayward self.
But it will have secured its history. At least according to the people here.
"Anyone can say Cabot landed in my backyard, but they have no proof," said Mayor Tremblett. "We had the Queen and Prince Phillip, the Matthew itself and dignitaries from all over the world. They all seem to think the Cabot landfall was in Bonavista, so this must say something for us."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Agreement Between States and Tobacco Industry

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the proposal for a settlement reached last Friday by tobacco industry representatives, a group of state attorneys general and plaintiffs' lawyers. The agreement is expected to alter the nation's legal, regulatory and public health landscape permanently. Among other changes, the proposed settlement would require cigarette companies to pay $368.5 billion over the next 25 years to compensate states for the costs of treating smoking-related illness, to finance nationwide anti- smoking programs and to underwrite health care for millions of uninsured children. The text was downloaded from the Web site at http://stic.neu.edu run by the State Tobacco Information Center, an information clearing house created to provide information for the public and attorneys general involved in the case.
 
Preamble
This legislation would mandate a total reformation and restructuring of how tobacco products are manufactured, marketed and distributed in this country. The nation can thereby see real and swift progress in preventing underage use of tobacco, addressing the adverse health effects of tobacco use and changing the corporate culture of the tobacco industry. 
 The Food and Drug Administration and other public health authorities view the use of tobacco products by our nation's children as a "pediatric disease" of epic and worsening proportions that results in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults. There is also a consensus within the scientific and medical communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous and cause cancer, heart disease and other serious adverse health effects.
The F.D.A. and other health authorities have concluded that virtually all new users of tobacco products are under legal age. President Clinton, the F.D.A., the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and public health authorities all believe that tobacco advertising and marketing contribute significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco products by adolescents. These officials have concluded that because past efforts to restrict advertising and marketing have failed to curb adolescent tobacco use, sweeping new restrictions on the sale, promotion and distribution of such products are needed.
Until now, Federal and state governments have lacked many of the legal means and resources they need to address the societal problems caused by the use of tobacco products. These officials have been armed only with crude regulatory tools which they view as inadequate to achieve the public health objectives with which they are charged.
This legislation greatly strengthens both the Federal and state governments' regulatory arsenal and furnishes them with additional resources needed to address a public health problem that affects millions of Americans, including most importantly underage tobacco use. Further, it is contemplated that certain of the obligations of the tobacco companies will be implemented by a binding, enforceable contractual protocol.
The legislation reaffirms individuals' right of access to the courts, to civil trial by jury and to full compensatory damages. Resolution through the act of potential punitive damages liability of the tobacco industry for past conduct is only made in the context of the comprehensive settlement proposed by the legislation. It is not intended to have precedential effect, nor does it express any position adverse to the imposition of punitive damages in general or as applied to any other specific industry, case, controversy or product and does not provide any authority whatsoever regarding the propriety of punitive damages.
Among other things, the new regime would:
*Confirm F.D.A.'s authority to regulate tobacco products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, making F.D.A. not only the pre-eminent regulatory agency with respect to the manufacture, marketing and distribution of tobacco products but also requiring the tobacco industry to fund F.D.A.'s oversight out of ongoing payments by the manufacturers pursuant to the new regime ("Industry Payments").
*Go beyond F.D.A.'s current regulations to ban all outdoor tobacco advertising and to eliminate cartoon characters and human figures, such as Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man, two tobacco icons which the public health community has long assailed as advertising appealing to our nation's youth.
*Impose and provide funding out of the Industry Payments for an aggressive Federal enforcement program, including a state-administered retail licensing system, to stop minors from obtaining tobacco products, while in no way preventing the states from enacting additional measures.
*Insure that the F.D.A. and the states have the regulatory flexibility to address issues of particular concern to public health officials, such as youth tobacco usage and tobacco dependence.
*Subject the tobacco industry to severe financial surcharges in the event under-age tobacco use does not decline radically over the next decade.
*Empower the Federal Government to set national standards controlling the manufacturing of tobacco products and the ingredients used in such products.
*Provide new and flexible regulatory enforcement powers to insure that the tobacco industry works to develop and introduce "less-hazardous tobacco products" including, among other things, vesting F.D.A. with the power to regulate the levels of nicotine in tobacco products.
*Require the manufacturers of tobacco products to disclose all previously nonpublic internal laboratory research and all new internal laboratory research generated in the future relating to the health effects or safety of their products.
*Establish a minimum Federal standard with tough restrictions on smoking in public places with enforcement funding from the Industry Payments, while preserving the authority of state and local governments to enact even more severe standards.
*Authorize and fund from Industry Payments a $500 million annual, national education-oriented counter-advertising and tobacco control campaign seeking to discourage the initiation of tobacco use by children and adolescents and to encourage current tobacco product users to quit use of the products.
*Authorize and fund from Industry Payments the annual payment to all states of significant, ongoing financial compensation to fund health benefits program expenditures and to establish and fund a tobacco products liability judgments and settlement fund.
*Authorize and fund from Industry Payments a nationwide program, administered through state governments and the private sector, of smoking cessation.
The sale of tobacco products to adults would remain legal but subject to restrictive measures to insure that they are not sold to under-age purchasers. These measures respond directly to concerns voiced by Federal and state public health officials, the public health community and the public at large that the tobacco industry should be subject to the strictest scrutiny and regulatory oversight. This statute imposes regulatory controls, including civil and criminal penalties, equal to, and in many respects exceeding, those imposed on other regulated industries. Further, it imposes on tobacco manufacturers the obligation to provide funding from Industry Payments for an array of public health initiatives.
The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising and use of tobacco products are activities substantially affecting interstate commerce. Such products are sold, marketed, advertised and distributed in interstate commerce on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the nation's economy. The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising and use of such products are also activities substantially affecting interstate commerce by virtue of the health care and other costs that federal and state governmental authorities have attributed to usage of tobacco products.
Various civil actions are pending in state and Federal courts arising from the use, marketing or sale of tobacco products. Among these actions are cases brought by some 40 state attorneys general, cases brought by certain cities and counties, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other third-party payer cases seeking to recover monies spent treating tobacco-related diseases and for the protection of minors and consumers. Also pending in courts throughout the United States are various private putative class action lawsuits brought on behalf of individuals claiming to be dependent upon and injured by tobacco products. Additionally, a multitude of individual suits have been filed against the tobacco products manufacturers and/or their distributors, trade associations, law firms and consultants.
All of these civil actions are complex, slow-moving, expensive and burdensome, not only for the litigants but also for the nation's state and Federal judiciaries. Moreover, none of those litigations has to date resulted in the collection of any monies to compensate smokers or third-party payers. Only national legislation offers the prospect of a swift, fair, equitable and consistent result that would serve the public interest by (1) insuring that a portion of the costs of treatment for diseases and adverse health effects linked to the use of tobacco products is borne by the manufacturers of these products, and (2) restricting nationwide the sale, distribution, marketing and advertising of tobacco products to persons of legal age. The unique position occupied by tobacco in the nation's history and economy, the magnitude of actual and potential tobacco-related litigation, the need to avoid the cost, expense, uncertainty and inconsistency associated with such protracted litigation, the need to limit the sale, distribution, marketing and advertising of tobacco products to persons of legal age, and the need to educate the public, especially young people, of the health effects of using tobacco products all dictate that it would be in the public interest to enact this legislation to facilitate a resolution of the matters described.
Public health authorities believe that the societal benefits of this legislation, in human and economic terms, would be vast. In particular, F.D.A. has found that reducing underage tobacco use by 50 percent "would prevent well over 60,000 early deaths." F.D.A. has estimated that the monetary value of its present regulations will be worth up to $43 billion per year in reduced medical costs, improved productivity and the benefit of avoiding the premature death of loved ones. This statute, which extends far beyond anything F.D.A. has previously proposed or attempted, can be expected to produce human and economic benefits many times greater than such existing regulations.
As part of this settlement, the tobacco companies recognize the historic changes that will be occurring to their business. They will fully comply with increased Federal regulation, focus intense efforts on dramatic reductions in youth access and youth tobacco usage, recognize that the regulatory scheme encourages the development of products with reduced risk and acknowledge the predominant public health positions associated with the use of tobacco products. . . .
 
Reformation Of the Tobacco Industry
. . . The legislation would incorporate and expand upon F.D.A.'s recent regulation of nicotine-containing tobacco products.
The following rules would apply to all tobacco products sold in the United States (including all its territories and possessions, as well as duty-free shops within United States borders). The new regime would be allowed to operate as described below for five years. F.D.A. would have authority to make revisions even within this period under extraordinary circumstances. Thereafter, the F.D.A. would be authorized to review and revise the rules under applicable Agency procedures.
 
Restrictions on Marketing And Advertising
The advertising and marketing of tobacco products would be drastically curtailed, including in ways that exceed the F.D.A. rule as originally promulgated and in ways that have previously been challenged on First Amendment grounds. As in the F.D.A. rule, the new regime would:
*Prohibit the use of nontobacco brand names as brand names of tobacco products except for tobacco products in existence as of Jan. 1, 1995
*Restrict tobacco product advertising to F.D.A. specified media
*Restrict permissible tobacco product advertising to black text on a white background except for advertising in adult-only facilities and in adult publications
*Require cigarette and smokeless tobacco product advertisements to carry the F.D.A.-mandated statement of intended use ("Nicotine Delivery Device")
*Ban all nontobacco merchandise, including caps, jackets or bags bearing the name, logo or selling message of a tobacco brand.
*Ban offers of nontobacco items or gifts based on proof of purchase of tobacco products.
*Ban sponsorships, including concerts and sporting events, in the name, logo or selling message of a tobacco brand
Further, building on and going beyond the F.D.A. rule, the new regime would:
*Ban the use of human images and cartoon characters -- thereby eliminating Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man -- in all tobacco advertising and on tobacco product packages.
*Ban all outdoor tobacco product advertising, including in enclosed stadiums as well as brand advertising directed outside from a retail establishment.
*Prohibit tobacco product advertising on the Internet unless designed to be inaccessible in or from the United States
*Establish nationwide restrictions in nonadult-only facilities on point of sale advertising with a view toward minimizing the impact of such advertising on minors. These provisions . . . restrict point of sale advertising that was otherwise permitted in retail establishments by the F.D.A. rule.
*Ban direct and indirect payments for tobacco product placement in movies, television programs and video games.
*Prohibit direct and indirect payments to "glamorize" tobacco use in media appealing to minors, including recorded and live performances of music.
*Without limiting the F.D.A.'s normal rule-making authority in this area, require that the use, in both existing and future brand styles, of words currently employed as product descriptors (e.g., "light" or "low tar") be accompanied by a mandatory disclaimer in advertisements (e.g., "Brand X not shown to be less hazardous than other cigarettes"); exemplars of all new advertising and tobacco products labeling shall be submitted to F.D.A. concurrently with their introduction into the marketplace for F.D.A.'s ongoing review.
 
Warnings, Labeling and Packaging
The federally mandated warning labels on cigarettes were last changed in 1984. Since then a number of countries, including Canada and members of the European Union, have imposed new warning labels. Further, the Federal Trade Commission's methodology to measure the "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes has been criticized as producing misleading information.
1. The legislation, through amendments to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act and the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act, would mandate new rotating warnings, to be introduced concurrently into the distribution chain on all tobacco product packages and cartons, and to be rotated quarterly in all advertisements. For cigarettes, the warnings would be:
*"WARNING: Cigarettes are addictive"
*"WARNING: Tobacco smoke can harm your children"
*"WARNING: Cigarettes cause fatal lung disease"
*"WARNING: Cigarettes cause cancer"
*"WARNING: Cigarettes cause strokes and heart disease"
*"WARNING: Smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby"
*"WARNING: Smoking can kill you"
*"WARNING: Tobacco smoke causes fatal lung disease in nonsmokers"
*"WARNING: Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health"
For smokeless tobacco products, the warnings would be:
*"WARNING: This product can cause mouth cancer"
*"WARNING: This product can cause gum disease and tooth loss"
*"WARNING: This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes"
*"WARNING: Smokeless tobacco is addictive"
For cigarettes, the warnings would occupy 25 percent of the front panel of the package (including packs and cartons) and would appear on the upper portion thereof. The legislation would contain a grandfather provision for existing brands with flip-top boxes comprising less than 25 percent of the front panel. For smokeless tobacco products, the warnings would appear on the principal display panel (e.g., a band around the can for moist smokeless tobacco products) and would occupy 25 percent of the display panel. The warnings would be printed in line with current Canadian standards (e.g., 17-point type with appropriate adjustments depending on length of required text) and in an alternating black on white and white on black format. The size and placement of warnings in advertisements would follow the requirements set forth in the existing United Kingdom standards. As described . . . the warning text and, where relevant, "tar"; and nicotine (or other constituent) yield information would occupy 20 percent of press advertisements.
Cigarette and smokeless tobacco product packages would also carry the F.D.A.-mandated statement of intended use ("Nicotine Delivery Device") on the side of pack. . . .
 
Restrictions on Access To Tobacco Products
Preventing youth access to tobacco products is a major objective of this legislation and the F.D.A. Rule. Without preventing state and local governments from imposing stricter measures, the legislation would incorporate every access restriction of the F.D.A. Rule, and more. As in the F.D.A. Rule, the legislation would:
*Set a minimum age of 18 to purchase tobacco products.
*Require retailers to check photo identification of anyone under 27.
*Establish the basic requirement of face-to-face transactions for all sales of tobacco products.
*Ban the sale of tobacco products from opened packages.
*Establish a minimum package size of 20 cigarettes.
*Impose retailer compliance obligations to insure that all self-service displays, advertising, labeling and other items conform with all applicable requirements.
*Ban the sampling of tobacco products.
*Ban the distribution of tobacco products through the mail, including redemption of coupons, except for sales subject to proof of age, with a review after two years by F.D.A. to determine if minors are obtaining tobacco products through the mail.
Building on and going beyond the F.D.A. Rule, the legislation would:
*Ban all sales of tobacco products through vending machines.
*Ban self-service displays of tobacco products except in adult-only facilities. In all other retail outlets, tobacco products must be placed out of reach of consumers (i.e., behind the counter or under lock and key) or, if on the counter, not visible or accessible to consumers. . . .
 
Reduced Risk Products
Products sold that an objective, reasonable consumer would believe pose less of a health risk:
*Tobacco product manufacturers will be barred from making claims that could reasonably be interpreted to state or imply a reduced health risk unless the manufacturer demonstrates to F.D.A. that the product scientifically does in fact "significantly reduce the risk to health" from ordinary tobacco products. Currently employed product descriptors such as "light" and "low tar" will be regulated as described . . . .
*F.D.A. would have to approve all health claims (direct or implied), as well as the content and placement of any such claims in advertisements, to prevent the public from being misled and to prevent the advertisement from being used to expand, or prevent the contraction of, the marketplace.
*For "less hazardous tobacco products," F.D.A. will be authorized to permit scientifically based specific health claims and to permit exceptions to the advertising restrictions that apply to other products if F.D.A. determines that such advertising would reduce harm and promote the public health. The F.D.A. will promulgate a rule to govern how these determinations will be made.
*The manufacturers will be required to notify F.D.A. of any technology that they develop or acquire and that reduces the risk from tobacco products and, for a commercially reasonable fee, to cross-license all such technology, but only to those companies also covered by the same obligations. Procedural protections will be built in to resolve license fee disputes, if the private parties cannot agree among themselves first. If the technology reported to the F.D.A. is in the early development stages, the manufacturer will be provided confidentiality protection during the development process.
*The Agency shall also have the authority to mandate the introduction of "less hazardous tobacco products" that are technologically feasible, after a formal rule making subject to the Administrative Procedures Act, with the right of judicial review. In doing so, the agency shall have the authority to mandate that a manufacturer subject to this Act who owns such technology (at such manufacturer's election) either introduce such products, or, at a commercially reasonable market rate, license such technology to a manufacturer who agrees to bring the technology to market in a reasonable time frame. In the event that no manufacturer or licensee introduces such "less hazardous tobacco products," within a reasonable time frame set by F.D.A., then the U.S. Public Health Service may produce either itself, or through a licensing arrangement, any such product.
*The goal of any rule mandating the introduction into the marketplace of "less hazardous tobacco products" for which the technology exists is to guarantee that a mechanism exists to insure that products which appear to hold out the hope of reducing risk are actually tested and made available in the marketplace and not held back.
 
 Performance Standards
To further the public health, to promote the production of "reduced risk" tobacco products, and to minimize the harm to consumers of tobacco products by insuring that the best available, feasible safety technology becomes the industry standard, F.D.A. will have the authority to promulgate Performance Standards pursuant to Section 514 that require the modification of tobacco products to reduce the harm caused by those products (including the components that produce drug dependence), provided that the standard shall not require the prohibition on the sale to adults of traditional tobacco products in the basic form as described in the Aug. 28, 1996 F.D.A. Rule. . . .
Specifically:
*For a period of no fewer than 12 years following the effective date of the act, the product Performance Standards will be governed by the following: The agency shall be permitted to adopt performance standards that require the modification of existing tobacco products, including the gradual reduction, but not the elimination, of nicotine yields, and the possible elimination of other constituents or other harmful components of the tobacco product, based upon a finding that the modification: (a) will result in a significant reduction of the health risks associated with such products to consumers thereof, (b) is technologically feasible and (c) will not result in the creation of a significant demand for contraband or other tobacco products that do not meet the product safety standard. In determining the risk of the demand for a market in contraband products, the F.D.A. shall take into account the number of dependent tobacco product users and the availability, or lack thereof, of alternative products then on the market and such other factors as the Agency may deem relevant.
The authority to require such product modification can be exercised upon a showing of "substantial evidence," based upon an administrative record developed through a formal rule-making subject to the Administrative Procedures Act, with the right of judicial review, and any such modification shall be subject to the current procedures of the Regulatory Reform Act of 1996 to provide time and a process for Congress to intervene should it so choose. In the event a party subsequently files a petition seeking an administrative review of whether a modification has, in fact, resulted in the creation of a significant demand for contraband or other tobacco products that do not meet the safety standard and F.D.A. denies the petition, the petitioner shall have the right to seek judicial review of the denial of the petition.
Additionally:
*Within one year of the effective date of this act, the F.D.A. shall establish a scientific advisory committee to examine and determine the effects of the alteration of nicotine yield levels and to examine and determine whether there is a threshold level below which nicotine yields do not produce drug dependence and, if so, to determine that level, and also review any other safety, dependence or health issue so designated by F.D.A.
*Separate from and without detracting from the agency's authority under the requirements of the Section 514 Performance Standard noted above, effective three years from the date of enactment of this act, no cigarette shall be sold in the United States which exceeds a 12 mg. "tar" yield, using the testing methodology now being used by the F.T.C.
*After the initial 12-year period, the agency will be permitted to set product safety standards that go beyond the standards it is authorized to set pursuant to the above noted provisions and, if it does so, any such product Performance Standards shall be governed by the following: The agency will be permitted to require the alteration of tobacco products then being marketed, including the elimination of nicotine and the elimination of other constituents or other demonstrated harmful components of the tobacco product, (the elimination of nicotine or other harmful constituent shall not be deemed to violate the prohibition on the sale of traditional tobacco products to adults, even if it results in a reduction of the number of the consumers who use the tobacco products then remaining on the market), based upon a finding that: (a) the safety standard will result in a significant overall reduction of the health risks to tobacco consumers as a group, (this includes the reduction in harm which will result from decreased drug dependence from the reduction and/or elimination of nicotine from (a) those who continue to use tobacco products, but less often, and (b) those who stop using tobacco products), (b) the modification is technologically feasible, and (c) the modification will not result in the creation of a significant demand for contraband or other tobacco products that do not meet the safety standard. In determining the overall health benefit of a change, the agency shall consider the number of dependent tobacco users then in existence, the availability and demonstrated market acceptance of alternate products then on the market, and the effectiveness of smoking cessation techniques and devices then on the market and such other factors as the agency may deem relevant.
Given the significance of such an action, the agency will be permitted to require the elimination of nicotine or take such other action that would have an effect comparable to the elimination of nicotine based upon a "preponderance of the evidence" pursuant to, at a manufacturer's election, a Part 12 hearing, or notice and comment rule-making, with a right of judicial review. Any such action shall be phased in, and no such phase-in shall begin in less than two years, to permit time for a meaningful Congressional review pursuant to the current procedures of the Regulatory Reform Act of 1996. In the event a party subsequently files a petition seeking an administrative review of whether a modification has, in fact, resulted in the creation of a significant demand for contraband or other tobacco products that do not meet the safety standard and the F.D.A. denies the petition, the petitioner shall have the right to seek judicial review of the denial of the petition. In any judicial review, the deference accorded to the agency's findings shall depend upon the extent to which the matter at issue is then within the agency's field of expertise. . . .
 
Access to Company Information
*The Act would insure that previously nonpublic or confidential files of the tobacco industry -- including internal documents -- are disclosed to F.D.A., private litigants. The details of the arrangement are set forth in documents from health research and the public.
*Any subpoena authority F.D.A. has with respect to manufacturers of medical devices generally would also apply to tobacco product manufacturers.
 
 Nontobacco Ingredients
Currently, at the Federal level, tobacco manufacturers are required only to submit aggregated ingredient information (not by brand or company) to Health and Human Services for monitoring and review. Nor do tobacco products manufacturers currently disclose to consumers ingredients information for each of the tobacco products they sell.
The legislation would supersede the current often-criticized Federal ingredient law and confirm F.D.A.'s authority to evaluate all additives in tobacco products. No nontobacco ingredient could be used in manufacturing tobacco products unless the manufacturer can demonstrate that such ingredient is not harmful under the intended conditions of use. Further, the legislation would require the manufacturers to disclose to F.D.A. the ingredients and the amounts thereof in each brand. In addition, it would require manufacturers to disclose ingredient information to the public under regulations comparable to what current Federal law requires for food products, reflecting the intended conditions of use.
Under this proposed legislation:
*Manufacturers would be required to provide F.D.A. on a confidential basis a list of all ingredients, substances and compounds (other than tobacco, water or reconstituted tobacco sheet made wholly from tobacco) which are added by the manufacturer to the tobacco, paper or filter of the tobacco product by brand and by quantity in each brand. For each such item, the manufacturer would identify whether or not it believes that the item would be exempt from public disclosure under the legislation.
*Manufacturers would be required to submit, within five years of the enactment of the act, for each ingredient currently added to the tobacco product, a safety assessment, based on the best available evidence, that there is a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the ingredient (up to a specified amount) is not harmful under the intended conditions of use. F.D.A. shall promulgate applicable regulations within 12 months.
*Within a statutory time assessment(s) in accordance within 90 days, F.D.A. must review the applicable standard; approve or disapprove an ingredient's safety, and if F.D.A. takes no action, the ingredient is deemed approved. F.D.A. may also challenge any manufacturer's assertion that an ingredient would be exempt from disclosure to consumers under applicable regulations comparable to what current Federal law requires for food products.
*New ingredients or use of current ingredients beyond the specified maximum amount are subject to a comparable process prior to use.
*F.D.A. would be required to protect as strictly confidential ingredient information not otherwise subject to public disclosure. If not subject to such disclosure, this information will be treated as trade secrets under federal law, exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests and protected by procedures which shall include the designation of an agent who will store it in a locked cabinet, maintain a record of any person who has access to the information and require a written confidentiality commitment from any such person.
*Manufacturers would be required to disclose to the public ingredients information pursuant to regulations comparable to what current Federal law requires for food products. During an initial five-year period, each ingredient that would be exempt from disclosure under the food regime would be presumed not to be subject to disclosure unless F.D.A. disproves its safety. However, manufacturers would be required to disclose all ingredients which they have been compelled to publicly disclose with respect to a particular brand in order to comply with a statute or regulation. . . .
 
 'Look Back'; Provisions/State Enforcement Incentives
A central aim of this legislation is to achieve dramatic and immediate reductions in the number of under-age consumers of tobacco products. The legislation accordingly contains a "look-back" provision giving tobacco product manufacturers significant economic incentives to take every possible step to insure that the advertising, marketing and distribution requirements of this act are met, and imposing substantial surcharges on the manufacturers in the event that underage tobacco-use reduction targets are not achieved.
The "look-back" provision sets targets for the dramatic reduction of current levels of underage tobacco use (as measured by the University of Michigan's National High School Drug Use Survey "Monitoring the Future"). Under-age use of cigarette products must decline by at least 30 percent from estimated levels over the last decade by the fifth year after the legislation takes effect, by at least 50 percent from estimated levels over the last decade by the seventh year after the legislation takes effect, by at least 60 percent from estimated levels over the last decade by the 10th year after the legislation takes effect, and remain at such reduced levels or below thereafter. (These required reductions amount to even steeper declines from current levels of under-age smoking.)
Under-age use of smokeless tobacco products must decline by at least 25 percent from current levels by the fifth year after the legislation takes effect, by at least 35 percent from current levels by the seventh year after the legislation takes effect, by at least 45 percent from current levels by the 10th year after the legislation takes effect, and remain at such reduced levels or below thereafter. F.D.A. will annually assess the prevalence of under-age tobacco use (based on the methodology employed by the University of Michigan survey) to determine whether these targets have been met.
If a target has not been met, F.D.A. will impose a mandatory surcharge on the relevant industry (cigarette or smokeless tobacco) based upon an approximation of the present value of the profit the industry would earn over the lives of all under-age users in excess of the target (subject to an annual cap of $2 billion for the cigarette industry (adjusted each year for inflation) and a comparably derived cap for the smokeless tobacco industry). Tobacco product manufacturers could receive a partial abatement of this surcharge (up to 75 percent) only if they could thereafter prove to F.D.A. that they had fully complied with the Act, had taken all reasonably available measures to reduce youth tobacco use and had not taken any action to undermine the achievement of the required reductions. . . .
 
Nationwide Standards
To Minimize Involuntary Exposure
To Environmental Tobacco Smoke
Until now, there has been no minimum or other Federal standard governing smoking in public places or at work. The legislation would:
*Restrict indoor smoking in "public facilities" (i.e., any building regularly entered by 10 or more individuals at least one day per week) to ventilated areas with systems that:
*Exhaust the air directly to the outside; maintain the smoking area at "negative pressure" compared with adjoining areas; and do not recirculate the air inside the public facility.
*Insure that no employee shall be required to enter a designated smoking area while smoking is occurring. Cleaning and maintenance work in a designated smoking area shall be conducted while no smoking is occurring. Exempt are restaurants (but not "fast food" restaurants). ("Fast food" restaurant means any restaurant or chain of restaurants which primarily distributes food via customer pick-up either at a counter or drive-through window). In addition, OSHA would be authorized to issue regulations clarifying this definition to the extent necessary to insure that the intended inclusion of establishments catering largely to minors is achieved. Any such regulation may consider such factors as whether a restaurant either has attached playgrounds or play areas for children, uses ad campaigns that feature or prominently include cartoon characters and/or toy giveaways or advertises "Happy Meal" or other comparable kids-combination platters, and other factors OSHA deems relevant) and bars (including those in hotels), private clubs, hotel guest rooms, casinos, bingo parlors, tobacco merchants and prisons.
*Direct OSHA to issue, not later than one year after the effective date of the legislation, regulations implementing and enforcing the preceding standards, with enforcement costs paid out of the Industry Payments. The smoking restrictions outlined . . . . would take effect on the first anniversary of the enactment of the legislation irrespective of whether the implementing regulations have been promulgated.
The legislation would not pre-empt or otherwise affect any other state or local law or regulation that restricts smoking in public facilities in an equal or stricter manner. Nor would the legislation pre-empt or otherwise affect any Federal rules that restrict smoking in Federal facilities. . . .

1. Duration--annual payments in perpetuity.
2. Commencement--12/31 of first full year after statute signing.
3. Face amounts (includes payments from all industry sources):

Figures in billions

Year	1	2	3	4	5	6-8	9	after	Total Payments	$8.5	9.5	11.5	14	15	15	15	15	Base Amount:	$6	7	8	10	10	12.5	15	15	Public	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Health Trust	$2.5	2.5	3.5	4	5	2.5	 	 	
4. Inflation protection for annual payments.
*Greater of 3 percent or Consumer Price Index applied each year on previous year, beginning with first annual payment.
5. Adjustment for volume decrease (adult volume only) or total volume increase.
*Beginning in year one; payment made equal to scheduled annual payment times the ratio of actual relevant domestic tobacco product unit sales volume to relevant base volume. In the event of a decline in volume, relevant actual volume and relevant base volume are adult volume figures; in the event of an increase in volume, relevant actual volume and relevant base volume are total volume figures. Base volume is 1996 volume. -- Any reduction in an annual payment will be reduced by 25 percent of any increase above the industry's base year net operating profits (after application of inflator discussed above) from domestic sales of tobacco products.
6. Payment Protection
*Provide for payment priority/continuation during bankruptcy/reorganization proceedings. Protocol cannot be rejected in bankruptcy. Obligation for annual payments responsibility only of entities selling into domestic market.
7. Pass-Through
*In order to promote maximum reduction in youth smoking, the statute would provide for the annual payments to be reflected in the prices manufacturers charge for tobacco products.
 
 Applicability
Applicable to all sellers of tobacco products.
*Through protocol and statute to protocol signatories.
* Through alternative statutory provisions to nonsignatories.
 
 Tax Treatment
All payments pursuant to this agreement . . . . shall be deemed ordinary and necessary business expenses for the year of payment, and no part thereof is either in settlement of an actual or potential liability for a fine or penalty (civil or criminal) or the cost of a tangible or intangible asset.
 
Public Health Funds from Tobacco
Settlement as Recommended by
The Attorneys General for
Consideration by the President
And the Congress
Based on the premise of $1 billion for the first year and gradually increasing to $1.5 billion thereafter, adjusted for inflation after the first year.
Based on the premise of $1 billion for smoking cessation for the first four years and $1.5 billion thereafter, adjusted for inflation.
 
Allocation of Grant Monies Among Programs
The use of monies under this section shall be limited to programs established under this section, shall be adjusted for inflation annually from the effective date, and shall be allocated among such programs as follows:
(1) $125 million for the first three years and $225 million annually thereafter to the Secretary of H.H.S. to accomplish the purposes described in Paragraph (B) of this section (Reduction in Tobacco Usage); (2) $300 million annually for the F.D.A. to carry out its obligations and to enforce the terms of this act, including for grants to the states to assist in the enforcement of the provisions of the act; (3) $75 million for the first two years, $100 million in the third year, and $125 million annually thereafter to fund state and local tobacco control community -based efforts modeled on the ASSIST program, designed to encourage community involvement in reducing tobacco use and the enactment and implementation of policies designed to reduce the use of tobacco products; (4) $100 million annually to fund research and the development of methods for how to discourage individuals from starting to use tobacco and how to help individuals to quit using tobacco; (5) Beginning in the second year, $75 million annually for a period of 10 years to compensate events, teams or entries in such events, who lose sponsorship by the tobacco industry as a result of this act, or who currently receive tobacco industry funding to sponsor events and elect to replace that funding, provided that the event, team or entry is otherwise unable to replace its tobacco industry sponsorship during those given years. Funds used for this purpose shall promote a Quit Tobacco Use theme. After a 10-year period, no additional funds shall be used for this purpose and the funds previously allocated to this purpose shall be used as follows: 50 percent to supplement funding of the multimedia campaigns in paragraph (1) of this subsection; 25 percent to supplement the funding of the enforcement provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection; and 25 percent to supplement the funding of community action programs in paragraph (3) of this subsection.
 
 Establishment of Programs By the Secretary
The Secretary shall establish programs to accomplish the following purposes:
(1) The reduction of tobacco product usage, both by seeking to discourage the initiation of tobacco use by persons under the age of 18 and by encouraging current tobacco users to quit through media-based and nonmedia based education, prevention and cessation campaigns. The Secretary may make grants to state health departments to assist in carrying out the purposes of this provision. (2) the research into and development and public dissemination of technologies and methods to reduce the risk of dependence and injury from tobacco product usage and exposure; (3) the identification, testing and evaluation of the health effects of both tobacco and nontobacco constituents of tobacco products; (4) the promulgation of such other rules and regulations as are necessary and proper to carry out the provisions of this act, as well as the development of such other programs as the Secretary determines are consistent with the goals of the Act.
 
 Public Education Campaign
$500 million shall be spent annually in such multimedia campaigns designed to discourage and deglamorize the use to tobacco products. To carry out such efforts, an independent nonprofit organization with a board made up of prestigious individuals and the leaders of the major public health organizations shall be created which shall contract or make grants to nonprofit private entities who are unaffiliated with tobacco manufacturers or tobacco importers, who have a demonstrated record of working effectively to reduce tobacco product use and expertise in multimedia communications campaigns. The independent body shall be authorized to contract with state health departments, where appropriate, to run campaigns for their states and communities. In creating the program the Secretary or independent body shall also take into account the needs of particular populations. The goal shall be the reduction of tobacco product usage, both by seeking to discourage the initiation of tobacco use by persons under the age of 18 and by encouraging current tobacco users to quit.
 
 Tobacco Use Cessation
For the first four years, $1 billion, and thereafter, $1.5 billion of the total amount paid by the tobacco industry shall be paid into a trust fund to be used to assist individuals who want to quit using tobacco to do so.
Within 12 months the Secretary shall promulgate regulations to govern (1) the establishment of criteria for and a procedure for the approval of cessation programs and devices for which payment may be made under the program; (2) the eligibility requirements for individuals seeking to use monies from the trust to fund the tobacco cessation efforts; and (3) the procedures to govern the tobacco cessation program.
The goal of the tobacco cessation program shall be to enable the most tobacco users possible to receive assistance in their effort to quit using tobacco by providing financial assistance and identifying the programs, techniques and devices that have been shown to be safe and effective.
Benefits to individuals should not be limited to a single effort, but should be tailored to the needs of individual smokers according to standards established by the Secretary using the best available scientific guidelines.
 
 Public Health Trust Fund
 Presidential Commission
A Presidential commission will be appointed to include representatives of the public health community, attorneys general . . . . and others to determine the specific tobacco-related medical research for which the $25 billion Public Health Trust Fund will be used.
 
 Civil Liability
The following provisions would govern actions for civil liability related to tobacco and to health.
 
General
1. Present Attorney General actions (or similar actions brought by or on behalf of any governmental entity), parens patriae and class actions are legislatively settled. No future prosecution of such actions. All "addiction"/dependence claims are settled and all other personal injury claims are reserved. As to signatory states, pending Congressional enactment, no stay applications will be made in pending actions, based upon the fact of this resolution, without mutual consent of the parties.
2. Third-party payer (and similar) actions pending as of 6/9/97 are not settled, but governed by provisions regarding past conduct set forth in Section B below.
 
Provisions as to Civil Liability For Past Conduct
The following provisions apply to suits for relief arising from past conduct - i.e., suits by persons claiming injury or damage caused by conduct taking place prior to the effective date of the act.
1. All punitive damages claims resolved as part of overall settlement. No punitive damages in individual tort actions.
2. Individual trials only: i.e., no class actions, joinder, aggregations, consolidations, extrapolations or other devices to resolve cases other than on the basis of individual trials, without defendant's consent. Action removable by defendant to federal court upon receipt of application to, or order of, state court providing for trial or other procedure in violation of this provision.
3. Except as expressly provided in the act, F.C.L.A.A. and applicable case law unchanged by the act.
4. Provided that the five negotiating companies enter into the protocol: Protocol manufacturers to enter into joint sharing agreement for civil liability. Protocol manufacturers not jointly and severally liable for liability of nonprotocol manufacturers. Trials involving both protocol and nonprotocol manufacturers to be severed.
5. Permissible parties:
Plaintiffs:
a. Claims of individuals, or claims derivative of such claims, must be brought either by person claiming injury or heirs.
b. Third-party payer (and similar) claims not based on subrogation that were pending as of 6/9/97.
c. Third-party payer (and similar) claims based on subrogation of individual claims; no extrapolations, etc.
Defendants:
a. Maintained only against companies, their assigns, any future fraudulent transferee, and/or entity for suit designated to survive defunct manufacturer. . . .
b. Manufacturers of agents agencies and liable vicariously for acts (including advertising attorneys).
6. No removal except under paragraph 2 above.
7. The development of "reduced risk" tobacco products after the effective date of the act is neither admissible nor discoverable.
8. Statute of limitations: for all actions, individual state laws governing time periods from injury, discovery, notice or contamination/violation.
9. Annual aggregate cap for judgments/settlements: 33 percent of annual industry base payment (including any reductions for volume decline). If aggregate judgments/settlements for a year exceed annual aggregate cap, excess does not have to be paid that year and rolls over.
Any judgments/settlements run against defendant but give rise to 80-cent-on-the-dollar credit against annual payment in year paid. Suitable provision for settlement consultation and permission. Manufacturers control insurance claims, and any insurance recovery obtained by manufacturers (net of cost) on account of judgment and/or settlement covered by above sharing arrangement allocated 80 percent to annual payments. Manufacturers retain any insurance proceeds on account of defense costs.
Provision with respect to individual judgments above $1 million: amount in excess of $1 million not paid that year unless every other judgment/settlement can be satisfied within the annual aggregate cap. Excess rolls forward without interest and is paid at the rate of $1 million per year, until the first year that the annual aggregate cap is not exceeded (at which time the remainder is paid in full). For purposes of this provision, a third-party payer (or similar) action not based on subrogation is treated as having been brought by a single plaintiff and is subject to the $1 million rollover.
10. In the event that the annual aggregate cap is not reached in any year, a commission appointed by the President will determine the appropriate allocation of the amount representing the unused amount of the credit. The commission will be entitled to consider, among public health, governmental entities, and other uses of the funds, applications for compensation from persons, including nonsubrogation claims of third-party payers, not otherwise entitled to compensation under the act. . . .
Tobacco product manufacturers may form or participate in any new tobacco industry trade association. Any such new trade association shall have an independent board of directors, in accordance with the following requirements. For at least 10 years after the formation of the new association, a minimum of 20 percent of the directors, but at least one director, shall be other than a current or former director, officer or employee of any association member or affiliated company. No other director of a new trade association may be, at the same time, a director of any association member or affiliated company. The officers shall be appointed by the board and shall be employees of the association, and during their term shall not be employed by any association member or affiliated company. Legal counsel for any such association shall be independent and not serve as legal counsel to any association member or affiliated company while counsel to the association.
Any new tobacco product manufacturers' trade association shall adopt bylaws governing the association's procedures and the activities of its members, board, employees, agents and other representatives.

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Sweatshops Are Where the Jobs Are

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I agree with the economists Jeffrey D. Sachs and Paul Krugman that sweatshops are an important contribution to employment in some developing countries ("In Principle, a Case for More 'Sweatshops,' " Week in Review, June 22). 
 The 2,300 assembly plants known as maquiladoras in Mexico are an important example of the benefits of these low-wage jobs.
The maquiladora industry employs at least 700,000 Mexicans. From 1986 to 1995, employment growth averaged 12.1 percent a year, while employment in the non-maquiladora Mexican manufacturing sector contracted 2.1 percent a year.
More significant is that employment in this sector has grown consistently during periods when Mexico's economic crises have been at their worst and unemployment has been at its highest.
Contrary to Professors Sachs and Krugman, however, sweatshops were not the main causes of the emergence of technological industries in Asia.
Rather, it was the investment those countries made in education. Sweatshops can generate jobs, but they are not the first step in the development of technological industries.

Do as We Do

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your June 22 Week in Review article on sweatshops quotes some prominent economists to the effect that sweatshops, which they confuse with "low-wage factories," are "an essential first step toward modern prosperity in developing countries." Sweatshops indeed existed in 19th-century Britain during early industrialization, leading to a burst of social legislation to rid the country of these ills. But nothing requires us to go that route again. 
 Nations should join nongovernmental groups like the International Labor Organization to rid the world of sweatshops. In addition, we can require multinationals to apply our own labor, safety and environmental standards when they manufacture abroad. In Rome, they must do not as Romans do but as we do. Their example would spread.

A Day at Hard Labor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"In Principle, a Case for More 'Sweatshops' " (Week in Review, June 22) shows enthusiasm for two economists who have concluded that sweatshop "employment is tremendous good news for the world's poor." It might be helpful if these men tried working in a sweatshop producing goods for United States multinationals. 
 To go to work in an industrial park in, say, Honduras, they would pass through metal gates patrolled by armed guards at 7:30 A.M. and leave 13 1/2 hours later. They would perform the same sewing operation 1,500 times a day in a hot factory under glaring lights. Supervisors would scream and hurl garments in their faces if they were not working fast enough. Two bathroom visits would be allowed a day. Wages per garment would amount to about 1 percent of the sales price of the garment in the United States. If they tried to organize, they would be fired.
Good news for people in the developing world would be if corporations were held accountable for human rights.

HEADLINE: D'Amato Vows to Fight for E.P.A.'s Tightened Air Standards

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 24

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York threw his support today behind the embattled Environmental Protection Agency and its proposals to toughen air quality standards, promising that he would lead a fight in Congress against any lawmakers who opposed them.
In a letter to President Clinton, Mr. D'Amato joined other Republican figures from the Northeast, including Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who, as leaders of states downwind of pollution that drifts from big Midwestern plants, have spoken out in defense of the environmental agency's efforts to tighten the standards, dealing with smog and soot. 
 "I want to make sure you are aware," Mr. D'Amato wrote the President, "that I will take a leadership role in fighting any legislative effort to delay, weaken or block these important new public health safeguards."
Mr. D'Amato's position could be especially important, both because he is an influential Republican fund-raiser and because he expressly promised to fight for the proposals rather than merely voicing some measure of support for them. To the dismay of environmental groups, the White House has left the environmental agency's Administrator, Carol M. Browner, to defend the proposals nearly single-handedly.
The proposals, which are still under final review at the White House, are the top priority of leading environmental and public health advocacy groups but are opposed by a powerful coalition of industries, which contend that they would cost far more than they are worth.
White House economic advisers have also sought to weaken the proposals, and the agency's opponents in Congress have suggested that they might work to overturn any such rules adopted, using new powers of regulatory review enacted by the 104th Congress.
The rules at issue, proposed by the E.P.A. last November, would tighten standards on the amounts of permitted ozone and tiny sooty particles, on the ground that current standards do not adequately protect asthmatic children, the elderly and outdoors workers.
The proposals would throw hundreds of counties out of compliance with the Clean Air Act, requiring states to impose new restrictions on pollution, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. Electric power companies and other industries would probably bear most of the costs.
The proposals resulted from a provision in the Clean Air Act requiring that air quality standards be reviewed every five years, with use of the latest scientific evidence. After a suit by environmental groups, a Federal court ordered the Clinton Administration to issue a final decision on the matter by July.
Environmentalists, who have been awaiting the White House's decision on the proposals with trepidation, said today that they were cheered by Mr. D'Amato's support, which they described as a reminder that the air quality debate was not one that broke on partisan lines.
"D'Amato goes to the head of the class on the Republican side," said Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. "It would be embarrassing for the Administration to come out with a proposal any weaker than what E.P.A. proposed and what Senator D'Amato supports."
With Mr. Clinton undecided about how strong a rule to issue, and with the court-imposed deadline forcing a decision soon, lawmakers on both sides of what has turned into the most divisive environmental debate of the decade have been circulating one letter after another pressing their views on the White House.
The proposals' supporters have been especially worried since Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican long viewed as pro-environment, voiced his opposition to them. Other opponents include powerful Democrats like Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking minority member of the House Commerce Committee, which oversees application of the Clean Air Act.
Mr. D'Amato's letter to the White House also signals the usefulness of a strong pro-environmental stance as he faces re-election next year. His strategy has included vocal support for a statewide $1.2 billion environmental bond issue last year, and for protecting the Sterling Forest, on New York's border with New Jersey.
"Pollution hurts us all," his letter said. "It is one of the major causes of diseases ranging from cancer to respiratory diseases including asthma. In New York State, more than 300,000 children suffer from this painful and serious disease, including four of my own seven grandchildren. It is serious, and we can do something about it."
Like the proposals' other Northeastern supporters, including the two Republican Senators from Maine and the Republican Governors of New Jersey and Massachusetts, Mr. D'Amato noted that clamping down on soot and smog from Midwestern utilities would help improve the air quality in downwind states.
In an interview, he said the smog that crosses state lines "is like terrorism, and we are sponsoring a form of pollution terrorism by allowing this to take place."

Pataki Plan for Increases In Tuition Is Seen Failing

 BODY:
Top state lawmakers in Albany indicated yesterday that the State University and City University tuition increases that Gov. George E. Pataki proposed in January were unlikely to be enacted, thanks to a healthy economy and better-than-expected state tax revenue.
The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican from Rensselaer County, both said that they opposed a tuition increase and that they thought it would be avoided. Their statements came after a meeting with Mr. Pataki on the state budget. 
 The Governor said that he, too, wanted to avert higher tuition, but made it clear that he would continue to hold the threat of an increase as a bargaining chip in negotiations over his proposed $66 billion budget for the fiscal year that began April 1.
Full-time students at four-year colleges now pay $3,400 a year at State University of New York campuses, and $3,200 a year at City University of New York campuses. Mr. Pataki proposed a $400 increase.

Chile, First and Forever

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
With only two weeks to go before the Madrid NATO summit meeting, the U.S. and its NATO allies are still arguing over which countries to add to NATO. The reason they're still arguing is because there are no clear criteria over who should be let in, because there is no clear strategy for how to expand NATO, because the Clinton team has no clear idea what it wants NATO to become. When you don't know where you are going, any road (or new member) will get you there. So the U.S. favors Poland, Hungary and the Czechs, while the Europeans also want Romania and Slovenia. Since everyone is pushing his favorite country, as if NATO were a book club, I would like to propose mine: Chile. You laugh, but here are 10 reasons Chile is the best candidate for an expanded NATO.
1. Chile is long, very long, and NATO doesn't have any long countries. All the other proposed new NATO members are short and fat, like dumplings. How about a thin country for once? 
 2. Since the main reason the Clintonites chose Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is because each has a strong ethnic voting bloc in the U.S., why not bring Chile in and get the whole Hispanic vote behind NATO expansion?
3. Bringing Chile into NATO would bring diversity to the alliance, which is now dominated by pasty-faced white Europeans. A little NATO diversity fits nicely with the Clinton domestic agenda, and without a NATO that looks like America, there's no way Congress will foot its bills forever.
4. The other reason Poles, Hungarians and Czechs are being brought into NATO is because the European Union won't let them into its free-trade club. (The E.U. doesn't want Polish workers taking French jobs.) Well, we've told Chile that it can't be in Nafta because Congress is afraid Chileans will take U.S. jobs. If Chile can't be in Nafta, then it too deserves NATO membership as a consolation prize. This is especially true since the Clintonites keep saying NATO membership is crucial for helping to consolidate free-market reform in Central Europe. Surely, if it is crucial to consolidate such reform in Central Europe, it is even more crucial to do it in our own hemisphere.
5. Chile, unlike Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic, actually shares a border with Russia. Check it out. The Russian slice of Antarctica is right next to the southern tip of Chile. Russian Antarctica is the soft underbelly of Russia.
6. Chile is one of the few countries in the world that not only qualify for NATO but also meet the Maastricht criteria for membership in the new single European currency. Maastricht requires E.U. countries to have a deficit-to-G.D.P. ratio below 3 percent. Chile has a deficit-to-G.D.P. ratio of 0 (it actually has a surplus) -- better than Poland, Hungary or the Czechs. Chile could be the bridge between NATO and the European Union.
7. Chile is just across the ocean from China. That could give NATO a whole new front, and since the Clintonites think NATO has to be expanded and take on new missions in order to survive, what could be a more important mission than deterring China? And how better to do it than with the longest country in the world?
8. Chile has a very tough, often cruel army that would put the Czech, Polish and Hungarian armies to shame. Remember Gen. Augusto Pinochet? They don't come any nastier. But try to name one Hungarian general. Hungarian cooks, maybe. Zsa Zsa Gabor, sure. But Hungary hasn't won a war since the 16th century. Also, since one purpose of expanding NATO is to sell the new members U.S. arms, Chile is perfect. It's dying to buy F-16's, and unlike the Central Europeans it can actually pay for them.
9. Chile is near Cuba, which, unlike Russia, is still a real Communist country that shoots down civilian planes and has a May Day parade. True, Fidel Castro is only a threat to his own people, but that still makes him a bigger threat than anything Poland, Hungary or the Czechs now face on their Eastern front.
10. Chile grows fruit during Europe's winter. What a morale booster for NATO troops! They would eat better than ever, and scurvy would never again be a problem for NATO's Atlantic command. Try to find fresh peaches in Poland in December.
Need I say more? Chile Ahora! Primero Chile! Chile in NATO forever!

Who will pay the tobacco industry's huge bills? Smokers.

 BODY:
THE $368 billion in damages to be exacted from the tobacco industry if the settlement announced last week is ultimately approved has already been sold as punishment that fits the crime. But that is not the way economists are likely to interpret it: since tobacco consumption by adults is not particularly sensitive to price, the industry should be able to pass nearly all of the $368 billion on to their customers.
Well, smokers burden others with their smoking-related medical bills. Isn't it about time they paid their own way? 
 The best guess is that they already do. The deal struck by the state attorneys general may spare millions of young Americans from addiction to nicotine. But it will come at a considerable cost to those who cannot kick the habit. And a disproportionate percentage of those happen to be poor.
Under the agreement, damage payments will be linked to sales, much like an excise tax that is simply added to the price. Studies show that the demand for cigarettes is only modestly affected by price increases -- a 10 percent increase, say, will reduce sales by far less than 10 percent. That means most of the cost will fall on consumers. Joseph Newhouse, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, estimates that at least two-thirds of the bill will come directly out of the pockets of smokers.
Actually, smokers' share of the burden might prove considerably higher since the settlement is intended to make the market for cigarettes less competitive. Today price increases are constrained by the risk that one of the manufacturers will not go along with a price rise by the others. But in the post-settlement market, tobacco companies would have strong incentives to act in concert. Indeed, the agreement calls for legally sanctioned price-fixing, explicitly asserting that "in order to promote maximum reduction in youth smoking, the statute would provide for the annual payments to be reflected in the prices manufacturers charge for tobacco products." Analysts estimate that the cost of a pack of cigarettes, now $1.80 to $2, would rise at least 50 cents and perhaps as much as $1.
Even if part of the settlement cost does come out of profits, David Vladeck, director of Public Citizen's litigation group, points out that the impact will be buffered by Uncle Sam. "The settlement specifies that all payments will be treated as ordinary business expenses," he notes. So unlike punitive damages awards levied by a court, they are fully deductible from corporate income taxes.
Forcing smokers to bear much of the cost of compensating the states for Medicaid payments for smoke-related illnesses looks like rough justice. Since the health care costs of smoke-related illnesses are estimated at about $50 billion annually -- nearly four times the excise taxes collected last year on tobacco products -- it seems only fair to add the $20 billion or so in annual payments required by the tobacco settlement.
But the arithmetic here is not so straightforward. The total lifetime outlays for smokers' medical care are not much larger than for nonsmokers. And since smokers die earlier, they collect less from Social Security and pensions.
A Rand Corporation study in the late 1980's directed by Willard Manning, now an economist at the University of Minnesota, estimated that the cost of smoking not paid by smokers themselves came to just 15 cents a pack -- less than state and Federal tobacco excise taxes. This cost is probably higher now since medical bills have risen and the health impact of secondhand smoking is greater than estimated a decade ago. But so, too, are excise taxes. The Federal excise tax on cigarettes is 24 cents a pack, while state taxes vary from 2.5 cents in Virginia to 82.5 cents in Washington.
Smokers, it so happens, are less able to afford new taxes than the population as a whole. And while some of the money from the proposed settlement would be used to finance medical care for poor children, the overall distributional impact of the settlement is almost certainly regressive.
Still, Michael Pertchuk, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission who now heads the Advocacy Institute, a nonprofit organization with close ties to the anti-smoking movement, views the settlement in pragmatic terms. A deal now, even on terms favorable to the industry, he argues, is better than a harsher deal years down the road. The combination of higher cigarette prices, tighter rules on marketing and direct financial incentives to end recruitment of new smokers should have an enormous positive impact on public health.
And Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia Law School points to another reason to move ahead despite the flaws. A failure to short-circuit the legal battle over cigarette liability could tie up the courts for decades, deny financial relief to the sick and funnel even more of the money from any settlement to trial lawyers. "Almost anything," he said, "is better than litigation."

HEADLINE: Albania's Lawless Anguish

BYLINE: By Misha Glenny; Misha Glenny, author of "The Fall of Yugoslavia," is writing a book on Balkan nationalism.

DATELINE: TIRANA, Albania

 BODY:
As the nightly curfew descends upon Tirana, the silence is broken by sporadic gunshots that soon develop into a cacophonous symphony played on Italian handguns, Chinese-made antiaircraft weapons and everything in between.
The next morning a dog scavenging for food is hit by one of the countless Mercedes that cruise the city's streets, Kalashnikovs hanging out the windows. The poor beast drags itself to the side of the road, squealing in anguish and terror. None of the gun-toting men who have stopped to sip coffee nearby have the presence of mind or the energy to put the animal out of its misery -- it is left to live its last few hours beside stinking garbage in excruciating pain. 
 Albania is not yet dead, but it is in agony. In parts of the country, the state has suffered what Albanians themselves are calling "meltdown." In Vlore, the so-called rebel capital, three armed gangs fighting for the lucrative proceeds of drugs and gun smuggling have made themselves fat with weaponry and inhumanity. Their bloodthirsty competitiveness keeps the civilian population in a permanent state of terror.
In areas where President Sali Berisha's police are still in control, Mercedes, Rolex watches and burgeoning shantytowns mark the obscene gulf between rich and poor. Politicians threaten each other with hellfire and vengeance.
At least 1,500 people have been killed in political violence in the last three months; every day during the current election campaign, more die. In this atmosphere of fear, the notion that Sunday's elections can be either free or fair is preposterous.
In central Albania, the Italian-led peacekeeping force has declared two industrial centers, Cerrik and Gramsh, too dangerous to enter. No peacekeeping force, no election observers. In the remote northeast, where Mr. Berisha's Socialist opponents fear to tread, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been forced to leave large gaps in its election monitoring work.
The O.S.C.E. is trying valiantly to salvage something from this disaster zone. But it has insufficient time and inadequate resources -- the organization will have 450 observers at its disposal on Sunday to patrol 4,900 polling booths. The 6,000 peacekeeping troops have been given a mandate by the United Nations Security Council that is so vague that soldiers are forced to sit and look on as the country disintegrates.
Mr. Berisha and his supporters contend that the country's chronic destabilization has been engineered by a demonic coalition of Communists, gangsters and unnamed foreign intelligence agencies. But Mr. Berisha and his party have been running the country with virtually limitless power for five years. For the first three years of his rule, he received extensive diplomatic support from the United States. Though the Americans have now wisely distanced themselves from him, Mr. Berisha still enjoys considerable European backing, particularly in Italy but also in Austria and Germany.
This week he and the Socialists have been bickering over legislation to control the kinds of pyramid investment schemes that led to the chaos. The collapse of five such pyramids this year provoked widespread violence and wiped out an estimated $1.2 billion of Albanians' savings. The pyramid frenzy also opened a large gap between haves and have-nots. In a country where there were no private cars until six years ago, thousands of Mercedes, castoffs from Europe's taxi ranks and vehicle-theft industry, fill Tirana's streets. Gangsters have seized upon the disruption, helping to create what one former official called "an economic miasma."
Taxes and customs duties are no longer collected. In the unlikely event that the elections confer some stability, it will take months of rigorous reform to establish coherent economic and administrative institutions.
The situation has been complicated by the uneven response of the international community. The current American position of critical neutrality is without question preferable to the thinly disguised support the United States once gave Mr. Berisha. There are signs, however, that the European Union is again proving hopelessly inadequate at dealing with a crisis in its own backyard.
Some countries, like Britain, show not the slightest interest in this problem on Europe's southern tier. Prime Minister Tony Blair has declared that next year's summit of the industrial democracies should focus on organized crime. Albania has become a fertile killing field, plowed and harvested by the most ruthless criminal organizations on the continent. Italy and Greece are seriously engaged in Albania, but their approach is on occasions too partisan.
The people of Albania are suffering dreadfully. If this is not sufficient to persuade Europe to redouble its efforts in assisting Albania's return to normalcy, Mr. Blair now has a real opportunity to demonstrate his commitment to the fight against the international drug and gun cartels that are devastating one small country.

HEADLINE: Stocks Dive In 3d Straight Volatile Day

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stock prices tumbled yesterday in the third consecutive session of volatile trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average, after falling 50 points in the first hour of trading, soared 100 points higher by noon, only to plunge 180 points from its peak in an afternoon selloff. 
 In late trading, however, those losses were pared, so that by the time the volatile session was over, the Dow stood just 68.08 points below where it began the day, closing at 7,689.98.
But the damage, mostly to the psyches of everyday traders and investors, was evident.
"There is nothing subtle anymore in this market. Everything is volatile -- violent," said Joseph Yurman, a managing director at Robertson Stephens.
One reason is that the market has been dominated in recent days by heavy program trading, analysts said. Any rumor, they added, could touch off a wave of arbitrage-related activity, as traders attempt to capitalize on the huge price swings.
In fact, program trading activity has been heavier than usual, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. Yesterday, for instance, there was one program trade sale of more than 400 blue-chip securities worth over $225 million. The program trade began at 2:42 P.M. and lasted until 3:07.
Analysts said they had to go back to late February to find a program trade with such a large basket of securities. And during that sale, the Dow plunged more than 100 points.
"The program traders are alive and well," Mr. Yurman said from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. "This is the stuff they like: volatility. And when the programs start kicking in it's like a waterfall."
Much of the heaviest activity was tied to a slump in bond prices and rising oil prices. But several analysts said that the volatility of the last few days had less to do with the economy and more to do with technical activity.
"This is what happens with markets at fairly high valuations," said William Meehan, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. "It just takes a little rumor and you get selling in the futures market. It's like a mini-panic."
On Monday, there was an even sharper selloff after word spread that the Japanese Prime Minister had threatened to sell American Treasury securities unless the United States Government acted to stabilize the yen-dollar exchange rate.
Such a move would have depressed bond prices and lifted yields, which compete with stocks. The Dow lost 192 points that day in its worst setback of the year.
But Japanese officials later said that the Prime Minister's remarks were misinterpreted and that there was no intention to sell their large holdings of Treasury issues. On Tuesday, prices bounced back, with the Dow soaring 153 points.
Such wild price swings have become a hallmark of this bull market, partly because investors have become uneasy about the rapid escalation of share prices, often symbolized by the Dow, which has risen about 20 percent since April.
But other analysts also note that with the Dow up at the 7,700-point level, a swing of 100 points -- while it seems large -- is only 1.3 percent. In fact, already this year, there have been 18 days of 100-point moves. Before this year, there were only 5 sessions with 100-point swings.
Yesterday's selloff was largely tied to large capitalization stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.35 points, to 888.99. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index lost 6.19, to 1,446.24.
Volume was heavy on the Big Board, with more than 607 million shares trading.
And of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 23 lost ground yesterday. American Express led the drop, down 1 11/16, to 75 1/2. Philip Morris lost 1, to 43 3/16, and Procter & Gamble lost 1 1/2, to 136 1/8.
Exxon, also a Dow stock, fell 1 9/16, to 60 15/16, along with other slumping oil shares. Chevron lost 7/16, to 73 13/16 and Texaco fell 7/16, to 111 3/8.

HEADLINE: Got the Gig, but Where's the Health Insurance?;
In the Arts, Benefits Are Often 'Catch as Catch Can'

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Carol Reynolds, a dancer, actress and teacher in a Manhattan acting studio, had to give up her health insurance six years ago, when Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield eliminated group rates for associations that almost anyone could join.
"They made it so expensive for individuals that I couldn't handle it," said Ms. Reynolds, who will be 56 next month. 
 Without insurance protection, she lived with constant pain from an old dance injury until last year, when X-rays showed that a bone in her hip was so full of holes that it could collapse at any time. Finally, on March 20, she had hip replacement surgery.
Although friends came up with $5,500 to pay the surgeon, she still owes $18,000 in hospital and doctor bills. The Actors' Fund of America also helped out with a check to cover her living expenses until she could return to work, and the fund helped her file an appeal seeking a one-time payment from Medicaid, which had turned her down.
Ms. Reynolds's problems with health insurance are familiar to hundreds of thousands of people who work in the visual and performing arts. With employment sporadic, and often poorly paid, a high proportion of workers in the arts have little or no insurance, even though the risks of injury can be severe. Singers strain vocal cords; musicians develop painful hand injuries; dancers hurt their knees and backs; painters and ceramicists work with toxic paints and powders that blacken their lungs.
People with AIDS or H.I.V. often have special problems because of the high cost of the many drugs they need. The Actors' Fund AIDS Initiative in New York helps several hundred people each year with money for co-payments on drug regimens and for necessities while they wait for insurance checks.
The Clinton Administration said last month that it would ask Congress to expand Medicaid financing for protease inhibitors, the potent but costly new drugs that can help some people with H.I.V. to keep working and avert AIDS. The drugs cost $8,000 to $16,000 a year. For people with AIDS, they are combined with AZT and other drugs that bring the cost up to $2,000 a month.
Last month, the Screen Actors Guild Foundation announced that it would pay for protease inhibitors for needy members who are uninsured.
Nearly one arts worker in five across the country did not have insurance in 1995, according to a recent analysis of the latest Census Bureau Current Population Survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington.
The research institute said that even more self-employed people -- one in four -- were uninsured. That group includes many painters, freelance writers and graphic artists. It said 17.6 percent of all Americans were uninsured.
Even freelancers who have insurance are often poorly protected. "Half my income goes to medical stuff," said Kristine McKenna, a Los Angeles-based arts writer. She pays $3,000 a year to California Blue Cross, she said, but it does not cover her "sun-related skin problems."
"It's a huge problem," said Ted Berger, executive director of the New York Foundation for the Arts, which provides grants to support individual artists.
"Artists who have worked forever are just playing Russian roulette with their health," Mr. Berger said. "The whole issue of fringe benefits in the not-for-profit community, and the arts commmunity, specifically, is catch as catch can," he said.
To be sure, people who work regularly in movies and television and parts of the music industry typically have solid health benefits under union contracts. But even many members of the entertainment unions have spotty protection, although 77 percent of them were covered throughout the year by entertainment employers or unions, according to a recent survey by the Workplace Center at the Columbia University School of Social Work.
Television actors, for example, are covered for health care by the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists only if they earn at least $7,500 during the year under Aftra contracts.
"From crafts people to photographers to fashion to ballet, circus and opera, it is a population very often not connected to a significant employer," said Barbara S. Davis, human services director in New York for the Actors' Fund, which helps 4,000 people a year with social problems, often involving health care.
Meyer Braiterman, a Brooklyn insurance broker, said that "many performers' union health plans have been decimated." In New York, for example, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians dropped hospital coverage for members, except for those in Broadway shows or pit orchestras of big opera and dance companies. The union still covers doctors' fees.
The American Guild of Musical Artists says it is seeking health coverage for singers and backstage workers who are not on permanent payrolls of opera and dance companies in current negotiations with the New York City Opera and a number of other companies.
A singer who insisted on anonymity said that under current restrictions he was not covered even though he had paid $500 to join the union and its dues were deducted from his paycheck during a recent four-week gig with a Philadelphia opera company.
"Health coverage is practically nonexistent for dancers and musicians in smaller dance companies," said Mark Jones, executive director of the 12-member Limon Dance Company, which spends about $40,000 annually for health benefits. As Government subsidies have dwindled, a number of small dance groups dropped coverage, he said.
"Health care is a tough issue for artists because so many are self-employed or underemployed," said Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for the Arts, a nonprofit research group. "It is not only an issue for those individuals," he added, "but it is a cultural issue for the country, because we allow this important part of our population to live in jeopardy."
Lenore Janacek, a health care consultant and broker in Chicago, said many arts organizations cover their staffs but not the dancers or musicians. She was able to arrange a group rate with Illinois Blue Cross and Blue Shield for expensive medical problems for an artists' coalition. "But for everyday care, they are on their own," she said.
After several years of discussing the problem, the National Endowment for the Arts recently asked the Actors' Fund to help create a national health care and insurance information center. Ms. Davis said that planners from arts groups across the country were laying the groundwork for an "800" telephone service and a Web site on the Internet that will tell callers, including members of the general public, about insurance opportunities for individuals with low incomes or in small groups.
"Many artists have no idea what is available," said Roy Assad, a New York insurance broker who has arranged reduced rates for arts and music groups with the Health Insurance Plan, the New York-based H.M.O.
In New York and Los Angeles, the entertainment capitals, there has been growing recognition of the economic importance of the arts and their attraction for tourists. "The culture sector has been one of the strongest growth industries in New York City in this economic recovery," said Rosemary Scanlon, an economist who is deputy state comptroller for New York City.
Ms. Scanlon estimated that "the impact of the arts in New York City now exceeds $10 billion," up from $9.2 billion in the 1992 survey by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Alliance for the Arts.
Although more than 1.5 million Americans had jobs in the arts in 1995, said Paul Frontsin, a researcher with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, they can be hard to pin down. The Census Bureau lumps together workers in "entertainment and recreation services." One recent New York job survey combined "culture and media," and another survey grouped writers, editors, artists, entertainers and, in what may have been a judgment call, athletes.

In an Actors' Fund survey of 974 members of 11 entertainment industry unions, about three-quarters had health insurance, largely through union helath plans. Here's a breakdown: In 1995, 77% of entertainment industry union members were fully insured...more than half through union health plans. Bar graphs show those members 'insured entire year' and those 'unisured all or part of year' and of those insured those insured through 'union health plan' and 'other sources'.

The Economy and Markets Frail, Thais Breed Skeptics

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

 BODY:
Thailand's new finance minister has moved to repair the country's troubled financial system, but analysts see little evidence so far that the Government has found the resolve to rejuvenate the faltering economy.
The Thai stock market reacted with initial relief to assurances by the new minister, Thanong Bidya, a 49-year-old economist and banker appointed last Thursday, that he would stick to his predecessor's economic recovery plan. 
 The main stock index surged 8.6 percent in a two-day rally on Friday and Monday before retreating 2.3 percent Tuesday on profit taking and continued concern about the country's trade deficit and weakening currency. Yesterday, it rose modestly despite new doubts raised about the Government's recovery program and new fears of a currency devaluation.
Mr. Thanong won Cabinet approval on Tuesday for two measures aimed at reviving the financial system -- one that would allow property loans to be repackaged and sold as securities and the other that would promote mergers among ailing finance companies.
But yesterday, analysts expressed skepticism about the initiatives, saying they were unlikely to have much impact. "They're something of a fudge," said Richard Henderson, research chief at Krungthai Thanakit P.L.C. "The real alternative is to let genuine bankruptcies happen."
The analysts said the Government had yet to overcome the political infighting that has held up meaningful economic change. Indeed, they said, the resignation last week of the previous Finance Minister, Amnuay Viravan, star of the Government's onetime economic "dream team," in a dispute over excise taxes underscored a paralysis in the country's political leadership.
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyuth, taking a break from economic and political crisis, flew to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, over the weekend for an official visit. But when he returned to Bangkok, there was increasing disillusionment with his handling of the economy and doubt about the durability of his seven-month coalition Government.
"Party politics has prevailed and the economy is again the biggest loser," the English-language Bangkok Post said in an editorial.
The appointment in December of Mr. Amnuay as Finance Minister had aroused resentment from other members of the governing coalition because the new minister had not earned his spurs by running for Parliament. From the start, his policies faced challenges from political opponents in the six-party coalition.
When Moody's Investors Service lowered Thailand's long-term credit rating in April, it said that although economic fundamentals were sound, the nation's unstable, personality-based coalition governments were prone to exactly the sort of pressures and infighting that in time brought down Mr. Amnuay.
Although Thailand's economy is humming along nicely by American standards, this country has been one of Asia's "tigers," where growth that would be considered extraordinary in much of the rest of the world is almost expectable here.
Last year, the Thai growth rate fell to 6.7 percent from an average of more than 8 percent in previous years, and last week the central bank lowered its projection for 1997 growth to 5.9 percent from 6.8 percent. If the economy continues on its present course, analysts say, Thailand could end the year with both an unaccustomed trade deficit and its first budget deficit in 10 years.
Yesterday, there was more bad news as economists estimated that Thailand had spent $5 billion in May shoring up its currency, the baht, and analysts questioned how long the Government could head off a devaluation. And the political climate heated up, with opposition members of Parliament demanding during a budget debate that Prime Minister Chavalit account for $2.1 billion they said was missing from the treasury.
The country's economic woes and political tensions have been painfully reflected in the Thai stock market, East Asia's weakest in the last year and a half. In 1996, what had been a booming market lost nearly 39 percent of its value, and so far this year, the main stock index is down nearly 40 percent beyond that.
The financial system is increasingly vulnerable. Thailand's rapid economic growth had been fueled in part by a construction boom that produced a glut in office and apartment buildings, golf courses, shopping centers and entertainment complexes. And the banks and other lenders that financed the expansion are left holding a lot of bad loans, dragging down the broad economy.
Thailand's slowdown has raised fears among some of its fast-developing neighbors that they might be heading toward the same sorts of financial strains. The Philippines, in particular, has experienced a construction boom that has some people fretting it might become the "next Thailand."
Mr. Amnuay's recovery package included a multibillion-dollar government cost-cutting program, tighter controls on lending, forced mergers of troubled finance companies and a $2 billion property rescue.
But as the economy continued to falter, he became the target of growing criticism. The last straw was the decision by the Cabinet, under pressure from affected industries, to overturn an excise tax increase levied weeks before on motorcycles, batteries and granite. When that happened, he quit in protest.
Almost from the moment that Mr. Thanong was appointed as Mr. Amnuay's successor, he came under criticism as too inexperienced and politically weak to deal as finance minister with the country's economic problems.
But Prime Minister Chavalit said that he already had plenty of economic policies and that what he needed was "someone to do the job." He said he would take charge of economic policy himself, although he has said in the past that he knows little about the field.
"The basic problem," a Western financial analyst remarked, "is that Thailand has no central leadership -- an unstable, inefficient leadership. The country as a whole is stable, but its coalition governments are tremendously unstable. People who have bet their fortunes on continued growth are suffering."
Still, he said, "it's hard to cry too much over economic growth rates that are still 5 or 6 percent."

HEADLINE: A Lakeside Villa in Berlin Tells Its Long, Bittersweet Story

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 25

 BODY:
If buildings could tell stories, the 40-room lakeside villa at Sandwerder 17-19 on Berlin's Wannsee would have a tale to recount.
Once the home of a prominent Jewish banking family, it became the wartime home of Walther Funk, Hitler's economic guru who built a bunker where the Fuhrer was said to have spent some time. 
 Then, in 1945, the occupying Red Army made a shambles of the villa before the Americans took it over as a military recreation center. Thousands of United States soldiers and civilians in West Berlin took time out from the cold war to enjoy tennis and swimming and sailing.
Now the imposing structure is about to enter its newest incarnation, that of an academic institution that is billed as an emblem of American interest in Germany at a time when some Germans feel the United States has lost interest in its erstwhile ally.
At a ceremony here today, a more human tale emerged. The people who are donating the $3 million founding grant for the American Academy to open next year are a German-born, American Jewish couple who met at the Sandwerder villa in the 1930's before they fled the Nazis.
"Time is a funny thing," said Anna-Maria Kellen, now a New York philanthropist, whose father, Hans Arnhold, once owned the villa. "I never expected that the house in which I grew up, where I learned my first words and took my first steps, where I met my dearest friend, my husband, would some day re-enter my life."
Indeed, when the donation was announced today at a ceremony attended by German and American officials as well as Mrs. Kellen and her husband, Stephen, a New York banker, the twist of destiny seemed to beg a question: why would people dispossessed by Nazi Germany return with gifts, particularly now when, across Europe, a broad debate has emerged on the moral and financial debt owed to survivors of the Holocaust?
The answer, possibly, lies not so much in Germany as in Berlin, which both husband and wife remember as a special place where the hatreds of Nazism did not spread so quickly as elsewhere in Germany. "I became a good New Yorker, but I always remained a good Berliner," Mr. Kellen said at the ceremony.
And to listen to the benefactors as well as others involved in creating the American Academy for visiting scholars in Berlin -- similar to the American Academy in Rome -- the institution will stand as a display of United States commitment to turn cold war swords into scholarships.
The academy responds to "a perception that the U.S. does not care about Germany," said Richard C. Holbrooke, now the academy's chairman and once the American Ambassador to Bonn.
Mr. Holbrooke said the Kellens' gift was the bulk of $5 million donated so far -- half the $10 million the Academy is seeking to start up and operate for the first two years.
As of next year, the American Academy is to begin offering fellowships and scholarships to academics and professionals to visit and study in Berlin. The villa on the Wannsee will be named the Hans Arnhold Center for Mrs. Kellen's father. Its history, though, will be hard to forget. The Wannsee is better known as the location of a nearby villa where Nazi leaders formulated what they called the "final solution" in January 1942.
As early as 1927, Mrs. Kellen said, her father sensed that Jews would be forced to leave Germany. "I think I was a little too young to understand," she said.

HEADLINE: Blair Offers New Ulster Deal; Key Is Disarming Both Sides

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, June 25

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair disclosed a new plan today for all-party peace talks on Northern Ireland coupled with simultaneous negotiations on disarming Catholic and Protestant gunmen. He challenged Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, to make an "absolute commitment" to nonviolence so it could take part in the talks.
The issue of how to arrange a weapons handover has been cited by Sinn Fein as a reason not to enter multi-party negotiations, with the Government of John Major rejecting parallel talks and Sinn Fein demanding them as a condition for considering a cease-fire. 
 Today's detailed initiative, a joint proposal of the Governments of Britain and Ireland, sets a timetable for the process beginning in September and ending in May.
Citing "revulsion and outrage right across the world" over the I.R.A. killings of two policemen in the town of Lurgan 10 days ago, Mr. Blair said that patience with the organization's refusal to abandon violence was running out. "Whatever Sinn Fein now say or do, I am determined to move on," he told a packed and solemn House of Commons. "Sinn Fein know what they have to do. There is no shred of justification for carrying on as they are now."
The leader of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams, acknowledging that the Blair Government had taken positions "in advance of those of the last Government." said from Belfast that he would give the proposal his "fullest attention and consideration."
Mr. Blair has moved vigorously in his first weeks in office to take up the search for an accord in Northern Ireland, where sectarian violence has claimed more than 3,200 lives since 1969. His Government was deeply dismayed by the Lurgan murders since they came at a time when it had restored the first contact with Sinn Fein in the 15 months since the I.R.A. ended its cease-fire; the Government and Sinn Fein had held two meetings, with a third scheduled. In addition, Mr. Blair's Secretary for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, has pursued contacts with all sides in the conflict more aggressively than her predecessors did, and a new government and new prime minister, Bertie Ahern, are coming to office in Dublin this week.
Mr. Blair noted today that the killings had had repercussions for Sinn Fein's credibility in the United States, where he had just spent three days at economic summit talks. President Clinton, he noted, condemned them "in exactly the same terms as I did." While in the United States, Mr. Blair appealed to Americans to stop giving aid to the I.R.A., echoing a longtime complaint by British governments that Americans are unknowingly funding violence.
He told the Commons today that three days before the killings of the two constables in Lurgan, he had sent a note to Sinn Fein setting out the terms of what was needed to gain re-entry to the talks and the period of time, six weeks, that the Government would need to conclude that the cease-fire declaration was a "sincere" one.
"I have dealt straight with them," the Prime Minister said of Sinn Fein today. "I expect straight dealing in return. We and the other parties will not be waiting around for them." He repeated an earlier warning that "the settlement train is leaving, with or without them."
While there is no longer any doubting the British Government's commitment to pressing ahead with peace talks even without the participation of representatives of Sinn Fein, it is hard to assess whether any meaningful accord could be reached without them.
Mr. Blair is trying to take the heat out of the coming season of Protestant marches, which ended in violence last year. The staging of the attacks in Lurgan, a County Armagh town in the very area where the marches are due to start early next month, was seen as an effort by the I.R.A. to provoke retaliation by Loyalist paramilitaries, plunging Northern Ireland back into the tit-for-tat violence that has largely abated in recent years.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary said today that it had arrested a 29-year-old man and charged him with the murders of Constable Roland John Graham and Reserve Constable David Andrew Johnston, the two men shot as they were on patrol in Lurgan on June 16. The man was identified only as Colin Francis Duffy, with no occupation or involvement in any political group.
The police in Belfast said today that they had foiled an I.R.A. ambush in a house off a street that is often used by British Army and police vehicles. A man was arrested and two loaded AK-47 rifles were seized. "There is no time to waste," Mr. Blair told the Commons. "The situation on the ground in Northern Ireland is fragile."
Before presenting his plan to the Commons, Mr. Blair met at 10 Downing Street with David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, to seek his cooperation. Mr. Blair paid tribute to Mr. Trimble's acceptance of the plan, even though he knew it was not all entirely to his liking and would cause him "difficulties."
The leaders of the two principal opposition parties, William Hague of the Conservatives, and Paddy Ashdown of the Liberal Democrats, expressed support for the initiative, in keeping with the tradition of non-partisanship on British policy in Northern Ireland.
John Hume, head of the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party in Northern Ireland and the man who helped engineer the initial I.R.A. cease-fire with Mr. Adams, also rose to praise the approach. But the Rev. Ian Paisley, head of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party, complained that Sinn Fein was being offered a chance to rejoin the talks without relinquishing "one weapon," or, in a reference to a plastic high-explosive, "one ounce of Semtex."
The principal new element in today's proposal is an agreement to set up simultaneous talks on disarmament and peace, a step called "parallel decommissioning." The term means that the I.R.A. and rival Protestant paramilitary groups would give up their arms in closely monitored stages while the main talks on a lasting settlement continued.
When this was proposed in January 1996 by George J. Mitchell, the former United States Senator who is the chairman of the year-old peace talks, Mr. Major said it was unacceptable and called instead on the I.R.A. to give up its arms as a condition for entering the talks. Sinn Fein has argued that arms should be turned in only when a final political settlement is reached.
As outlined in a 12-page document from Ms. Mowlam's office, the plan would set up an independent commission to make proposals for disarming the guerrilla forces and then assess how to carry them out. Another committee would be charged with coming up with "confidence-building measures," and a full meeting would be convened every two months to review progress. Any overall agreement would be put to a referendum in Northern Ireland and to a vote in Parliament.
The I.R.A. violence of recent weeks is evidence that at least some elements of the underground organization want to sabotage any moves toward new talks. The political talks do not hold out the prospect of a united Ireland for which activists have fought, but a government in Northern Ireland that would enjoy a degree of autonomy like that being proposed for Scotland and Wales, while still remaining a part of Britain.

HEADLINE: Bond Issue In New Jersey Brings In $2.8 Billion

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 25

 BODY:
Investors from around the world took part in the biggest debt offering in New Jersey's history, buying more than $2.8 billion in bonds issued by the state today.
The sale, which was preceded by months of political bickering and debate, marked a victory for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who is using the proceeds to shore up the state pension fund and to avoid using $590 million of this year's budget to cover a scheduled contribution to the fund. 
 Enthusiasm for the bonds was strong enough that the offerings were sold at an average interest rate of 7.64 percent, significantly lower than the originally projected rate of 7.78 percent.
Also, the debt service -- the total amount the state will repay over the life of the bonds -- was reduced, because the bonds were scheduled to be repaid in the year 2029, instead of 2033, as had been earlier projected. In a statement, Ms. Whitman called the bond issue an "overwhelming success" and a "big win" for taxpayers.
The individual and institutional investors who bought the bonds apparently were not deterred by critics of Ms. Whitman's plan, who have argued that it would place the state in a precarious fiscal position, and have also tried to stop the sale through court challenges.
Officials at Merrill Lynch & Company, the firm that managed the bond sale, said the response from investors exceeded expectations. Noting the lower than anticipated interest rate, David Andersen, managing director and co-head of municipal trading and underwriting at Merrill Lynch, credited state officials for spending "several days educating the market on the deal."
And as Samuel B. Corliss Jr., managing director of Merrill Lynch's public finance group, pointed out, "the current bullish market environment for new issues" also allowed the firm to price the offering below expectations.
Institutions that took part in the sale included United States and international pension funds, banks, insurance companies and mutual funds, state officials said. There were about 15,000 retail buyers, and the average spent by each buyer was $25,000, according to Merrill Lynch.
The total transaction was the largest municipal bond issue ever for Merrill Lynch, which will split a fee of $23 million with a group of firms that jointly managed the sale.
The total transaction included three separate offerings, one for zero coupon bonds totaling $1.14 billion, another for $1.3 billion in current coupon bonds sold to institutional investors and a third for current coupon bonds totaling $375 million that were sold to institutional investors.
While investors were gearing up for the bond purchase this week, critics of the Republican Governor's financing plan -- most of whom are Democrats -- were trying to stop the sale from going forward.
A state appeals panel on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit filed by Democratic politicians who were seeking to stop the bond sale on the basis that it was unconstitutional to issue the debt without voter approval. (Earlier this month, the State Legislature approved the plan.)
The three-judge panel rejected a request by the Democrats to halt the sale. Also earlier this month, a judge in Superior Court ruled that the bond sale did not require voter approval, and on Monday that same judge refused a final motion to freeze the sale pending appeal.
Alan Karcher, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs and a former county Democratic Party chairman, said he planned to file an appeal with the State Supreme Court.
Despite the robust sales of the bonds, Mrs. Whitman's fiscal maneuvers have caused concern on Wall Street among investors who wonder what effect the huge debt will have on the state's long-term stability. On Friday, Moody's Investor Service, a New York-based bond ratings agency, issued a report in which it warned that the state's aggressive budget strategies in recent years and its increasing debt "will leave it less well prepared to deal with the next economic downturn."
Moody's gave an A1 rating to the $2.75 billion pension financing issuebut also warned that the agency was taking a "negative outlook" on the state's general obligation debt, which is rated Aa1, a few notches above the pension bonds.
The negative outlook means that the rating on those pre-existing bonds could be lowered over the next one to three years.
But neither the threat of ongoing litigation nor the potential for future tough economic times in the state could create much trepidation among the bulls on Wall Street today. As Mr. Corliss of Merrill Lynch asserted: "Given the overwhelming response from the market, I would conjecture there was no concern."

HEADLINE: Carnival Starts Bidding War For Celebrity Cruise Lines

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 25

 BODY:
The Carnival Corporation opened a bidding war today when it offered $525 million in cash or stock for Celebrity Cruise Lines.
The offer comes on the heels of an offer last week by Royal Caribbean International for $230 million in cash and $270 million in stock for Celebrity. 
 Both offers include assumption of $800 million in Celebrity debt.
Tim Gallagher, Carnival's vice president, said last night that the Miami-based company would provide more details Thursday.
There was no answer tonight at Royal Caribbean's Miami headquarters.
Money-losing Celebrity, a well-regarded upscale line with four modern ships and another scheduled for delivery in October, appeals to older customers and has many from New England. But it is considered too small to compete on its own, as the industry expands internationally.
Under the Carnival offer, Celebrity's shareholders could choose how much of the purchase price would be paid in cash, or a combination of cash and Carnival Class A common stock in the same proportion as the Royal Caribbean offer.
Carnival said it might consider increasing the purchase price if it found Celebrity worth it.
The Carnival Corporation owns Carnival Cruise Lines, Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises and has interests in Seabourn Cruise Line and Costa Cruise Lines, which combined operate 33 ships in the Caribbean, Alaska, Europe and other destinations.
The merger of Royal Caribbean and Celebrity would have ranked the combined companies second largest in the industry behind Carnival and ahead of London-based P&O Cruises, the parent of Princess.
Royal Caribbean, which sails to more than 150 destinations worldwide, changed its name last year after almost 30 years as the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. The company, based in Miami, wanted a name that better reflected its growing fleet and greater reach.
Richard D. Fain, Royal Caribbean's chairman and chief executive, said last week that "Together, the two brands will enable us to deploy vessels and attract customers on an increasingly global basis, as well as provide opportunities to achieve greater economies of scale."
Celebrity is jointly owned by the Chandris Group, a Greek shipping company with headquarters in London, and the Overseas Shipholding Group Inc., one of the world's biggest bulk shipping companies. Chandris also owns hotels in Greece, as well as commercial ships.
Cruise Week, an industry newsletter, reported last week that Overseas Shipholding Group was disappointed with the financial results of its relationship with Celebrity and wanted to sell its interest in the line.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Tokyo Economic Data Send Dollar Down vs. the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most key currencies yesterday, hurt by unexpectedly strong Japanese economic data that suggested Japan's record-low interest rates could start to rise.
New indications of a possible delay in Europe's single currency also pressured the dollar indirectly by helping to strengthen the mark, which would remain the predominant European currency if the January 1999 timetable for introducing the euro was postponed. 
 The dollar ended higher against the pound on a broad selloff in the British currency, its second straight decline, on British trade data that suggested the pound's strength was hurting Britain's exports. But the pound's weakness largely benefited the mark and yen, further contributing to the dollar's weakness against those currencies.
The dollar fell to an intraday low of 113.30 yen before settling in New York at 113.80 yen, down from 114.82 yen Tuesday and the lowest closing level in a week. The dollar cost 1.7235 marks, down from 1.7245 marks. The pound fell to $1.6636 from $1.6675.
The main event in currency trading came early in the day when the Bank of Japan released its quarterly survey of business sentiment known as the Tankan, viewed as a barometer of Japanese economic and interest-rate trends.
Instead of showing weakness as had been widely forecast, the results showed a surge in confidence among big Japanese manufacturers.
The unexpectedly positive reading suggested that the Bank of Japan could soon start raising interest rates, which have languished at record lows since September 1995 because of prolonged Japanese economic weakness. Higher rates would enhance the yen's value.
"I think the Tankan report surprised the financial markets and the purchases of yen overnight were quite significant," said John Nelson, head of foreign-exchange trading at ABN-AMRO Bank N.V. in Chicago.
The dollar later recovered a bit as the foreign-exchange market reassessed the Tankan results and concluded a rise in Japanese interest rates was unlikely for a while. Despite the rising confidence among big manufacturers, smaller companies and nonmanufacturing businesses were more pessimistic about the economy than three months earlier.

HEADLINE: Decisive Days for Congo

 BODY:
The coming days will show what kind of ruler Congo's new President, Laurent Kabila, is likely to be. A United Nations team has arrived in the country, formerly called Zaire, to investigate reported massacres by Mr. Kabila's troops earlier this year. If Congolese officials cooperate with the investigation, as Mr. Kabila has assured the Clinton Administration they will, Washington can put some faith in the new leader's other promises. These include an end to corruption, respect for human rights and eventual democratic elections.
If Mr. Kabila lets his lieutenants obstruct the investigation by denying the U.N. independent access to people and places, Washington should suspend the tentative support and promises of assistance it has offered the new Government. 
 Mr. Kabila initially stirred high hopes by promising clean and law-abiding government after decades of corruption and brutality under his predecessor, Mobutu Sese Seko. But since he took full charge of Congo last month, disturbing reports of arbitrary rule and military brutality have emerged. These include credible accounts that Mr. Kabila's troops massacred thousands of Hutu refugees.
Earlier this month, President Clinton offered Mr. Kabila assistance in improving health and education and American advice on planning a market economy and democratic elections. But Mr. Clinton's emissary, Bill Richardson, who is also Washington's United Nations delegate, made clear that American help depended on whether Mr. Kabila addressed human rights and refugee concerns and how quickly he moved toward democracy.
Last weekend a United Nations advance team arrived in Congo to establish ground rules for the investigation into the reported refugee massacres. The tone of its first meetings with Congolese officials has been cooperative. But specific details remain to be worked out.
Mr. Kabila must make sure that when a full U.N. team starts work it is free to interview people and conduct forensic tests in the areas where massacres may have taken place. Any soldiers found to have participated in massacres must be promptly prosecuted. Mr. Kabila must also see that United Nations refugee workers and the Red Cross are allowed access to all remaining refugees. He needs to start delivering on the humanitarian agenda raised by Mr. Richardson if he wants continued American support.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Divided Over Mexican Governor Who's Reportedly Linked to Drug Trade

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN and JULIA PRESTON 

 BODY:
United States diplomats in Mexico City have rejected a proposal to revoke the visa of a powerful state governor in Mexico, despite what officials described as a widespread judgment among law enforcement and intelligence analysts in Washington that he is linked to major drug traffickers.
Differences over the issue have opened an unusual rift between American officials responsible for anti-drug efforts and the departing United States Ambassador to Mexico, James R. Jones, who has grown close to Mexico's governing elite. 
 American officials said the dispute also underscored the difficulties they face in trying to take action against Mexican politicians and businessmen who are implicated in the drug trade on the basis of information that law-enforcement and intelligence agents piece together from informants and secret investigations.
The State Department typically defers to its ambassadors and consuls general on visa cases abroad. But officials in Washington said divisions over the Mexican governor had been so deep that the embassy's decision might yet be reviewed by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
In recent years, the United States has revoked the visas of scores of Colombians linked to the drug trade, President Ernesto Samper among them. But applying the same strategy has proven considerably more complicated in Mexico, a country with which the United States has a far more important economic and political relationship.
Officials in Washington said Ambassador Jones had objected repeatedly to efforts by State Department drug-policy officials to withdraw the visa of Manlio Fabio Beltrones, the Governor of the Mexican state of Sonora, which borders Arizona.
Mr. Jones voiced considerable skepticism about the intelligence data on Mr. Beltrones, calling it inconclusive. He also told State Department officials that he did not want to preside over "a witch hunt" in which Mr. Beltrones's rights might be trampled.
The Ambassador is leaving his post this week to head the international division of Warnaco Group Inc., a large multinational apparel company that has extensive operations in Mexico, including a brassiere manufacturing plant in Sonora.
Mr. Jones said in an interview in Mexico City that he was unaware during the visa dispute that Warnaco operated a plant in Mr. Beltrones's state. He said it was "off the wall" to suppose his judgment was influenced by the possibility that Mr. Beltrones might be able to harm the business of his new employer.
"If you don't even know, I don't see how you could have a conflict," Mr. Jones said.
Officials of Warnaco said its Sonora plant, in the border city of San Luis Rio Colorado, has operated for 12 years and employs about 800 workers in the assembly of Olga brand brassieres. They said it was one of five plants the company runs in Mexico.
Mr. Jones said senior embassy officials, including law-enforcement and intelligence officers, had voted unanimously against revoking the visa on June 13 while he was out of town.
However, a senior official of the Drug Enforcement Administration directly contradicted Mr. Jones' claim. The official, who spoke on the condition he not be named, said drug-enforcement officials at the embassy had participated in discussions, but never in a vote.
In Washington, half a dozen other officials interviewed about the case also challenged the Ambassador's position, suggesting that it was at least inconsistent.
Almost three years ago, some of the officials noted, Mr. Beltrones had been included on a secret list of 18 serving and former Mexican officials who were believed by embassy officials to have protected drug traffickers or were implicated in other serious corruption.
The officials said Mr. Jones had the list drawn up and then delivered to the incoming Mexican President, Ernesto Zedillo, in an effort to keep the 18 men out of Mr. Zedillo's Government.
Before Mr. Beltrones, 44, was implicated in a series of scandals, he had been widely seen as a rising star in Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, and he remains popular in Sonora.
In an interview in Mexico City, Mr. Jones denied that he had shown any favoritism to Mr. Beltrones because of the Governor's influential place in Mexican politics.
Officials said Mr. Beltrones's visa began to come under serious scrutiny in February, around the time The New York Times reported that numerous United States drug-intelligence reports linked the Governor to major drug smugglers.
Then, as now, Mr. Beltrones denied being anything but an implacable foe of the traffickers, who have made his state one of the most important bases of drug operations in Mexico.
"I am extremely upset and indignant about these reports, which are entirely false," he said in a telephone interview yesterday from his office in the city of Hermosillo. Mr. Beltrones said he had received no information from American officials about the status of his visa.
Since the February article appeared, both Mr. Beltrones and Jorge Carrillo Olea, the Governor of Morelos, who was also mentioned in the article, have asked the Mexican Attorney General's office to bring criminal charges of libel in the matter.
Mr. Carrillo Olea has also denied any involvement with drug traffickers. American officials said they are continuing to review whether to cancel Mr. Carrillo Olea's visa.
United States immigration laws say American consular officials can revoke a visa if they have a "reason to believe" the foreigner has aided or colluded with drug traffickers. That criterion can be met where officials have "several reliable and corroborative reports" of such involvement.
In late February, the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, then run by Robert S. Gelbard, began to circulate a memorandum calling for the revocation of Mr. Beltrones's visa.
The State Department's Office of the Under Secretary for Global Affairs endorsed the proposal, officials said, as did its Bureau of Consular Affairs. The Department's Latin America bureau opposed the idea, however, echoing Mr. Jones's concerns.
After a sometimes heated struggle within the State Department, the issue was referred to the United States Embassy in Mexico City. Officials also sent the embassy about a dozen pages summarizing intelligence reports on Mr. Beltrones.
Officials said the documents showed that American agencies had received frequent reports of contacts between Mr. Beltrones and the powerful syndicates that move cocaine and other drugs through Sonora and across the border into the United States.
One American official who read the documents said they contained "no smoking gun"; other officials described them as unusually voluminous and specific.
The most concrete and frequently mentioned charge in the documents was that Mr. Beltrones was present at a meeting at a ranch in northern Mexico where Raul Salinas de Gortari, the elder brother of the former President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, received a payoff from Mexican traffickers, one official said.
At a meeting at the United States Embassy, an official said, Mr. Jones underscored the political sensitivity of Mr. Beltrones's case once more.
The Ambassador argued that in deciding whether to cancel the visas of prominent Mexicans, the embassy should, in effect, consider a higher standard of evidence than that stipulated in consular regulations, the official said. He urged that American diplomats act only on evidence that would be strong enough to put before a grand jury in the United States.
Later, at Mr. Beltrones' request, Mr. Jones also invited the Governor to the Ambassador's residence in Mexico City so that he might defend himself against the allegations. Mr. Beltrones said he argued strongly that he had been slandered by the reports.
At the Ambassador's suggestion, he said, he will file a request under the Freedom of Information Act for any drug intelligence reports that mention him.
In the interview, Mr. Jones repeatedly took issue with accounts of the debate given by officials in Washington. He denied having contravened consular rules. But he also called the reason-to-believe standard "a great nebulous thing."
"If I need to convince a group of people that what I'm suggesting is right," he added, "I want to have the minimum amount of credibility of what I present to them. And the lowest test of credibility is generally what you would present to a grand jury."
Mr. Jones contended that the initiative to review Mr. Beltrones's visa had come from him. As far as he was concerned, he said, the case was closed.
"There was a discussion and it was decided that based upon the information, there wasn't enough information to do it," he said. "That's the decision that the embassy unanimously agrees upon. If it is going to be overruled, it is going to be overruled in Washington."

HEADLINE: Harvest of Shares;
One Farm's Stock Plan Gives Its Migrant Workers a Stake

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: WATERLOO, Wis.

 BODY:
Like most farms reliant on seasonal field workers, the McKay Nursery Company long ago gave up the notion that it could afford wages high enough to make such dirty, wearying labor attractive to unemployed Americans.
"We haven't had a local market for entry-level farm labor since the 1960's," said Griff Mason, McKay's president, recalling how the company turned to migrant Mexican workers to sustain its nursery here in southeastern Wisconsin. "People here just didn't see it as a place to start a career." 
 Since then, though, McKay has veered far from the norm in agriculture. It has quietly evolved into an employee-owned enterprise where many migrant workers not only play an increasingly influential role, but annually receive chunks of stock in the company. Mr. Mason projects that the stock distributions and related bonuses will compound into a nest egg of at least $100,000 in 30 years for even the most lowly paid.
"I don't feel like an owner," said Guillermo Castillo, a 28-year-old native of Zacatecas, Mexico, who freely admits he is confused about the details of the company's ownership structure and his accumulating holdings. "But I do feel like a partner," he added, noting that some peers had kidded him in his early days about the amount of unpaid work he performed caring for young plants.
Such attitudes -- and the opportunities that created them -- are so rare in the world of migrant labor that McKay caught the attention of the Business Enterprise Trust, a California foundation created by the television producer Norman Lear to honor businesses that combine financial success with social vision.
In February, Mr. Mason, along with Richard Knoke, the company's nursery superintendent, and Reuben Almanza, a migrant worker who has been coming north annually from Texas to work McKay's fields for 35 years, were lauded by business leaders and President Clinton at the foundation's annual awards ceremony in New York.
McKay's award was a public reminder that many Americans are angered or embarrassed every time they are confronted with agribusiness's reliance on impoverished migrants -- and with the way many companies treat them.
Conditions have improved for the nation's one million farm workers since Edward R. Murrow's shocking 1960 CBS documentary "Harvest of Shame." Most now get unemployment insurance, Social Security, and workers' compensation coverage, clean water and access to toilets.
After adjusting for inflation, though, wages have been declining for 20 years, as illegal immigrants continue to flood the labor market. The most recent Department of Labor surveys estimate that the number of illegal aliens working on farms jumped from less than 10 percent in the 1988-89 crop year to 37 percent in 1994-95. Labor leaders say the actual figures are higher.
Meanwhile, many seasonal workers have seen their cost of living soar. Employers have avoided charges that they provide substandard housing by simply shifting to the workers the burden of finding housing and transportation to work.
Nor have the most flagrant abuses entirely disappeared. Just last month, three men pleaded guilty in South Carolina to enslaving migrant workers who had illegally entered the country from Mexico.
"There's rampant violations of the minimum wage laws," Bruce Goldstein, director of the Farmworker Justice Fund in Washington, said.
Debate about migrants is an annual event in Congress. This year, growers support a Senate bill to make it easier to import more "guest workers" -- foreign nationals who are allowed to enter the United States temporarily for specific employers. Farm employers say there are not enough natives and legal immigrants to meet their needs.
But critics say that the growers are simply trying to avoid paying higher wages and that unemployment remains high among farm workers. The Labor Department estimated in its most recent study that 190,000, or 12 percent, were unemployed in 1994. Hearings have not yet been scheduled on the Senate bill.
At McKay, wages are legal but meager by any measure. New migrants start at $6 an hour, far less than the $7.50-an-hour average for farm workers in the Great Lakes region. Just 30 hours a week of work is guaranteed, though migrants can count on the typical spring workload being almost double that. After 35 years, Mr. Almanza's base wage has risen to just $9.50 an hour.
In California, which has half the nation's farm workers, the union wages paid at Dole Fresh Foods, start at almost $7.50 an hour plus piecework bonuses that lift the average to more than $9. And migrant workers can easily find jobs paying $12 an hour or more in meatpacking operations here in the upper Midwest.
But McKay's other benefits and advancement opportunities keep far more than 90 percent of its migrant workers returning year after year. Ten of McKay's 60 year-round employees, including several key managers, are former migrants whose early stints on its payroll lasted only through the 10 weeks of spring when the company is busiest shipping trees and shrubs. About 60 migrants have moved into jobs that keep them on the payroll eight months annually, long enough to work the minimum 1,000 hours needed to receive bonus payments in company stock along with the year-round staff.
Eligible migrant workers receive bonuses equal to 20 percent to 25 percent of their wages in stock or cash; the mix depends on how much stock is available to distribute in a given year. It comes to at least $2,000 worth of stock or cash each year for even the lowest-paid worker, Mr. Mason said.
The stock, which is not traded publicly, is revalued each August by an outside accounting firm. Mr. Mason said it had been steadily appreciating but declined to disclose the most recent price. McKay does not release financial performance data, but filings with industry associations and statements about the breakdown of sales suggest that annual revenue is about $15 million.
The beneficiaries of the McKay stock plan include Monsies Gomez, who has risen to second-in-command of daily operations, and his wife, Juanita, who became a full-time worker in 1974. Mrs. Gomez, who plans to retire this August at age 55, figured she would not have to work again, thanks to the money the couple expect to receive from selling her stock back to the company.
"I never expected to see this when I started," said Mrs. Gomez, who declined to say how much the sale should bring. McKay has set up a financial counseling program to arm its migrant employees against bad advice from investment advisers.
Employees are required to sell their stock to the company when they retire, which limits its value. Mr. Mason worries about outsiders trying to convince employees to eliminate that restriction in the stock plan, risking loss of control of the company in return for a short-term gain in the value of the shares.
McKay is uneasy about being cast as a model of progressive migrant labor policy. Indeed, in horticultural terms, the century-old company might be seen as a "sport," a freak of nature that pops up unexpectedly through a combination of heritage and circumstances that may not be easily duplicated. Senior executives stress that McKay's employment policies for migrant workers are just one part of a unique and sometimes stressful corporate culture.
By all accounts, the pivotal figure was Karl Junginger, who succeeded the founder, W. G. McKay, at the company's helm in 1959. Part autocrat, part father figure, Mr. Junginger used a combination of low base pay and substantial bonuses to create a strong team feeling.
The search for a tax-friendly way to pay off the small group of private investors who owned the company, make sure it remained independent and prepare for Mr. Junginger eventual retirement led to the sale of all of the company's stock in 1984 to an employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP.
"The ESOP is the current embodiment of the feeling Karl created," said Mr. Mason, who had been a grocery clerk and life insurance salesman before joining the company as a 20-year-old apprentice. He was 43 when he became president in 1988, three years before Mr. Junginger's death.
Migrants and former migrants make up about half the ESOP membership (though they own considerably less than half the shares) but that is not the only thing unusual about McKay's stock plan. Most such plans own less than a majority of a company. McKay's plan owns 100 percent.
Mr. Mason has always envisioned the stock plan as a tool to goad all his employees to feel more responsibility for improving operations throughout the company. "It's an excuse for changing the culture to get more bottom-up participation," Mr. Mason said.
But other managers, whom he encouraged a visitor to interview, say that process went too far in the early years and may still need reining in.
"This is the greatest company in the country to work for, but people have way too intense discussions about small things," said Jerry Draeger, the executive vice president. "The ESOP concept is beautiful, but it had gone to the extreme where you couldn't make a decision without a committee of 12."
At the same time, he and others said, some lower-level employees made costly mistakes by assuming they had the authority to do what they wanted without direction from upper management.
One positive outcome, however, is that immigrant shareholders, while generally more reticent than their American-born counterparts, have still had a remarkably open window on how the business operates and have begun to take more responsibility.
The employee stock plan is not the only peculiarity shaping McKay's award-winning employment policies; indeed, they might not be possible were it not for the economics of the nursery business. The trees and shrubs produced by the nation's 5,000 nurseries are a high-priced crop. Total receipts of $10.4 billion last year were higher than those for crops like cotton and wheat that involve many more farms and millions of acres.
Nurseries are also labor-intensive. For McKay, the value of each plant and the company's investment in labor -- 50 cents for every $1 in revenue -- create an unusually strong need compared with other farmers to reduce turnover and training costs.
Farm labor leaders also note that nurseries can attract the cream of the migrant work force because they offer jobs that last longer than picking a season's produce or fruit. McKay's location may also have figured in its evolving employment policies: The farther employers of seasonal workers are from Texas or California -- the main marketplaces for hirings of migrants -- the more benefits they must offer to recruit workers.
Could McKay's deal for migrants get sweeter still? Mr. Almanza, for one, said that the company ought to offer medical insurance. Indeed, in California, unionized farm workers with the best contracts enjoy not just medical coverage, but dental and vision benefits and paid vacations.
Matching those standards would be a challenge for McKay, because the company needs to control labor costs to stay competitive with other nurseries, especially as it expands from its primary markets in Minneapolis, lower Wisconsin and Chicago.
Still, even union members see plenty to envy in McKay's approach. "I've never heard of giving stock to migrants," said Doug Blaylock, an administrator of the United Farm Workers Union pension plan in Keene, Calif. "I think it's fantastic."

HEADLINE: CLINTON SHARPLY TIGHTENS AIR POLLUTION REGULATIONS DESPITE CONCERN OVER COSTS

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
President Clinton today approved significantly tighter pollution limits on deadly soot and choking smog, while offering states and cities substantial flexibility in deciding how to reach the new goals over the next 10 years and beyond.
The action, one of the most important environmental decisions of the decade, ended a fierce behind-the-scenes battle. Mr. Clinton sided with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol M. Browner, against the concerns of his economic advisers, who had balked in the face of industry complaints that the rules would cost far more than they were worth. 
 The White House put aside many of those economic concerns once Vice President Al Gore jumped into the fray last week, after lobbying by environmental groups, Administration officials said today.
And in the end, Ms. Browner made relatively modest changes to the rule her agency proposed last November.
Announcing his decision in a speech in Tennessee, the President cast it as an initiative to protect children, a favorite theme for the Administration. In this case, he cited especially the asthmatics who are most at risk from exposure to ozone and small particles of soot, two common pollutants caused by burning fossil fuels.
"I approved some very strong new regulations today that will be somewhat controversial, but I think kids ought to be healthy," Mr. Clinton said at a conference on families at which Mr. Gore was the host.
The rules are expected to have wide-ranging practical effects. For example, old power plants in the Midwest may have to install the kind of expensive pollution-control equipment that is already commonly used in much of the Northeast, where the air is dirtier. Also, states will probably have to put more money into mass transit and other measures to reduce pollution from automobiles.
In addition, some factories like steel plants that burn lots of coal may be required to adapt their equipment to cleaner-burning fuels to avoid emissions of soot. And even the United States Forest Service may have to change the way it sets controlled fires on public lands to avoid sending too much smoke into the air.
The air pollution regulation is one of two major environmental issues on the President's agenda this week, both of them intensely debated and each of them dividing one of the Administration's core constituencies, environmentalists, from business groups that the Administration does not want to alienate. On Thursday, he is to outline the Administration's policies on global warming to a United Nations conference in New York, where the United States has been criticized by European states for not moving swiftly enough to control emissions of carbon dioxide.
Although the pollutants are different and the problems they cause are not directly related, both global warming and the soot and smog issues addressed today stem largely from the combustion of fossil fuels.
Like the efforts to negotiate a binding treaty to limit emissions of gases that cause global warming, the Administration's decision on air quality rules faced an enormous campaign of opposition by industry and equally determined efforts by environmentalists who supported it.
"The final product, I am delighted to say, is a major step forward for protecting the public health of the people of this country," said Ms. Browner, whose adamant defense of the proposals was described by her backers as courageous and principled, but by her detractors as stubborn and close-minded. "These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children."
She spoke at a White House briefing that included officials who for weeks have argued over the rules.
Those millions of people, E.P.A. officials said, live in hundreds of counties that will eventually have to impose new pollution control measures to meet the new standards.
The agency has claimed, based on epidemiological studies, that 15,000 people die every year from exposure to these pollutants, especially the fine sooty particles. And the agency expects that hundreds of thousands of acute asthma attacks can be avoided each year, since smog often triggers breathing difficulties in children with that disease.
By putting the new controls into place, states with relatively clean air will also be helping to clean the air in New York and other downwind states where the air is generally dirtier. Across most of the Northeast, a significant fraction of the chronic air pollution blows in from the Midwest.
Under the Clean Air Act, the E.P.A. must set health-based standards for air quality without regard to the potential expense. States where the air violates these standards must then impose pollution controls that can cost industries billions of dollars and inconvenience motorists. The drive to tighten the standards touched off a huge lobbying campaign over the past two years, led by auto makers, electric utilities, fuel suppliers and manufacturers.
Although the final rules are not quite as aggressive as the version that was first proposed, they are nonetheless a significant milestone in the long struggle against unhealthy air. The last time the ozone standard was changed, nearly 20 years ago, it was weakened. The tiniest particles of sooty chemicals, so small that they lodge deep in the lungs, have never been controlled before under the Clean Air Act.
Some of the expected health benefits from the new regulations will not be felt until at least 2003 in the case of smog and 2008 in the case of soot, officials said. In the meantime, steps that are already under way to control pollution should continue to provide more modest gains.
A coalition of powerful industry groups denounced the decision as "crushing blow" to the economy, and urged Congress to overturn it.
"The Administration lacked the courage to do what is right," said Charles J. DiBona of the American Petroleum Institute, a leader of the coalition. "Those who worked hard to bring reason to the debate, including some 250 members of Congress, 27 governors and more than a thousand mayors and other state, county and local officials, were simply ignored."
Environmental groups highly praised the new standards and raised no objections to the flexible approach the Administration is offering to put the rules in place.
"They really stood up to the worst that industry could throw at them," said Philip Clapp, the head of the Environmental Information Center, who had lobbied hard on the issue and criticized Mr. Gore last week for not intervening strongly enough.
Mr. Clapp and other environmentalists said they believed that when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore focused on the rule in the past week or so, they acted decisively to favor the Administration's green faction. "They were extremely mindful of the fact that they had campaigned extensively on the environment, and the leaders of the Administration made their decision based on the promises they had made," Mr. Clapp said.
At the White House today, Mr. Clinton's advisers sought to describe the intense interagency fight over the rules as a normal process in writing regulations, and said all sides agreed that protecting the public health was a top priority all along.
But privately, Administration officials said there was a definite dispute between economic agencies and health agencies. The Treasury Department, for example, fought Ms. Browner's proposals, while the Department of Health and Human Services supported her.
Although the fight within the Administration over the proposals is now over, the new standards continue to face opposition in Congress and in the courts.
Industry opponents are making several claims. They contend that the scientific evidence linking air pollution to illness and death is not solid enough, and the predicted health benefits not great enough, to justify such large expenditures. And they maintain that the E.P.A. failed to adequately assess the economic effects of tighter controls on small businesses, as required by a new law that gives Congress 60 days to overturn any major Federal regulation. The new rules on air quality are expected to be published in mid-July.
The new standards for ozone, a compound of oxygen in a form that corrodes tissues, call for concentrations in the air not to exceed 80 parts per billion over an eight-hour period. Places where smog exceeds that standard more than four times a year averaged over three years would have to adopt corrective measures. The existing standard is 120 parts per billion over a one-hour peak period, a measure that the agency considers flawed because brief spikes of smog show up as violations, while persistent smog at lower but still damaging levels go unprevented.
The new rules for fine particles of 2.5 microns in diameter call for daily averages not to exceed 65 micrograms per cubic meter of air, and for annual averages not to exceed 15 micrograms per cubic meter.
To provide more flexibility as states try to comply with the fine particle rule, the E.P.A. loosened its earlier proposal for the daily standard, which was to have been 50 micrograms per cubic meter. But it maintained its initial proposal for the annual standard, which is a better indicator of chronic air pollution.
The E.P.A. agreed to allow five years for constructing monitors to detect the fine particles, since they have not been regulated before, and a few years more will pass before states must actually control emissions. During that time, more scientific studies of the health effects will be conducted.

Chart: "The New Restrictions"
Highlights of the air quality standards that President Clinton approved yesterday:
 
LIMITS ON POLLUTANTS
The rules tighten limits on smog-causing ozone to 80 parts per billion over an eight-hour period from the current 120 parts per billion and limit microscopic sooty particles for the first time.
 
WHOM IT AFFECTS
Industries and households in hundreds of counties, especially in heavily industrial states.
 
HEALTH BENEFITS
The Administration says that the sooty particles kill 15,000 people a year and that children with asthma should especially benefit from the restrictions.
 
THE OPPOSITION
Industry groups contend that the rules will cost far more than they are worth and are not supported by sound science.
 
NEXT STEPS
Congress has 60 days to review the rules once they are published next month. Court challenges are likely.

HEADLINE: Surprise Fall For Durables During May

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Orders to factories for durable goods fell unexpectedly in May, easing concern that inflationary bottlenecks might develop in the manufacturing sector. Home resales during the month also confounded analysts' expectations by increasing.
The Commerce Department said today that factory orders for the big-ticket goods, which are meant to last at least three years, decreased six-tenths of 1 percent in May, in contrast with analysts' expectations of a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent. But April's increase was revised upward, to 1.8 percent from the 1.3 percent reported originally. In March, orders fell 2.8 percent. 
 The report provided further evidence that growth had slowed sharply in the second quarter. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 5.8 percent in the first quarter -- the fastest pace in nearly a decade.
The data also helped dissipate earlier fears that factories would become swamped with orders, leading to delayed deliveries and shortages that would push up prices.
The lull suggested that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee was unlikely to raise interest rates again soon. It meets next Tuesday and Wednesday.
Fearing the economy was overheating, the committee raised short-term interest rates in March. It left rates unchanged at its most recent meeting, on May 20.
Orders for durable goods tend to be volatile from month to month because of the erratic pattern of orders for commercial jets and military weapons. Excluding transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose two-tenths of 1 percent during May after having increased 1.6 percent in April. Excluding military hardware, orders decreased one-tenth of 1 percent after rising 1.1 percent in April.
In line with the easing pressure in manufacturing, the backlog of unfilled orders for durable goods was unchanged in May after having fallen in April and March.
May's drop in new orders was widespread, except for a strong 10.4 percent increase in orders for electronic equipment, led by demand for electronic parts and communications equipment. That helped raise orders for nonmilitary capital goods -- a barometer of business investment in modernization -- by seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Transportation orders fell 3.3 percent, with orders for vehicles and aircraft decreasing. Orders for primary metals like steel decreased 2.4 percent, and those for industrial machinery fell 1 percent. Orders for military goods plunged 12.8 percent.
Shipments, a measure of current production, fell 1.2 percent in May after an April gain of 1.3 percent and eight-tenths of 1 percent in March.
Separately, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes jumped 4.4 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.24 million. That was the highest level since the record 4.28 million sales rate of May 1996.
Sales had fallen in April and March, and analysts had expected a decline in the latest month as well.
The association's president, Russell Booth, said May's sales reflected pent-up demand among some homeowners who were trading up to bigger houses. Sales were helped by the highest level of consumer confidence in 28 years and the lowest jobless rate in nearly 24 years.
"We expect fairly stable sales for the balance of the year," Mr. Booth said. That would bring sales in at about the 18-year high of 4.09 million reached last year.
The median price of an existing home was $123,900 in May, up 4.8 percent from a year ago. Sales rose 8.2 percent in the South, to a rate of 1.46 million, and 5.9 percent in the Midwest, to 1.07 million. Sales in the West were unchanged at a rate of 930,000. They fell 1.5 percent in the Northeast, to 660,000.

Patten a Hong Kong Favorite
Outgoing colonial Governor Christopher Patten won the approval of 79 percent of Hong Kong's citizens, a recent poll found; Tung Chee-hwa, the shipping tycoon chosen by Beijing to run Hong Kong after it returns to Chinese control next Tuesday, won the support of only 57 percent. Mr. Patten was the first Governor to grant Hong Kong's people the right to elect members of their legislature. The move prompted Beijing, which will abolish the legislative council, to call Mr. Patten "a sinner for a thousand generations." A3

HEADLINE: Children Place Low in Adults' Esteem, a Study Finds

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
Adults' negative views of the nation's teen-agers and younger children are so widespread that only 37 percent believe that today's youngsters will eventually make this country a better place, according to a new national study by a public-policy research organization.
The study, "Kids These Days: What Americans Really Think About the Next Generation," finds a stunning level of antagonism not just toward teen-agers but toward young children as well. 
 Two-thirds of adults surveyed for the study came up with negative adjectives like "rude," "wild" and "irresponsible" when asked to describe teen-agers. Nearly half described younger children as "spoiled," and nearly a third called them "lazy."
Officials with the research organization, Public Agenda, based in New York, said that beyond the age-old and somewhat predictable divide between generations, the findings reflected a stark change from earlier surveys, both in the degree of adult alarm and in the broadening of its focus to younger children.
And, they said, the responses demonstrate a fundamental concern about youngsters' moral and ethical values that is often left out of policy discussions on children's issues.
"Adults are not confused, and they're not ambivalent," said Deborah Wadsworth, executive director of Public Agenda. "Instead, they're virtually riveted by the need to teach kids integrity, ethical behavior, respect, civility, compassion, all those characteristics without which these children will never become responsible adults and our society can't function. They're focused like a laser beam on the question of character, and if the political leadership and policy initiatives don't reflect that, they're out of alignment with the concerns the public has."
Public Agenda's report, to be formally issued today, was based on telephone interviews with 2,000 adults last December. The poll, whose margin of sampling error was plus or minus two percentage points, was supplemented by interviews with 300 black and Hispanic parents, with six focus groups at sites across the country and with youngsters 12 to 17 years of age.
The issues raised in the report are particularly relevant at a time when the rise in one-parent households and two-career families has made child-rearing a far more difficult task.
What is unclear from the responses, though, is how much the public attitudes toward children reflect real behavioral problems, and how much they instead reflect media portrayals. The report comes at a time when a series of disturbing, even morally unfathomable crimes involving youngsters have attracted enormous popular attention.
The study, one of several that Public Agenda has done on issues involving children or education in recent years, found that adults across demographic lines, and including both parents and non-parents, tended to view young people with feelings of alarm or fear.
"Americans are convinced," the report concluded, "that today's adolescents face a crisis -- not in their economic or physical well-being but in their values and morals."
More than 6 in 10 adults said there was a very serious problem in young people's failure to learn fundamental moral values. That failure is viewed as a broad-based social problem, not the province of the poor. Nine in 10 adults said the failure to learn values was widespread, while only 8 percent said it was mostly among youngsters from poor families.
Much of the blame was leveled at parents and the schools. Only one in five respondents said it was very common to find parents who are good role models for their children. And almost half said schools failed to give children a good education and provide a safe, orderly environment.
Respondents ranked school improvement, more after-school programs, flexible work schedules for parents, nightly curfews and more involvement by volunteer organizations like the Boy Scouts as the most effective ways to address the problem.
More government financing for child care and health care was only 11th of 12 such solutions, and more spending for welfare programs ranked last, a finding that ran counter to the priorities of some child advocacy groups.
Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, director of the Center for Children and Families at Teachers College of Columbia University, said that while adults' expression of concern about adolescents was hardly anything new, she was surprised by the degree of antagonism that the study found toward young children.
She said some of the remedies identified by the respondents were perceptive, especially after-school programs, which, she said, should seek to attract large numbers of youngsters and provide not only learning and recreation but also opportunities for children to interact with adults.
Richard Weissbourd, an expert on family policy at Harvard University, said the findings probably reflected both reactions to the young themselves and adults' projecting their fears about society and change onto young people.
And while he said the public's focus on values was an important message for child advocates, he also said the message did not lend itself to easy solutions.
"I think it's very important to find a way to talk about values, but that does not mean you can easily teach values or that it leads to simple solutions," he said. "I don't think it does."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From Decision Voiding Congressional Act on Religious Freedom

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today in City of Boerne v. Flores, declaring unconstitutional the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices John Paul Stevens, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia. Justices Stevens and Scalia also filed concurring opinions. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer filed dissenting opinions. 

 
JUSTICE KENNEDY
For the Court
A decision by local zoning authorities to deny a church a building permit was challenged under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (R.F.R.A.). The case calls into question the authority of Congress to enact R.F.R.A. We conclude the statute exceeds Congress's power. . . .
Congress enacted R.F.R.A. in direct response to the Court's decision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, (1990). There we considered a Free Exercise Clause claim brought by members of the Native American Church who were denied unemployment benefits when they lost their jobs because they had used peyote.
Their practice was to ingest peyote for sacramental purposes, and they challenged an Oregon statute of general applicability, which made use of the drug criminal. In evaluating the claim, we declined to apply the balancing test set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, (1963), under which we would have asked whether Oregon's prohibition substantially burdened a religious practice and, if it did, whether the burden was justified by a compelling government interest.
The application of the Sherbert test, the Smith decision explained, would have produced an anomaly in the law, a constitutional right to ignore neutral laws of general applicability. . . .
Smith held that neutral, generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even when not supported by a compelling governmental interest.
These points of constitutional interpretation were debated by members of Congress in hearings and floor debates. Many criticized the Court's reasoning, and this disagreement resulted in the passage of R.F.R.A.
The act's stated purposes are:
"(1) to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, and Wisconsin v. Yoder, (1972) and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened; and "(2) to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government."
R.F.R.A. prohibits "(g)overnment" from "substantially burden(ing)" a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability unless the government can demonstrate the burden "(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest." The act's mandate applies to any "branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States," as well as to any "state, or subdivision of a state". . .
Congress relied on its 14th Amendment enforcement power in enacting the most far reaching and substantial of R.F.R.A.'s provisions, those which impose its requirements on the States. The 14th Amendment provides, in relevant part:
"Section 1. . . . No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
"Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article."
The parties disagree over whether R.F.R.A. is a proper exercise of Congress' Section 5 power "to enforce" by "appropriate legislation" the constitutional guarantee that no state shall deprive any person of "life, liberty, or property, without due process of law" nor deny any person "equal protection of the laws."
In defense of the act respondent contends, with support from the United States as amicus, that R.F.R.A. is permissible enforcement legislation. Congress, it is said, is only protecting by legislation one of the liberties guaranteed by the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause, the free exercise of religion, beyond what is necessary under Smith. It is said the Congressional decision to dispense with proof of deliberate or overt discrimination and instead concentrate on a law's effects accords with the settled understanding that Section 5 includes the power to enact legislation designed to prevent as well as remedy constitutional violations. It is further contended that Congress's Section 5 power is not limited to remedial or preventive legislation.
Legislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall within the sweep of Congress's enforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into "legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the states." Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer (1976).
For example, the Court upheld a suspension of literacy tests and similar voting requirements under Congress' parallel power to enforce the provisions of the 15th Amendment as a measure to combat racial discrimination in voting, South Carolina v. Katzenbach, (1966), despite the facial constitutionality of the tests under Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd. of Elections, (1959).
We have also concluded that other measures protecting voting rights are within Congress's power to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments, despite the burdens those measures placed on the states. South Carolina v. Katzenbach (upholding several provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965); Katzenbach v. Morgan (upholding ban on literacy tests that prohibited certain people schooled in Puerto Rico from voting) . . .
It is also true, however, that "(a)s broad as the Congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited." Oregon v. Mitchell (1970). In assessing the breadth of Section 5's enforcement power, we begin with its text. Congress has been given the power "to enforce" the "provisions of this article." We agree with respondent, of course, that Congress can enact legislation under Section 5 enforcing the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. The "provisions of this article," to which Section 5 refers, include the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.
Congress' power to enforce the Free Exercise Clause follows from our holding in Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940), that the "fundamental concept of liberty embodied in (the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause) embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment."
Congress's power under Section 5, however, extends only to "enforc(ing)" the provisions of the 14th Amendment. The Court has described this power as "remedial," South Carolina v. Katzenbach. The design of the Amendment and the text of Section 5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the 14th Amendment's restrictions on the states.
Legislation which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given the power "to enforce," not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the "provisions of (the 14th Amendment)."
While the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and Congress must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction exists and must be observed.
There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect. History and our case law support drawing the distinction, one apparent from the text of the amendment.
Recent cases have continued to revolve around the question of whether Section 5 legislation can be considered remedial.
In South Carolina v. Katzenbach we emphasized that "(t)he constitutional propriety of (legislation adopted under the Enforcement Clause) must be judged with reference to the historical experience . . . it reflects." There we upheld various provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, finding them to be "remedies aimed at areas where voting discrimination has been most flagrant," and necessary to "banish the blight of racial discrimination in voting, which has infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century."
We noted evidence in the record reflecting the subsisting and pervasive discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional use of literacy tests. The act's new remedies, which used the administrative resources of the Federal Government, included the suspension of both literacy tests and, pending Federal review, all new voting regulations in covered jurisdictions, as well as the assignment of Federal examiners to list qualified applicants enabling those listed to vote.
The new, unprecedented remedies were deemed necessary given the ineffectiveness of the existing voting rights laws and the slow costly character of case-by-case litigation.
Any suggestion that Congress has a substantive, nonremedial power under the 14th Amendment is not supported by our case law. In Oregon v. Mitchell, a majority of the Court concluded Congress had exceeded its enforcement powers by enacting legislation lowering the minimum age of voters from 21 to 18 in state and local elections. The five members of the Court who reached this conclusion explained that the legislation intruded into an area reserved by the Constitution to the States . . .
There is language in our opinion in Katzenbach v. Morgan which could be interpreted as acknowledging a power in Congress to enact legislation that expands the rights contained in Section 1 of the 14th Amendment. This is not a necessary interpretation, however, or even the best one . . .
If Congress could define its own powers by altering the 14th Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be "superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means." It would be "on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, . . . alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it." Marbury v. Madison.
Under this approach, it is difficult to conceive of a principle that would limit Congressional power. Shifting legislative majorities could change the Constitution and effectively circumvent the difficult and detailed amendment process contained in Article V.
We now turn to consider whether R.F.R.A. can be considered enforcement legislation under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment.
Respondent contends that R.F.R.A. is a proper exercise of Congress's remedial or preventive power. The act, it is said, is a reasonable means of protecting the free exercise of religion as defined by Smith. It prevents and remedies laws which are enacted with the unconstitutional object of targeting religious beliefs and practices.
To avoid the difficulty of proving such violations, it is said, Congress can simply invalidate any law which imposes a substantial burden on a religious practice unless it is justified by a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means of accomplishing that interest . . .
While preventive rules are sometimes appropriate remedial measures, there must be a congruence between the means used and the ends to be achieved. The appropriateness of remedial measures must be considered in light of the evil presented. Strong measures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted response to another, lesser one.
A comparison between R.F.R.A. and the Voting Rights Act is instructive. In contrast to the record which confronted Congress and the judiciary in the voting rights cases, R.F.R.A.'s legislative record lacks examples of modern instances of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry. The history of persecution in this country detailed in the hearings mentions no episodes occurring in the past 40 years . . .
Rather, the emphasis of the hearings was on laws of general applicability which place incidental burdens on religion. Much of the discussion centered upon anecdotal evidence of autopsies performed on Jewish individuals and Hmong immigrants in violation of their religious beliefs . . . and on zoning regulations and historic preservation laws (like the one at issue here), which as an incident of their normal operation, have adverse effects on churches and synagogues . . .
Regardless of the state of the legislative record, R.F.R.A. cannot be considered remedial, preventive legislation, if those terms are to have any meaning. R.F.R.A. is so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior. It appears, instead, to attempt a substantive change in constitutional protections. Preventive measures prohibiting certain types of laws may be appropriate when there is reason to believe that many of the laws affected by the Congressional enactment have a significant likelihood of being unconstitutional. Remedial legislation under Section 5 "should be adapted to the mischief and wrong which the (14th) (A)mendment was intended to provide against."
R.F.R.A. is not so confined. Sweeping coverage insures its intrusion at every level of government, displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter. R.F.R.A.'s restrictions apply to every agency and official of the Federal, state, and local governments. R.F.R.A. applies to all Federal and state law, statutory or otherwise, whether adopted before or after its enactment. R.F.R.A. has no termination date or termination mechanism. Any law is subject to challenge at any time by any individual who alleges a substantial burden on his or her free exercise of religion.
 
JUSTICE O'CONNOR
Dissenting
I remain of the view that Smith was wrongly decided, and I would use this case to re-examine the Court's holding there.Therefore, I would direct the parties to brief the question whether Smith represents the correct understanding of the Free Exercise Clause and set the case for reargument.
If the Court were to correct the misinterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause set forth in Smith, it would simultaneously put our First Amendment jurisprudence back on course and allay the legitimate concerns of a majority in Congress who believed that Smith improperly restricted religious liberty. We would then be in a position to review R.F.R.A. in light of a proper interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause.
I agree with much of the reasoning . . . of the Court's opinion. Indeed, if I agreed with the Court's standard in Smith, I would join the opinion . . .
Contrary to the Court's holding in that case, however, the Free Exercise Clause is not simply an antidiscrimination principle that protects only against those laws that single out religious practice for unfavorable treatment. Rather the clause is best understood as an affirmative guarantee of the right to participate in religious practices and conduct without impermissible governmental interference, even when such conduct conflicts with a neutral, generally applicable law . . .

HEADLINE: Clinton Move on Pollution Wins Praise in Northeast

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
President Clinton's endorsement of strengthened Federal air pollution standards yesterday came as welcome news to elected officials in New York State and the surrounding region, where efforts to reduce soot, acid rain and smog have been undercut by clouds of pollutants carried on the wind from coal-fired plants in the Midwest.
The fight over the stricter Federal standards, for fine soot and smog ingredients, had sparked regional political battles that transcended partisan lines. Only Tuesday, for example, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, a Republican not known for championing environmental causes, told the White House that he would fight any effort to weaken the standards, proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency last November. 
 For New York and its neighbors, the most significant result from the change in Federal pollution rules will be that many places in the Midwest will now have to meet the same stricter standards that are already in effect in parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
Largely because of imported pollution from the Midwest, the Northeastern states until now have been nearly alone in being forced to comply with stringent Federal requirements on cleanup of ozone, a main component of smog, said Robert C. Shinn Jr., New Jersey's environmental protection commissioner, who is chairman of a national advisory committee examining the problem of drifting pollution.
"It's like a big domino game," Mr. Shinn said. "Pennsylvania's downwind of Ohio, and so on. By the time you get to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, that pollution is a big part of the total problem."
As a result, Republican officials from across the Northeast lauded the Democratic President for standing firm on the new rules despite a bruising lobbying battle by industry.
Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who had personally lobbied on behalf of the changes, was among the Republicans hailing Mr. Clinton's move.
"It means cleaner air, better health, and it's going to mean more jobs," Mr. Pataki said in an interview. "We have for too long been penalized by particulates and ozone being generated in other parts of the country. What we finally have is a system of fair standards."
The Governor said jobs would flow to New York once Midwestern industries had to invest equally in pollution reductions, eliminating an economic advantage that has prevailed for seven years.
But some of New York's biggest corporations, which have plants across the country, parted with the Governor, their frequent ally.
The Business Council of New York State, representing the state's largest industries, opposed the tighter standards on fairly fundamental grounds. Kenneth J. Pokalsky, the council's director of environmental programs, said the ozone standard was arbitrary.
"Unlike standards for most other pollutants, it's not based on any measurable impact," Mr. Pokalsky said. "It's regulated mainly as an irritant, not a toxic chemical. So there's no way of measuring the environmental benefits of achieving a certain standard."
And the council opposed the new regulations on fine particles of soot on the ground that more research should be done first to define more precisely which particles are a health risk.
"Is it the entire universe of small particles, or some specific one?" said Mr. Pokalsky, who added that he was not surprised that the new standards had garnered strong bipartisan support.
"There seems to be a great reluctance for officials to oppose any type of new environmental requirement," he said.
But, he said, people tend to forget the costs that pile up as industries comply with each new rule. "The economy ends up paying for it," he said, "which means everyone ends up paying for it."
Supporters of the changes said the full effect of the new rules would take years to achieve, allowing industries time to adapt and find efficient ways to cut emissions.
S. William Becker, executive director of a Washington association of state and local pollution officials, said, "It will be almost a decade before industry is forced to reduce the first pound of pollution as a result of the new fine-particulate standard."
Mr. Becker also said the problem of imported pollution was so overwhelming in places like New York City that something had had to be done to level the playing field.
"You could impose an immediate moratorium on driving and shut down most industries in the city, and still exceed the Federal standard" for ozone, he said. "The air pollution from interstate transport is so significant it's imperative to have upwind cooperation."

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT;
Excerpts From High Court's Ruling in Asbestos Industry Case

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today in Amchem Products v. Windsor, in which the court struck down a landmark $1.3 billion class-action settlement between the victims of asbestos exposure and 20 asbestos makers. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas. Justice Stephen G. Breyer filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, that was also signed by Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor took no part in the case. 
 This case concerns the legitimacy under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of a class-action certification sought to achieve global settlement of current and future asbestos-related claims. The class proposed for certification potentially encompasses hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of individuals tied together by this commonality: each was, or some day may be, adversely affected by past exposure to asbestos products manufactured by one or more of 20 companies. Those companies, defendants in the lower courts, are petitioners here.
The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania certified the class for settlement only, finding that the proposed settlement was fair and that representation and notice had been adequate. That court enjoined class members from separately pursuing asbestos-related personal-injury suits in any court, Federal or state, pending the issuance of a final order. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the district court's orders, holding that the class certification failed to satisfy Rule 23's requirement in several critical respects. We affirm the Court of Appeals judgment. . . .
In the face of legislative inaction, the Federal courts -- lacking authority to replace state tort systems with a national toxic tort compensation regime -- endeavored to work with the procedural tools available to improve management of Federal asbestos litigation.
Eight Federal judges, experienced in the superintendence of asbestos cases, urged the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, to consolidate in a single district all asbestos complains then pending in Federal courts. . . .
The class action thus instituted was not intended to be litigated. Rather, within the space of a single day, Jan. 15, 1993, the settling parties -- the Center for Claims Resolution defendants and the representatives of the plaintiff class described below -- presented to the district court a complaint, an answer, a proposed settlement agreement and a joint motion for conditional class certification. . . .
Objectors raised numerous challenges to the settlement. They urged that the settlement unfairly disadvantaged those without currently compensable conditions in that it failed to adjust for inflation or to account for changes, over time, in medical understanding. They maintained that compensation levels were intolerably low in comparison to awards available in tort litigation. . . .
We granted review to decide the role settlement may play, under existing Rule 23, in determining the propriety of class certification. . . .
We agree with petitioners to this limited extent: settlement is relevant to a class certification. The Third Circuit's opinion bears modification in that respect. But, as we early observed, the Court of Appeals in fact did not ignore the settlement; instead, that court homed in on settlement terms in explaining why it found the absentees' interests inadequately represented. The Third Circuit's close inspection of the settlement in that regard was altogether proper.
Confronted with a request for settlement-only class certification, a district court need not inquire whether the case, if tried, would present intractable management problems. . . .
But other specifications of the rule -- those designed to protect absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions -- demand undiluted, even heightened, attention in the settlement context.
Such attention is of vital importance, for a court asked to certify a settlement class will lack the opportunity, present when a case is litigated, to adjust the class, informed by the proceedings as they unfold. . . .
We address first the requirement of Rule 23(b)(3) that "(common) questions of law or fact . . . predominate over any questions affecting only individual members." The predominance requirement stated in Rule 23 (b)(3), we hold, is not met by the factors on which the district court relied. The benefits asbestos-exposed persons might gain from the establishment of a grand-scale compensation scheme is a matter fit for legislative consideration, but it is not pertinent to the predominance inquiry. That inquiry trains on the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member's case as a genuine controversy, questions that preexist any settlement. . . .
Given the greater number of questions peculiar to the several categories of class members, and to individuals within each category, and the significance of those uncommon questions, any overarching dispute about the health consequences of asbestos exposure cannot satisfy the Rule 23 (b)(3) predominance standard.
Nor did the class approved by the district court satisfy Rule 23 (a)(4)'s requirement that the named parties "will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class." The adequacy inquiry under Rule 23(a)(4) serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.
As the Third Circuit pointed out, named parties with diverse medical conditions sought to act on behalf of a single giant class rather than on behalf of discrete subclasses. In significant respects, the interests of those within the single class are not aligned. Most saliently for the currently injured, the critical goal is generous immediate payments. That goal tugs against the interest of exposure-only plaintiffs in insuring an ample inflation-protected fund for the future. . . .
The settling parties, in sum, achieved a global compromise with no structural assurance of fair and adequate representation for the diverse groups and individuals affected.

On-Line Company Grows

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Agency.com, one of New York City's largest on-line marketing companies, has acquired a stake in Online Magic, an interactive media company based in London.
Chan Suh, chairman and chief executive officer of Agency.com, declined to provide further details, saying only that the deal was worth several million dollars. 
 Even so, Patrick Keene, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, an on-line research firm, said the deal was significant because new media start-ups in New York usually seek to be acquired, not to invest in other companies. It also reinforces the idea that larger, more successful new media companies, like Agency.com, are trying to expand their resources to gain more market share.
Agency.com, which projects revenues this year of more than $12 million and has a staff of 100, has designed Web sites for clients like British Airways, the American Express Company, Lucent Technologies and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
Online Magic, with a staff of 60 and estimated annual revenues of $4 million, has designed Web sites for clients like the Department of Trade and Industry, The Economist magazine, Simon & Schuster and Showtime Networks. DAVID W. CHEN

HEADLINE: Former Rival Of Rowland Gets Ready For Rematch

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 25

 BODY:
After narrowly losing the 1994 race for governor, William E. Curry Jr. got what he described as the best consolation prize a failed Democratic candidate could imagine: he was hired by the White House as a domestic policy adviser. Now he is back in Connecticut and ready to challenge Gov. John G. Rowland, the Republican who defeated him in 1994.
It is an uphill battle for Mr. Curry against a strong incumbent who has already amassed a sizable war chest. Mr. Curry is not even the clear Democratic choice, with several other prominent politicians, most notably Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, also considering a run. 
 But in an interview, Mr. Curry, a 45-year-old lawyer, insisted that he has returned to Connecticut a stronger candidate.
"I've had plenty of time to reflect on what I did right and what I did wrong," he said. "Working with the President of the United States on a host of national issues has taught me a great deal, and I can't imagine that there's a better place to learn about governing."
And to make contacts.
While Mr. Curry played down the political benefits of working at the White House, where he was Dick Morris's right-hand man, he conceded, "I've met a number of people in the Democratic Party whom I never otherwise would have met, who are ready to help and will take an interest." For instance, Mario M. Cuomo attended a fund-raiser for Mr. Curry last year to help him retire debt from his last race.
The stint in the White House may also help Mr. Curry dispel the liberal label Mr. Rowland tagged him with in the last election. Although Mr. Curry ran as a "New Democrat," many in the state viewed him as the candidate of labor unions and liberal special interest groups.
But in the White House, Mr. Curry was one of the aides who pushed Mr. Clinton to take a more centrist course, and was a prominent advocate for the President to offer a balanced budget that included cuts in social programs, a move that many liberal Democrats decried.
Mr. Curry attributed his loss last time to his being in a four-way race. One candidate, former Lieut. Gov. Eunice Groark of A Connecticut Party, won 19 percent of the vote, and Mr. Curry said that in a two-way match-up with Mr. Rowland, those votes would come back to the Democrat, a point Republicans dispute.
In 1994, Mr. Curry lost to Mr. Rowland, 33 percent to 36 percent. A poll of 500 voters by The Hartford Courant this month showed that while 37 percent of those polled wanted to see Mr. Rowland re-elected, 44 percent would like to see someone else. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
There is little question that Mr. Rowland will be a formidable candidate. Since he has taken office, the state economy has rebounded, adding at least 50,000 jobs, and Mr. Rowland has said his policies of cutting taxes and holding the line on spending are largely responsible.
While Mr. Rowland has not formally announced his candidacy, aides said he will have raised at least $1 million for the race by July.
Mr. Curry, a former state comptroller and state senator, is expected to establish his campaign committee as early as next week. Other Democrats, like the Speaker of the State House of Representatives, Thomas D. Ritter, and Mayor Joseph Ganim of Bridgeport, are weighing runs, though the biggest obstacle would be Ms. Kennelly, whom The Courant's poll showed as being in a virtual dead heat with Mr. Rowland if a race were held now. All other candidates, including Mr. Curry, trailed Mr. Rowland by at least 18 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Continental Drops Ads That Mayor Criticized

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani rounded up a posse of civic, business and labor leaders yesterday to do battle with the latest interloper to besmirch the reputation of New York City. They met at City Hall, all itching to stride before the microphone to announce that they were boycotting Continental Air Lines for running a waggish advertising campaign that seeks to entice New Yorkers to cross the border to Newark International Airport.
But just as the Mayor was beginning the attack at an afternoon news conference, just before his cohorts were to issue their own lock-step denunciations, Deputy Mayor Randy Levine burst in to the room with a message. A truce was at hand. Continental had capitulated. It was suspending most of its advertisements. 
 Mr. Giuliani had spent the last few days criticizing Continental over the advertisements, which have appeared on radio, in newspapers and in outdoor locations like billboards. Continental maintained that its campaign promoted the convenience of the airline's service at Newark Airport, saying that its tenor was not anti-New York. But the Mayor said the advertisements damaged Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports in Queens, and also disparaged the city's image.
One radio commercial that the Mayor said particularly angered him featured the voice of a woman supposedly speaking in a recorded city taxi announcement. The voice ends the spot by saying, "Welcome to New York! Now get out!"
Continental had responded to the Mayor's complaints on Monday by saying that it would amend that advertisement and one other. But after the airline declined to end the entire campaign, the Mayor stayed on the offensive, no doubt eager in this election year to appear as a guardian of the city's interests.
Ned Walker, a spokesman for Continental, said yesterday that the airline was immediately halting the radio and newspaper advertisements. "In the spirit of cooperation with the Mayor," Mr. Walker said, "we decided to go ahead and suspend the campaign until we have had an opportunity to sit down and hear his concerns."
He said that for now, the airline would not remove the outdoor advertisements because it would be too difficult to do that in a short time.
The Mayor had mustered two dozen or so luminaries for the news conference yesterday, from Stanley Hill, the municipal labor leader, to Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. In addition to asking residents to boycott Continental, the Mayor had also considered running an advertising campaign that would have skewered Continental and Newark Airport, perhaps featuring well-known residents like the comedian Jackie Mason.
One highlight of the news conference was the unusual sight of the Mayor being interrupted in public by one of his aides. "Well, can't I finish my statement first?" Mr. Giuliani asked Mr. Levine, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Planning and Administration. "Would you like to take over the press conference?"
When he returned after a brief chat with Mr. Levine, Mr. Giuliani triumphantly announced Continental's surrender.
"I don't find ads like that funny," Mr. Giuliani said. "I don't find it funny when you make fun of the city of New York because I know the impact that it has on jobs. Those ads to me are taking bread off the table of New Yorkers. So I don't laugh about that."
The Mayor has also complained that the Port Authority, which runs all three airports, favors Newark over La Guardia and Kennedy. But one New Jersey politician yesterday fired a salvo back across the Hudson. Robert C. Janiszewski, a Democrat who is the Hudson County Executive and a Port Authority commissioner, called the Mayor's anti-Continental diatribe "election-year hot air."
He said politicians should be worried about the economy of the region as a whole, and called the proposed boycott of Continental "an affront to the thousands of people who work day in and day out for New Jersey's largest employer."

HEADLINE: Inevitable Surgery on Medicare

 BODY:
The Senate's votes to raise Medicare premiums for wealthy retirees and to raise the age of eligibility were a sensible start down a road that has to be taken. If Congress does not reduce soaring Medicare costs in ways that protect the needy, it will eventually be forced to cut wantonly. But the policy implications are less remarkable than the fact that 70 senators had the guts to take necessary action despite the opposition of the elderly, a powerful constituency. When Congress voted in 1988 to raise Medicare premiums on wealthier retirees, the elderly forced it to repeal the decision. Something has changed for the better on Capitol Hill, in ways that will color future debates on Medicare and other privileged sanctuaries of the Federal budget.
Senators have known, in part because Phil Gramm of Texas tells them so at every provocation, that Medicare is at the forefront of an imminent budget crunch. It will drain the treasury over the next 10 years of $1.6 trillion, because health expenditures are outstripping inflation and because tens of millions of baby boomers are lining up to retire. Everything else the Government does will have to survive on rapidly diminishing resources. 
 This week's Senate vote shows that Congress is moving from a sterile debate over whether to cut Medicare growth to a useful debate about means. The Senate Finance Committee, behind Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, took the lead, arguing that Congress should target the inevitable cuts on those who could afford a small hit. The chairman, William Roth, provided leeway for a bipartisan debate. The starkest proof that the political landscape has shifted, however, is the vote of Bob Graham of Florida -- a Democrat up for re-election from a state chock full of retirees. Compare his courage with the timid platitudes from the White House. President Clinton says the Senate reforms might make sense, but not yet.
Some senators had legitimate reasons to oppose the Medicare changes. For example, the Senate plan would raise the age of Medicare eligibility in parallel with already approved hikes in the age of Social Security eligibility. But the Senate plan does not allow for early retirees to sign up for Medicare, as they can for Social Security. Congress will need to correct this defect.
The Medicare changes are unlikely to survive a House-Senate conference. But now that 70 senators have voted to means-test premiums and 62 have approved raising the age of eligibility, no member need any longer run for cover when Congress, or, as expected, a Presidential commission next year, debates cutting entitlements for the elderly.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: GROUP ADVERTISEMENTS;
Agricultural Marketing Effort Is Ruled Constitutional

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
A narrowly divided Supreme Court today upheld a New Deal-era Federal marketing program that requires agricultural companies to help pay for industrywide advertising.
Rejecting a lower court's view that the advertising assessments amounted to compelled speech, in violation of the First Amendment, the majority said the program was an unexceptional form of economic regulation that was well within the power of Congress and did not pose any First Amendment concerns. 
 Writing for the Court in a 5-to-4 decision, Justice John Paul Stevens said the Court's cases about compelled speech were "clearly inapplicable to the regulatory scheme at issue here." For example, he said, those cases have protected people from having to salute the flag or attach license plates with unwanted slogans to their cars.
Justice Stevens said that in requiring the growers of California fruits to underwrite advertising campaigns urging Americans to eat more fruit in general, and California fruit in particular, the Government was neither imposing an ideology nor preventing the objecting growers from paying for additional advertising of their own brands.
The dissenters said the Court had devalued the First Amendment interests at stake by not applying an analysis that required the Government to justify restrictions on commercial speech as "narrowly tailored" for "substantial" interests.
Justice David H. Souter said that under the Court's precedents, compelling speech "is just as suspect as suppressing it, and is typically subject to the same level of scrutiny."
The opinion by Justice Stevens essentially tracked the Clinton Administration's defense of the program, part of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. The outcome was somewhat surprising given the Court's recently protective stance toward protective speech, which has led it recently to invalidate several state and Federal laws regulating advertising and labeling.
The voting pattern was also surprising, with Justices on opposite sides from where their previous opinions would seem to have placed them. The majority was joined by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who rarely rejects a First Amendment argument, and by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
Justice Souter's dissenting opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who only rarely votes to strike down a Government program, and by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who also filed a dissenting opinion of his own.
The case, Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, No. 95-1184, was brought by a group of growers and processors of California nectarines, peaches and plums to protest their assessments for the generic advertising program. They argued that they would rather spend their money advertising their own products rather than, as they saw it, subsidizing their competitors.
Several million dollars were at stake in the case; the assessments generate some $10 million a year to advertise the produce at issue. Other commodities, including beef, are covered by similar Federal programs, which Justice Stevens described as incorporating a "police of collective, rather than competitive marketing" for farm products.
The Federal District Court in Sacramento rejected the growers' challenge, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, declared the program unconstitutional. The appeals court said, "The First Amendment right of freedom of speech includes a right not to be compelled to render financial support for others' speech."
The court relied in part on a series of Supreme Court cases holding that employees who object to union membership or who object to the way a union spends its money cannot be required to support union activities beyond the basic collective bargaining function. But the generic advertising program did not raise those concerns, Justice Stevens said.
"None of the advertising in this record promotes any particular message other than encouraging consumers to buy California tree fruit," he said, adding that the assessments "cannot be said to engender any crisis of conscience."
Justice Stevens continued, "The mere fact that objectors believe their money is not being well spent does not mean that they have a First Amendment complaint."
In his dissent, Justice Souter said, "The very reasons for recognizing that commercial speech falls within the scope of First Amendment protection likewise justifies the protection of those who object to subsidizing it against their will."
He said the program was "so randomly implemented" that it could not survive even a moderate level of First Amendment scrutiny.
There was also an unusual voting lineup in a separate, unrelated case today. The Justices voted 5 to 4 to uphold a Florida State Senate district, drawn to increase representation for black voters, against a challenge by a district resident that the district was the product of an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
Since the Court embarked four years ago on its strict scrutiny of legislative districts drawn with race in mind, it has not upheld any of the districts it has examined.
While this was a procedurally unusual case that dealt with a Federal District Court's authority in drawing the district rather than directly with the question of race, it was nonetheless notable that Chief Justice Rehnquist joined Justice Souter's opinion in upholding the district. The others in the majority were Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer.
The group that Chief Justice Rehnquist had previously voted with in every one of this series of redistricting cases comprised the dissenters: Justices Scalia, O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas. The Chief Justice did not write a separate opinion to explain his position.
The case, Lawyer v. Dept. of Justice, No. 95-2024, concerned a district in the Tampa area that a three-judge Federal District Court redrew last year after earlier, more heavily black and geographically irregular district had become presumptively unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's recent rulings.
The District Court did not declare the earlier district unconstitutional. Rather, it approved revisions that were the product of settlement discussions among all parties to the case except for the objecting resident, C. Martin Lawyer 3d, who challenged the District Court's authority.
In his opinion today, Justice Souter said both that the District Court had authority over the case and that its conclusion that race was not the predominant factor in the final lines was justified by the evidence. The dissenters disputed the court's authority but did not address the question of the district's constitutionality.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: INDUSTRY SETTLEMENT;
Overturning of $1.3 Billion Settlement With Victims of Asbestos Exposure Is Upheld

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 25

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today struck down a landmark $1.3 billion class-action settlement that would have provided payments to current victims of asbestos exposure while sharply limiting the ability of future victims to file health claims against 20 large asbestos makers.
The Court agreed with a Federal appeals court in Philadelphia that threw out the settlement last year. Both courts concluded that the asbestos victims, who were ultimately expected to number in the millions, had interests that were too diverse to be represented in a single class-action lawsuit. 
 In particular, they found a serious conflict in the way the settlement treated current asbestos victims and those whose exposure to asbestos had not yet manifested serious illness.
Today's 6-to-2 decision, in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg carefully dissected the procedural rules that govern class-action lawsuits, has no discernable impact on last week's proposed settlement between the tobacco industry and state attorneys general. The tobacco agreement would abolish all class-action lawsuits in cigarette cases.
But the tobacco agreement cannot go into effect without Federal legislation. Should the effort to write a bill stall in Congress, today's decision all but prevents any resolution of current and future claims against the tobacco companies through the courts.
The decision also leaves unresolved millions of current and future claims against many major asbestos makers. Those claims had begun to overwhelm Federal and state courts around the nation, leading to the kinds of class-action settlements that the court today struck down.
Over the past half-century, between 13 million and 21 million workers have been exposed to asbestos in the workplace, a substance that the ancient Greeks first discovered had fierce fire-retardant qualities, but that also poses potentially deadly hazards.
A 1991 report by the United States Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the Federal judiciary, predicted as many as 200,000 deaths by 2000 related to asbestos exposure.
One fear among victims was that the huge litigation costs associated with asbestos claims threatened to deplete the limited assets of asbestos producers before all victims and their survivors could be compensated for illnesses, which range from minor respiratory ailments to mesothelioma, a fatal cancer.
In trying to manage the burgeoning caseload, Federal judges have sought to have such cases settled rather than litigated and combined into large class actions.
Such was the case with the lawsuit at issue today, which was widely known under an earlier name, Georgine v. Amchem Products. It began when a special panel of Federal judges that oversees large and complex cases consolidated all pending asbestos cases in 1991 and assigned them to a Federal District Court in Philadelphia.
Two years later, the settlement in question was reached between a group of plaintiff's lawyers from Charleston, S.C., who received millions of dollars in fees, and a consortium of 20 former asbestos makers known as the Center for Claims Resolution.
The Center's members included the Union Carbide Corporation, the United States Gypsum Company, GAF Corporation and Armstrong World Industries.
The settlement set up an administrative claims procedure for awarding damages to four categories of diseases. It eliminated the statute of limitations requirement on any claims, but also barred certain other claims.
Perhaps most important, it sought to bind all future possible claimants. That provision was crucial because many asbestos-related maladies take decades before they begin to appear.
After the settlement was approved by Judge Lowell A. Reed Jr. of Federal District Court in Philadelphia, it was challenged by three groups who asserted that it was unfair.
They said that it was impossible to provide adequate notice of the settlement to millions of people whose identities could not be determined and who, lacking knowledge that they were at risk, might not heed a notice even if one reached them.
In striking down the settlement last year, Judge Edward R. Becker of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, said that the plaintiffs' interests were too diverse to meet the test for a class-action lawsuit that could go to trial under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs class actions.
Because the class action could not be litigated, it could not be settled, Judge Becker said, unless the existing rules were amended to create a new, separate category of class actions for settlement purposes only.
The question before the Supreme Court in Amchem Products Inc. v. Windsor, No. 96-270, was whether a Federal judge, in approving a settlement of a class-action lawsuit, must first apply the same strict standards required for certifying such a lawsuit for trial, or whether the court can be more flexible and apply more generalized standards of fairness.
In affirming the appeals court decision today, Justice Ginsburg said that a trial judge considering whether to approve a class-action settlement must give "undiluted, even heightened attention" to those provisions of Rule 23 that are supposed to protect absent members of the class.
But in the asbestos case, the Court strongly implied, the asbestos settlement was a collusive effort by the asbestos companies and a small group of plaintiffs' lawyers who stood to gain significantly by the settlement and thus did not adequately represent the interests of future claimants.
"Most saliently, for the currently injured, the critical goal is generous immediate payments," Justice Ginsburg wrote.
"That goal tugs against the interest of exposure-only plaintiffs in ensuring an ample, inflation-protected fund for the future. The settling parties, in sum, achieved a global compromise with no structural assurance of fair and adequate representation for the diverse groups and individuals affected."
In a partial dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer criticized the majority for "second-guessing" the district court and said he would have sent the case back down to see if the proposed settlement could satisfy the Supreme Court's interpretation of Rule 23. His opinion was also signed by Justice John Paul Stevens. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate in the case.
The Federal judiciary is considering a proposal to amend Rule 23 to permit a class action to be certified for purposes of settlement only. Such a change would require the approval of the Supreme Court and could be blocked by Congress.
The proposed change has been criticized by consumer groups and others who say it would encourage collusion in settling unworthy cases between lawyers for plaintiffs, who can earn high fees, and defendants who are absolved of liability.
Today's decision will leave the prospect of future large settlements in asbestos and other so-called "mass torts" cases uncertain.
Larry Fitzpatrick, the president and chief executive of the Center for Claims Resolution, said that lawyers involved in the class-action agreement had been discussing ways to forge another settlement.
"We're certainly not going to go back to the days when we litigated every case individually and 69 out of every 70 cents was going to transactional costs," he said.
Today's decision had little impact on the stocks of the companies involved, perhaps because the appeals court had already thrown out the settlement and the market had anticipated the decision.

HEADLINE: Mother Left Her Children Out of Despair, Police Say

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Lori-Ann Williamston is said by her friends to be a good mother, one who prevailed against the circumstances of poverty to keep her two young children happy. Although she spent her days looking for a job and her nights crammed beside her sleeping brood on a friend's fold-out couch, Ms. Williamston kept her children clean, clothed and well fed. Even the police say so.
But the police also say she abandoned her two daughters, 3-year-old Kiyah and 8-month-old Lacey, in a Central Park playground Tuesday afternoon. Although she also left behind a stroller packed with baby food and clean clothing for her girls, the police say that this maternal touch does not excuse her actions. 
 Ms. Williamston, 33, was arrested early yesterday morning at the East Harlem apartment that she shares with a childhood friend. Her roommate had notified the police after seeing pictures of the children on the 11 P.M. news.
At an arraignment last night in Manhattan Criminal Court, Ms. Williamston was charged with two counts of abandonment, a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, and two counts of child endangerment, a misdemeanor, said Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney. Bail was set at $5,000.
Ms. Williamston's actions appear to have been motivated by despair. "Her explanation was that she was depressed," the Police Commissioner, Howard Safir, said yesterday. "And she knew that if she left them in the park, the police would come and take care of them."
Valarie Grant, Ms. Williamston's roommate, said that her friend made sure the baby was fed and changed and that the children were well clothed. But the financial and child-care pressures had become too much for an unemployed single mother, Ms. Grant said.
Ms. Grant and Ms. Williamston have known each other for almost 30 years. And when Ms. Williamston needed a place to stay more than a year ago, Ms. Grant agreed to share her two-bedroom apartment at 117 East 130th Street, in the heart of the neighborhood where the two grew up.
The gesture was both welcoming and problematic. Ms. Grant has a teen-age son, Cori, which left Ms. Williamston and her two children to carve out their own space in the living room. There, near the dining-room table and an empty aquarium, the Williamston family would sleep.
At other times, Ms. Williamston and her daughters would stay overnight in the Brooklyn apartment of her boyfriend, her younger child's father. Ms. Grant said that the boyfriend, Richard Robinson, worked for a design company in New Jersey.
Ms. Williamston served in the Navy and received her high school equivalency diploma, Ms. Grant said, but still had trouble finding steady employment. Ms. Grant said that Ms. Williamston took temporary jobs, including one collating paper in a warehouse for $5 an hour. She paid her share of the rent with about $100 from her public assistance allowance and by cleaning the apartment. Meanwhile, she had no contact with the city's child welfare agencies.
As the two friends ran errands on Tuesday, Ms. Grant said, her friend seemed unusually quiet. Later that afternoon, Ms. Grant was getting off the elevator in her apartment when she bumped into Ms. Williamston and the children.
"She said she was going to the park," Ms. Grant recalled.
According to a police complaint, she later told investigators that she intended to give up her children by leaving them in the park.
After 45 minutes, a nanny in the park became concerned and notified the authorities. The children were found in good condition and were placed in the custody of the Administration for Children's Services.
Ms. Grant said that Ms. Williamston returned alone to the sweltering apartment, leading her to assume that her friend had dropped off the children with a relative who lives nearby. But when she saw the young faces on the late-night news, she telephoned the 23d Precinct.
At about 12:30 yesterday morning, Ms. Williamston returned to her friend's apartment on East 130th Street. Sitting at the dining room table were two police detectives.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Dancing Again With Keith Haring, Day-Glo Populist

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
FOR many New Yorkers sweating out long summers in the early 1980's, the art of Keith Haring was more than just a fact of daily life. It was a touch of Christmas in July.
Commuters dashing into the subway on a Monday morning would find his work waiting for them on the station walls: thickly contoured cartoon figures of luminous babies, yapping dogs and flying saucers, drawn in chalk the night before on the black rectangles usually reserved for movie posters. 
 The images were simple but catchy; their little narratives of danger and transcendence gave the workaday world a subversive lift, as if a pop song had suddenly floated in over the Transit Authority's P.A. system. People really liked the drawings. Fragile as they were, they usually stayed intact until a poster covered them up.
Haring, who died of AIDS in 1990 at the age of 31, is back in town this summer. A smart, exuberant retrospective of his brief career has just opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art; a dozen of his large-scale sculptures are parading down Park Avenue, under auspices of the Public Art Fund; a handful of gallery shows are on view.
How does his work look now, nearly two decades on and far from the subways, streets and downtown studios that produced it? Visually, like the deft, febrile, often expressive but thin-textured thing it was. Conceptually, as something more: a dynamic popular art that succeeded in bringing entertainment and edification together as later art has rarely been able to.
That dynamism comes across at the Whitney. The show's curator, Elisabeth Sussman, has given a prolix, repetitive body of material a propulsive shape and pace; the exhibition's designer, Tibor Kalman, with the help of Lana Hum and Richard Pandiscio, has put together an appropriately high-octane installation. Paintings and drawings are hung floor to ceiling; the sounds of disco and car horns hang in the air; wall vitrines filled with biographical ephemera -- family photos, grade-school drawings -- run like a time line from room to room.
In the case of Haring, who took much of his inspiration from childhood and from the culture around him, and who approached art as both a form of social interaction and serious play, the inclusion of such memorabilia makes perfect sense. Born in 1958 in Pennsylvania, he grew up on a diet of Saturday morning cartoons, Dr. Seuss and sitcoms. By the time he was in his teens, the antic, tune-in spirit of the 60's kicked in: he went through a brief religious phase in high school, then became an acid-dropping Grateful Dead devotee.
At the same time, he was already looking hard at art: at the primitivist, pseudo-infantile work of the Belgian painter Pierre Alechinsky, at album-cover psychedelia, at Stuart Davis and Jackson Pollock. In 1978, he left for art school in New York.
Culturally, the late 70's were a watershed time in New York City, one that Haring both wandered into and helped create. The art world, like the city, had bottomed out economically. Young artists looking for places to make and show their work gravitated to marginal, racially mixed neighborhoods like the East Village and the South Bronx. Figurative painting and graffiti were on the rise; street life had taken on a new glamour.
Haring's early collages of cut-up newspaper headlines pasted to lampposts owed a lot to older artists like Jenny Holzer. His hit-and-run use of public space for art was modeled on the methods of graffiti artists, Jean-Michel Basquiat among them. But once he started his subway drawings, he was on his own track.
A handful of such subway drawings, dating from the early 80's, appear in a dim, corridorlike gallery near the start of the Whitney show. They look ghostly now, their improvisatory fizz long gone. But in them, Haring's narrow repertory of images are in place: the Everyman bodies with holes in the center and mutating limbs; the beasts and U.F.O.'s that seem to be alternately friend and foe; the New Age optimism touched with an edge of violence.
Also evident is the springy, hyperactive virtuosity of his drawing style, captured live in a 1982 CBS television video clip of him at work in the subway. Performing for the camera, Haring draws an entire figure on the wall in one astonishing split-second gesture that has the dazzle of a perfectly executed dance move.
After this, the museum show opens into a room bursting with paintings on vinyl tarpaulins and sheets of paper. Some are elaborations of the subway drawings in other media, with their political import -- anti-racist, anti-nuke -- made explicit. Others are dense, centrally focused compositions in which bright Pop colors (bubble-gum pink, lime green, tangerine orange) and networks of hieroglyphic squiggles cause figure and ground to merge, then bounce apart.
Even with this jazzy optical buzz, the formal hallmark of Haring's art is its readability, which is ultimately both its strength and its limitation. Like effective advertising, it establishes an instantly recognizable presence whether seen close up or from a distance, under good light or bad, and in a wide variety of media.
Haring understood the attraction of his style and exploited it. By the mid-80's, his images were showing up on buttons and decals and in coloring books, for sale in the Pop Shops he set up in New York and Tokyo. Many of the products were geared toward children, Haring's favorite audience; others, like a series of fiberglass garden pots covered with his all-purpose babies, were little more than high-priced designer items.
The idea of bringing esthetics and commerce together so blatantly had its audacious side; Haring saw the Pop Shops as performance art. But for many, his entrepreneurship, like his jet-set celebrity, was at odds with his guerrilla roots. When a theory-intensive, neo-Conceptual style came into favor in New York in the mid-1980's, Haring's work tended to be dismissed as feel-good fluff.
The Whitney show tells a different story. Some of the most complex and interesting paintings here date from 1985 and after, and they suggest the tough, contentious, often radical nature of Haring's best work all along.
He was, for example, among the first high-profile artists after Andy Warhol (whom he knew and admired) to create a widely distributed, openly gay art, one that moved out of the niche of 60's camp and into the mass-market mainstream. And well before his own illness was diagnosed in 1988, he had turned his energies to producing AIDS-specific work that put a human face on a demonized disease and a vulnerable population.
The show also points up the surprisingly dark cast of much of Haring's output. Paintings and drawings from the early 80's are peppered with images of torture, dismemberment and bestiality. In the mid-80's he produced a number of large-scale expressionist paintings, influenced by artists like Bosch and Ensor, which have a distinctly eschatological import.
This expressive element is important to note, not just because it gives Haring's art texture and weight, but also because it helps to situate him in relation to art in the 90's, when images of childhood, and particularly of childhood threatened and corrupted, are ubiquitous.
Why this theme is pervasive is hard to say. Perhaps it reflects the moody, passive side of 60's hedonism: the response of a post-Stonewall generation hit with AIDS, a post-protest generation faced with problems that seem entrenched beyond righting. Or maybe it is the response of artists living in a time when the reach of art feels diminished, and an inward-looking, self-examining, infantilized approach seems the way to go.
Haring is in this picture somewhere, but he also stands apart from it, as an expansive, celebratory figure who really believes art can change things and acts on his belief. The evidence is still around us. His "Crack Is Wack" wall in a Harlem playground, done fast and illegally in 1986, continues to greet motorists on the F.D.R. Drive. And the rhythmically buoyant murals he drew the year before he died for the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center in Greenwich Village are still on view, turning the men's room into a homoerotic safe-sex Sistine Chapel.
Not all of his work has such energy. The cutout polychrome sculptures of break-dancing figures lining Park Avenue are cute but flat in more ways than one. And although a walk through the Whitney show gets the juices flowing and puts a little hop in the step, a second look tends to yield less, not more.
But it doesn't matter. The Keith Haring show is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser; it will give pleasure to New Yorkers and out-of-towners alike through this late-90's summer. And Haring would have loved that. He saw himself as an American artist to his fingertips, and his vision is an optimistic, democratic and generous one of a society in which everybody -- black and white, rich and poor, gay and straight, old and young -- could have a piece of the pie.
That they could also have a piece of his art -- free, or at least cheap -- gives his life and work a special appeal. There may never be another Haring retrospective on this scale; his work isn't meant for museum scrutiny. But one guesses that his art will live on: on generations of T-shirts and posters and school notebook covers, in the drawings of radiant, talented young artists who want to be famous, like Haring himself. And that may be the truest American sort of immortality there is.
"Keith Haring" remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, through Sept. 21. "Keith Haring on Park Avenue," organized by the Public Art Fund, is on view through Oct. 10 on Park Avenue from Seagram Plaza, at 53d Street, going north to 75th Street, where the last piece is to be installed tomorrow morning, and at Doris C. Freedman Plaza, at the southeast corner of Central Park (Fifth Avenue and 60th Street). Murals remain at the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, at 208 West 13th Street in Greenwich Village, which is open to the public seven days a week.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Yen Is Up and Mark Is Down, While Canadian Dollar Soars

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark yesterday after a Bundesbank official suggested interest rates could fall, but it weakened against the Japanese yen on prospects for a rate increase.
And the Canadian dollar surged against the United States dollar on an unexpected rate increase by the Bank of Canada. 
 By the trading day's end in New York, the dollar had risen to 1.7256 marks from 1.7235 on Wednesday. It was trading at 113.15 yen, down from 113.80, and 1.3822 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3933.
In Germany, a Bundesbank council member, Reimut Jochimsen, said he did not rule out an interest rate cut to help the economy although German rates now remained effectively "on hold." Bundesbank policy makers left rates unchanged at their meeting yesterday.
Against the yen, the dollar weakened on the possibility of an increase in interest rates amid signs that Japan's economy was strengthening. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association reported the nation's vehicle exports jumped 28.8 percent in May from a year earlier.
"That raised the issue again in the market's mind of trade surplus," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company.
Earlier in the week, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Japan had been tempted to sell United States Treasury securities in the past and hoped Washington would keep currencies stable so Japan would not be forced to do so.
Japanese officials backed away from the remarks. Nevertheless, news reports cited a top official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry speaking anonymously yesterday as saying it was only natural for Japan to want to sell dollar-denominated assets given the nation's tight financial condition.
He said that would lead to a strengthening of the yen. His comments also helped the Japanese currency against the dollar.
The Bank of Canada surprised traders by raising its target band for the overnight funds rate by a quarter percentage point, driving the Canadian dollar sharply higher against the United States dollar. The central bank said it had wanted to support the relatively weak Canadian dollar.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Power of Unity

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In every struggle for human rights, the time comes when governments that rule by repression can no longer block penalties by the democracies.
They lose that power when people of free countries who differ on other important matters decide to use their combined political weight against religious and political persecution in the dictatorships. 
 Movement toward that unity of purpose is beginning between many American conservatives and liberals. Some are motivated by longtime revulsion against China's system of rule by oppression and U.S. appeasement of Beijing during the Bush and Clinton Administrations.
Other Americans have awakened to the persecution of Christians in China and about a dozen other Communist and Muslim countries. They add a critical new engine against religious oppression, and so for all human rights. Name a country that has wiped out either political or religious freedom, and permits the other to flourish.
Americans fighting the Chinese repression and the strengthening of Beijing by American business took an expected loss on Tuesday. The House of Representatives defeated another attempt to make China pay the price of increased tariffs for its persecutions. The bill gained 30 more votes than last year but went down because of the political pressure of the Clinton Administration, whose betrayal of human rights in China has made it Beijing's prisoner, and the money power of the U.S.-China business lobby. It was a sorrowful defeat for the Chinese and Tibetans in slave-labor camps.
But in Washington and across the country Americans long in the human rights struggle and those new to it are just beginning to fight.
Beginning this summer, a hopper full of bills will be presented, aimed at Chinese political and religious oppression. Among them will be a package from Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California, a strong fighter for human rights.
One bill would increase tariffs for the hundreds of companies owned by the Chinese Army, which uses profits to make itself bigger and better. Another would tighten the ban on slave labor goods, or try to. Others would cut off American contributions to loans to China from international organizations like the World Bank and mandate annual U.S. reports on Chinese manipulation of American politics with money or espionage.
Another goal: to hamper Chinese sale of nuclear, chemical and cruise-missile material and technology. To be believable, the legislation should include Congressional investigation and disclosure of all the cases the Clinton Administration knew about, but would not act on.
No proposed legislation will be as effective a human rights message to China and the world as taking away Beijing's tariff privileges -- an effort that will go on in Congress.
But the bills will speak for America against tyranny. They will also test the good faith of Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Congressmen. They opposed ending China's tariff privileges across the board. But they promised to support other action to fight rule by terror in China.
Then in the fall, as part of a campaign against religious persecution leading up to an International Day of Prayer, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Representative Frank Wolf of Virginia, both Republicans, will present another bill. It is a call for action against all countries persecuting Christians, Buddhists and members of the Bahai faith -- as in Iran. It will include a variety of sanctions against persecuting countries, such as withholding international loans; make immigration to the U.S. easier for victims of religious oppression, and set up a special office in the White House to monitor and report on religious persecution.
Congressional action would then have two spearheads -- against Chinese repression of all human rights, and against religious persecution internationally. The combination would be logical -- and doable if American unity for human rights holds.
After World War II, much of the Western left edged off from the fight for human rights in Communist countries. Conservatives looked away almost everywhere else. The losers were the people in the cells.
So if the still-developing and largely untested unity can be preserved it will be of historic importance in the fight for human rights, and the revival of America's role in it.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Apple Computer is seeking to burnish its results by finding a new agency for its domestic account.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THEY say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, but a big bite of the Apple Computer Inc. account has finally fallen from its longtime perch.
Apple, struggling to reverse a severe slump in sales and profits, said yesterday that it would begin a review on the largest portion of its worldwide account: the domestic duties, with billings estimated at $80 million to $90 million, handled since 1986 by BBDO West. 
 But BBDO West abruptly resigned those duties, effective on Sept. 30 -- thereby cutting the longest ties between a major computer company and its agency -- by refusing a request to take part in the review.
"We've been a very loyal and committed partner," said David Lubars, chief executive and chief creative officer at BBDO West in Los Angeles. "But like a relationship, you just know when it's over."
The review on the American portion of the Apple account caused some confusion as to whether BBDO Worldwide, the global agency to which BBDO West reports, would retain its international Apple accounts, with billings estimated at $50 million to $60 million. Mr. Lubars and Apple executives said, however, that the review involved only the domestic duties, though they differed on the billings; Mr. Lubars estimated them at $45 million.
The sudden coming change in Apple's American sales pitches is indicative of the substantive shifts that are roiling Madison Avenue as more giant consumer product marketers, in categories from automobiles to fast food to computers, reassess their agency ties in the face of increasing competition. Accounts with billings of more than $1 billion have been placed in review so far this year by blue-chip advertisers such as BankAmerica, Black & Decker, GTE, Saab, Samsonite, Sun Microsystems and Taco Bell.
"BBDO has made a great contribution to Apple," said David Roman, vice president for advertising and brand communications at Apple in Cupertino, Calif. "We have had many, many successful campaigns."
"This is not driven specifically by BBDO's performance," he added. "We're just making sure we have the best advertising we can get."
Speculation that Apple was unhappy with BBDO West has persisted for several years, intensifying in the wake of the serious, sustained slide in Apple's financial results as computer users spurned Macintosh computers for those that use Microsoft and Intel products. Apple reported a loss of $708 million in its second quarter ending March 28, more than analysts expected, as sales declined 27 percent, to $1.6 billion.
The speculation about worms gnawing at the core of the relationship between Apple and BBDO West -- which has created campaigns with themes such as "The power to be your best" -- gained strength as Apple frequently changed marketing and operating executives.
"The reason for doing this is not so much to take some dramatic action to save the company," Mr. Roman said. "It's part of a process of refocusing our marketing efforts to support the business better."
Allen Rosenshine, chairman and chief executive at BBDO Worldwide in New York, owned by Omnicom Group, took issue with that.
"Apple executives are looking to do something dramatic, and as part of the drama they're looking for a new agency," he said in a telephone interview from London.
"I do understand why they're doing it," he added, "but that doesn't make it right."
Computer industry analysts expressed doubts about the ability of an agency change to improve Apple's faltering performance.
"It is very late in the day, and advertising alone will not solve Apple's problems," said Gary Stibel, a principal at the New England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn., who specializes in technology marketing. "Apple has got to figure out a way to break out of the box."
Only "great advertising in concert with product news has the potential to significantly improve the current situation," he added, "which is not very positive."
James Poyner, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company in New York, was equally pointed.
"I wish Apple's only problem was advertising," he said in an interview with Bloomberg News, adding that Apple executives "are trying to hold body and soul together until they can get their next-generation technology out." That reference was to new operating system software, code-named Rhapsody, to be released next year.
Mr. Lubars at BBDO West said that Mr. Roman had notified him of the review on Tuesday, adding that he spoke with Mr. Rosenshine on Wednesday and then informed Mr. Roman that BBDO West would reject the invitation to participate.
"I have a lot of mixed feelings," Mr. Lubars said. "Obviously there were tensions between us, but that goes on with all clients."
"I still believe it's the superior technology, the way the world should've gone," he added, referring to Macintosh, which has steadily lost ground to Microsoft's Windows.
Mr. Roman said that he and other Apple executives had hoped BBDO would take part in the review.
But "there's always that chance," he added, that an incumbent will decline to participate.
Indeed, big agencies have become more willing to quit than fight, walking away from large accounts after surprise reviews are called. Since January, agencies such as Grey Advertising Inc. and two units of the Interpublic Group of Companies, Ammirati Puris Lintas and Lowe & Partners/SMS, resigned rather than undergo reviews for accounts such as Domino's Pizza, Mastercard and Nabisco Foods.
"We're not petulant," Mr. Rosenshine said. "It's not a BBDO policy to refuse to participate in a review. You look at it case by case."
"But with Apple," he added, "I couldn't ask our people, considering what they've gone through in the last three or four years, to go through it and lose -- which is what I think would have happened."
Mr. Roman said that Apple would seek an agency to create ads to burnish Apple's brand image for the mass media and peddle products to current customers in specialized media. The goal is to hire one shop, he added, but duties may be divided.
Mr. Roman declined to identify the agencies in the review because, he said, they are only now being contacted. The trade publication Advertising Age suggested contenders with computer experience like the Bates USA unit of Bates Worldwide, owned by Cordiant P.L.C.; the CKS Partners unit of CKS Group in Cupertino; Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis, and Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco.
Advertising Age also mentioned the TBWA Chiat/Day unit of Omnicom in Venice, Calif. That shop is the successor to Chiat/Day, which created the spectacular, successful spot for Apple titled "1984" but stumbled the next year with a dour commercial called "Lemmings" and lost Apple to BBDO West in 1986.
"But the question is how desirable Apple is as an account," said Bradley Johnson, the national technology editor for Advertising Age in Los Angeles. "If you are a hot agency, do you want to lock yourself into a troubled and apparently declining company in an industry that's the fastest-growing part of the economy?"
That question echoes for BBDO Worldwide, too, because that agency was invited by I.B.M. in 1994 to take part in a closed review for its worldwide account, with billings estimated at $400 million to $500 million. BBDO executives said they would rather stick with Apple.
"We believed in Apple, and that's how I still feel," Mr. Lubars said.
Asked whether BBDO West would now get rid of all of its many Macintoshes, he replied, laughing: "No. Not anytime soon, anyway."
As for layoffs at BBDO West after Apple's departure, Mr. Lubars said they would be minimal because of recent account gains. About 40 to 50 members of the staff of fewer than 200 people work on Apple, he said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Falter; The Dow Ends 35.73 Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stock prices closed lower yesterday as Wall Street's nerves were again rattled by another rise in long-term bond interest rates ahead of next week's meeting of the policy-setting Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee.
Worries about the quality of second-quarter corporate profits also cut into stocks, analysts said. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended 35.73 points lower at 7,654.25.
In the broader market, declining issues narrowly outpaced advancers, 1,460 to 1,339, on heavy New York Stock Exchange volume of 503.8 million shares. The Nasdaq composite index lost 9.86 points, to 1,436.38. And the Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 5.31 points, to 883.68.
It was the fourth day this week that stocks were subject to sharp swings. On Monday, the Dow had its second-biggest point loss ever as it dropped 192.25 points, followed by Tuesday's recovery of 153.80 points and Wednesday's 68.08-point fall.
Since the beginning of May, the blue-chip Dow index has risen nearly 700 points, or 9.7 percent, fostering doubts about whether the run-up still had staying power.
"People are nervous as cats out there and they are doing some selling to nail down profits," said Marshall Acuff, the chief investment strategist for Smith Barney.
Analysts said stocks were jarred by the steady rise in long-term interest rates, which have advanced for four straight days.
The 30-year Treasury bond fell 17/32 , raising its yield to 6.78 percent, from 6.73 percent on Wednesday. The price and yield move in opposite directions.
More warnings of lower second-quarter profits from the technology company Komag Inc. also helped to cool investors' ardor for stocks, analysts said.
"For the past three quarters, there has been a sense of hesitancy and nervousness in the month before earnings get reported when profit warnings come out," Mr. Acuff said. "We are heading into the reporting period, and this quarter shouldn't be any different."
Wall Street was also on edge ahead of the meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee, though most economists do not expect a credit tightening until the panel's August meeting at the earliest.
The stocks of computer disk drive companies slumped after Komag, of San Jose, Calif., said that its profits for the second quarter and the rest of the year would fall short of analyst expectations.
The stock, the most heavily traded on Nasdaq, fell 6 7/8 a share, to 16 11/16 . Shares of rival disk drive makers also fell: Seagate Technology was off 1/8 at 33 1/2 and the Read-Rite Corporation lost 2 1/8, to 20 1/16 .
Technology and drug stocks, which have led the market higher recently, lost ground. Pharmacia & Upjohn shed 13/16 a share, to 34 1/16 ; Johnson & Johnson fell 1 5/16 , to 63 7/8, and Warner-Lambert was off 2 3/4 at 119.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. surged 11 9/16 , to 91, after its French parent company, Rhone-Poulenc S.A., said it was considering a $4.3 billion bid to buy the stake of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer it does not already own.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
TriBeCa Lofts Are Growing, and Growing Larger

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Manhattan's heated housing market continues to fuel the conversion of old manufacturing buildings into loft condominiums in TriBeCa, where developers are trying to meet a demand they say still outstrips the supply.
"Throughout lower Manhattan, there is a virtual explosion of housing, and TriBeCa is part of it," said Paul Goldstein, district manager of Community Board 1, which tries to guide the area's growth. He said there are more conversions in TriBeCa now than during the heyday of the mid- to late 1980's. 
 Estimates from the community board are that in the last two years 250 loft apartments have been completed or are under way, and some 300 more are planned. That, along with rising prices, has bolstered the neighborhood's transformation, which began in the 1980's but was stalled by the recession.
Mr. Goldstein said the conversion activity is also "working its way northward" from Duane Street, the neighborhood's core, and bringing in "other types of developments," like restaurants and theaters.
Three projects illustrate the current activity. Work started early this month at a 56-unit project on North Moore. A 30-unit project on Duane is winding down its sales campaign. Construction also will start soon on a conversion of up to 42 units, which includes a six-screen movie theater, also on North Moore.
The conversion boom has been aided by zoning changes adopted by the City Council in 1995 affecting a 45-block area in TriBeCa. The regulations permit new construction and conversions south of North Moore to residential, business and art uses. Such conversions still require special permits from the City Planning Commission north of North Moore and Walker Streets.
The new projects are different in several ways from those of the 1980's, brokers said. Most offer larger apartments, averaging 2,400 square feet. They are also condominiums, reflecting consumer preference toward that more flexible form of ownership over the restrictiveness of co-ops.
Many of the larger new developments also come with more services than those of the last decade. Among them are 24-hour doormen, concierges and live-in superintendents.
"The new product has broadened the base of buyers," said Pamela Liebman, managing partner at the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage. In addition to artists and entertainers, today's buyers also include professionals in the finance and media industries, empty nesters and families, including some from the Upper East and West sides.
Sales are steady, prices are rising and "there are no signs that demand is waning," added Jeffrey Tabak, who runs Tabak Real Estate in TriBeCa. He said prices for existing lofts, which fell by as much as 30 percent since the market's downturn in 1990, have rebounded and surpassed their 1987 peak.
In its midyear survey, the Corcoran Group reports that existing loft apartments, with 2,250 square feet, sold on average for $322 a square foot, or $724,500. The firm puts the average sales price for new lofts at $400 a square foot, with some going as high as $500.
"I would not say prices have peaked," Ms. Liebman said. But she added, "It will be difficult to achieve prices too far beyond the $500 a square foot level in the near future."
Sales began four months ago at the 12-story Duane Park building, at 166 Duane, which Hudu Development of Manhattan turned into 30 lofts, at sizes from 2,700 square feet to nearly 6,000. Contracts have been signed or are pending on 23 units at the building, which will offer a concierge. Prices range from $695,000 to $3.7 million with monthly maintenance fees, including taxes, from $1,259 to $4,834
"The demand is being driven by young Wall Street families," said Mark S. Blau, Hudu's president. Initial occupancy will start this fall and be completed by year's end, he said.
Work started three weeks ago on the conversion to 56 lofts of the former John Ericsson Ice House, a 10-story, 1905 Renaissance Revival structure at 27 North Moore. It is being done by Jack Lefkowitz and Joseph Pell Lombardi, who is also the project's architect.
The design calls for restoring the building's exterior, installing windows in its now mostly windowless facade and carving a courtyard from its core. The last will allow more light to the building and provide each loft, ranging from 1,600 to 4,700 square feet with exposures on the street and on the courtyard. The cut-away space will be relocated as two and a half floors for penthouses, said Mr. Lombardi.
Prices for the lofts will be $425 a square foot and monthly common charges, including taxes, will be $1,600 to $4,700. Amenities will include an exercise room and a concierge.
Next month, work is to begin on the conversion of the 16-story Atalanta Building at 25 North Moore into up to 42 lofts and a movie theater on the first five floors. Most of the apartments will have 1,035 to 2,500 square feet, and the penthouses will have 5,000 square feet, but all will be offered as unfinished space and can be combined, said George L. Olsen. Mr. Olsen and Martin Shaw are general managing partners of 25 North Moore Associates, which is developing the project. Mr. Olsen said prices will be competitive.
The intent is to provide buyers with smaller units that are not now available and with flexibility to design their own space, he said, noting, "We do not see demand abating."

HEADLINE: Rules Alone Won't Clean the Air

BYLINE: By Richard M. Daley; Richard M. Daley is the Mayor of Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
This week's announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency will move forward with recommendations for significantly tighter limits on air pollution is both encouraging and disappointing.
I am encouraged by President Clinton's assurances that the new regulations will be flexible and sensible and not single out large metropolitan areas for punishment. 
 But unfortunately, the new E.P.A. regulations include no new ideas. Everyone wants less soot and smog -- especially residents of large cities, where pollution is the biggest problem. But setting tougher pollution standards will not give us cleaner air.
Indeed, good standards, if carried out badly, can adversely affect public health and the environment. The major cause of smog and soot in cities is no longer industry, which has cleaned up its act, but automobile emissions. Yet the new clean air regulations could encourage suburban sprawl (and thus more cars), while hurting the development of industrial jobs in the cities.
That's what happened with the Government's Superfund program, which was supposed to speed the cleanup of polluted sites. But because of liability problems associated with the Superfund, contaminated property is almost certain to be abandoned. Industry won't invest in this property; neither will lenders.
This has happened thousands of times in cities across the country: jobs and capital are encouraged to flee to the suburbs and beyond. The result is more people in cars driving to and from work, and more air pollution.
The new clean air regulations could have an equally devastating effect. For instance, if a city is having trouble meeting the new standards, a moratorium could be placed on industrial development. Industry moves out, promoting more traffic and suburban sprawl.
Cities need real programs to clean up the air. For example, Chicago has a new program, Brownfields, aimed at correcting the failures of the Superfund. The city is reclaiming abandoned, polluted inner-city industrial property. This reclamation cleans the environment and brings jobs into the city. Congress is considering several bills that would help cities rebuild their industrial sites.
But the Government must do a better job of planning how cleaner air will be achieved. For instance, highway construction still takes first priority, while urban mass transit receives less and less Federal money. It is left to the cities and states to give mass transit more money in order to meet the new clean air standards.
This week at a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, many mayors, from Susan Savage of Tulsa, Okla., to Dennis Archer of Detroit, expressed concerns about the new E.P.A. standards. Together under the leadership of Mayor Paul Helmke of Fort Wayne, Ind., the conference will work toward a more flexible approach to this problem.
But serious questions have been raised about whether the E.P.A. has the legal authority to be flexible. Congress should act to insure that the new standards will be carried out with the common sense that has been promised. This may require rewriting the Clean Air Act to make it fairer to cities by making it less reliant on punitive sanctions and enforcement.
Action must match rhetoric. Without a real Federal plan to meet the new standards, taxpayers won't be getting the cleaner air they deserve.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AT THE U.N.;
Clinton on the Global Environment: Some Progress but Much More Still to Be Done

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's address to the United Nations environmental conference yesterday, as provided by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company:
Five years ago in Rio, the nations of the world joined together around a simple but revolutionary proposition: that today's progress must not come at tomorrow's expense. 
 In our era, the environment has moved to the top of the international agenda because how well a nation honors it will have an impact, for good or ill, not only on the people of that nation, but all across the globe. Preserving the resources we share is crucial not only for the quality of our individual environments and health, but also to maintain stability and peace within nations and among them.
As the father of conservation in our nation, John Muir, said, "When we try to pick anything out by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe."
In the years since Rio there has been real progress in some areas. Nations have banned the dumping of radioactive wastes in the ocean and reduced marine pollution from sources on land. We're working to protect the precious coral reefs, to conserve threatened fish, to stop the advance of deserts. At the Cairo Conference on Population and Development, we reaffirmed the crucial importance of cooperative family planning efforts to long-term sustainable development.
Here in America, we have worked to clean up a record number of our toxic dumps, and we intend to clean 500 more over the next four years. We've passed new laws to better protect our water, created new national parks and monuments, and worked to harmonize our efforts for environmental protection, economic growth, and social improvement, aided by a distinguished Council on Sustainable Development.
Yesterday I announced the most far-reaching efforts to improve air quality in our nation in 20 years, cutting smog levels dramatically and, for the first time ever, setting standards to lower the levels of the fine particles in the atmosphere that form soot. In America, the incidence of childhood asthma has been increasing rapidly. It is now the single biggest reason our children are hospitalized. These measures will help to change that, to improve health of people of all ages, and to prevent as many as 15,000 premature deaths a year.
Still, we here have much more to do, especially in reducing America's contribution to global climate change. The science is clear and compelling: We humans are changing the global climate.
Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are at their highest levels in more than 200,000 years and climbing sharply. If the trend does not change, scientists expect the seas to rise two feet or more over the next century. In America, that means 9,000 square miles of Florida, Louisiana and other coastal areas will be flooded; in Asia, 17 percent of Bangladesh, land on which six million people now live, will be lost; island chains such as the Maldives will disappear from the map unless we reverse the predictions.
Climate changes will disrupt agriculture, cause severe droughts and floods and the spread of infectious diseases, which will be a big enough problem for us under the best of circumstances in the 21st century. There could be 50 million or more cases of malaria a year. We can expect more deaths from heat stress. Just two years ago here in the United States in the city of Chicago, we saw the tragedy of more than 400 of our citizens dying during a severe heat wave.
No nation can escape this danger. None can evade its responsibility to confront it, and we must all do our part, industrial nations that emit the largest quantities of greenhouse gases today, and developing nations whose greenhouse gas emissions are growing rapidly.
I applaud the European Union for its strong focus on this issue and the World Bank for setting environmental standards for projects it will finance in the developing world.
Here in the United States, we must do better. With 4 percent of the world's population, we already produce more than 20 percent of its greenhouse gases.
Frankly, our record since Rio is not sufficient. We have been blessed with high rates of growth and millions of new jobs over the last few years, but that has led to an increase in greenhouse-gas emissions in spite of the adoption of new conservation practices. So we must do better, and we will.
The air-quality action I took on yesterday is a positive first step, but many more must follow. In order to reduce greenhouse gases and grow the economy, we must invest more in the technologies of the future. I am directing my Cabinet to work to develop them. Government, universities, business and labor must work together. All these efforts must be sustained over years, indeed, over decades. As Vice President Gore said Monday, "Sustainable development requires sustained commitment." With that commitment, we can succeed.
We must create new technologies and develop new strategies like emissions trading that will both curtail pollution and support continued economic growth. We owe that in the developed world to ourselves, and equally to those in the developing nations. Many of the technologies that will help us to meet the new air quality standards in America can also help address climate change. This is a challenge we must undertake immediately, and one in which I personally plan to play a critical role.
In the United States, in order to do our part, we have to first convince the American people and the Congress that the climate change problem is real and imminent. I will convene a White House Conference on Climate Change later this year to lay the scientific facts before our people to understand that we must act, and to lay the economic facts there so that they will understand the benefits and the costs. With the best ideas and strategies, and new technologies and increased productivity and energy efficiency, we can turn the challenge to our advantage.
We will work with our people, and we will bring to the Kyoto conference a strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits that will significantly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases.
I want to mention three other initiatives briefly that we are taking to deal with climate change and to advance sustainable development here and beyond our borders.
First, to help developing nations reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the United States will provide a billion dollars in assistance over the next five years to support energy efficiency, develop alternative energy sources, and improve resource management to promote growth that does not have an adverse effect on the climate.
Second, we will do more to encourage private investment to meet environmental standards. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation will now require that its projects adhere to new and strengthened environmental guidelines, just as our Export-Import Bank already does, and as I hope our allies and friends soon will. Common guidelines for responsible investment clearly would lead to more sustainable growth in developing nations.
Third, we must increase our use of new technologies even as we move to develop more new technologies. Already we are working with our auto industry to produce cars by early in the next century that are three times as fuel efficient as today's vehicles. Now we will work with businesses and communities to use the sun's energy to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by installing solar panels on one million more roofs around our nation by 2010. Capturing the sun's warmth can help us to turn down the Earth's temperature.
Distinguished leaders, in all our cultures we have been taught from time immemorial that, as scripture says, "One generation passes away and another comes, but the Earth abides forever." We must strengthen our stewardship of the environment to make that true, and to insure that when this generation passes, the young man who just spoke before me, and all of those of his generation, will inherit a rich and abundant Earth.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AT THE U.N.: AN ASSESSMENT;
Pollution Politics: Clinton's Choice

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 26

 BODY:
President Clinton this week confronted the two most important environmental questions of the year, how to slow global warming and how to tighten the Clean Air Act. He satisfied the environmentalists in his constituency on the issue of smog and soot, but deeply disappointed many of them today on the question of climate change. It was a striking disparity, given that the two environmental problems have some important common roots. Soot and smog, like greenhouse gases, come mainly from burning fossil fuels. Imaginative new approaches to controlling both kinds of pollution are likely to involve plans for trading emissions credits and perfecting new technologies.
But there are important differences, and these illustrate why the President found himself seeming so torn on the overall question of what to do about air pollution. 
 For one thing, many ordinary people have immediate concerns about the smog they breathe and the way it and particles in the air can worsen the illnesses of their young children and aging parents. Not so many are worried about rising sea levels caused by melting glaciers, or about the scientific subtleties of global warming.
For another thing, President Clinton faced a pressing deadline for deciding on the new air pollution rules, which under a court order had to be issued by July. His ultimate decisions about how fast to move on global warming are not due until December, when international negotiations sponsored by the United Nations culminate in Kyoto, Japan.
And above all, fixing the global warming problem requires not just more powerful medicine, but a lot more of it, than controlling local smokestacks and tailpipes.
To satisfy the critics demanding swift and decisive action from the United States to head off global warming, Mr. Clinton would have to pledge that a nation in the midst of an energy binge was about to break its addiction to cheap fossil fuels.
And that implies an act of extraordinary political will.
At the United Nations today, Mr. Clinton promised to mobilize his own country in such an effort, but he disappointed anybody who wanted a precise plan. In the President's own crucial word, any goals he will eventually accept must be "realistic."
The industry giants who lambasted the Administration for its decision on air quality on Wednesday praised Mr. Clinton's caution on global warming today.
"We are encouraged by the fact that President Clinton seems to be taking a slightly more cautious approach to climate issues than he appeared to be taking several months ago," said Gail McDonald, president of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group. "There are many vested interests pushing very hard for an agreement that would have dire consequences for the economy."
Several policies favored by many environmentalists are seen by the Administration as unrealistic.
Energy taxes as a way to lower fuel consumption are pretty well ruled out in Washington's current political climate. Regulations to enforce fuel-efficiency on automakers are equally out of favor.
Federico Pena, Mr. Clinton's Energy Secretary, said in an interview today that the most important thing in the President's speech was his commitment to proselytizing the public on the urgency of the problem and then to persuading the country that the solution will not be unduly painful.
"We have not done a good job of educating the American people, first about the challenges we face on global warming, and secondly about the value of making the long-term investments that actually pay back in your pocketbook," he said.
It is impossible to say, of course, whether technology breakthroughs of the kind Mr. Clinton vowed to pursue are the most realistic way of weaning America from coal and oil. Despite the progress toward wider use of photovoltaic solar cells, electric cars, fuel cells that run on hydrogen, and so on, the technical hurdles are still formidable.
"Solar energy is an important part of the long-term solution, but it is no substitute for binding targets and timetables for reducing emissions soon," said Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund.
America is, after all, a nation where energy waste is common enough that many readily available conservation measures could pay for themselves by reducing the energy costs of businesses and households. Still, market mechanisms do not yet exist to drive investments in those directions, at least not at the speed needed to dramatically slow emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas.
The Administration is working hard to develop an approach toward holding down emissions that will create pollution permits that companies can buy and sell to each other. Known as the "cap and trade" approach, it is intended to steer investments in pollution control toward the cheapest possible solutions. It pleases some environmental groups, but others view it with the suspicion of a grandmother confronted with a newfangled gadget.
But the White House appears to be persuaded by its own economists that the economic pain of abruptly taking new paths on energy consumption might be too great to bear, and that a more moderate approach is called for. Such conclusions are amplified in dire warnings from powerful industries about the dangers of moving too quickly.
Fed by an economic boom that has overwhelmed steady improvements in industrial energy efficiency, its gas-guzzling vehicles slaked by affordable gasoline, the United States appears likely to increase emissions of carbon dioxide by 13 percent in this decade. This is just the reverse of what it promised to do five years ago in Rio de Janeiro, where the industrial countries aimed to reduce greenhouse gas output to the level of 1990 by the year 2000.
As Mr. Clinton said in his speech, only 1 out of every 25 people on the planet is an American, but the fuel they burn produces one out of every five tons of the carbon dioxide that is steadily building up in the atmosphere, threatening to seriously disrupt the climate 100 or 200 years from now.
To be sure, some countries have met their targets and others are willing to promise to obey a new, binding treaty that would actually reduce greenhouse gases further. The target the European Union proposes is to cut emissions by 15 percent from the 1990 level, achieving that goal by the year 2010.
The British cut emissions when they ended subsidies for an inefficient coal industry. The Germans, after unification, tore down the obsolete state-run factories of the east. Russia met the target of reducing emissions, but only because its economy collapsed along with Communism. And as a whole, Europe does not have the aversion to energy taxes -- or taxes in general -- that has been displayed in the United States, where the Clinton Administration's first big economic policy defeat was on the BTU tax, and where just last year Congress, egged on by Bob Dole, was busily trying to roll back gas taxes because of a blip in prices at the pump.

Bonds Drop For a 2d Day; Job Data Cited

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities, with the exception of the shorter maturities, fell yesterday for a second day.
The market was hurt by a report that the number of Americans applying for unemployment dropped significantly in the latest week, hinting at possibly inflationary conditions in the labor market, and by a large supply of new corporate debt. The short end was helped by portfolio managers buying to provide window dressing for their portfolios at the end of the quarter. 
 Still, moves were limited, and analysts expect that to continue to be the case ahead of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting next week, as market participants anticipate that the Fed will keep interest rates at current levels.
The 30-year bond fell 17/32 , to a price of 98 2/32 , and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.78 percent, from 6.73 percent on Wednesday. In just the last two days the long bond is down 1 3/32 , or about $11 for $1,000 invested.
The Labor Department said that the number of workers filing for state unemployment benefits for the first time fell by 14,000, to 332,000, last week. Analysts had expected a drop of 5,000 jobs. Traders said the bigger-than-expected drop fueled concerns that the Fed might raise rates in an effort to slow the economy, despite the fact that other recent reports have indicated the economy is already experiencing a slowdown.
Adding to the picture of moderating growth was a report yesterday by the Conference Board that its index of help-wanted advertising in newspapers for May fell six points, to 81, the lowest level since last August.
Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said he believed that the drop in the index was consistent with the relatively small increase in payrolls in the Government's last monthly employment report, for May. Mr. Harris is also predicting that the June payroll number will be slightly less than the one a year earlier.
Still, the unemployment rate in the United States is now at a 23-year low of 4.8 percent, which has left many market participants concerned that employers will have to compete for workers by raising wages, passing the extra costs on to consumers.
Joel Marver, chief technical analyst with Technical Data of Boston, said that the decline in bonds yesterday was caused by the amount of new debt issued this week, from the Treasury's auction of new two- and five-year notes and new corporate debt.
"The gains scored this month have been eroded, but not completely eliminated," Mr. Marver said. "Traders note that as the market is examined from a longer-term time frame, there is still positive momentum present despite the losses of the past several days."
Contributing to the new supply on the market, Poland sold $400 million of debt yesterday in two parts through underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities.
For $300 million of notes due 2004, the yield after pricing was 7.129 percent, or about 75-hundredths of a percentage point more than a comparable United States Treasury security, while $100 million of notes due 2017 was priced to yield 7.82 percent, a full point above a comparable Treasury. Both parts are noncallable and rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor's.

Study Finds Cutting Clothing Tax Costly

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
A new study concludes that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposal to do away with the sales tax on clothing items under $500 in New York City would have a relatively small impact on the local economy and would depress overall tax revenues more than Mr. Giuliani has estimated.
The study, released yesterday by the city's Independent Budget Office, found that if the 8.25 percent clothing tax were eliminated, the municipal government would lose $300 million annually in tax revenues. 
 Elimination of the tax would lead to some increase in economic activity and municipal taxes, the study said, because shoppers would buy more clothing in the city instead of going to New Jersey or other places that do not have sales taxes. For example, clothing stores might hire more people to handle the additional sales, causing an upturn in revenues from the city's income tax.
By 2001, the study said, the additional spending would raise annual revenues from the range of city taxes by at least $35 million, or 12 percent of the $300 million annual cost of the cut.
Mr. Giuliani disputed the conclusions of the Independent Budget Office, which is independent of the Mayor and the City Council. He said eliminating the clothing sales tax would generate an "enormous economic boom and opportunity in the city."
The Giuliani administration's own analysis has found that the additional tax revenues would initially cover nearly 40 percent of the cost of the cut, while also providing many indirect benefits.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AT THE U.N.: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Defers Curbs on Gases Heating Globe

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 26

 BODY:
President Clinton told a special session of the United Nations tonight that if countries ignore the "real and imminent" problem of global warming, the earth risks severe drought, floods and the spread of infectious disease.
But, speaking a day after he sharply tightened pollution limits on soot and smog, Mr. Clinton stopped well short of the commitment to cutting greenhouse gases that allies have been urging. He deferred announcing any such restrictions -- which are opposed by automobile and oil companies and other heavy industries -- until an international meeting in December in Kyoto, Japan. 
 Mr. Clinton went further tonight than he has before in endorsing scientific findings establishing the dangers of pollution.
"The science is clear and compelling: We humans are changing the global climate," he said. "Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are at their highest levels in more than 200,000 years and climbing sharply." [Transcript, page A11.]
Mr. Clinton's speech fit the tone of the conference, which has been attended this week by the heads of state of about 70 nations. The debate over the environment here has been marked by talk of crisis, bitter criticism of international foot-dragging and apocalyptic visions of a stricken planet.
Warning that unless changes are made, scientists expect the seas to rise by two feet or more in the next century, Mr. Clinton envisioned an America in which "9,000 square miles of Florida, Louisiana, and other coastal areas will be flooded." He spoke of an increase of 50 million or more malaria cases worldwide each year.
"No nation can escape this danger," he said. "None can evade its responsibility to confront it." Mr. Clinton noted that with 4 percent of the world's population, the United States emits 20 percent of its greenhouse gases, which are defined as carbon dioxide emissions generated by anything that burns fossil fuels like oil and coal. "Here in the United States, we must do better," he said.
But just last weekend at an annual summit meeting of industrialized nations held in Denver, Mr. Clinton fended off demands from the French and Germans that he move immediately to restrict greenhouse emissions.
Privately, his aides said the Europeans were more interested in posturing for their voters back home than in setting immediate and strict goals that could also prove difficult for them to meet.
Further, Mr. Clinton faces less pressure domestically on the issue of greenhouse gases than he did over soot and smog. While heat waves, like the one in Chicago that was blamed for more than 400 deaths two years ago, have periodically drawn public attention to the issue of global warming, on a daily basis, parents ferrying their children to baseball practice are more likely to fret about the smog.
Today, the President said he would take action on greenhouse gases later this year. He said he would "work with our people and we will bring to the Kyoto conference a strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits that will significantly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases."
Within the Administration, Vice President Al Gore has been the house goad over the dangers of greenhouse gases. He is fond of unveiling a chart whose right side unfolds repeatedly upward to display a dramatic red spike depicting the recent global increase in carbon dioxide.
Support from environmentalists -- who were delighted by the Administration's moves against pollution on Wednesday but disappointed tonight -- is considered a key to Mr. Gore's probable Presidential bid. But it is an open question how far the Administration can afford to push energy and auto companies, and the union workers who depend on them.
Fred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defense Fund, said President Clinton's failure to set specific timetables for reduction of greenhouse gases made "instant Pablum" out of his speech, despite the promises of foreign aid and advanced research aimed at controlling climate change.
But Richard Mott, vice president of the World Wildlife Fund, called the speech "the strongest statement on climate change by any sitting U.S. President, by a wide margin." He said it was very significant that Mr. Clinton had endorsed the scientific consensus that the problem is serious, and had pledged to educate the public and persuade the Congress to address it.
Mr. Clinton promised some modest steps tonight to begin tackling the problem of climate change -- two of them intended to modify the practices of foreign countries, rather than of the United States. He promised $1 billion in assistance, already proposed in his budget plan, to help third-world nations manage their resources and develop alternative energy sources.
He also said the United States would require that certain projects it helps finance overseas meet new environmental standards.
Lastly, he said the United States would try to increase its own use of more environmentally friendly technologies, including solar energy.
In keeping with rules at the conference, most speeches have lasted about seven minutes. Mr. Clinton spoke for 12 minutes. He wrestled with the wording of his remarks all afternoon after attending the burial of a great-uncle in Hope, Ark.
Bill Richardson, United States representative to the United Nations, said Mr. Clinton's decision on Wednesday to tighten pollution restrictions had helped allay other nations' doubts about the Administration, proving it was "serious about the environment."
Asked why the President decided not to move immediately on the issue of greenhouse gases as well, Mr. Richardson said, "We've got to build support with the Congress and the American people first," adding, "I think there'll be a good basis to move aggressively in Kyoto."
Mr. Clinton said he needed to generate more support before trying to cut greenhouse emissions. To do so, he said, he will hold a White House conference on climate change later this year, "to lay the scientific facts before our people, to understand that we must act, and to lay the economic facts there so that they understand the benefits and the costs."
Mr. Clinton intended his appearance at the United Nations tonight to raise his profile on environmental issuesdramatically.
He had announced his intention to attend during a speech in a Costa Rican rain forest on May 9. In that speech, he issued a more hedged warning about the dangers of climate change.
"There is some doubt about what increased greenhouse gas emissions are doing to the climate," Mr. Clinton said then, "but no one doubts that they're changing the climate, and no one doubts that the potential consequences can be very profound and severe."
The special session of the General Assembly was called to assess what progress has been made toward solving global environmental problems since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro five years ago. When the conference ends on Friday night, representatives of 199 countries and international organizations will have spoken, including 42 heads of state or government, a couple of princes and dozens of ministers.
There was little expectation that the conference would break any new ground or reach any new agreements.
The highlight of the week was the unexpectedly strong language used by Europeans in urging the United States to take a leadership role in solving environmental problems.
Britain's Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, said on Monday that this meant the American people as well as the Clinton Administration.
Nations from the third world wanted promises of more aid to help alleviate pollution and other problems. Except for offers of some assistance from Japan and the United States, no such pledges materialized.

Earnings Increase 12% at Lehman Brothers

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said yesterday that its earnings had risen 12 percent in its second quarter as gains in investment banking offset a decline in trading.
Lehman, the fourth-largest United States securities firm, said earnings for the quarter, which ended on May 31, rose to $121 million, or 95 cents a share, from $108 million, or 89 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 The results exceeded the average forecast of 82 cents a share made by four analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S. International Inc. Lehman's shares rose 75 cents, to $43.50, yesterday.
The firm's focus on high-margin businesses such as mergers and acquisitions helped it overcome "an extremely difficult trading and underwriting environment in March and April," Richard Fuld Jr., the chairman and chief executive, said.
Lehman's results contrasted with those of Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company and Goldman, Sachs Group. Both reported declines in their securities businesses from the quarter a year earlier, which was particularly strong for Wall Street.
Lehman's revenue, excluding interest income and expenses, rose 2.5 percent in the second quarter, to $854 million. Investment banking revenue had the biggest gains, rising 23 percent, to $274 million. Trading revenue -- including interest costs -- fell 6 percent, to $473 million, amid the slump in stock and bond markets in March and April.
Lehman, one of Wall Street's biggest bond traders and underwriters, is trying to expand its merger, stock and high-yield bond businesses to improve shareholder returns. These areas have higher profit margins than the firm's debt businesses.
The firm was the second-biggest bond underwriter during the quarter ended in May, arranging $25.6 billion of sales, according to the Securities Data Company, which tracks the securities industry.
Lehman ranked eighth among Wall Street's stock underwriters, putting together sales worth $783.9 million. It was also the eighth-biggest merger and acquisition adviser, completing $16.2 billion of corporate combinations.
Though underwriting of stocks and bonds by Lehman and other firms slowed after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in March, lower rates and rising stocks spurred a recovery later in the quarter.
"Since the second week of May, we've seen an acceleration in underwriting across the board," said Jeffrey Vanderbeek, head of debt capital markets at Lehman.

HEADLINE: Albert L. Latter, 76, Physicist And Expert on Nuclear Arms

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Albert L. Latter, a nuclear physicist and expert on nuclear weapons systems' abilities and vulnerabilities, died on June 8 at his home in the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles. He was 76.
His death was announced on Wednesday by the Rand Corporation, the research concern based in Santa Monica, Calif., where Dr. Latter worked from 1951 to 1971. Rand's public information director, Jess Cook, said Dr. Latter had had a long illness. 
 While Dr. Latter was at Rand, he was the co-author, with the physicist Edward Teller, of a widely noted 1958 book, "Our Nuclear Future: Facts, Dangers and Opportunities." The two men had worked together on the Air Force's Scientific Advisory Board.
Reviewing the work in The New York Times Book Review, Leonard Engel, a science writer, said the authors presented "a strong, carefully reasoned plea" for the Atomic Energy Commission's nuclear bomb-testing program "and the necessity of continuing it, at least for the near future."
In their book, Dr. Latter and Dr. Teller contended that past nuclear weapons tests had caused at most a very minor increase in the world's exposure to radioactivity without detectably having an impact on human life and that further testing at the current rate for several years would not alter that. The authors also argued that trying to ban bomb tests would fail because they could be hidden and because the Soviet Union could not be relied on to obey a ban.
"It is almost certain," they wrote, "that in the competition between prohibition and bootlegging, the bootlegger will win."
In 1960, Dr. Latter became head of the physics department at Rand, where the aspects of nuclear weapons he dealt with ranged from their design and efficiency to defensive steps against them. He also played a significant role in developing certain advanced missile warheads and in devising ways to detect underground nuclear tests.
Among the honors he received was an Atomic Energy Commission award in 1964 for his contributions to the design of nuclear weapons and to the detection of nuclear explosions. He also did important work in contriving measures to strengthen United States missile silos to make them less vulnerable to nuclear attack.
Dr. Latter left Rand in 1971 and founded R & D Associates, a defense company based in Marina del Rey, Calif. In 1983, when the company was acquired by Logicon Inc., it was providing high-technology electronic systems and professional services, mainly to the Defense Department. Dr. Latter was the president until he retired from that post in 1985.
Dr. Latter was born in Kokomo, Ind., and received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics in 1941 and a doctorate in physics in 1951, both from the University of California at Los Angeles.
He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Christina Kelton of Cincinnati and Jacqueline Latter of Los Angeles; a brother, Richard of McLean, Va., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: HOUSE BACKS BILL FOR BIG TAX CUTS IN A 253-179 VOTE

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
The House passed the first big Federal tax cut in 16 years today, brushing aside Democratic complaints that the plan favored the wealthy to approve a package of reductions that Republicans said would give the middle class much-needed relief.
The bill, which contains a credit of $500 per child for many families, tax breaks for college expenses, and reductions in capital gains and inheritance taxes, must still be reconciled with a somewhat different version making its way through the Senate. 
 The House bill passed 253 to 179. Just 27 Democrats joined 226 Republicans to approve the legislation, which was largely unchanged from the version passed by the Ways and Means Committee earlier this month without any Democratic support.
The House bill contains provisions that President Clinton has said are unacceptable to him, including an allowance for investors to exclude inflation in calculating capital gains, on stocks, real estate and other investments.
Mr. Clinton has also contended that the costs of the tax cut could spiral out of control in coming decades, risking a return of big budget deficits, and he is pressing for changes on a number of specific provisions, like making the child credit available to more low- and moderate-income families and providing more money for college tuition tax breaks.
Because he can veto the tax bill, Mr. Clinton will have a say in reshaping it when House and Senate negotiators meet next month to work out differences between their versions, including a provision in the Senate bill to raise the Federal tax on cigarettes by 20 cents a pack from its current level of 24 cents. The Senate is expected to vote on its bill on Friday.
Along with spending bills passed by the House and Senate on Wednesday, the tax bills provide the framework for implementing the agreement between Congress and the Administration to balance the Federal budget by 2002.
"I can give you my word that we're going to do everything we can to get the two bills signed by the President," Speaker Newt Gingrich said after the House vote. "We have no intention of playing games and I don't think the President has any intention of playing games."
Gene Sperling, the chairman of the White House's National Economic Council, said that although the House bill fell short of Mr. Clinton's demands in a number of areas, the Administration hoped "to work in good faith toward getting a bill the President can sign."
The Administration plans to unveil its own comprehensive tax-cutting proposals on Monday to make clear how it would want to see the House and Senate bills changed.
The House bill would provide about $135 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, partly offset by $50 billion in new or extended taxes, primarily on airline tickets.
Its main provisions are a $500-per-child credit for couples filing jointly with incomes up to $110,000, a reduction in the top rate on capital gains to 20 percent from the current 28 percent, a credit of up to $1,500 a year per student for the first two years of college, creation of a new type of retirement savings accounts, cuts in the minimum tax on corporations and cuts in the Federal estate tax.
The Senate version is likely to resemble the House bill in broad outline, containing a $500 child credit, cuts in the capital gains and estate taxes, expansion of the retirement savings account and tax incentives for college education.
But the two bills will differ in many other ways, some small, some big, including the Senate bill's reliance on the increased cigarette tax to raise $15 billion over the next five years, in part to pay for expanding medical coverage to uninsured children. The Senate bill also calls for the proceeds of the child credit for children ages 13 to 16 to be placed in a special education savings account, a requirement not included in the House bill.
The attempt to raise cigarette taxes is shaping up as a major battle. The Administration said tonight that it would support an effort by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to raise the tax by 43 cents a pack in order to cover additional uninsured children. But tobacco-state lawmakers are fighting hard to have even the 20-cents-a-pack increase stripped out of the Senate bill or deleted from the final legislation during the conference to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions.
While small relative to overall tax revenues, the reductions contained in both the House and Senate bills are substantial by the standards of an era in which bringing the Federal budget deficit under control has become an overriding priority for both parties.
But the debate on the House floor today highlighted the deep philosophical and political differences between the parties on how the tax cuts should be apportioned and more generally on taxes as a barometer for the scope of the Federal Government.
Republicans argued that tax cuts should go to those who pay the most in Federal income taxes and who help the overall economy by investing and saving. Democrats took the position that cutting taxes is an opportunity to help working people at the bottom of the income scale who are struggling to become secure members of the middle class.
The bill's chief author, Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the Ways and Means Committee, said the vote was an opportunity for Republicans to reverse years of tax increases and begin reining in Washington's influence on economic and social issues.
"For too many years taxes went up, spending went up and the size and power of Washington Government went up," Mr. Archer said. "It's time for Washington to tax less so the American people can do more."
Mr. Archer said 76 percent of the bill's benefits would go to people making $75,000 a year or less. Saying tax relief should go to those who shoulder most of the tax burden, Mr. Archer said, "This plan is dedicated to America's forgotten middle-income taxpayers."
Of the Democrats arguing against his bill, Mr. Archer said, "Their fingers remain stuck deep in the wallets of middle-income Americans, trying to take from one citizen in order to give to another."
Democrats pressed their case that the bill was written primarily to benefit those people who already have wealth or savings, and not those who are working just to make ends meet. They said reductions in capital gains taxes, the expansion of the Individual Retirement Account and other provisions of the bill would do little to help families making $30,000 or less.
"Everyone is for tax cuts," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader.
"The question is, who gets the cuts?" Mr. Gephardt said, citing an analysis by the Treasury Department saying that 67.9 percent of the benefits of the House bill would go to the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers and that 19.3 percent of the benefits would go to the top one percent.
"The lion's share should go to hard-working middle-income families," Mr. Gephardt said.
In particular, Democrats said, the bill unfairly excludes from eligibility for the child credit many working families whose Federal income tax bills are already reduced by the earned income tax credit. They said the burden of other payroll taxes on those families is so heavy that they need and deserve the $500 per child credit at least as much as families who make more and have bigger Federal income-tax liabilities.
"The people on the other side think people who work for low incomes are asking for welfare," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.

Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK: Major Provisions of House Tax-Cut Bill"
Here are the major provisions of the bill passed by the House yesterday providing about $85 billion in tax breaks. The Senate was still debating the proposed legislation and hoped to vote today on its version of the bill, which is similar to the House measure in the major elements. The Senate has included a 20-cent per pack increase in the Federal cigarette tax that is not in the House version. And the House would allow capital gains to be reduced to reflect increases caused by inflation.
 
TAX CREDITS FOR CHILDREN
Would provide a credit of up to $500 per child up to age 17, phased out for couples filing jointly with incomes above $110,000. The credit would be $400 next year, rising to $500 the next year. Many lower- and middle-income families who already claim the earned income tax credit or the dependent-care credit would not receive the full child credit.
 
COLLEGE EDUCATION
For the first two years of college, a tax credit of up to 50 percent of $3,000 in tuition and book costs would be offered, after accounting for financial aid. Would provide deductions of up to $10,000 a year for college costs when money is saved through several varieties of savings plans. Would allow penalty-free withdrawals from I.R.A.'s for college and graduate school.
 
CAPITAL GAINS
Would reduce the top rate to 20 percent from 28 percent for individuals making more than $24,650 and couples making more than $41,200, and set a bottom rate of 10 percent. Would allow investors to factor out the effects of inflation in calculating gains starting in 2001. Would allow profits on sale of a primary home to be exempted up to $500,000 for couples filing jointly, $250,000 for single filers. Would reduce the top corporate rate to 30 percent from 35 percent.
 
RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS
Would create a new form of I.R.A. open to taxpayers, regardless of income level. Contributions would not be tax deductible, but would accrue interest tax free and could be withdrawn tax free after retirement or for purchase of a first home.
 
INHERITANCE TAXES
Would increase the exemption from Federal estate taxes to $1 million from $600,000 by 2007. (pg. A22)

HEADLINE: Whitman Gets Auto Plan in Final Session

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 26

 BODY:
The State Legislature sent an auto insurance bill to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's desk today that would eliminate the automatic rate increases scheduled to cost the average New Jersey driver at least $30 a year more and would end the surcharges some drivers are forced to pay after minor accidents or traffic tickets.
But because the bill would do little to reduce the actual cost of insuring New Jersey's 4.5 million drivers, most motorists would probably see little or no relief from the nation's highest premiums, which now average $1,013 a driver. In fact, the bill would do much less than the Governor first proposed last January. 
 The latest annual automatic rate increase, of at least 3 percent, was scheduled to go into effect on July 1. But insurance company executives expect dozens of companies to apply for increases by year-end. Insurers would still be allowed to ask state regulators for permission to raise rates each year to account for inflation and earn a profit.
Tens of thousands of drivers in the state now pay surcharges on their premiums for traffic tickets and accidents when they are at least partly at fault.
Those surcharges would be dropped in the next year. But they would be replaced by a new tiered system that rates drivers by their driving records. And insurers say some good drivers could end up paying more than they do now.
The bill prevents insurance companies from dropping drivers without cause.
The Legislature, in its final session before the summer recess, also took action on several other major bills.
Legislators voted along party lines to give final approval to a $16.8 billion budget for the new fiscal year, starting July 1, that includes more money than Governor Whitman originally proposed for state colleges, child protective workers and school construction projects.
New Jersey's Senate, by an overwhelming margin, passed bills that would cut the tax rate on sales of electricity and gas by 45 percent over six years but assure that the state's 567 communities dependent on that tax would not be hurt.
Auto insurance dominated much of the debate during the voting sessions of both the Assembly and the Senate, which went well into the night.
Insurance companies said today that they could not provide specific estimates of how auto rates would change since state regulators must still write regulations to enact the bill, which Governor Whitman is expected to sign.
This afternoon, Mrs. Whitman said the bill would result in a system that was fairer to motorists, with good drivers paying less and bad drivers paying more.
The Governor said she would continue to press for the more aggressive changes that she had proposed earlier this year but could not get enough support for in the two houses, even though both are controlled by her own party.
"More certainly needs to be done," she said. "I do not think the will is there at the present time. Just because we are all Republicans does not mean that we all think alike. The Legislature determined that this needs a lot more discussion."
Democrats, who called a news conference before the votes, charged today that Mrs. Whitman should have fought harder for more aggressive changes.
"The Governor's idea of reform is a charade," said State Senator James E. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate for governor. "It will do absolutely nothing to lower rates."
Mr. McGreevey and other Democrats introduced a bill today that would roll back rates by 10 percent on July 1, stop insurance companies from passing the cost of fraud onto their customers and create a special state prosecutor to handle fraud cases.
The Democrats called on the Legislature to reconvene this summer to consider their bill, but Republicans showed little interest in bringing the issue back during July or August, months when vacationing lawmakers rarely meet.
The bill also helps state justice officials prosecute people who insure their cars in New Jersey but live in New York City or Philadelphia, where high theft and accident rates have pushed premiums even higher than the average premium in New Jersey.
The bill would also give insurers incentives to sell more insurance policies in urban areas, which most companies now avoid, saying that they cannot charge high enough premiums to cover the losses there.
The legislation would crack down on fraud, which state regulators now believe accounts for as much as 20 percent of the cost of premiums.
 
Energy Tax
The Legislature also took action on energy tax legislation, which passed the Senate by a 37-to-1 vote. It would cut the tax rate on electricity and natural gas sales, now one of the nation's highest, to 7 percent, from 13 percent, by 2003. State officials say residents and businesses will receive a monthly savings in 2003 of 6 cents on each dollar spent on electricity and natural gas.
Governor Whitman proposed the change because New Jersey plans to deregulate energy sales by 2000 and open the state to out-of-state suppliers. The current energy tax, known as the Gross Receipts and Franchise Tax, cannot legally be applied against out-of-state suppliers. The new tax, starting next Jan. 1, would consist of a 6 percent sales tax, a 1 percent tax on corporate net income and a transitional tax that starts at 6 percent next year and then is phased out by 2003.
Under the new system, revenues from energy sales are to decline from $1.1 billion this year to $798 million in 2003.
Governor Whitman also wants to use the lower tax as a lure to new industry and business. The municipal aid in the bill eased fears that local budgets and taxpayers would suffer from the changes.
After local governments grumbled recently about the state's initial offer of $730 million a year from the revised tax, legislative leaders and the Whitman administration increased the aid from $730 million this year to $740 million in 1998. The aid will increase by $5 million a year until it is capped at $755 million in 2001. The distribution formula passed on a vote of 38 to 1.
The aid is critical to the state's municipalities because it is their second-biggest single source of revenue, after local property taxes.
It comes from taxes that electrical, gas and other utility companies pay to the state for their wires, pipes, poles, transformer stations and other equipment around the state.
 
Abortion Procedure Ban
 The day was also notable for what votes were not cast. It was widely expected that both the Assembly and Senate would vote to override Governor Whitman's conditional veto of legislation that would ban an abortion procedure known to its opponents as "partial birth" abortion.
But while there were enough votes in the Assembly to override the Governor's veto easily, the Senate was one vote short.
Lawmakers have until Jan. 13, 1998, to act on the Governor's conditional veto, which she issued on Monday.

HEADLINE: Observer;
Acute Outrage Failure

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
My outrage generator is out of order. Hard as I try to work up a full head of outrage about the tobacco industry, I cannot. It is alarming. Being outraged about big tobacco is the duty of every decent American just now. I cannot manage it.
On the other hand, I become purple with outrage when someone writes a sentence that begins, "On the other hand . . ." 
 You see what I mean: malfunctioning outrage generator. Not a drop of steam sizzling off the top of the skull about those vile tobacconists, but red-hot pedantic rage about flabby diction.
And what is my response to matters every decent American has a duty to smile upon? Outrage. Inappropriate outrage. The rich-voter-friendly tax cut now being planned by President Clinton and the Congress, for instance, produces only a sullen outrage.
It brings to mind H. L. Mencken, who, while listening to Chopin, was reminded of "two embalmers at work on a minor poet." The minor poet on whom the morticianly Clinton and Congress are at work is the American body politic.
"The body politic is dead?" you ask. You have to be dead, at least between the ears, to believe cutting taxes will balance a budget. Well, Americans have believed it again and again ever since Ronald Reagan's great tax cut of 1981 was followed by the most astounding deficit in history.
Being outraged about this subject embarrasses me. Nobody else is outraged. Everybody is delighted to hear that the trick to paying the nation's overdue bills is to have less income.
My outrage problem may be grave. The generator seems to work only when it detects an onset of serious silliness.
Look at the case of the vile tobacconists, for whom I feel no outrage whatever. They were just another group of consumer-goods peddlers who used modern salesmanship methods to get people hooked on their product. We are asked to find them uniquely hateful because they used their wiles on children.
Struggling to achieve outrage, I end up asking why we should confine our anger to the tobacco set. Shouldn't we despise with equal fervor all consumer-goods salesmen who use modern advertising guile to make children crave their goods?
Dozens of different businesses are conditioning toddlers to lust for junk food, junk toys and just plain junk. Why is no one outraged by the Pied TV Pipers of Christmas and Saturday morning?
Unhealthy though tobacco is, common sense harnessed to a little will power can break its grip. Addiction to a life spent acquiring unnecessary consumer goods, however, may be just as destructive as a cigarette habit, and even harder to shake. Who has not recoiled from appalling scenes of tertiary acquisition fever played each day in the shopping malls of America?
See the problem? I am outraged because nobody is outraged about something I think should outrage everybody as thoroughly as tobacco outrages them.
So back to Washington's cockamamie tax cut: I am outraged because nobody else is outraged about politicians for thinking us dumb enough to believe we can pay overdue bills by earning less money.
Outrage oozes from every pore when these duplicitous embalmers say tax cuts for the champagne classes are needed to encourage investment and spark business activity. I have to fight a childish impulse to ask hasn't anybody heard about Wall Street's big bull market deluging people with money.
I am foolishly outraged about a government, which having just refined the welfare law to deny paupers' tots a pot of beans, now plans to give boxcar-lots of money to the well heeled in the form of tax cuts. Considering the rate at which Wall Street is pumping money to them, wouldn't it make more sense -- if we really think a balanced budget important -- to raise their taxes instead of cutting?
This is foolish of me. Childish nonsense. Economic ignorance. Liberal elitist idiocy. Outdated humanitarianism. I am ashamed to have an antique, broken-down, malfunctioning, dysfunctional outrage generator that cranks up such pap, twaddle, piffle, drivel, poppycock, balderdash and malarkey.
I shall have it replaced. Then I shall enjoy fuming with righteous anger about the truly serious outrages that every decent American has a duty to be outraged about, if only to divert his attention from matters of genuine gravity.

HEADLINE: Mario G. Salvadori, Engineer And Inner-City Teacher, 90

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
Mario G. Salvadori, an engineer whose passion for structures was equaled only by his devotion to teaching about them, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 90 and lived in Manhattan.
At his death, Dr. Salvadori was honorary chairman of the engineering firm of Weidlinger Associates and the James Renwick Professor Emeritus of Engineering and a Professor Emeritus of Architecture at Columbia University. He was best known in his last years, however, for his determination to use the principles of architecture and engineering as a way of teaching science and math to inner-city students. 
 Responding to a call for volunteers in the New York City public schools in 1975, Dr. Salvadori, then 68, taught a junior high school class in Harlem. His success at explaining complex structural concepts through such real-world examples as how bridges and skyscrapers are built led him to develop his ideas into a formal curriculum, which ultimately became the basis of the Salvadori Educational Center on the Built Environment, now based at City College. The nonprofit center trains teachers and supervises the use of Dr. Salvadori's curriculum in more than 25 schools in the South Bronx, Harlem and elsewhere.
Dr. Salvadori, a lifelong pacifist, had a gentle, patient manner that belied his stature as one of the world's leading structural engineers. He took particular delight in encouraging inner-city students to build models of buildings and bridges out of ordinary materials like toothpicks and string, and would even encourage them in class to set up economies in play money to teach them about the economics of structure as well as the physics of it. He showed the students how to make arches out of folded paper, startling them by revealing that the paper could be strong enough to support several bricks.
"I teach them why buildings stand up -- that is, the basic principles of architectural structures, which is also the subject of my first-year course in architecture at Columbia," Dr. Salvadori wrote in 1981. "To my surprise, the children seem to absorb the ideas better and quicker than do my university students. Their enthusiasm is unbounded and their questions come like bullets from a machine gun."
In a speech in 1990 at the International Design Conference in Aspen, Colo., he asked: "Are children capable of influencing the environment? I believe the answer to this question to be a resounding yes, on one condition: that they be empowered to understand, appreciate and wish to modify that environment."
In 1993, when Dr. Salvadori received the Hoover Medal, given jointly by the nation's engineering societies, Jonathan F. Fanton, president of the New School, said of him: "He is shattering myths about how science and math must be taught, how inner-city children learn and what they are capable of learning." Dr. Fanton concluded: "He has made the teaching of engineering a humanitarian art in itself."
Unlike many engineers who think in purely mathematical terms, Dr. Salvadori was a scientist who constantly sought ways to connect his craft to art and society. He designed the concrete structural system for Eero Saarinen's CBS Building in Manhattan, among many other celebrated buildings.
"His main concern was that great architecture be achieved," the architect Eugene Kohn said of Dr. Salvadori in 1995. "Some engineers say you can't do this or that, but Mario never did. In my view, he's on a par with Louis Kahn or Paul Rudolph."
Mr. Salvadori was born on March 19, 1907, in Rome and was reared in Genoa and in Spain. His father was an engineer, but Mario hoped to become a concert conductor, and in 1925, at 18, he established what he later said was Italy's first student jazz band.
Dissuaded by his parents from a musical career, he received two doctorates from the University of Rome, one in civil engineering and the other in mathematics. An outspoken critic of Mussolini's Fascist regime -- he later said that his exposure to Fascism helped inspire him to seek more creative and open teaching methods with children -- he left Italy in 1939 for the United States. Through a contact established by his parents, he first worked as a time-and-motion engineer at Lionel Trains in New Jersey.
His interest in teaching was already apparent, however, and by 1940 he joined Columbia as a temporary faculty member, the beginning of a 50-year association with the university. He was appointed a full professor in 1959.
For three years he worked as a consultant to the Manhattan Project, unaware, he said later, that his research was connected to the atomic bomb. In 1945, Dr. Salvadori joined with Paul Weidlinger, who had recently established an engineering firm in New York. While his name was never on the door, for many years he was the firm's most prominent presence, serving as a consultant until 1960, as a partner from 1960 to 1991, and then as honorary chairman.
At Weidlinger he established a particular expertise in the analysis of structural failure. While he helped design numerous new buildings, Dr. Salvadori was often called in as a forensic engineer, investigating building failures in situations ranging from design and construction errors to earthquakes.
Dr. Salvadori is survived by his wife, Carol; a son, Vieri; a stepson, Michael Kazan, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Early '97 Growth Is Lifted a Bit, to 5.9%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
The economy grew in the first quarter at a slightly faster pace than previously estimated, and inflation remained in check, the Commerce Department said today.
Growth in corporate profits was revised downward. 
 Gross domestic product, the nation's output of goods and services excluding foreign income, rose at a 5.9 percent annual rate in the quarter, faster than the 5.8 pace reported earlier. The expansion was the fastest in nearly a decade. The economy grew at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1996.
Today's revision, which matched analysts' expectations, "mainly reflects an upward revision to net exports that offsets a downward revision to inventory investment," said Steve Landefeld, director of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. The improvement in net exports came as imports turned out to be lower than initially estimated, Mr. Landefeld said.
Business inventories grew by $48.6 billion in the quarter, down from the previously estimated $51.4 billion. Real final sales, which exclude the effects of inventory changes, rose 4.1 percent; the rise had been previously put at 3.8 percent.
After-tax corporate profits rose 3.5 percent, slower than the 4.5 percent gain reported earlier. Profits from current production, meantime, rose 6.3 percent, the largest gain since an 8.5 percent rise in the third quarter of 1985.
Growth in inflation-adjusted earnings was revised upward, to a 4.1 percent rate from 3.8 percent.
The G.D.P. price deflator, a measure of price increases followed by Wall Street, showed prices accelerated at a 2.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter, unchanged from the previous report.
In the current quarter, which ends Monday, growth probably slowed to an annual rate of 2 percent or less as consumer spending wound down and unsold goods piled up in stores and warehouses, analysts have said.
The slowdown and the subuded inflation suggest Federal Reserve policy makers will refrain from raising interest rates at their two-day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Uncertainties For Dollar: Trade, Euro, U.S. Growth

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The combined weight of a strong economy, low inflation and comparatively high interest rates in the United States buttressed the dollar for much of the first half of the year, helping it continue a rally in which it climbed back from historic lows.
Yet after reaching a four-and-a-half-year high against the Japanese yen in early May, the dollar has reversed course, falling about 10 percent, and it has stumbled in its ascent against European currencies. 
 Although many of the positive fundamentals remain in place, three big uncertainties -- the trade deficit with Japan, the outlook for European currency union and the United States economy -- have weighed on the dollar after its rebound, and currency traders and analysts expect these factors to continue to play critical roles for the rest of the year.
"Six months ago I was very bullish on the dollar," said Russell LaScala, chief spot dealer for Citibank in New York. "And I thought the trend would continue. But the follow-through has been disappointing."
In part, it is the dollar's strength, notwithstanding the recent gyrations, that is responsible for the questions. Yesterday, though there was little economic news, the dollar rose strongly. It continued its uneven gains against the mark, rising to 1.7387 marks, from 1.7256 on Thursday. Its last close that high came in February 1994. The dollar traded at 114.55 yen, up from 113.15 yen.
Through yesterday, an index compiled by J. P. Morgan shows that on a trade-weighted basis the dollar has appreciated by more than 4 percent against the currencies of 12 major industrial countries. A broader measure, which covers about 30 currencies, shows that the dollar has risen by just under 4 percent.
After those gains, it is perhaps not surprising that the dollar has stumbled a bit, particularly given the rise in the closely watched United States trade deficit with Japan. It has been widening as Japanese goods have become less expensive here, possibly causing a resurgence of trade tensions.
Uncertainty about the prospects for European monetary union, which buffeted the dollar in the first half, could continue to send it higher or lower depending on the market's perceptions of the strength or weakness of the planned currency, the euro.
Finally, the outlook at home is clouded, too, as the economy shows signs of slowing from a pace at which it has clearly outpaced its main trading partners and fueled the demand for dollars.
"Over all, the main thing underlying the dollar's performance is that the United States economy has been outperforming economies in the rest of the world, in terms of growth and employment generation, most notably compared with Germany and Japan," said Ron Leven, global currency strategist at J. P. Morgan.
"Also, interest rates have been rising in this country, and have remained very low elsewhere," making dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
Mr. Leven predicted that the dollar would strengthen in the second half, particularly against the yen, largely because he believes that the economy, which has slowed in the second quarter, will expand at a 4 percent rate on average in the third and fourth quarters. That sort of growth will prompt the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point by the end of the year, he predicted.
A number of other analysts said they, too, were expecting further tightening moves from the Fed, though perhaps not as soon as at next week's meeting of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee.
"It seems to us that the Fed will not move until August," said Jim O'Neill, chief currency economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "And unless we see some strength in upcoming employment numbers, they might wait until the fourth quarter."
Unlike Mr. Leven at J. P. Morgan, Mr. O'Neill said he expected the dollar to fall further, particularly against the yen.
"The single most important determinant of a currency's value is the balance of payments, and the United States balance-of-payments deficit is still 2 percent of gross domestic product," he said. "If it were not for that factor, the dollar would be stronger than it is."
Unlike other analysts, who said they saw the recent widening in Japan's trade surplus with the United States as temporary, Mr. O'Neill and others said they did not expect it to narrow. Over the next 12 months, Mr. O'Neill said he expected the yen to appreciate 5 to 6 percent against the dollar.
"Trade and exports are the only source of strength in the Japanese economy at the moment," he said. "Japan is trying to export its way out of trouble, as it has in the past."
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research organization, also views America's trade deficit as a major impediment to sustained strength in the dollar.
"There is a direct conflict between short-term fundamentals, which are bullish for the dollar, and the longer-term ones, which are bearish," he said. "I think there is a shift going on, and that this is likely to be a bearish period for the dollar."
The subject of Japan's widening trade surplus prompted some political sniping at the recent Group of Seven economic meeting in Denver, and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan provoked a mini-meltdown in the stock market last Monday when he suggested that Tokyo might sell its holdings of United States Treasury securities unless Washington moved to stabilize the dollar-yen exchange rate.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister subsequently said Mr. Hashimoto's remarks had been misinterpreted. But Mr. Leven of J. P. Morgan said the rhetoric on both sides masked an underlying fact: For the foreseeable future, against a backdrop of relative prosperity, the dollar is not likely to be an important political topic in the United States.
"This is not an issue for the United States," he said. "For that to happen unemployment would have to be a lot higher than it is." In addition, he said, a relatively strong dollar is one more argument against an increase in interest rates, because it helps dampen inflation. "And the public is happy when interest rates are lower than they might otherwise be," Mr. Leven said.
By contrast, political concerns will likely be a dominant theme in Europe as it struggles with the plan to adopt the single currency.
And while currency market participants seem to believe that members of the European Union remain on track to achieving monetary union on schedule beginning in 1999, the recent Socialist Party victory in France, coupled with political developments in Germany, has shaken confidence a bit. The Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a main proponent of the single currency, has found it difficult to reconcile its own worsening budget situation with the strict fiscal criteria of the currency plan.
Some analysts said that uncertainty about monetary union could benefit the dollar, as investors turned to it as a haven. But setbacks for the currency plan could also lead to a strengthening of the German mark, traditionally the strongest European currency.

HEADLINE: Late Selling Curbs a Rally; Dow Up 33.47

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market ended a jittery week the way it began: erratically.
The market rallied strongly in the morning, with the help of falling interest rates. In the late afternoon, however, a sharp selloff erased most of those gains. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, up nearly 117 points at 2:13 P.M., ended the day with a gain of just 33.47 points, at 7,687.72. For the week, the Dow lost 108.79 points, or 1.4 percent.
"It was almost as if someone flipped off a switch at 2 P.M.," said Art Hogan, an equity trader at Morgan Stanley, referring to the late afternoon selloff. "We gave it a run, but there were just no players in the last couple of hours."
Broader indexes also held onto slim gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.62 points, to 887.30, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.77 points, to 1,438.15.
Considering how the week began, though, the market finished with just minimal losses. On Monday, the Dow fell 192 points in its worst loss of the year after reports that the Bank of Japan was considering large sales of American Treasury securities.
A day later, when such reports were discounted by Japanese officials, the markets shot back up, with the Dow climbing 153 points.
The remainder of the week was not much different. In fact, each session saw a 100-point swing in the Dow, the first week that has ever happened.
Much of the volatility was related to worries about a soaring market. Since its low on April 11, the Dow has risen nearly 1,300 points, or 20.3 percent. But analysts also said that increased volatility might be related to heavy trading as the end of the second quarter approaches on Monday.
"This has been an odd week because you have end-of-the-quarter window dressing and a lot of program trading," said Hildegard Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential Securities.
In "window dressing," portfolio managers sell their losers and buy winners to create the impression of a more successful portfolio.
And with a large majority of portfolio managers underperforming the S.& P. 500 index, it is not surprising that activity was heavy this week, analysts said. Yesterday, however, volume on the New York Stock Exchange was lighter than it has been recently, at 472.5 million shares.
Issues with gains edged out those with losses by nearly 2 to 1.
Although many analysts express fears that the market is pricey, many also say stocks will trend higher, partly because of the heavy cash inflows into mutual funds.
That has led some strategists to revise their year-end forecasts. For instance, William LeFevre, an analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, is now projecting 8,250 on the Dow at year-end, up from his earlier forecast of 7,000.
Part of the reason is that inflation jitters have subsided, and few analysts believe Federal Reserve officials will raise short-term interest rates when they meet next week.
"The absence of a Fed tightening and fresh money flowing into the market is going to keep this thing going," Mr. LeFevre said.
The Dow was led yesterday by Procter & Gamble, up 2 13/16, to 139 5/16, and Caterpillar, up 2 3/8, to 108. Allied Signal gained 1 1/2, to 84.
Shares of Mercantile Stores Inc. soared yesterday, up 7 3/16, to 63 15/16, a 52-week high, after Business Week reported that the retailer had rejected a takeover bid from Federated Department Stores. Federated was said to have offered $75 a share.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Gold at 4-Year Low
 (Bloomberg News) -- Gold prices fell to a four-year low yesterday. The futures contract for August delivery was down $3.90, to $335.90 an ounce, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest since March 29, 1993.
On other markets, wheat and corn fell. Wheat was at its lowest price in almost three years amid signs of a bumper crop.
Soft red winter wheat for July delivery fell 7.25 cents, to $3.2575 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest for a contract closest to delivery since July 1994.
Corn for December delivery, representing the fall harvest, lost 3 cents, to $2.355 a bushel. July corn tumbled 4 cents, to $2.4625 a bushel, the lowest for a contract closest to delivery since March 1995.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
The Opium War's Secret History

BYLINE: By KARL E. MEYER 

 BODY:
Losers rarely name wars, an exception being the conflict between Britain and China from 1839 to 1842, known bluntly ever since as the Opium War. To most Chinese, a century of humiliation began with this war, in which Westerners sought to force a deadly drug on an Asian people, and then imposed an unequal treaty that pried open their country and annexed the island that became Hong Kong.
In embarrassing truth, that is essentially what happened. As Hong Kong reverts to China at month's end, many of us for the first time may see a bit of history from a different end of the telescope. Yet a further point needs making. Even the authors of the Opium War were ashamed of it, and Western protests against it marked the beginning of a concern with international human rights that in a fresh turn embarrasses today's leaders in Beijing. 
 Along with the slave trade, the traffic in opium was the dirty underside of an evolving global trading economy. In America as in Europe, pretty much everything was deemed fair in the pursuit of profits. Such was the outlook at Russell & Company, a Boston concern whose clipper ships made it the leader in the lucrative American trade in Chinese tea and silk.
In 1823 a 24-year-old Yankee, Warren Delano, sailed to Canton, where he did so well that within seven years he was a senior partner in Russell & Company. Delano's problem, as with all traders, European and American, was that China had much to sell but declined to buy. The Manchu emperors believed that the Middle Kingdom already possessed everything worth having, and hence needed no barbarian manufactures.
The British struck upon an ingenious way to reduce a huge trade deficit. Their merchants bribed Chinese officials to allow entry of chests of opium from British-ruled India, though its importation had long been banned by imperial decree. Imports soared, and nearly every American company followed suit, acquiring "black dirt" in Turkey or as agents for Indian producers.
Writing home, Delano said he could not pretend to justify the opium trade on moral grounds, "but as a merchant I insist it has been . . . fair, honorable and legitimate," and no more objectionable than the importation of wines and spirits to the U.S. Yet as addiction became epidemic, and as the Chinese began paying with precious silver for the drug, their Emperor finally in 1839 named an Imperial Commissioner to end the trade.
Commissioner Lin Tse-hsu proceeded to Canton, seized vast stocks of opium and dumped the chests in the sea. This, plus a melee in which drunken sailors killed a Chinese villager, furnished the spark for the Opium War, initiated by Lord Palmerston, the British Prime Minister, and waged with determination to obtain full compensation for the opium. The Celestial Empire was humbled, forced to open five ports to foreign traders and to permit a British colony at Hong Kong.
But as noteworthy, the war was denounced in Parliament as "unjust and iniquitous" by 30-year-old William Ewart Gladstone, who accused Palmerston of hoisting the British flag "to protect an infamous contraband traffic." The same outrage was expressed in the pulpit and the press, in America and England, thereby encouraging Russell & Company and most other American businesses to pull out of the opium trade.
Warren Delano returned to America rich, and in 1851 settled in Newburgh, N.Y. There he eventually gave his daughter Sara in marriage to a well-born neighbor, James Roosevelt, the father of Franklin Roosevelt. The old China trader was close-mouthed about opium, as were his partners in Russell & Company. It is not clear how much F.D.R. knew about this source of his grandfather's wealth. But the President's recent biographer Geoffrey Ward rejects efforts by the Delano family to minimize Warren's involvement.
The family's discomfort is understandable. We no longer believe that anything goes in the global marketplace, regardless of social consequences. It is precisely this conviction that underlies efforts to attach human rights conditions to trading relations -- to temper the amorality of the market -- a point that, alas, seems to elude the Socialist soon-to-be masters of Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Climb as a Fed Move Is Doubted

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices rose yesterday for the first time in three days amid optimism that Federal Reserve policy makers would refrain from raising interest rates at their meeting next week.
Traders also awaited a number of economic reports -- including the June employment report, to be released on Thursday -- for more clues about the strength of the economy and prospects for a rate increase in the months ahead. 
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32, to 98 14/32, or $5 for a $1,000 bond. Its yield fell 4 basis points, to 6.74 percent.
Bond prices were aided by a Federal Reserve move to buy $1.405 billion of securities to add reserves to the banking system in a so-called coupon pass. The Fed bought Treasuries maturing between Aug. 15, 2002, and Jan. 15, 2027 -- a broader range of maturities than had been expected by analysts and traders.
"The coupon pass was more aggressive than most people expected," and that helped bolster bond prices, said Will Jarosak, a trader at Fuji Securities Inc.
Another factor in yesterday's gains was the rise in the dollar's value that came after Japan forecast that industrial production would decline in coming months, damping expectations that interest rates there would rise anytime soon.
A stronger dollar increases the returns that foreign investors receive on Treasury securities when the proceeds are converted into other currencies.
Yesterday's gains snapped a two-day decline for Treasury bonds. They had fallen as the dollar weakened and a number of corporations, municipalities and other borrowers sold more than $9 billion of new debt. Issuance subsided yesterday, with only three borrowers, led by Bear, Stearns & Company, selling $700 million of debt.
Bonds also rose as some traders reversed short sales, or bets that prices would keep falling, Mr. Jarosak said. In a short sale, a trader borrows bonds and sells them, speculating that the bonds can be replaced later at a lower price, with the trader pocketing the difference. If bond prices rise, short-sellers usually start buying bonds immediately to stem their mounting losses.
Some traders said yesterday that they remained reluctant to enter the market ahead of next week's Fed meeting and the release of several important economic reports.
"Trying to set any rules with this many variables ahead could be detrimental," said Jim Somers, who manages $2.5 billion at Martindale Andres & Company in West Conshohocken, Pa.

HEADLINE: Health Panel Set to Attack Tobacco Deal

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration begins an intensive review of the proposed tobacco settlement, a panel of public-health experts is preparing to send the White House a detailed critique of the deal, demanding several significant changes in the terms of the agreement.
The panel, representing 23 public-health groups, is insisting that the deal be strengthened in seven areas, including Food and Drug Administration jurisdiction over tobacco products, disclosure of industry documents and the right to sue cigarette makers for punitive damages. 
 President Clinton appeared to agree that the proposed settlement would take away too much of the F.D.A.'s authority over tobacco.
"It was a terrific achievement," Mr. Clinton said of the agreement reached last week. "But my preliminary take is that we do not want to paralyze the capacity of the F.D.A. to protect the American people."
Under the agreement, if the F.D.A. wanted to require that cigarettes have less nicotine, it would have to prove that they would be safer and would not lead to a black market for high-nicotine cigarettes.
The pre-emptive strike by the health experts, led by Dr. David A. Kessler, a former Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and Dr. C. Everett Koop, a former Surgeon General, is a sign of the pressure that Administration officials will be under as they struggle to meet a 30-day deadline imposed by President Clinton to review the terms of the tobacco deal thoroughly and recommend changes.
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Bruce Reed, the President's chief domestic policy adviser, are directing the Administration review. At least 50 officials from 10 Government agencies will participate.
Today, at a White House briefing, they outlined the approach they intend to follow to scrutinize the complex tobacco proposal. Though they insisted that every aspect of the deal would be studied, it appeared clear that their mandate is to find a way to make the proposal acceptable to the President -- and not to kill it.
Ms. Shalala and Mr. Reed have created four task forces to look at what they consider the key elements of the deal: provisions affecting Federal regulation, industry payments, legal issues and the future of the cigarette companies.
Ms. Shalala called the proposal "a chance of a lifetime" to make dramatic strides in public health. She indicated a number of preliminary concerns with the plan, including a possible weakening of F.D.A. authority to regulate nicotine and a lack of clear enforcement mechanisms.
She said the goal of the review was to answer two fundamental questions: Does this proposal improve the public health? And at what cost?
But the White House is unlikely to endorse any settlement that is not approved by the the Koop-Kessler panel, which was appointed by Congress. And the group has already concluded that the costs extracted by the tobacco industry in 12 weeks of negotiations are too high.
In a draft of a letter to be sent to the White House next week, the group identified what it considered weaknesses in the proposed settlement. Two of the problems are potential "deal-breakers," an aide to the panel said today.
In addition to its concerns about F.D.A. power, the group will tell the White House that penalties that would be imposed on cigarette makers for failing to meet targets to reduce teen-age smoking should be two to three times higher than those in the agreement.
The deal calls for tobacco makers to pay a maximum of $2 billion a year if smoking by teen-agers fails to decline by prescribed amounts: 30 percent after five years, 50 percent after seven years and 60 percent after 10 years.
Unless the penalties and F.D.A. power are strengthened, the public-health groups will recommend that the deal be scrapped, said the aide, who insisted on anonymity.
The group also objected to the deal's level of financing for public-health initiatives and programs for quitting smoking, its lack of measures to curtail tobacco companies' overseas sales, its limits on disclosure of tobacco industry documents and its ban on class-action lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers.
"The letter will say that the panel has reviewed the settlement and in these areas has grave concerns," the aide said. "These are core principles and there is unanimity on them."

HEADLINE: In Vietnam, 'Hanoi Hilton' Brick Links Past and Future

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, June 27

 BODY:
Pete Peterson, the first American Ambassador to Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, gave the visiting Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, a precious gift today: a brick.
The brick, mounted on wood, is from the "Hanoi Hilton," where he spent more than six years as a prisoner of war, and which is now being turned into a luxury block of apartments and stores by a Singapore company. 
 "This brick is a symbol of a more brutal time," said Mr. Peterson, who arrived in Vietnam less than two months ago. "But it is also a stepping stone to a better future." Ms. Albright, visibly moved, said she would keep it in her office "as a sign of what we've been through and also of where we're going."
Standing alongside the former prisoner of war also gave Ms. Albright something else -- political cover.
Mr. Peterson, who was celebrating his 62nd birthday, is not only a highly decorated veteran and onetime P.O.W., but he is a Democrat, a former Representative from Florida, and his record of valor and endurance made it difficult for the Republican Party to block full normalization of relations with Vietnam and the exchange of ambassadors -- 22 years after the previous American Ambassador, Graham Martin, left the rooftop helipad of the previous American Embassy, in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
For Ms. Albright -- the first Secretary of State since then to visit Ho Chi Minh City, where on Saturday she will lay the cornerstone of an American consulate -- this is a trip about the future. Like former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who came to Hanoi in August 1995 to raise the American flag over the new embassy, she is trying to solidify a political and economic relationship with a Vietnam that has shed its Chinese and Russian allies and now joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, originally set up by Washington as a bulwark against Communism.
But given President Clinton's youthful opposition to the Vietnam War, in which he did not fight, any high-level visit to Vietnam has to address the problem of American servicemen -- 1,584 at last count -- who are still unaccounted for.
So Ms. Albright has spent as much time on the issues of Vietnamese cooperation in the $10 million a year American effort to achieve "the fullest possible accounting" of the missing as she has meeting senior Vietnamese officials to press for faster economic reform, a better climate for investment and more respect for dissent and religious freedom.
She had a long briefing this morning by the Joint Task Force that searches crash sites, along with the Vietnamese, to try to resolve the fate of the missing -- now centered on the remaining 48 of 196 priority cases listed in 1992, men who were reported to have been seen alive after their capture. The operation could go on for years, said Lieut. Col. Jonathan Chase, and ultimately a political decision would have to be made about what constitutes "the fullest possible accounting."
In her meetings today with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and the Communist Party leader, Do Muoi, all expressed sympathy for the American search and promised full assistance.
Ms. Albright then pressed ahead with the message the Vietnamese are happier to hear: "We have been able to normalize our political relations with Vietnam and exchange ambassadors and we now want to lay greater stress on normalizing and moving forward in our economic relationship."
To do that, she said, Vietnam has to reinvigorate its economic reforms, or "doi moi," which have lagged because of conservatism in the party, a divided leadership, corrupt bureaucrats and remaining central controls. These criticisms echo those of the leadership itself. "What is needed now is doi moi II," she said, just after signing a copyright agreement with Mr. Cam.
But Vietnamese leaders were less convinced by her argument that "economic and political openness are two sides of the same coin," and that they should relax curbs on political dissent and religious practice.
They did listen closely, however, American officials said, as she raised three specific cases of prisoners, two jailed for political dissent and one for religious practice, and asked for their speedy release and the possibility of family visits.
She said that for Washington to provide loans and loan guarantees to American companies, Washington had first to waive a Jackson-Vanik provision, requiring fair emigration. To do that, Vietnam has to live up to its promise to speed up exit permits for boat people seeking interviews with American officials in an effort to immigrate to the United States. While Vietnam had promised 1,500 exit permits a month from April on, so far only 359 permits have been processed this year, officials said.
More timely exit permits for about 7,000 cases left pending would likely produce the waiver, American officials said.
But to receive the normal trading status Vietnam seeks -- called "most favored nation status" -- Vietnam and Washington first have to negotiate a complicated trade agreement, which is far from ready. Washington submitted a draft to Hanoi three months ago; Hanoi has not yet responded.
Vietnam is having National Assembly elections next month, and the top leadership -- the conservative President, Le Duc Anh, 76, and the relatively more liberal Mr. Muoi, 80, and Mr. Kiet, 74 -- will not run. They will retain influential party posts, but the transition in the Government is not helping a speedy negotiation, a Vietnamese official said.
But as Ms. Albright made her own first visit to Vietnam, she basked in the symbolism of a new era, and in the presence of Mr. Peterson. For the future, she said, "there is no better guide as our journey unfolds than Ambassador Peterson, whose own journey from airman to P.O.W. to legislator to diplomat is an inspiration for Americans and Vietnamese alike."
For his part, Mr. Peterson said that the Vietnamese treat him like an old friend. "They approach me in the street like they know me really well, like they knew me in another life -- and maybe they did." As a prisoner, he said, he saw the worst of the Vietnamese and they saw the worst of him. Now it is time to see the best of one another.
"We're not talking 1975 anymore. We're talking 1997," he said. "I think it would be really helpful if Americans could see Vietnam as a country, and not a war, if in the American psyche, in the mindset, we could get to '97 and not '75."

HEADLINE: A Movement Is Born;
New Britain Puerto Ricans React to Report Revealing Bias

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

DATELINE: NEW BRITAIN, Conn.

 BODY:
For 28 years, Monserrate Rosado worked two jobs, making door hinges in a hardware factory in the morning and cleaning the floors of a hospital in the evening. In the whirlwind of his busy middle years, he also managed to learn English, graduate from high school at 40 and buy a modest house in this small city, 20 minutes from Hartford.
In four decades here, Mr. Rosado, who was born in Puerto Rico, never participated in politics. He simply voted and hoped for the best. 
 But two months ago, on a rainy afternoon, he and hundreds of others created an organization called Proud (Puerto Rican Organization for Unity and Dignity) to combat prejudice in New Britain.
The inspiration for the group was a report in which some New Britain business leaders blamed Puerto Ricans for the city's lack of economic progress. "The Hispanic population has poor language skills," the report said. "They have bad work habits. They're always late for jobs. They take off from work when they feel like it, and, as a consequence are very undependable." It also said Puerto Ricans "had poor family values and even poorer language skills."
The only solution for New Britain, the business leaders said, was to get rid of the Puerto Ricans who clog the city's public housing and strain its financial resources.
The report caused such a stir that three business leaders apologized for their comments, and two of them no longer hold leadership positions. Not content with the public acts of contrition, Puerto Ricans in New Britain sought outside help, calling the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, a national advocacy group based in New York, which has asked the Federal Government to investigate the handling of public money in New Britain.
Leaders of national advocacy and civil rights groups say that what is happening in New Britain reflects the current mood of Hispanic groups across the country. The quick and angry response, they said, is a common reaction when Hispanic immigrants, even those who are not immigrants, like Puerto Ricans, feel threatened by anti-immigrant and antiwelfare sentiments, and the laws that articulate them.
"The rhetoric that comes out of Congress filters down and this is what happens," said Juan Figueroa, president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. "People are tired of the rhetoric, they feel blamed for everything that's wrong with America and they are saying, 'Stop.' They want to set the record straight."
Many local political and business leaders were taken aback by the reaction to the report. Not because they thought the comments did not merit a strong response, they said, but because they did not know that their neighbors had such ability to turn anger into action so quickly.
"The strength of the reaction surprised me," said William W. Weber, a lawyer who used to lead the Downtown District Council. Mr. Weber was quoted in the report stressing that Puerto Ricans needed to learn English, a remark for which he has apologized. "That the report and the reaction created such unity in the community also surprised me. But sometimes, a lot of things come together and things happen, and I guess this is that time for them."
Mr. Rosado's anger is simpler to explain. New Britain, he said, is home. "Where am I going to go? Where are my children going to go? They were born here. Am I a financial strain to this city? I've done nothing but work."
Assigning blame is an old story in New Britain, a city of immigrants where the last ones to arrive have always been held responsible for shortcomings. It happened to the Irish, the Germans, the Italians and the Poles. It is now happening to Puerto Ricans.
The difference this time is that, with the continuing loss of jobs in the hardware industry, the city's decline has never been as stark.
Despite the efforts of the Chamber of Commerce, the Downtown District Council and the city's economic development arm, the downtown area remains deserted. Boarded-up storefronts hide turn-of-the century architectural jewels, and dilapidated buildings dot the once bustling streets. One day last month, the busiest spot was the sidewalk in front of a store where used work shirts were on sale for 50 cents apiece. Two men browsed through the merchandise.
Members of Proud said something else is different today. Because anti-immigrant sentiment is so prevalent, they said, some New Britain business leaders felt emboldened to vent private feelings that previously had been whispered among friends or communicated subtly, with a dismissive wave of the hand.
"You know what really hurts," said Jenny Correa, a school counselor born in New Britain 42 years ago who raised her three children here. "That those people would think that we are so unimportant, that we don't count, that they could just sit there and tell a researcher their most intimate, racist thoughts. We are all prejudiced, to a certain extent, but I can tell you that in my house we don't even allow any Polish jokes."
The report that so rattled this city was commissioned by Citizens for Action in New Britain, a local group seeking to discover the obstacles to New Britain's economic development. With that information, the group was hoping to rally residents to redevelop Arch Street, a particularly troubled downtown block.
A local researcher, William W. Hansen, was hired for the task by the Trinity Center for Neighborhoods, which is associated with Trinity College. Mr. Hansen identified many of the sources in the report, but left out the names of those he thought had made the most caustic comments. Later, when asked by a reporter from a local paper who had made the comments, Mr. Hansen revealed the names of all his sources, because, he said, they were never promised nor had they requested anonymity.
When the names became public, Hispanic people were irate. Demonstrations were staged throughout the city, heated meetings were held, doors were shut on both sides, and hastily, Proud was created.
Two months later, the anger has subsided somewhat, but not the issue. Beyond the apologies and the calls for respect, the Puerto Ricans say they want power. In a searing open letter to town leaders, members of Proud made 10 demands. They want to serve on public-financed boards and city commissions, and they want a voice in economic planning. They have already met twice with the Chamber of Commerce.
There is sense in this city that the report was a blessing in disguise. It brought Hispanic people together and forced the business community to take notice. Hispanic people, mainly Puerto Ricans, were 16 percent of the city's population in the 1990 Census, and local officials estimate that has since climbed to 25 percent.
Now, a committee of the Chamber of Commerce is studying how to attract Hispanic business owners to the chamber. Some business owners are starting to plan ways to attract Hispanic clients, said Kevin McCabe, the longtime chamber director.
"They have shown us that there is a strong purchasing power there," Mr. McCabe said. "And, given what they have done lately, I think, they ought to be a big voting bloc."
The increasing political sophistication of Puerto Ricans here, moving from anger to specific demands and, later, to active participation, is similar to what advocates are seeing among other Hispanic groups.
"It's like someone lit a keg and it is ready to go," said Lisa Navarrete, public information director of the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights organization. "I'm reminded of the movie 'Network,' when people opened their windows and shouted into the night, 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.' "
Ms. Navarrete pointed to last year's voting records (5.2 million Hispanic votes were cast in the Presidential election nationwide, a jump of more than a million from 1992) as an example of how eager Hispanic citizens are to have a voice in the political process.
In New Britain, at least two members of Proud have political aspirations beyond the city. William C. Rivera, a lawyer and the City Council's majority leader, has his sights set on Congress and plans to run for state senator next year. Edgardo Saavedra, a City Councilman, wants to run for state representative. Both are counting on support from the Puerto Rican community.
"It's like waking up a sleeping giant," said Mr. Saavedra, 33, an engineer, who has lived in New Britain since he was 7. "We have been taken for granted for too long. There is an awareness now of the size, potential and power of the Hispanic community."

Serb War Crimes Suspect Is Arrested in Slavonia
A Serb charged in the 1991 massacre of 261 patients in a Croatian hospital in Vukovar was arrested and taken to The Hague by investigators with the international tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. The arrest took place in Eastern Slavonia, a part of Croatia now administered by the United Nations, and was the first made by the tribunal's own investigators. 5 

Bosnian General Expelled
A Bosnian general was expelled from an elite United States Army training course after Administration officials heard unconfirmed accusations that he was a war criminal. Brig. Gen. Selmo Cikotic served as a field commander during the war in the Balkans until December 1994, when he went to Washington as the military attache at his country's embassy. 5
 
Political Leader Freed in Congo
Congo's leading opposition politician, Etienne Tshisekedi, was released after a night of detention that set off scattered disturbances throughout Kinshasa. Senior Government officials declined to comment on the reason for his arrest, but troops poured into the area when his supporters started to set fire to parked cars. 3
 
Glum End to U.N. Conference
The United Nations conference on the global environment ground to a close without concrete agreements on any of the critical issues of cutting emissions, protecting forests or increasing aid to poor nations. Razali Ismail, the Malaysian president of the General Assembly, lamented that the spirit of the conference in Rio in 1992 was gone. He said neither rich nor poor nations had shown real political will. 3

Supreme Court Rejects Key Provision of Brady Law
A bitterly divided Supreme Court ruled that the Brady gun control law violated "the very principle of separate state sovereignty" by requiring state officials to conduct background checks of prospective handgun buyers. The decision provided the strongest evidence yet of the ascension of state power at the Court, and was the third time in as many days that the Court overturned a major Federal statute. 1
 
Lawmakers in Congress who support gun control called the Court's decision a minor setback and said they would consider drafting legislation to require gun dealers to request criminal background checks on buyers. 1
 
Despite the Court's decision law enforcement officials in a majority of states will use local laws to continue to perform background checks on handgun buyers. 8
 
The Court ended its current term by laying the groundwork for a major debate over affirmative action when its next meets in October. The Justices agreed to decide whether a school district in Piscataway Township, N.J., violated the civil rights of a white high school teacher when it dismissed her to preserve the job of a black teacher with equal seniority. 9

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Major Tax Cut By Big Margin

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 27

 BODY:
The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to cut Federal taxes substantially for the first time since 1981, as many Democrats supported the bill and President Clinton expressed optimism about reaching a bipartisan compromise on the final legislation.
The legislation is similar in its broad outlines to a version passed by the House on Thursday on a largely party-line vote after a bitter debate. But the Senate bill contained enough compromises and specific provisions to woo Democrats and passed by 80 to 18, with 29 Democrats joining 51 Republicans voting in favor of it. Among those supporting the bill was the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
 After Congress returns next month from a one-week recess, House and Senate negotiators will meet, with Administration officials looking over their shoulders, to work out the differences between their bills and draft a final version to send to Mr. Clinton. The Administration has raised objections to the details of the main provisions in both bills, but Mr. Clinton suggested today that solutions were in reach on all of them.
"I'm frankly quite optimistic," Mr. Clinton said. "You would expect that all the parties would advance their views in the most vigorous way possible."
Although he has managed to set some limits on the scope of the cuts, Mr. Clinton has long since given in to the fundamental Republican demand for reductions in taxes for investors and middle-class families. Like the House, the Senate voted to give many families a $500-per-child tax credit and to reduce inheritance and capital gains taxes, all centerpieces of the Republican agenda since the party took control of Congress after the 1994 elections.
So Mr. Clinton is pressing Republicans to use the bill to address his priorities as well. He wants more generous tax breaks for college expenses than the House or Senate bill contains, and he wants to make more low-income families eligible for the child credit.
Saying that the full package of Republican cuts could lead to a resurgence of the Federal budget deficit in the long run, Mr. Clinton is demanding the removal of provisions whose costs mount rapidly in later years. Among them is a measure in the House bill that would allow taxpayers to subtract the effects of inflation in calculating capital gains on stocks, real estate and other investments.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has already begun discussions with Republicans, including Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chief author of the House tax bill, in an effort to narrow the differences between the two sides.
The tax cuts in both bills would total about $135 billion over five years. In both cases, the reductions would be paid for in part by new or extended taxes -- $50 billion worth in the House bill and about $55 billion worth in the Senate bill -- including levies on airline tickets and, in the case of the Senate bill, an increase in the Federal tax on cigarettes by 20 cents a pack, to 44 cents.
Although passage of the tax bills in the Republican-controlled Congress was a foregone conclusion, their approval this week, along with passage by both chambers of bills setting spending levels, marked a big step toward enactment of the balanced budget agreement reached last month by Congress and the Administration.
And despite the political and philosophical differences between the parties over both taxes and spending, the votes on the measures this week were the most practical manifestations yet of the uneasy bipartisanship maintained this year in an effort by both sides to put aside their bitter battles of the past few years.
"This is truly a celebration of a bipartisan effort," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader. "We kept our word to each other, and we kept our word to the American people."
Amid the self-congratulation after the vote, there were a few dissenting voices. Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, who was one of 14 Democrats who voted against the tax bill, said he was on the Senate floor in 1981 when the sweeping tax cut bill advocated by President Ronald Reagan was approved with only 11 dissenting votes.
Noting that the Reagan tax cuts had contributed to a huge surge in Federal budget deficits over the next decade, Mr. Bumpers said that those who voted against the tax bill today would be proved prudent, and that the money going to tax cuts would be better used to reduce the deficit.
"When the year 2002 rolls around, we will not have a balanced budget or anything close to it," Mr. Bumpers said.
Some of the four Republicans who voted against the bill, including Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, did so in opposition to the tobacco tax increase.
The tobacco tax included in the Senate bill is one of the biggest and most politically sensitive of the differences between the House and Senate bills. The $15 billion that the tax would raise over five years would help finance one of the provisions in the bill that attracted Democratic support, a commitment to spend an additional $8 billion, beyond the $16 billion provided for in other legislation, to offer medical coverage to uninsured children.
The House bill has no cigarette tax provision, and tobacco state lawmakers are certain to make an all-out push to keep the tax out of the final bill. The Administration not only supports the tax, but said this week that it would support efforts by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to increase the tax by 43 cents instead of the 20 cents in the Senate bill.
The details of the child credit are also certain to be hotly debated.
The Administration is insisting that the credit be made available to low-income working families that have to pay no Federal income tax after claiming the earned-income tax credit, which is intended to reduce the tax burden on the working poor.
House Republicans, who said that giving the credit to people who do not have to pay income taxes would be a form of welfare, are adamant in resisting the Administration.
Senate Republicans have already taken a step toward compromise by using a formula that would make more low-income families at least partially eligible for the child credit, although Administration officials said they would demand a more generous formula in the bill that emerges from the House-Senate conference.
Another provision of the child credit also seems certain to lead to a battle. The Senate bill, at the behest of several Democrats, requires that the proceeds of the credit for children age 13 to 16 be deposited in an educational savings account.
The House bill contains no such provision, and the requirement is strongly opposed by some of the most influential Republican constituencies, the religious right and other social conservatives.
"Our country is headed in the wrong direction when its leaders dictate exactly how each family must spend their money," said Gary L. Bauer, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative research and lobbying organization.
As it moved toward a final vote today, the Senate approved several amendments to the tax bill.
It passed a measure sponsored by Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, to increase the deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed.
Senator Paul Coverdell, Republican of Georgia, won approval for a provision that would allow penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts for private school tuition.
The Senate also approved an amendment sponsored by Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, that would create a tax credit of as much as 50 percent on as much as $150,000 of an employer's expenses to increase the supply of child care.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Tax Bills: How They Measure Up"
A comparison of the tax bill passed on Thursday by the House and the bill passed yesterday by the Senate. Negotiators from the two chambers will meet to work out the differences between the bills next month. They will work closely with the White House in an effort to insure that President Clinton will sign the final legislation, which would provide the first substantial Federal tax cut since 1981.
 
TAX CREDITS FOR CHILDREN
 
HOUSE: A credit of up to $500 per child up to age 17, phased out for couples filing jointly with incomes above $110,000 ($75,000 for single filers). The credit would be $400 next year, rising to $500 the following year. Many lower- and middle- income families who already claim the earned- income tax credit would not receive the full child credit. Cost: $71 billion over five years.
 
SENATE: A credit of up to $500 per child up to age 17 through 2002 starting next year, and then up to age 18, subject to the same income limits as the House bill. For children aged 13 to 16, the proceeds of the credit would have to be placed in an educa 2/3tional savings account modeled on an I.R.A. A $250 credit for the current tax year for children under 13. Would limit the credit for families claiming the earned-income tax credit, but would be less restrictive than the House bill. Cost: $84 billion over five years.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Supports a $500 credit, but wants more low- and moderate-income families to be eligible. Strongly opposes the language in the House bill. More supportive of Senate bill, but still insists on changes.
 
COLLEGE EDUCATION
 
HOUSE: Starting next year, for the first two years of college, a tax credit of up to 50 percent of $3,000 in tuition and book costs, after account 2/3ing for financial aid, phasing out for joint filers with incomes above $80,000 and for single filers with incomes above $40,000. Deductions of up to $10,000 a year for four years for college costs when money is saved through several varieties of savings plans. Would allow penalty-free withdrawals from I.R.A.'s for college and graduate school. Would extend through the end of this year the tax break for employer-provided educa 2/3tion payments, but would phase out the tax break for college employees who receive free or reduced tuition. Cost: $31 billion over five years.
 
SENATE: Starting next year, for first two years of college, a tax credit of up to 50 percent of $3,000 in tuition and book costs, after accounting for financial aid, or up to 75 percent of $2,000 for costs of community or technical colleges. Would make up to $2,500 a year in student loan interest payments deductible for five years. Would create educational savings accounts and allow penalty-free withdrawals from I.R.A.'s for college and graduate school. Would make permanent the tax break for employer-provided educational payments. Cost: $32.4 billion over five years.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Strongly urges a more generous version of the tax credit for the first two years of college. Wants the credit to be $1,500 per year and opposes Republican language that would allow the credit to be claimed only against tuition and book expenses after accounting for financial aid and student loans.
 
CAPITAL GAINS
 
HOUSE: Would reduce the top rate for individuals to 20 percent from 28 percent and set a bottom rate of 10 percent for people currently in the 15 percent income tax bracket (joint filers with incomes below about $41,000 or single filers with incomes below about $24,000). The reduced rates would be applied to all transactions on or after May 7. Would allow investors to subtract the effects of inflation in calculating gains starting in 2001. Would allow profits on sale of a primary home to be exempted up to $500,000 for couples filing jointly, $250,000 for single filers. Would reduce the top corporate rate gradually to 30 percent from 35 percent. Revenue gain of $2.7 billion through 2002, but then would cost $35 billion over 10 years.
 
SENATE: Would reduce the rates for individuals in the same way as the House bill, but would not allow indexing for inflation and would not reduce the corporate rate. The reduced rates would be applied to all transactions on or after May 7. Would include the same provisions as the House bill for sale of a home. Would also provide special capital gains reductions for small businesses and venture capital. Cost: $2.7 billion through 2002, rising rapidly to $25 billion over 10 years.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Strongly opposes the provision in the House bill that allows investors to subtract the effects of inflation. Has generally supported only limited capital gains tax reductions like the exemption on the sale of homes, but is unlikely to fight the rate reductions in the House and Senate bills.
 
RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS
 
HOUSE: Would create a new form of I.R.A. next year open to taxpayers regardless of income level. Contributions, limited to $2,000 a year plus an annual upward adjustment for inflation, would not be tax deductible, but would accrue interest tax free and could be withdrawn tax free after age 59 and a half or for buying of a first home. Cost: $33 million over 5 years, $13 billion over 10 years.
 
SENATE: Starting next year, would gradually double the current income limits on eligibility for traditional I.R.A.'s, to $100,000 for joint filers and $60,000 for single filers. Would allow penalty-free withdrawals of up to $10,000 for first-time home purchases or in the event of long-term unemployment. Would create new form of I.R.A. similar to those in the House bill. Cost: $3.3 billion over five years, $24 billion over 10 years.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Supports expansion of I.R.A. program but worries that the Republican proposals will be too costly in coming years.
 
INHERITANCE TAX
 
HOUSE: Would increase the exemption from Federal estate taxes to $1 million from $600,000 over 10 years, starting next year. Cost: $7.5 billion over five years, $27 billion over 10 years.
 
SENATE: Starting next year, would increase the exemption gradually to $1 million by 2006, and would provide an additional $1 million exemption for many family-owned businesses and farms. Cost: $6.1 billion over five years, $36 billion over 10 years.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Supports a more limited reduction in estate taxes, but is unlikely to fight for a significant scaling back of the House or Senate bill.
 
TOBACCO TAX
 
HOUSE: Contains no provision.
 
SENATE: Would increase the tax on cigarettes by 20 cents a pack, effective Oct.1, to 44 cents. About $8 billion of total revenues earmarked over five years to increase medical coverage for uninsured children. Revenue raised: $15 billion over five years.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Supports proposal by Senator Edward M. Kennedy to raise the tax by 43 cents a pack to provide further coverage for uninsured children.
 
AIRLINE TICKET TAX
 
HOUSE: Effective Oct.1, would reduce the current 10 percent tax on domestic flights to 7.5 percent, but would add a fee for every flight segment, starting at $2 and rising to $3 in 2002. The tax on international round trips would rise to $31 from $6. Revenue raised: $34 billion over five years and $82 billion over 10 years.
 
SENATE: Extends the current 10 percent domestic-flight tax, which would otherwise expire on Oct.1, and raises the tax on international round trips to $16 from $6. Revenue raised: $34 billion over five years and $78 billion over 10 years.
 
ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Extends the current 10 percent domestic-flight tax, which would otherwise expire on Oct.1, and raises the tax on international round trips to $16 from $6. Revenue raised: $34 billion over five years and $78 billion over 10 years.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: LAW ENFORCEMENT;
Period of Confusion Expected After Ruling on Brady Law

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court's decision overturning a crucial provision of the Brady law is expected to have the greatest effect in the 23 states that perform background checks on prospective gun buyers only because the law requires them to do so. And many of those states recently have been identified by law-enforcement officials as major sources for the guns used in crimes in other states.
Law-enforcement officials and crime experts interviewed yesterday said the ruling would create a period of much confusion in those states, where the decision whether to continue checking gun buyers will now be up to thousands of local police chiefs or sheriffs, or in some cases, to state police. 
 Some crime experts said they were particularly concerned about states with weak gun-control laws like South Carolina, Mississippi and Texas, which are among the major suppliers of guns to areas with stricter laws like the Northeast.
"We will now start to see economic competition between states whereby states that see selling guns as an attractive opportunity and provide a haven for traffickers will export more guns to other states," said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University.
Another fear is that some people barred by the Brady law from purchasing handguns will now be able to do so in the states without restrictive laws of their own. These include convicted felons, fugitives and people with mental illness. More than 250,000 people in these categories were stopped from buying guns since the law went into effect, according to Attorney General Janet Reno.
"This is really a shame," said Philip Cook, a professor of public policy at Duke University and an expert on illegal gun markets. "I think it is credible that putting this extra barrier to buying guns has helped reduce the homicide rate," he said, as violent crime has fallen sharply during the past five years.
In interviews, many sheriffs and police chiefs left no doubt that they support the key principles of the Brady gun-control law.
Despite the Court decision, law enforcement officials in 27 states will continue to perform background checks on handgun purchasers because of their state laws. And even many police chiefs in states without gun-control regulations say they will also continue making the checks.
"We're real committed to continuing with the background checks," said Ellen Hanson, the police chief of Lenexa in Kansas, which has no law requiring the checks. "To be real honest, it takes a lot less time to do a gun check than to do a homicide investigation."
Police support for Brady checks represents a dramatic change in attitudes from even a decade ago, when law-enforcement officers were often closely allied with the National Rifle Association. But the sharp rise in gun violence in the late 1980's and the N.R.A.'s opposition to any gun-control measures have made many police officers champions of restrictions on handgun sales.
"All of us have seen the devastation caused by guns and realized that some rational law should apply to gun ownership," said Gil Kerlikowske, the police commissioner of Buffalo and the president of Police Executive Research Forum.
But other law enforcement officers regard the background checks as too time consuming or an infringement on state's rights. They said they would now happily stop performing them.
"We can get back to our essential job, instead of shuffling Brady paper work," said Sheriff Jay Printz of Ravalli County, Mont., one of the two sheriffs who challenged the Brady law leading to yesterday's Court decision. "I think there will be no more gun checks in Montana, because Montana law prohibits local governments from regulating the purchase of firearms," said Sheriff Printz, a longtime member of the N.R.A.
In some states, where the Brady background checks have been performed by a statewide law enforcement agency rather than by local police, they may now be stopped altogether. In Ohio, for example, where the Brady checks have been done by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations and where there is no state law requiring background checks, Mark R. Weaver, a deputy attorney general, said the agency would stop doing the checks immediately.
State police officials in Arkansas and Kentucky, where there are also no state laws equivalent to the Brady law and the checks have been performed by the state police, said they had received no information yet on how to respond to the ruling, though a spokesman for the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division said it would continue doing checks.
Despite the ruling, David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, said he was optimistic that the decision would not have a far-reaching impact because of the variety of recent efforts to stop the flow of illegal guns. Among the most important of these is the increased tracing of guns seized in crimes by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
The Supreme Court's decision will also have no effect on another important policy, Mr. Kennedy noted, a move by the firearms agency to reduce the number of Federally licensed gun dealers to 110,272 today from 286,531 in 1993. Many of the dealers who have been closed down were so-called "kitchen dealers" selling small numbers of guns to buyers who would not have been able to obtain them legally.
The whole dispute over Brady checks is scheduled to become moot in November 1998 when the Federal Government is supposed to have in operation new technology to give gun dealers the means to instantly check any prospective buyer. The Court's decision did not affect that part of the Brady law.
But whether the technology will be effective, if people use false identification, for example, is uncertain.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "STATE BY STATE: To Check or Not to Check"
The Brady law's requirement, overturned yesterday by the Supreme Court, that state or local authorities check handgun buyers' backgrounds was intended as an interim measure. A national database, allowing gun dealers to perform instant background checks, is scheduled to go into operation in November 1998. And many states have their own systems for checking, so they are not subject to the law. Map/Chart shows states that were subject to the Federal requirement, states not subject to the Federal requirement because of existing state laws: background checks, permits or other system of approval and states that have adopted background checks or other systems since the passage of the Brady law in February 1994.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 26

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman today signed into law a $16.8 billion state budget that increases spending by $800 million over this year's, with most of the new money earmarked for public schools and dozens of modest programs aimed at appealing to a wide range of voters in this election year.
The budget for the new fiscal year, starting July 1, raises spending for almost every state agency and does not include new tax cuts, a departure from Governor Whitman's previous spending plans. Nor are layoffs of state workers planned. 
 The Governor used her power to veto individual items, striking out about $8 million, mostly for projects for which money had been allocated elsewhere in the budget. She left untouched most of the $40 million in pet projects of state legislators, with the exception of two items inserted by State Senator Robert E. Littell, the Sussex County Republican who heads the Budget and Appropriations Committee.
She took out two items for High Point State Park, in Mr. Littell's district: $16,000 for a trailer to carry forest fire equipment and $13,000 for a brush chipper. She also cut $1.8 million that Mr. Littell had placed in the budget to cover the costs of charity cases at Northwest Covenant Health Systems in Denville. Northwest Covenant runs three hospitals in his district.
Although Michael P. Torpey, chief counsel for the Governor, said politics had not played a role in the decision to cut the items, Mr. Littell was highly critical of Governor Whitman's plan to borrow for the state pension system. He at one point called it a "wacko idea."
Mr. Torpey today described the Governor's actions as "merit based." Mr. Littell declined to comment on whether he believed that the Governor was punishing him for not supporting her bond issue for closing a deficit in the state pension system.
The Legislature, which voted for the new budget along party lines after hours of debate on Thursday night, added almost $400 million to Governor Whitman's original proposal, mostly for public schools, state colleges and child-protection workers. More than half the additional money, $246 million, will go to the public schools. It was included after the State Supreme Court ordered the state last month to increase spending to help end the disparity between the richest and poorest school districts.
Governor Whitman's budget also increased spending in areas that are certain to appeal to Democratic and swing voters as she seeks a second term. After making cuts for three years at the State Department of Environmental Protection, she increased spending for some of its programs. She also added money for expanding tax-free zones in urban areas to help lure new businesses.
The budget also provides a $100 million increase in the property tax deduction from the state income tax next year, to 75 percent from 50 percent. The property tax deduction, which was part of the current budget, is being gradually phased in.
Surrounded by Republican legislative leaders and members of her Cabinet at a State House press conference today, Mrs. Whitman summed up the themes of her upcoming campaign as she signed the budget into law. "This is a promise-keeping, job-creating, crime-fighting, school-improving, environment-protecting budget," she said. "This keeps New Jersey on the right road."
The new spending is fueled by the boom on Wall Street and a strong state economy that increased tax revenues by at least $600 million more than had been expected in January.
The budget also relies on borrowing $2.75 billion to help close a deficit in the state pension system. The borrowing allowed the state to reduce scheduled pension payments to $220 million from $810 million, freeing $590 million.
Democrats were quick to attack the budget, asserting that it relied on borrowed money to increase spending, sticking future taxpayers with the bill.
"The Governor's budget is the culmination of four years of borrowing that will leave New Jersey's taxpayers in debt," said State Senator James E. McGreevey, the Democrat from Woodbridge who is challenging Mrs. Whitman this fall.

THE GREAT WALL AND THE EMPTY FORTRESS
China's Search for Security.
By Andrew J. Nathan and Robert S. Ross.
268 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $27.50. 

 When the cold war ended, the American foreign policy community cast about for a new threat. Perhaps a "rogue state," like Iraq, or ethnic conflicts or even "instability" would now be the enemy. But none of these contenders had the geopolitical gravity of a superpower adversary, nor did they require the sort of global strategizing that the cold war demanded. Quite suddenly, though, a World Bank report that remains controversial today seemed to point to a new hegemon on the horizon. The Chinese economy, the bank announced in 1992, was far larger than previously thought. The analysts quickly grabbed their calculators. Present economic and technological trends were extrapolated; China's military purchasing power was assessed; war games were played. The result: Many strategists concluded that China could emerge as the dominant power in Asia, seriously challenging America's interests.
The debate over the "China threat" closely resembles the disagreements over United States policy toward the Soviet Union during the cold war. Hard-liners and moderates disagree about Beijing's capabilities and about whether American aims would best be served by containing or engaging China. Earlier this year the journalists Richard Bernstein and Ross H. Munro comprehensively argued the hard-line position for a general audience in their aptly titled book "The Coming Conflict With China." Now another team, Andrew J. Nathan, a Columbia University political scientist, and Robert S. Ross, a Boston College political scientist, have delivered a detailed argument for the other side with "The Great Wall and the Empty Fortress."
Hard-liners see a China mounting a challenge to America's position in East Asia. Nathan and Ross, on the other hand, see a defensively minded state, vulnerable to internal unrest, obsessed with maintaining its territorial integrity and burdened by a military that is technologically and organizationally far behind not only the United States but Taiwan, Japan and South Korea as well.
Nathan and Ross issue a needed corrective to some of the more outlandish claims of those who stress the "China threat." They convincingly argue, for instance, that China's ambitions regarding the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea fail to constitute the geostrategic danger that many discern. Hard-liners warn that China's possession of the islands, which it has claimed uninterruptedly for centuries, would allow it to project its naval and air power, disrupting the sea lanes carrying trade between Europe and the Middle East and East Asia, and intimidating Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. But military geography is more complicated than playing a game of Risk: Nathan and Ross point out that the Spratlys are too small to support the military facilities that would make them strategically significant and that, anyhow, many of the islands are under water for most of the year.
Nathan and Ross also cut through the arcane debate over the actual size of the Chinese military budget to demonstrate just how severely limited Beijing's current capabilities are. China's cumbersome armed forces have traditionally been oriented toward the defense of home territory. If China were to make a bid for the mastery of East Asia, it would have to project huge naval and air power far from home. But most of its airplanes, as the authors observe, are based on 1950's and 60's technology -- and even its few new-generation fighter planes have been called "the most highly perfected obsolete aircraft in the world." Forget fighting Japan or the United States. The Chinese Navy would lose a battle against Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia.
More important, Nathan and Ross emphasize factors other than hardware that constrain China's military influence, pointing to the current "revolution" in technology. The demands placed on the command, control, communications and intelligence capabilities that are required to integrate air, land and naval forces are enormous today and, with the continual advances in information technology, are growing nearly exponentially. The upshot is that the United States has such a jump on China in its ability to conduct modern warfare that America's military preponderance in East Asia will increase, not diminish, in the coming years.
Although Nathan and Ross demolish the most absurd claims of those who see an immediate China threat, by focusing on these extreme arguments they are, in a way, setting up straw men. The more sophisticated hard-line position holds that given its economic dynamism, China could in the long term threaten what Nathan and Ross call East Asia's "balance of power." The authors are surely right that China cannot mount a real challenge to American naval supremacy within anything less than 25 years, but what about after that? Nathan and Ross fail to address this long-range concern.
Actually, the most interesting feature of their argument is not their differences with the hard-liners but their similarities to them. Throughout their book Nathan and Ross assert, echoing the hard-liners and nearly everyone else in the American foreign policy community, that the United States must maintain the so-called balance of power in East Asia. But this begs a question: What balance? As Nathan and Ross make abundantly clear, "the United States possesses strategic superiority throughout Asia." This superiority, they argue, must be sustained, lest the states in the region begin to jockey for power and advantage among themselves, thereby "destabilizing . . . the regional balance of power." But the idea that balance can be achieved through dominance is the contradiction at the heart of American policy.
To Nathan and Ross, as much as to the hard-liners, United States dominance in Asia should continue indefinitely. Yet what America sees as balance can easily be seen by another state as hegemony. While one can agree or disagree with the authors' position, it should not really be surprising if China -- which, like any state, must be concerned more with a competing power's capabilities than with its intentions -- were to use its growing wealth to try to end American dominance in Asia. That Washington would regard as a threat the efforts of the largest and potentially most powerful state in a region to remedy its weak position reveals more about America's ambitions than about China's.

HEADLINE: Endless Trails To Open Water

BYLINE: By BRENDA FOWLER; BRENDA FOWLER contributes to The Times from Chicago.

 BODY:
THE Upper Peninsula of Michigan might as well be an island. Bounded by the broad and chilly waters of Lakes Superior, Huron and Michigan, this isolated arch of peninsula is anchored in the hinterlands of northern Wisconsin on the hem of the United States.
Two bridges lead to its eastern tip; one comes from Canada and the other across the straits of Mackinac from Michigan's lower peninsula. But the stream of traffic they carry seems effortlessly absorbed by vast forests and dispersed by ample swamps, rivers and lakes. The U.P., as people here call it, is as large as Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Delaware combined, yet has a population of just over 300,000. 
 Last June, I spent a week with friends at their well-equipped cabin on the shore of Lake Superior several miles east Marquette. During the day, we combed the beach, or hiked in a state park, or visited the little towns and museums along the more than 100 miles of shore between Marquette and Whitefish Bay. I was amazed by the unburdened roads, the beautiful, lonesome sandy beaches and boundless wilderness. My friends, who have spent part of each summer here for decades, told me that tourism increases later in the season, when the lake water warms up to just bearable, but you never see a crowd.
Many people come here for what I think of as hard-core wilderness activities like hunting and fishing. They stay in cabins in the woods, and catch and cook their own food. I noticed many older couples in luxury sedans, usually with two men riding in the front, and two women in the back. The young people I saw were couples with children who drove pickups or mini-vans. There are few night spots apart from bars, and most restaurants serve ordinary food like steak and potatoes for dinner and B.L.T.'s for lunch.
Marquette, an immaculate town of about 22,000 on Lake Superior, is the largest urban center in the U.P. At the turn of the century, the vast iron ranges of the Upper Peninsula were producing much of the iron ore for the nation, and most of it arrived in Marquette by rail and was shipped out through its harbors. Those who got rich off the iron-mining boom of the 19th century built homes out of the local sandstone on the bluff overlooking the docks. The Marquette County Historical Society sells a walking tour guide of these homes in the Arch and Ridge Streets Historic District.
Iron ore remains part of the region's economy. A friendly reference librarian at the Peter White Public Library in Marquette told me that people here joke that watching the loading of the 1,000-foot ore boats at the dock from Presque Isle Park is the best entertainment in town. The park, about a 20-minute walk north of downtown on a pleasant shoreline path shared by bikers and skaters, is an ideal city oasis.
The massive timber ore dock, under which you must pass to reach the park, forms an odd industrial gateway for the serenity of Presque Isle, a small peninsula whose name means "almost an island." Above the dock runs a rail line carrying cars laden with iron ore pellets from the nearby mine at Tilden. The pellets are released into chutes, and when an ore boat arrives, they are then poured down the chute into openings in the top of the tanker. I couldn't see them running down the chute, but I liked the dramatic rumble. The arrival of the ore boats is irregular, but the men in the small house beneath the dock may know when the next one is coming in.
Iron's importance in the development of the U.P. is engagingly explained at the Michigan Iron Industry Museum near Negaunee, eight miles west of Marquette. In the the 19th century, life in this remote and frigid clime did not hold much appeal, and mine work was a job for struggling newcomers. In 1892, an astounding 92 percent of the miners were foreign born; many came from the two poles of Europe, Italy and Finland.
A Finnish contribution to U.P. culture is the sauna, which is still a common fixture in the locals' camps, as they call their weekend cabins. The Italian heritage survives in the thin, tasty sausage known as the cudighi, (pronounced COO-duh-ghee), often eaten like a hamburger, on a bun with ketchup and pickles.
Another local specialty is the pastie (rhymes with nasty), a baked pocket of bread filled with meat or vegetables or both; it was introduced to the region by Cornish miners. They are advertised as if they were national treasures, but two local residents quietly told me they eat the rather bland pasties just once or twice a year, usually in connection with some family ritual.
Fortunately, if you camp or stay at a place with a kitchen, you can easily find good, fresh ingredients. Lake Superior's whitefish and trout are succulent and inexpensive. In Marquette, the best market for fish is Thill's Fish House, downtown right on the bay. One night, we grilled whitefish basted with olive oil, lemon juice and rosemary (I had brought the rosemary from home since fresh herbs were not generally available in the local supermarkets).
Two other native delicacies are blueberries, which ripen in August, and wild mushrooms -- chanterelles and morels -- available from July through the fall. Though these are not usually available in local stores, people who know which mushrooms are safe to eat can hunt them.
The edible thimbleberry, or black raspberry, grows in many clearings, including in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, a 35-mile wedge of Superior coastline between Munising and Grand Marais. The area gets its name from variably hued sandstone cliffs that rise several hundred feet out of the blue water. The brown, golden and pink streaks on the rocks come from minerals in the water that have seeped from the ground and stained the cliffs.
Endless trails, including one along the entire reach of Twelvemile Beach, cut through the wilderness, and several lead past waterfalls, like Sable Falls, the 19th-century romantic's paradigm of the waterfall, with a series of winding drops under a canopy of trees. Ten minutes by foot are the Grand Sable Dunes, an undulating landscape of high dunes, which, the informational tablet says, are creeping slowly along the beach, devouring forests as they move.
One day, I went walking in Pictured Rocks with a geologist friend who has been exploring this area since childhood. We had intended to follow a path north of Miners Castle through the piney forest atop the rock cliffs, but somehow we ended up on a barely discernible path along the shore. After 15 minutes of fighting back branches and traversing muddy pools, we emerged on a brilliantly lighted sandstone shelf that ran along the cliffs about 20 feet above the glistening blue water.
The shelf, which at points tilted precariously toward the water, dipped and rose, following the curve of the shore around a bend. We eagerly set out to see how far it would take us. Because the sandstone was so soft, the water had eroded it smoothly, revealing layer after layer of gold- and cream-colored sediments. At points, wading was possible on an inviting shelf a half-foot underwater, and we also found several beautiful spots from which it would have been possible -- if foolhardy -- to dive, Acapulco-style, from natural platforms.
After perhaps a half-mile, the shelf dwindled and the cliff became too steep to continue on. But from there we could hear, from just around a corner in the cliff, the sucking gurgle of a cave or hollow at water level. Until this point, we had seen no one else on the shore or water, but now, from the west, came a pair of kayakers who paddled silently past us and waved. I called to them to check out the cave ahead and they smiled and headed for it.
 THE pictured rocks, as well as the curvy sandstone formations with the inevitable anthropomorphic appellations (like Indian Head Rock), are best seen from the lake. Kayaks can be rented at a few locations on the southern shore, and at one, Northern Waters Adventures, Carl Hansen said that although they can be taken freely into the rivers and smaller lakes, his company requires four hours' training before venturing onto Lake Superior, which can turn stormy in minutes. A less strenuous way to see the cliffs from the water is a two-and-a-half-hour cruise out of Munising. I did not take it, but it was universally praised by passengers I asked.
Superior's moodiness is legendary. The Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point documents 300 shipwrecks that claimed 320 lives. The most recent -- and, thanks to the ballad by Gordon Lightfoot, the most famous -- was of the ore-carrying Edmund Fitzgerald, whose crew of 19 perished off Whitefish Point in 1975 in the worst storm anyone in the U.P. can remember. The exact cause of the wreck is not known; a video the museum shows keeps the story mysterious.
For me, the uncelebrated centerpiece of the museum is a nine-foot-wide, lozenge-shaped Fresnel lens. Made in Paris of leaded crystal prisms, it came from one of the lighthouses that still measure this dangerously rocky coastline. The Fresnel lens could modify and amplify a modest light into a life-saving signal visible for more than 28 miles.
I was reminded of the lens late that evening on the beach behind the cabin, where we picked up the rhythmic blink of light from the beacon in Marquette. Then we lit an enormous bonfire, settled into the sand and lay back to watch the stars.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
The Good Buy

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis 

 BODY:
It is difficult to explain the joy to be had from paying too much. I learned about this subtle pleasure a few years ago, when I became surely the first man in America to pay the full sticker price for a new car. The dealer who benefited from this extraordinary act did not exploit me. He is incapable of the aggressive salesmanship for which car dealers are justly notorious. He is maybe the only car dealer in history who forgets to return phone calls from customers who say they are ready to buy. By the ordinary standards of car dealing, he is a flop, a disgrace to the science of manipulating his fellow man.
But this natural reticence is, at least in part, what provoked me to forgo any haggling. In this market-drenched world there are precious few opportunities for sedition. Buying from salesmen who don't know how to sell is one of them. My car dealer may be grotesquely unambitious, but he is nice to his employees, whom he encourages to be as laid-back and happy as he is. Plus, he never tries to fool anyone about anything. I first realized that I didn't want to bargain him down when he asked, "You sure you don't want to negotiate, like everyone else?" 
This man should be encouraged, I thought. The pleasure to be had knowing someone like him exists would far exceed the cost of helping to keep him alive. And it has. Each time I drive by his quiet lot I experience the same satisfaction as a man who has helped to preserve an endangered species. I used what little power I have as a buyer to reward qualities other than those typically rewarded in car dealers; e.g., slickness and efficiency. I am no longer a mere customer. I am a patron.
I am also a fool -- or at least that is how most of the world views people who pay the full sticker price for an automobile. This is just one of many things that is wrong with the world.
Walk into any bookstore and you find walls of texts on salesmanship. The modern world is obsessed with the subject. Three days into almost any job and some wizened character will take you aside and say, "Whatever they tell you, it all comes down to sales." No attention at all is paid to the art of buying. There's Consumer Reports, of course, and other similar references that detail the price and the quality of goods. But there is nothing to suggest the variety of attitudes available to the buyer. Rather, it is simply assumed that the best way to shop is to get the most for the least. That is why I would like to suggest a few tips for the New Enlightened Buyer.
* The New Enlightened Buyer understands that shopping is not a competitive sport. Often you hear people boasting about how they cut the best deal, as if they kicked the winning field goal in the Super Bowl. Enlightened Buyers understand that shopping contains a spiritual, counterintuitive dimension; sometimes you have to lose in order to win. In the same way that a college might admit a student with poor grades and low SAT's because of some special character trait, you might do business with retailers who are a bit more expensive or a tad inefficient out of deference to other qualities -- the appearance of the shop, the spirit of the enterprise, etc. Occasionally, when we are feeling political, we boycott companies we despise. Why not make smaller, less overtly political gestures and reward sellers we approve of?
* The New Enlightened Buyer takes pleasure in making the salesman happy. There is real satisfaction in subverting conventional market behavior. We pretty much assume that the customer enjoys a God-given right to make the salesman miserable, or at least to demand that he thoroughly kowtow to him. ("I paid good money for this fertilizer, and the grass still won't grow and I wanna know what you're going to do about it ... blah, blah, blah.") This retrograde attitude is the cause of no end of unhappiness in the world today. It is the main reason, for instance, that many sales jobs lack dignity. When New Enlightened Buyers see a customer at war with a salesman, they know that the ugliness is probably the customer's fault. Have you ever noticed that the same people forever encounter stupid or dishonest salespeople? Buyers create their own problems.
*Occasionally, New Enlightened Buyers leave themselves open to be taken advantage of. They understand that they'll sometimes stumble upon the genuinely malicious salesman. But more often than not, they will be rewarded for their benevolence and find themselves upgraded on domestic flights and offered free drinks after dinner. And even when they feel maltreated in the marketplace, they can take real pride in improving its standards, in the same way a good driver improves the safety of the road.
*The New Enlightened Buyer ultimately works toward a private system of self-evaluation. Once you become enlightened yourself, you may wish to sit down at the end of the day and ask yourself, "Did I buy well?" The nature of this exercise depends on the circumstances of the buyer. If you are rich, you deserve less credit for paying too much but more credit for putting up with terrible delays. If you are unemployed, you should reward yourself fewer points for waiting around but more credit for overpaying. Special Brownie points go to those who resist the urge to insult especially inept sellers.
Until I codified my new philosophy, I spent a lot of time thinking of devastating remarks to bring the employees of phone companies to their knees. Remarks like, "Are you always this charming, or is this just an especially nice day for you?" or, "We're thinking of switching to tin cans and string." Now I believe that their ineptitude presents me with an opportunity to score points on my self-evaluation sheets. The truly admirable transaction, I now think, is one in which the seller behaved terribly but the buyer somehow made him happy.

HEADLINE: When the Dutch Moved In and the Pequots Managed Trade

BYLINE: By ALBERTA EISEMAN 

 BODY:
THE story of Connecticut's settlement is usually told in terms British Colonists versus Indians. Yet well before the British traveled from what is now Massachusetts to the Connecticut River valley, Dutch traders had made their way upriver from Long Island Sound and had established extensive trade, especially with the Pequot tribe.
This chapter in the state's history is the focus of the exhibition "Before New England: The Dutch and Native Americans in the Connecticut River Valley, 1609-1650" at the Connecticut River Museum in Essex. 
 "The concept of the show is the narrow span of time when two cultures met and established a trade relationship that was mutually beneficial and very successful," said Bruce Yenawine, director of the museum. "The denouement came when the governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony decided the relationship was too successful and it was time to move in."
Mr. Yenawine believes that the Dutch have been all but ignored in history books is the pro-British bias of most Colonial historians. The exhibition, organized in cooperation with Emily Stearns, the Museum's curator, is meant to offset some of that.
Displays -- 17th-century maps, ship models, paintings, Dutch and native American artifacts, a full-scale wigwam and a model of the Dutch Fort of Good Hope -- are centered around two life-size color transparencies housed in oversized light boxes, representing a Dutchman and a native American, both in elaborate costumes.
Plymouth Plantation, a living history museum, lent the costumes and provided assistance in research and photography.It also lent the furnishings for the recreation of a room inside a fort -- a table, a three-legged chair, a foot warmer, some swords and muskets -- all original period pieces from the Netherlands.
Early Colonial records describe the Fort of Good Hope as sited on land "extending one league down along the river and one-third of a league in width to the high land" -- the area of Hartford now known as Dutch Point. It was bought in 1633 from the chief sachem of the Pequots, Tatobem, for "one piece of duffels 27 ells long, 6 axes, 6 kettles, 18 knives, 1 sword blade, 1 shears and some toys." In modern terminology, the piece of duffels, or woolen cloth, was 41 feet long.
Because no description of the fort itself was ever found, the exhibit was based on what is known of Fort Orange, the 1624 Dutch fort on the Hudson River at Albany, where earthen and timber battlements enclosed a trading post and other structures. Outside the stockade, the land was farmed and used for grazing livestock and for an orchard.
Dutch explorations in the New World began in 1609, when Henry Hudson -- an English captain recruited by the merchants of Amsterdam -- sailed through New York Bay and up the river that now bears his name. He was followed in 1611 by Adriaen Block, an adventurer and cartographer who made three voyages in as many years, ascending the stream we call the Connecticut -- he named it Versche, or Fresh, river -- as far as today's Hartford and, perhaps, the falls at Enfield.
"In the year 1614," Block later wrote, "our traders had not only traded at the Fresh River but had also ascended it before any English had ever dreamed of going there . . . all the islands, bays, havens, rivers, kills and places . . . have Dutch names, which our Dutch ship-masters and traders gave to them."
It was the fur trade, and especially beaver pelts, that drew the merchants of the Dutch West India Company. Beaver hats became fashionable among Dutchmen of all social classes, along with fur capes, boots, mufflers and trimming for coats.
"Portrait of Rembrandt's Mother," by Gerard Dou (1613-1675), depicts a woman wearing a fur hat and collar as well as fur trimming on the cuffs of her coat.
As for the Pequots -- who conquered other river tribes in the early 1620's -- they were most interested in metal goods. A display features Dutch kettles, buckles, hooks and scissors, which would then be cut up to make points for arrows and spears. Knives, blades, ax heads and other tools were valued for practical uses; pendants, rings and buttons were worn for ceremonial uses or as amulets.
Another exhibit highlights the essential role of wampum in native American life. In its final form, wampum was white or purple beads, cut, shaped and drilled from quahog and whelk shells. The beads had decorative and ceremonial value, and could be used as a means of exchange, with each bead assigned a monetary value.
The market for wampum set up a triangular network: Dutch trade goods exchanged for wampum produced by Connecticut coastal tribes was traded for pelts harvested by Indians in the interior -- the entire transaction managed by the Pequots as middlemen.
"The English wanted the story to be that the Pequots were violent invaders ultimately chased out by other Connecticut River tribes and English settlers," said Mr. Yenawine. "The truth is that the Pequots were very successful partners of the Dutch and managed a trading operation that allowed for important economic development in this region of America."
According to Mr. Yenawine, it was only after the English learned the process of wampum trade from the Dutch -- and after the Pequots were annihilated in 1637 -- that English settlement of the Connecticut Valley became possible. "It was an economic war," Mr. Yenawine said.
In time, the English population grew to such proportions that it posed a constant threat to the small Dutch garrison at the Fort of Good Hope. Finally, at a meeting held in Hartford in 1650, Dutch officials agreed to forfeit their claim to Connecticut.
One of the few remains of four decades of Dutch presence along the river is on display: a small yellow brick, typically used in building chimneys, thought to be from the Fort of Good Hope.
"Before New England" will be on view at the Connecticut River Museum, 67 Main Street, Essex, through November. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is $4, with discounts for children and elderly people.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: 1.5 Million Square Feet Downtown Back on Office Market;
2 Broadway to Get A Major Makeover

 BODY:
A nearly vacant building that stood as a symbol of Manhattan's struggling downtown office scene has come back on the rental market, with its owner saying it is confident the time is right to fill it up again.
The 1.6 million-square-foot building at 2 Broadway, at Bowling Green, is to undergo a $100 million makeover designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill that includes new heating and air-conditioning, an electrical upgrade and renovations of the facade, the lobby and the elevators. 
 The owner, ZAR Realty, which purchased the building in September 1995 for about $21 million, said that about 1.5 million square feet of space was available at rents ranging from the upper $20's to the low $30's a square foot a year.
Several other large vacant or nearly vacant downtown buildings are being converted to residential use, but Frederick J. Contini, ZAR's executive vice president, said that "our feeling ever since we purchased it was that it would be fully commercial."
"We have large blocks of space, and we think the time is right based on the pent-up demand in the marketplace for large amounts of space," Mr. Contini said. "That, plus Mayor Giuliani's Downtown Revitalization Plan, which gives tax breaks to encourage development, should attract tenants."
The building, which once housed back-office operations for large Wall Street brokerage firms, was put up by the Uris family in 1958 during an economic rebirth of Wall Street.
It was later owned by Olympia & York, which sold it as part of its bankruptcy.
Mr. Contini said that about 100,000 square feet of the building was occupied. The Williams Real Estate Company has been retained as the exclusive leasing agent.
"We can do immediate deals," Mr. Contini said.
